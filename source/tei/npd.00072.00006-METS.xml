            <seg id="p007">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL • Lincoln, Nebraska, • . January 5, 1933 Honorable Charles W. Bryan, Governor of Nebraska. Dear Sir: - . . I have the honor to submit herewith the report of the Attorney General for the biennium ending January 5, 1933. The Attorney General by statute is made the head of the Department of Justice. As such head he is charged with the duty of appearing for the state and prosecuting and defending in any court or before any officer, board or tribunal, any cause or matter, civil or criminal, in which the state may be a party or interested. Among the various other duties imposed upon the Attorney General are the following: 1." To consult with and advise the county attorneys in all criminal matters and in matters relating to the public revenue. 2. To give when requested his opinion in writing upon all questions of law submitted to him by any state officer, board, commission or either branch of the Legislature. 3. To enforce the proper application of monies appropriated, by the Legislature to the various funds of the state and to prosecute breaches of trust in the administration of such funds. </seg>

The Supreme Court of Nebraska in sustaining the authority of the kv^Tn ' S3id Wkh reference to Ws P^ers and author - lty the following: "The attorney general also defended his action by reding upon the decision of this court in the case of Mate v. Pacific Express Co., 80 Neb. 823 115 N W 619 622, 18 L. R. A. (N. S.) 664, in which is cited a' New Jersey case (Attorney General v. Delaware &amp; B. B R • Co., 27 N. J. Eq. 631) holding: " ,'*" «J«&gt;ty, "as in the law court, the Attorney : General has the right, in cases where the property of the sovereign or the interests of the public are directly concerned, to institute suit by what may be called "civil information" for their protection. The state is not left without redress in its own courts, because no private citizen chooses to encounter the difficulty of defending it but has appointed this high public officer, on whom it has cast the responsibflty, and to whom, therefore it </seg>
            <seg id="p009">9 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL has given the right of appearing in its behalf and invok - ing the judgment of the court on such questions of public moment." "We find that a late case, which is in line with the weight of authority, is State v. Finch, 128 Kan. 665, 280 P. 91Q, 66 A. L. R. 1369. which traces the powers and duties of the office of attorney general at common law from the earliest times to the present time, and holds: 'Ordinarily the Attorney General, both under the common law and by statute, is empowered to make any disposition of the state's litigation which he deems for its best interest.' " "Thrccp on Public Officers,, page 542, says: 'The rule respecting such powers is that, in addition to the powers expressly given by statute, * :S ::t he has by im - plication such additional powers as are necessary for the due and efficient exercise of the powers expressly grant - ed, or as may be implied from the statute granting the express powers.' "The attorney general is given executive powers in •regard to various matters committed to his care. Follmer v. State, 94 Neb. 217, 142 N. W. 90S, Ann." Ca&amp; 1914D, 1-5L "By the great weight of authority, it is now held that the attorney general is clothed and charged with all the common law powers and duties except in so far as they have been limited by statute. The duties of his office are so numerous and varied that it has not been the policy of different state legislatures to enumerate them. As the chief law officer of the state, he may, in the absence of some express legislative restriction to the contrary exercise all such power and authority as public interests may from time to time require. 2 R. C. L. 916. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "The attorney general is the principal law officer of the state." The work of the office during the past two years may be summarized as follows: Number of cases prepared and argued in the Supreme Court of the United Stales 1 Number of cases prepared and argued in .the Supreme Court of Nebraska. 114 Number of cases in the District Courts cf Nebras - ka, (including bank receivership suits) in which the Attorney General represented the state or state officers ■ 268 Number of cases prepared and submitted to the Interstate Commerce Commission . .'. 25 Number of cases in the United States District Court in which the Attorney General repre - sented the state or state. officers. ............ 5 Number of cases in municipal and county courts. . 15 Number of requests for opinions and complaints received : 22,375 Number of persons who called at office to make verbal complaint or request a legal opinion (estimated) ,'.„■ 12,000 Number of formal written opinions prepared &lt;&gt;,400 The case in the United States Supreme Court, Abie State Bank vs. Charles VV. Bryan, et al, was won. Of the 114 cases whicii were argued in the Supreme Court 92 were won and 22 were lost. There are pendjng in the Supreme Court 34 cases which have been handled by the Attorney GeneraTs office but which have not been argued or in which there has been no final adjudication. It is hard to say which cases were the most important but some of the more important cases were: 1. Abie State Bank vs. Charles W. Bryan et al, and Hubbell </seg>
            <seg id="p011">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL State Bank vs. Charles W. Bryan, ct al. In the Abie State Bank case that bank, acting for itse'f and the other state banks, sought to enjoin the Department of Trade and Commerce from collecting the special guaranty fund assessments due from the banks for 1928, 1929. and 1930. The banks won in the District Court of Lancaster County. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Nebraska the lower court was reversed and the injunction dis - solved The banks then took the case to the Supreme Court of the United States where the decision of the State Supreme Court was affirmed. Shortly thereafter, the Legislature having amended the guaranty fund law in the meanwhile, the Hubbell State Bank, • on behalf of itself and all other banks, brought suit to enjoin collection not only of all the assessments under the old guaranty fund law, but also the assessments under the Depositors' Final Settlement Fund law. The Attorney General filed an answer deny - ing the allegations of the banks and a cross petition asking for judgment against the banks for the full amount of all the assess - ments due. The position of the Attorney General was sustained and on the motion of the Attorney General judgments against all of the banks were obtained totaling approximately $3,000,000.00. The banks then prosecuted" an appeal to the Supreme Court of Nebraska where the Depositors' Final Settlement law was de - clared unconstitutional, the assessments confiscatory, and the judgments obtained against the banks set aside. Motion for re-hearing lias been filed by our office, on which the court has not passed. ■ 2. C. A. Sorensen, Attorney General vs. State Board of Equalization and Assessment. The State Board of Equalization and Assessment after equalizing between the various counties the assessments of natural gas pipe lines, reduced such equalized valuation 17 per cent. The Attorney General protested that this was arbitrary and unconscionable. The Attorney General then prosecuted a writ of error to the Supreme Court of Nebraska from the decision of the State Board of Equalization and Assess - ment reducing the equalized assessed valuation of pipe line prop - erty 1.7 per cent. This was the first time that any such action had ever been taken by the Attorney General's office in Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL The Governor, on -behalf of himself and said State Board of Equalization and. Assesssment, hired special counsel to represent the Board. The Supreme Court decided in favor of the Attorney General, saying in part: "One of the duties of the state board of equalization is that of equalizing assessments, that is, changing assess - ments by increasing or decreasing the same, to the end' that all property in the state shall bear its just propor- ' tion of the burdens of taxation. The board having failed to follow certain requirements of the statute, its action in reducing pipe line valuation 17 per cent is set aside and cause remanded to said board to act therein in con - formity to statutes". ■ . 3. Stale e.v rel C. A. Sorensen vs. Lyman-litchey Sand ana Gravel Company, et al. After an investigation lasting nearly a year and costing several thousand dollars, the Attorney General brought suit in the Supreme Court of Nebraska to enjoin the Lyman-Richey Sand and Gravel Company, its officers and agents, and certain other companies from maintaining a monopoly in restraint of trade in the sand and gravel business. Maps were prepared showing the location of the principal sand and grave.1 deposits in Nebraska and from the county records were obtained the information as to the 1 ownership of all such ' deposits. After many conferences in which the officers of the Lyman-Richey Sand and Gravel Company were made acquainted in part with the evidence of the state, said officers entered into a stipulation that consent decree might be entered against the company and its officers and agents. In said decree the defendants are enjoined among other things from doing any of the following acts: "First. That the defendants, Lyman-Richey Sand and Gravel Company, its officers, directors, agents and ser - vants are hereby severally and perpetually enjoined and restrained from entering into or maintaining any con - tract, combination, or conspiracy with each other, or with </seg>

"Second. That the defendants; Lyman-Richey Sand &amp; Gravel Company, its officers, directors, agents, ser - vants or employees, shall, within a reasonable time after the entry of this Decree, dispose of any stpck which it or they, may own or hold in the defendant corporation, the Western Sand &amp; Gravel Company, a corporation, of Lincoln, Nebraska. "Third. That the defendant, Lyman-Richey Sand and Gravel Company, shall within six months by proper and effective conveyances: "(a) Release and quit claim to the adjoining land owner any interest retained and reserved by it to strips of land not exceeding two rods in width, in conveyances made of the lands of which said strips formed a part where said strips are along and adjacent to any line of railroad and located in Sarpy, Douglas, Dodge and Platte Counties. •■;:'■; • "(b) Release and terminate its lease to the McClean Estate tract of land, being a tract of land lying between the Platte River and the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy right-of-way in Sections One and Two, Township Sixteen, Range Eight, and lying north of the Woodcliff Elevator, Saunders County, Nebraska, recorded in Book I of the Miscellaneous Records of said County at Page 523, also at Page 560 and also in the Miscellaneous record of said County in Book K page 92 thereof.

State ex rel C. A. -Sorcnsen vs. Safeway Stores, a Cor - poration. Various comp'aints came to the Attorney General's office that this chain store company was violating the anti-dis - crimination law by selling goods and commodities in some cities and communities at a less price than it received for the same goods and commodities :n the other cities and communities in which it was operating. After a lengthy investigation in wliicjh more than thirty witnesses were called, the Attorney General's office brought suit in the District Court of Lancaster County to enjoin the company from selling goods in violation of the anti-discrimination law. By stipulation this company agreed to let a decree be entered enjoining the company from continuing the practices complained of in the cities of Holdrege and Kearney. 5. Interstate Commerce cases. Many Interstate Commerce Commission cases have been handled by this Department during the past biennium. The cases arising under the Hoch-Smith Resolution, known as the "Docket 17,000" cases, are of the highest importance to the people of this state. Docket 17,000, Part 7, </seg>
            <seg id="p015">I REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Grain Rates, affects the rates paid by the people of this state to an amount considerably upwards of a million dollars per year.. The case was heard and completed and an order, very favorable to our state was entered. Due to the delay of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the raii roads resorted to the courts, charging that conditions had so changed that they were entitled to further hearing.. An injunction was granted and the case was afterwards re-opened. It is now being re-heard before examiners of the Interstate Commerce Commission. It will probably be several months before it will be concluded. Dur - ing the time that the new rates were in force, from August 1, 1931,, to January 25. 1932, when the injunction was granted! it is estimated by traffic experts that the saving to Nebraska "shippers was upwards of $600,(;00,00. It should be understood that in this case the contest is not only between the railroads, on the one hand, and the shippers of Nebraska, on the other, but to a certain- extent it is a contest among the states in the western district. The evidence in the case shows clearly that Nebraska is paying too high rates in proportion to those paid by other states in this area, and that even if the revenues of the carriers were to remain at. the same level, Nebraska should have a substantial reduction in its interstate rates. Other Docket 17,000 cases of importance to the people of this state are Part 2, Class Rates in Western Trunk Line Terri - tory, which is now being re-heard; Part 9, Live Stock Rates, which has already been .argued and submitted; Part 10, Hay Rates, pending before the examiners; and Part 13, Salt Rates. Part 2^ Class Rates, and Part 9, Live Stock Rates, involve iarge amounts annually. Among other of the important cases may be mentioned Docket 16,750, National Poultry, Butter &amp; Egg Association vs. Aberdeen &amp; Rockfish Railway Company, No. 24,326, Rates on Coal from Northen Colorado; No. 28,823,, Gypsum Association, et aL vs. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Company, all recently argued. and submitted; and No. 24,350,, Nebraska State Railway Commission vs. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway </seg>
            <seg id="p016">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Company, Rates on Fruits and Vegetables; No. 23.205. Nebraska State Railway Commission vs. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Rail - way Company, Rates on Potatoes from Central and Western Ne - braska, recently determined; and Finance Docket Na 9312, Appli - cation of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway Company for permission to abandon branch line from Coburn Junction to. Wynot, Nebraska. It is difficult to say how much in money is in controversy in the several cases, but it may be stated that a conservative estimate in all of the rate cases handled within the last two years, including those now pending and partly heard, considerably ex - ceeds two million dollars per year to the people of this state.- The credit for all the work done does not be'ong to the Attorney General personally, a great share of the credit belongs to the exceedingly able and highly conscientious men associated with me^ namely, George W. Ay res. Homer L. Ky'e, Hugh La- Master. L. Ross Newkirk, Clifford L. Rein, Irvin Stalmaster, and T. F. Neighbors. BOARD OF EDUCATIONAL LANDS AND FUNDS As Attorney General I have been a meml)er of the Board of Educational Lands and Funds. This board is charged among other things with the investment of the permanent school funds of the State of Nebraska. The state has not so far lost a dollar on any security purchased during my term of office. It. has been my policy to insfst on treating the securities as sacred trust funds belonging to the school children of the state. Political favoritism has no place in the buying of securities for the state. PARDON BOARD The Attorney General is a member of the Board of. Pardons. I felt it necessary to disseiit in a number of cases. In the matter of the Application of one Lewis Nellson for Commutation of Sentence, I filed the following dissenting opinion: "I dissent. Nellson is a third termer, an habitual </seg>
            <seg id="p017">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL criminal. The record show that he served a term in the Kansas penitentiary. Later he served a term in the Ne - braska penitentiary as convict No. 9845. A few weeks after finishing this sentence he again got into trouble and again was sentenced to the penitentiary. County Attorney Heinke of Otoe County from which Nellson was sent up recommends that no clemency be granted. I agreo with him. If there is any reason at all for the maintenance of reformatories and penitentiaries it is to have custody of habitual criminals. It is exceedingly probable that this man will resume his crime career. "As a member of the Board I have been exceedingly lenient to first offenders. I have been very willing to give a young man especially another chance. I dislike being known as the 'hard boiled' member of the Board. I fre - quently compromise in granting paroles and commuta - tions when I am not wholly convinced. But I cannot agree to the release of this man who has a high school education and who is now 44 years of age. He knows right from wrong and he is past the age when there is very much likelihood of any reformation. He says he wants to go to Texas. I cannot join in the theory that one state has the right to ship its criminals to some other state. I know that is being done by some states but it is wrong in principle and cannot be defended on any ground." In the matter of the application of Charles Hinds for com - mutation of Sentence, I hied a dissenting opinion in which I said in .part: "I dissent. I know of no valid reasons for granting special favors to this banker. "I realize there were powerful influences brought to bear in this case. But what of it? Surely it has not come to pass that in passing on a prisoner's application our action is determined by the number of prominent names thereon. The depositors of the failed bank were not </seg>

            <seg id="p020">18 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL represented; those who did appear had lost nothing by Kinds' operation of the bank. "The Attorney General's office had charge of the prosecution of Hinds. At much expense the evidence was gotten tog-ether and presented, to the court and jury. In spite of his able lawyers, Hinds was convicted on five counts. The court imposed a sentence of one to five years in the penitentiary on each count, but tempered justice with mercy by making the five sentences run concur - rently. Hinds then appealed to the Supreme Court. That court giving him the benefit or ail possible doubts dis - missed the counts based on the borrowing of money from his own bank but let the sentence of one to five years stand on the other counts. The Supreme Court was very familiar with the facts and saw no reason for re - ducing the sentence. No new evidence has been presented or cause shown why this Board should override the Supreme Court in this matter. "During the last three and one-half years we have been responsible for sending to the penitentiary more bankers than were sent during the previous thirty years. It has been an exceedingly unpleasant task. Some of the men that we prosecuted were personal friends; others acquaintancs of many, years standing. But it was a job that had to be done. Wrecking a bank from the inside is in many ways a worse crime- than robbing it from the outside. The loss from robbery can be covered by in - surance; there can be no insurance against bankers who juggle the bank's funds, make false reports, or intention - ally or knowingly accept deposits knowing the bank to be insolvent. "I have never advised criminal action on mere tech - nicalities; only where there were flagrant violations- of the banking laws. </seg>
            <seg id="p021">• REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "After our office lias gone to much trouble and ex - pense in finally getting a llagrant violater of the bank - ing laws into the penitentiary it is discouraging to have the Pardon Board after a 20 minute hearing turn him loose. It tends to discredit not only our office but the District Court and the Supreme Court which after much . consideration imposed and ratified his sentence to the penitentiary. There are, of course, exceptional cases where mercy should be extended even where the prisoner has ...-:•■:• only served part of his time. I give my colleagues on the Board credit for acting in good faith, but I am unable to see that the record of Hinds entitles him to any special consideration at this time." I filed a number of dissents' against the release of murderers and professional crooks after serving only a short time I did so not because of any feeling that the state should revenge itself on those convicted of "violating its laws, but because in my opinion the protection of society comes first and the wishes of the convict second. No person should be released by parole or pardon merely because he has served a long time or because he has relatives who need, his support.' In my opinion members of the Pardon Board need to ask themselves two questions regarding applicants for e'emency: 1. Has the prisoner fundamentally changed his point of view toward society and is he strong enough in character and willpower to go straight? , i .2. Has the prisoner served a sentence long enough to act as a warning and deterrent to the criminally inclined elements oi our society? I am firmly of the opinion that the inmates of our penal institutions should be dealt with kindly but firmly. They should not be permitted to develop a feeling of self-pity- In a talk one Sunday afternoon to the young men in the State Reformatory I said: "Behave yourself. You knew better. You just took a </seg>
            <seg id="p022">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL chance and got caught. Burn into your brain two words, "never again.' Do not feel sorry for yourself. Feel sorry for what you did. Feel sorry for'those you wronged. Feel sorry for the humiliation and disgrace you brought upon your folks. Real repentance and regret is the foundation of a better life. Character never was built on se'.f-pity. Say to yourself, T deserve this punishment- I was a Tool. I did wrong. But with the help of God I am now going to make a man of myself.' " DISBARMENT. Our office has brought ten disbarment cases. As Attorney General we have learned that the legal profession has lost respect and standing in the eyes of the public because of the conduct of a small percentage of the members of the Bar. Every lawyer that is a disgrace to the profession smears the whole profession. The profession of law is a noble one. Its history is inseparably intertwined with and is part and parcel of mankind's upward struggle from brute force to the rule of reason. The challenge- of the traditions of the bar cannot be • met by many. Only he whose character is beyond reproach, who loves scholarship and learning for its own sake, who hates fraud, injustice and tyranny, and who is ever ready to champion every righteous cause is entitled to call himself a lawyer. The people rightfully expect of lawyers: 1. Utmost personal integrity - 2. Knowledge and understanding of the law. 3. Rues of procedure and organization of courts which will tend to bring about to the extent humanly pos - sible even-handed justice. 4. Championship of the right and leadership against public enemies. Our profession cannot go to too great pains to keep out </seg>
            <seg id="p023">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL men of unsound character. If occasionally one gets inside pur walls ■ we ought without very much ceremony to have him disbarred. Attorneys are ministers of justice. They have an obligation to the public as well as to their clients. They are officers of the various courts in which they practice. Under the laws of Nebraska the Supreme Court is vested with the sole authority to admit lawyers to practice. Coupled with this power is the authority to strike from its rolls the name of any attorney whose conduct shows a lack of that integrity as an attorney which his clients, the courts, and the public have a right to expect and require. In my opinion lawyers should be subject to suspension or dis - barment on any of the following grounds: 1. Personal dishonesty or want of good moral character showing the attorney to be unfitted and unsafe to act as an officer of the court. •2. Conviction of a felony or other crime involving moral turpitude. 3. Obtaining money or property from a client by extortion or for which he has failed to render adequate service. 4. Any kind of fraud on or false representations to a client about a case entrusted to him. 5. Misappropriation of funds, either by failing to pay over money collected for client, or appropriating to his own use money left with him for safe-keeping or investment. 6. Any attempt to pervert justice by tampering with wit - nesses or jurors, introducing testimony known to be false,, knowingly making false affidavits to deceive the court, stilling or suppressing evidence, or intentionally deceiving or misleading the court as to the law or the' facts. . « MODIFICATION OF CRIMINAL CODE In our opinion the defects in our system of criminal court procedure, however glaring they may be, are not the principal </seg>

Less than ten per cent of alJ crimes reported are followed by criminal prosecution of any kind lhe chief failure, particularly in Nebraska, is lack of apprehen - sion of the criminal and the securing of evidence to convict. However, whether or not our present- criminal court, pro - cedure is as much to Whine for conditions as many of its critics contend, it may well be conceded by. all that it is by no means perlect and that many changes and improvements could and snou.d be made. Our present system is a legacy Trom by-gone days, when, harsh and absolute rulers .wielded despotic power over courts and juries and the criminal code was brutal and oppressive- Through -a tacit conspiracy between the judges and lawyers, the most frivolous and unreasonable pointsand objections were constantly being: raised on beha f of the defendant and wore encouraged by the courts as loopholes to permit the innocent to escape persecution and. to soften the rigors of the system lor the guilty. Today when the cruel despot, has beer, dethroned the criminal cede robbed of its brutalities and terrors to a great extent, and the criminal himself has grown haughty and contemp - tuous ol law and government and the right of others, the court machinery which was origina'Iy designed to shield the innocent has become too often an armor for the guilty to turn aside the sword of justice and leave him free to p!y his ■ cailin- With impunity. . The American Law Institute has spent approximately five years in drafting a model code of criminal procedure It consists oi 166 pages of text divided into twenty-five chapters and into 4&lt;0 sections. It covers the whole field of criminal procedure and is intended for adoption by the state legislatures It is so drawn that it may be adopted in fu'.l orin part with equal facility. One suggestion contained' in the code proposed by the Ameri - can Law Institute provides for the use of summons as in a civil suit where the oilense is not serious and the magistrate has reason to believe the accused will appear without being placed under arrest. If the defendant- served with a summons fails to </seg>
            <seg id="p025">' REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL appear he would be treated as in contempt of court and dealt with accordingly. The use of the summons in place of a warrant would greatly expedite the handling of petty offenses in my opinion. Another provision of the model code of the American Law Institute which deserves study with a view to similar legis'ation in Nebraska is the chapter on bail. A part of the provisions of the cede coukl not be adopted in this state because they conflict with .provisions of our constitution, but those provisions regulating professional bondsmen and designed to prevent "straw" bail, providing for the deposit of cash or securities and increasing the rliscrct on of the court in accepting bail and fixing the conditions thereof, and the provision making the undertaking a lien on any real property owned by the surety in the county from the date the undertaking is recorded and simplifying the co'lection of bail in case of default,, are worthy of serious consideration. Another chapter of the model code which might well be adopted is. that relating to indictments and informations and giving model forms to be followed by the prosecuting attorneys. It is true that in Nebraska our Supreme Court has been far more liberal than that cf many states in brushing aside mere technical defects in the form of the indictment or information and has even attempted on its own initiative to simplify somewhat the form of these instruments, but county attorneys would feel much safer and more assured if the procedure at this stage of a criminal prosecution were made plain and simple by statute so that the chance of error is reduced to a minimum. A bill relating to indictments and informations which was proposed by the Montana State Crime Commission provides that where two or more different offenses have been committed in connection with the same act they may all be charged in the same indictment or information, or different statements of the same offense may be made, under separate counts, and the prosecutor shall not be required to eLect on which count he shall rely but the verdict of the jury must specify either guilty or not guilty as </seg>
            <seg id="p026">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL " • to each count. Thus if a person is charged with burglary he may also be charged with }arceny and he can not escape if he has actually stolen property merely because his crime did not include all the elements included in the definition of burglary. It seems to me this might well be the law in Nebraska. I also recommend enactment of the so-called Alibi Defense Law which has already been enacted in Michigan and Ohio and in perhaps other states. By the provisions of this law, as enacted ■ n Michigan, whenever a defendant proposes to establish an alibi as his defense he must file and serve on the prescuting attorney a notice in writing of his intention to claim such defense at least four days before the trial, and such notice shall include specific information as to the place at. which -the accused claims to have been at the time of the. alleged offense. If such notice is not filed the court may in its discretion exclude evidence of such alibi. The advantages of such law are obvious. The alibi is a favorite de - iensc. It is perfectly legitimate and proper as a defense but be - cause it is easy to prove and hard to disprove it is capable of great abuse. If the alibi defense is honest and made in good faith there can be no harm in permitting the prosecuting attorney to invest gate it before the triaL Such ' invesigation may result in the charges being dismissed. If the alibi is faked it gives the prosecutor a better opportunity to expose its falsity. A similar law in Michigan requires the giving of notice where the defense relied on is insanity. Such notice gives the. prosecut - ing attorney an opportunity to make investigation which may result either in disposing of the case without a trial or in dis - proving the defense. The model code of the American Law Institute has a chap - ter providing special proceedings to determine the mental condi - tion of the defendant when, the issue of insanity is raised or the court has reasonable ground before or during the trial to believe the defendant is insane. Under its provisions the court may ap - point from one to three disinterested qualified experts to examine the defendant and testify as to the mental condition of the defen- </seg>
            <seg id="p027">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL dant, but both the defendant and the state are permitted to call other experts to testify at the trial as well. Chapter 11 of the model code of the American Law Institute provides that where it appears that a fair trial can not be had because of the prejudice of the trial judge either the defendant or the state may apply for a change of judge as distinguished from a change of venue. When such application is made an - other judge' is called in to rule on it. Cases arise where the judge because of political or other pressure is hanicapped in the per - formance of his duty. Occasionally too, a judge, in his eagerness to see a defendant convicted will permit errors to occur during the trial which will result in a reversal in the Supreme Court. Another law which might well be adopted is one permitting be valuable in saving unnecessary expense and which is not unfair to the accused, is that when two or more defendants are jointly charged with any offense, whether a 'felony or misde - meanor, they shall be tried jointly unless the court in its dis - cretion orders separate trials. Another law which might well be adopted is one permitting the defendant in all cases, except perhaps cases where a death sentence may be imposed, to waive a jury, and try the case to the judge. This provision is found in Chapter 12 of the American Law Institute's model code, and has been the law in Maryland for more than a century where it has been frequently availed of by defendants, particularly negroes, who have preferred to trust their cases with a judge rather than a jury. Another law recommended by the Missouri Crime Survey and which deserves serious consideration would permit a five-sixths jury to convict or acquit in all misdemeanor cases and in all felony cases except those which may be punished by death. I believe the state of Lauisana does not require an unanimous verdict in felony cases at the present time but all other states follow the English common law in requiring an unanimous verdict of 12 jurors in all felony cases. </seg>
            <seg id="p028">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL There is, of course, no magic about the number twelve. Stu - dents of the historical development of our modern jury system tell us that the number twelve appears to have been hit upon as the proper number for a jury because of the semi-religious character ascribed to the lawsuit in early times; it being naively assumed by our pious Anglo Saxon ancestors that the. Lord was a silent but powerful party to every lawsuit and made it His special business to see that right' always prevailed. It was sup - posed that the number twelve was particularly pleasing to the Lord and had a holy significance because of the favor which the Lord was supposed to have shown to the twelve tribes of Israel and the fact that Jesus chose twelve disciples- Whatever the rea - son, we have come to look upon the institution of a twelve man jury as being almost sacred and considerable prejudice will have to be overcome before a five-sixths verdict will be permitted in a criminal case, although the theory that a defendant must be convicted by .the unanimous verdict of twelve jurors finds no ac - ceptance outside of. the English speaking peoples of the world. It has frequently been urged with great force that the trial judge should be permitted by law to comment to the jury on the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses. This is the rule in the Federal courts where it appears to work we'd. Such a law would go far to restore to the judge the control of the trial which he enjoyed under the English common law and which, i be'ieve, he should still exercise. It; would raise the judge above the dignigty of a mere. referee of a legal prize fight between two clever and aggressive lawyers bent on winning a lawsuit at any ccst and give him an opportunity to clarify in the minds of the jurors the actual issues and dispell the prejudicial effects of im - passioned oratory and other artifices of the pettifogger. Another law which has been urged is one which will permit the prosecuting attorney to comment on and the, jury to consider, the failure of the defendant to testify in his own behalf. There seems to be no logical reason why an innocent person accused of crime should not take the witness stand and teU the truth. If he is guilty he should suffer the consequences. This rule is em- </seg>

ACCIDENT AND HEALTH INSURANCE POLICY FORMS As Attorney General I requested the Department of Trade and Commerce under its authority to require with reference to policy forms of accident and health insurance that they be couched in language which clearly and unequivocally defines the liability of the company and the rights of the insured, and that the provisions in such policies conform to the advertisements and representations of the insurance company offering the policy to the public. The insurance business is quasi-public in nature. The doctrine of caveat emplor does not apply. The business of in - surance has been placed under the supervision of the state and by statute the forms of all policies of insurance companies must be approved by the Department of Trade and Commerce. This power to approve is quasi-judicial in character and includes not only the structural make-up and arrangement of policies in re - spect to being readable and understandable, but "also all of its contractual provisions going to the substance of the contract, and to determine whether it violates any applicable law, whether writ - ten or unwritten, and whether consisting of constitutional or stat - utory provisions, or the rules of the common law, or the principles of equity of which the courts of the jurisdiction take cognizance." 32 G J. 1116, 1117. It is contrary to public policy that any insurance company should play hide-and-seek with the policy buyer by hiding its liability behind conditions, limitations, and provisions which be - wilder or tend to mislead the insured. Exceptions to the liability should not be permitted to be hidden in a straw-stack of words. The confidence of the public in insurance would, be greatly increased, in our opinion, if the Department of Trade and Com - merce would insist that the language of policies be such as to ex - press succinctly and clearly the liability which the company tends </seg>

IRRIGATION The North Platte is a river of liquid gold. When poured out on the fertile farms of Nebraska it brings wealth and riches. Its headwaters are in North Park, Larimer County, Colorado. It flows north into Wyoming, then east, and then southeast into Nebraska in Scotts Bluff County. It flows into the Missouri at Piattsmouth. Each of the three states through which the North Platte flows has rights in the use of the water. AJ1 three states have adopted the doctrine of appropriations as opposed to the common law rule of riparian rights. The right of appropria - tion means the right of diversion and use. "It is the right," said the Circuit Court of Appeals in Rickey Land &amp; Cattle Co. v. Miller &amp; Lux, 152 Fed. 11, 81 C. C. A. 207, "not to any specific water, but to some definite quantity of that which may at any time be running in the stream. So the right acquired by an appropriation includes the right to have the water flow in the stream to the point of diversion. The fact of a state line inter - secting the stream does not within itself infringe upon that right. In other words, the appropriation may still be acquired, although the stream is interstate, and not local to one state; nor will the mere fact that the stream has its source in one state authorize a diversion of all the water thereof as against an earlier and prior appropriation across the line in another state." Colorado proposes .to divert at its sources a large part of the flow of the headwaters of the North Platte river. If that state undertakes to carry out its purpose Nebraska's only remedy is to bring a suit in the Supreme Court of the United States to enjoin such diversion. Section 84-208, C- &amp;. for 1929, reads as follows: "It shall be the duty of the attorney-general of the state to commence, prosecute and defend any and all actions affecting the rights of Nebraska water-users in interstate streams as against appropriately in any other </seg>

Acting under the authority of this section I caused .the fol - lowing formal notice to be sent, December 10, 1932, to the Governor and to the Attorney General of the State of Colorado. "Honorable W. H. Adams, Governor of Colorado, Denver, Colorado. "Dear Sir: . • .j "This office is informed that the State of Colorado proposes and unless restrained will divent more than one - half of the natural flow of the head-waters of the North Piatte river. "This proposed diversion of water out of the North Piatte river watershed into another watershed in Colo - rado disregards and is inequitable to the water rights of appropriators in Nebraska. If such diversion is made, we are informed by engineers who investigated the propo - sition, that there will not remain sufficient water in the North Piatte river to supply the needs of Nebiaska irri - gators. Such action, therefore, on the part of Colorado would cause the abandonment of Nebraska land now in a high state of development and the loss to Nebraska citi - ■ zens of millions of dollars now invested in farms, irriga - • tion works, and town and city property. ■ . "This is to formally notify you, and through you the state of Colorado, that the state of Nebraska is opposed to and protests said proposed diversion of water out of the North Piatte river, and that if the State of Colorado takes steps to carry out said project the State of Ne - braska will institute suit in the Supreme Court of the United States against the State of Colorado to enjoin said diversion. ■ </seg>

            <seg id="p033">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL BOOTLEGGING OF GASOLINE Nebraskans generally have little comprehension of the im - mensity of the volume of gasoline handled by bootleggers from Kansas and adjoining states who run their tank trucks into the state during the daytime as well as the night time. It all started when the Kansas legislature exempted from taxation all gasoline used for certain specified purposes. This opened nn almost limitless supply of gasoline from which bootleggers might secure motor fuel for resale in Nebraska, and it is being tapped in increasing vohime. The gas tax in Kansas is a cent lower than in Nebraska, and this alone made a profitable opportunity, but only for the few who lived near the state lines. Tax-free gasoline by reason of false declarations as to the use to which it would be put has made it profitable to market bootleg gasoline from Kansas as far north as the middle tier of Nebraska counties in the larger populated centers. It has been found almost impossible to suppress this traffic, largely because there is no adequate patrol of the highways and because the sheriffs in the counties through which the illicit running is done are not able, with their small law enforcement forces to watch all the highways. These runners have learned all the tricks of the liquor smugglers, and find it easy to run the gauntlet of the law. Estimates based upon the decreased collections of gasoline dealers located hear the state border are that at least $400,000 of gasoline taxes were lost to the state last year by the operations of these lawless tankers. NON-ENFORCEMENT OF ROAD LAWS Death stalks our highways. The more graveled and paved highways the state builds the more persons are killed and maimed each year. For every person killed by crime, five die by automobile. In 1931 automobiles and trucks on the highways caus - ed the death of 295 persons and the injury of 5,084. It may help us awake to the situation if we recall that the population </seg>
            <seg id="p034">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL of Stanton, Phelps and Pawnee counties, 27.234, is less than the number of persons killed and injured in Nebraska during the last six years. The difference between the enforcement and non-enforcement of our road laws is the difference between reasonable safety on our highways or death and injury to thousands. of our citizens. LAW ENFORCEMENT I am old-fashioned enough to believe that the primary pur - pose of government is maintenance of law and order for the pro - tection of the property, home, and life of the citizen. All other purposes are secondary. Therefore, within the narrow limits of the authority of the Attorney General, I have constantly sought to bring about more wallop and punch in Nebraska's law enforce - ment, I have craved for Nebraska the honor of some day be - coming the model state of the Union for law and order. Every decent citizen has been startled by the evidence intro - duced in the liquor conspiracy case now being tried in the federal district court in Omaha; The stern fact must be faced that Ne- I braska too has been harboring • hoodlums, racketeers, and gang - sters. When those in charge of the law enforcement machinery of Omaha, Douglas County, and the state, failed to take action against Omaha's gangland, a group of Nebraska citizens appealed to the federal government for help. It came. But Nebraska must prepare to take care of its ov/n law enforcement. Only in unusual situations and where the vio - lation of federal laws are concerned can the United States Depart - ment of Justice be called upon for assistance. l _ - Criminals and gangsters are bold because so much of our law enforcement is indifferent, careless, and apathetic. In some communities there is an actual alliance between the </seg>
            <seg id="p035">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GFNERAL politicians in office and the lawless. The political power of the underworld is made up not only of the votes of the vice over - lords and their employees but unfortunately also of the votes of many of those who patronize the bootleggers, commercial gambl - ing dens, and houses of prostitution. The organized underwor'd seeks to control elections in order to secure protection. But its business of supplying liquor outlawed by statutes, furnishing women for prostitution, selling dope, and operating commercial gambling houses,, "can not exist and prosper without the connivance - or tacit approval of 'the law enforcement officials. Nebraska will never secure effective law enforcement until . it ceases electing to public office officials who for fear of losing votes or because of an understanding with the underworld leaders fail to enforce the law. The public official who keeps silent or merely makes idle gestures of opposition against the gambling and liquor racketeers seeking to gain control in many of our cities and towns is a public enemy. We do not need more laws. What we need in Nebraska is a reorganization and a new set-up in our state law enforcement machinery. We need efficient and effective enforcement of the laws that we have. Crime can not be abolished, but by well organ - ized, thoroughly trained, and co-ordinated state and city police forces, under able an honest direction, ■ crime can be kept down and reduced to a minimum. As attorney general during the past four years I have learn - ed that our penal system falls down principally in detecting and apprehending criminals. The crook who thinks he can "get away with it," unfortunately, is right perhaps nine-tenths of the time. Only as to less than 10 per cent of all crimes reported, are those guilty brought to justice. The sheriffs and other peace officers are not to blame. The average sheriff has little time to investigate crime or to patrol </seg>
            <seg id="p036">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL the roads. His time is taken up in serving summons,, collecting ■ taxes, selling property under foreclosure, and so on. Our sheriffs need expert state help. . ' A state force, unhampered by politics,, well armed and having the benefit of a short-wave length broadcasting communication system, could put on the run the crooks, hoodlums and gangsters. The most effective way to discourage law breakers is to make de - tection and capture more certain. Because of divided public opinion, the suppressing of illegal traffic in liquor, gambling, and prostitution is particularly diffi - cult. Not only will these highly profitable underworld businesses spend unlimited amounts of money foT political protection but since they capitalize and cater to oulawed human appetites they range on their side in any fight for their elimination thousands of people who themselves do not profit by crime. Law enforcement in some communities as to these businesses is often political sui - cide. Out of such situations arises the doctrine of local self-govern - ment in law enforcement. It justifies the .state official in doing nothing and gives the underworld what it wants. In my opinion chaos and anarchy is the inevitable result. Law must be enforced as law. We can not count noses in a town to find out if the majority in that town wish to have any certain law enforced. I am a friend, of and believer in majority rule. The principle of the Referendum, however, can only be applied to the making of laws, not their enforcement. Neither a commun - ity nor the state can exist half law-abiding and half-violating. If the liquor laws are to be enforced in Lancaster County then they must also be enforced in Hamilton County. If it is wrong to conduct a commercial gambling house in Dodge County then it is also wrong in Douglas County. No city. or county is big or important enough to secede from the state in matters of law en - forcement. Of course all citizens may urge the repeal or modi - fication of any law. But until repealed every law must be honestly </seg>
            <seg id="p037">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL enforced. Law enforcement officials have no other alternative. If a citizen disobeys a law because he does not like it, then he thereby impliedly consents that some other citizen may violate some other law that that citizen does not like.- We cannot have a stable government if every citizen may with impunity violate the laws he finds distasteful The same rule applies to cities. I do not think that the state should play God and try to regulate the private morals of its citizens. To make people better morally is a task for the preachers, teachers, and parents. But when men without effective opposition of local authorities operate gambling establishments, houses of prostitution, or bootlegging joints for the purpose of making money out of the weaknesses of human beings, then I think it is high time for the state to use its power and authority for their suppression. To apply the doc - trine of local self-government in such cases makes government a jest and hollow mockery. A public official paid by the taxpayers to do his duty, but who,, nevertheless, allows flagrant and con - temptuous violations of the law to exist is unfit for public office. TAXES . The people are suffering from a severe tax headache. A tax storm is brewing that will shake every court house and rock the new Ten Million Dollar Capitol. Keeping up with the Jonses in public buildings and govern - mental services was not so burdensome when money was flush. Trying now to maintain a CadiUac government on a Model T Ford income is what hurts. The average man now works one year out of every five for the government. The farmer more; during the last two years the average Nebraska farmer, according to the statistics of the United States Department of Agriculture, has paid in state, county, township, and school taxes from 25 to 40 per cent of his net income. While land values and crop prices have reached new low levels, taxes during the last 16 years have gone up 200 per cent. </seg>
            <seg id="p038">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Such a burden is intolerable. The government become like a fat tick on a dog, the taxpayers being the dog. The more the tick eats the fatter it gets but the less of the dog there is. Finally the tick becomes bfgger than the dog. This session of the Legislature should and in my opinion will undertake to revise and revamp our entire taxation system. An effective tax reform program must include the following: 1. Sharp curtailment of State, County, City, Township and School expenditures. How? By requiring the following: V (a) Payment of salaries of public off icials and employees not in excess of the salaries paid by private corporations for similar work. (b) Dismissal of unnecessary employees. If in an office there are three clerks but the work can be done by two. one should be dismissed. This is harsh but necessary in times like these. (c) Consolidation wherever possible of overlapping bureaus, departments, and governmental subdivisions. . To illustrate, the state now has three law enforcement agencies, the state sheriff's office, the fire marshal's office, and .the bureau in the department of public works for the enforcement of motor vehicle laws. This means three separate sets of offices in three different parts of the State House, three separate sets of stenographers and clerical help, and three separate sets of state automobiles. A consolidation of these three bureaus for law enforcement would save thousands of dollars in overhead expenses. (d) Elimination of non-essential governmental services: The problem of reducing taxes is largely that of getting along without governmental services that we now have. The question is not what services we as taxpayers would like to have the state, county, city, township and school district furnish us, but what we as taxpayers can afford to pay for. We will have </seg>
            <seg id="p039">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL to quit buying government strawberries in January and govern - mentally speaking Jive on liver and pot roast rather than porter - house steaks. (e) The elimination of the spoils system and the application of business principles to the conduct of public affairs. Public officials too often consider public money as easy money. Whether it is spent foolishly or otherwise does not affect their private pocketbook. The result sometimes, therefore, is employ - ment of relatives at high sa'aries, appointment of political friends without much regard for their ability but as reward for political work, contracts to political favorites, and the use of official sta - tionery, stamps, and automobiles in political campaigns. This spoils system of political appointments with its waste and petty graft costs the taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars every year. The only remedy is the election of public officials of proved integrity and provision by law for the appointment of govern - mental employees on a strictly merit basis. (f) Consolidation of some of the smaller counties as desired by voters of all counties affected. New Mexico,- larger than Nebraska, has only 31 counties; Arizona 14, and Oregon,, 36. • The agitation for the division of Custer County, a county four times the size of the average Ne - braska county ceased several years ago. Automobiles; and reason - ably good roads shrunk the county for administrative purposes. Nebraska could get along with probably 30 counties. Twenty per cent of the taxes collected in Nebraska are for the maintenance of our county governments. Reducing our present 93 county ad - ministrative units to ,'jO would obviously save many millions per years in overhead expenses. II. An adequate tax reform, program must include ade - quate and workable taxation machinery that will bring about the listing of all taxable real, personal, and tangible property and their assessment at actual value. It. is. estimated tbat.in. Nebraska. 300 million dqUars of prop- </seg>
            <seg id="p040">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL erty is either not listed, or assessed to that amount below its actual value. III. Lightening of tax burden on farm and city real estate by a sales tax on luxuries, increased inheritance taxes, and a state tax on large incomes of persons who do not own real estate. Ability to pay should be the basis for taxation. Ownership of real estate is no longer a fair test of that ability. The taxes that the farmer must pay Vary not a cent by reason of destruc - tion of crops from drouth, hail, or grasshoppers. The owner of farm land must pay the same taxes whether he receives 25 cents or $2.00 per- bushel for wheat. The workingman in town pays exactly the same taxes on his little home whether he is earning $5.00 a day or out of work. A widow with' seven children to sup - port may pay in taxes on her little home near the railroad tracks 50 per cent of the money she takes in "from washing. The general property tax is crude, unscientific and often oppressive. Taxes imposed on farm land and homes in the cities and towns no longer bear any relation to the net income of the owners thereof. But that is not alL By collecting most .of our taxes from those who own tangible property we in effect exempt from taxa - tion those men and women of substantial incomes from salaries, interest, or dividends, who either use up their money in high living or invest their surplus in tax-free securities. Under our present system of taxation the law penalizes the thrifty man who saves his money and invests it in a home or in tangible property of any kind. The spendthrifts and wasters are favored. They have the same benefits of government as those who save their money but pay nothing in taxes for what they get from the government. Such a system is unfair and un-American and must be changed.

He owns a dog, radio, Chinese rug, couch, folding bed, tables, chairs, some books, and a few dishes. Two hundred and fifty dollars of his household goods are exempt, which means in fact that about three times that amount in actual value escapes tax - ation. Since he spends his income as he gets it, except for a small amount put into tax-free securities, the result is that he does not pay to the state in taxes an amount based on his ability to pay. There are many Peter Does in Nebraska. The farmer, the crippled mechanic, the washerwoman, and the wage earner all pay more than their share of taxes. Some of the burden of Mary Dodd, Arthur Roe, John Jackson and Jack Meyer, must be shifted to the shoulders of Peter Doe, John Smith and John Brown. TV. Limitation of amount of property that shall be exempt from taxation. V. Prohibition of bond issues by governmental subdi - visions of state except by consent of two thirds of qualified voters' and obtaining of certificate of approval from State Board of Equalization and Assessment. VI. Payment for construction and maintenance of all State and County roads and bridges out of gasoline taxes. VII. Reduce automobile license fees to $2.00 per vehicle. </seg>
            <seg id="p042">RKPORT OF ATTORNEY GENKRAL SALE OF CORPORATION SECURITIES To our office have come hundreds of complaints alleging mis - representation and fraud in the sale of securities. Investors are not adequately protected in Nebraska. The average citizen knowns Lttle about finance. When he has saved some money he invests it, not on the basis of his personal knowledge of value of the security, but because of his faith in the seller. Many Nebraska citizens who worked hard, lived frugally, saved a competence, invested in what they were led to believe were sound securities, now find them - selves objects of charity. The present Blue Sky Law does not cover the situation. Most of the fraud has been in the sale of securities exempt from the provisions of that law. I suggest: 1. Requirement by law of simplified corporate structure of corporations offering their securities to the public. Some cor - poration capital structures now consist of such a tangle of re - lating and interrelating securities that even an expert accountant has difficulty in ascertaining the exact position of any share of stock in the capital set-up. 2. Legislation making directors personally responsible foi all corporate manipu'atiom by which stockholders or buyers of securities are defrauded. 3. Publicity of accounts. A corporation selling its "securities to the public should be required to maintain a running audit open to inspection by all persons having a financial interest in ■ the company. 4. Limit exemptions nnder "Bhie Sky Laio." The' notion that securities should be exempted becaused they are listed on some stock exchange has no foundation in law or fact. Nor is there any excuse for exempting securities of public utility companies. Some of the most flagrant cases of fraud have been in the sale of the securities of public utility holding companies. </seg>
            <seg id="p043">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL CONCLUSION As Attorney General I have been merely a hired man of the people. They elected me. They supplied me with spacious offices, stenographers and assistants. They paid my salary, rain or shine, depression or prosperity. I have been under the greatest possible obligation to conduct my office honestly and fearlessly for the benefit of all the people. I have not sought to hide anything from the public It is my belief that the public is entitled to know what their servants are doing. Respectfully submitted, ■ C. A.

            <seg id="p076">; REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL TRUST COMPANIES— LEGALITY OF VARIOUS PRACTICES - PARTICIPATION CERTIFICATES March 4, 1931. • Department of Trade and Commerce, Lincoln, Nebraska. Attention: E. H. Luikart. . . • -'" Dear Sir: ■ In your letter of February 16 you make the following inquiries to which we have made answer as follows: 1. Q. "Ill your opinion, can a Trust Company legally issue partici - pation certificates against mortgages on real estate owned by them?" A. In our opinion it can subject to the rules and regulations of the department as to safety hereinafter mentioned. 2. Q. "Can a Trust Company legally permit participations on a mortgage to remain outstanding and unpaid where they have fore - closed on the mortgage and bid in the property at Sheriff's sale and set the equity up as an asset of the Trust Company?" • A. If the trust company is the trustee or otherwise directly inter - ested in such trust it is our opinion that this practice is a gross violation of the duties of a fiduciary, borders on fraud if it is not actually fraud, and should be firmly suppressed by the department. Even if the trustee is some other person or corporation than the trust company itself there is at least a strong moral if not legal obligation on the part of the trust company which has sold and distributed such participations, to gather in the outstanding certificates or see that this is done and that full disclosure is made to the securities holders of the purchase at the sale. \ ' . 3. Q. "Can a Trust Company legally issue participation certificates on second mortgages or on tax certificates, etc.? Oftentimes when a Trust Company has advanced interest on mortgages, they set this item up as an asset, thereby making it a part of their capital. I am doubtful if this is legal,. and I am sure it is very' bad business practice." A. While it make be legal for a trust company to issue partici - pation certificates on second mortgages we believe that under the general power of regulation of trust companies which is conferred upon your department by Section 8-201 you may insist and require that all </seg>
            <seg id="p077">OPINIONS securities thus issued clearly show oii their face the nature of the underlying securities whether second mortgage or otherwise. As to the advancement of interest by a trust company -on mortgages or other securities sold by it, without disclosure of such advancement to the ' outstanding certificate holders it is our opinion that this practice nlso should be firmly suppressed under your regulatory powers above men - tioned. Usually, the trust company hclds itself out as an agent or trustee in looking after or otherwise safeguarding the assets of the trust and in such capacity the trust company owes the certificate holders absolute {rood faith. To set up, upon the trust company's books, such advanced payments of interest, as an asset of the company, should not be per - mitted, by the department and the department should insist upon full and complete disclosure on the part of the trust company to its cus - tomers of the status of the underlying mortgages at all times whether as to delinquent interest, non-payment of taxes or otherwise. 4. Q. "We also find' this condition in several instances, which makes it impossible to properly examine a Trust Company and get at the actual facts of its conditions. Here is an example — A certain Trust Company carries as an rsset of their company three thousand shares of another Company at a valuation of $30,700.00. The capital stock of the company which they carry, amounts to S128.000.00. The capital of the particular Trust Company amounts to 100,000.00. Practically one - third of the capital stock of this trust company is invested in the capital stock" of a subsidiary company. This condition allows them to use the subsidiary as a cover-up. "Would our examiners have a legal right to examine the subsidiary company for the purpose of learning the true situation relative to the condition of the Trust Company?" A. As to the ownership by a trust company of n large block of shares of another corporation, the provisions of Sec. 8-206, Subd. 7, apply and such stock must conform to the requirement that dividends "of at least 4% per annum for at least three years" have been paid on such slock. Otherwise the department should compel a sale or charge-off. . While the examiners would probably not have the right to examine such subsidiary company the department could require the trust com - pany to make proper showing relative to the condition of the subsidiary in such form as would be satisfactory to the department. The regulatory powers of your department under Sec. 8-201 are very similar to those the department exercises in connection with the supervision and examination of banks in this state and we believe that </seg>

TAXATION— STOCK OF NATIONAL BANK IN ANOTHER STATE OWNED BY CITIZEN OF NEBRASKA NOT SUBJECT TO TAXATION IN NEBRASKA May 19, 1931. Mr. W. H. Smith, State Tax Commissioner, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Smith: ■ ■&gt;. ■ ' This is in answer to your kind letter of May 12, 1931, in which you state and inquire: "I have had the question put up to me as to whether or not a citizen of Nebraska owning stock in a National Bank in some other state than Nebraska, is subject to taxation in this state for the stock owned." National banks are instrumentalities of the United States Govern - ment and their property and the shares of stock of their stockholders can only be taxed when Congress has given its consent to such taxation. The law provides that "The shares or the net income ...... of any national banking association owned by non-residents of the state or the dividends on such shares owned by such non-residents shall be taxed in the taxing district where the association is located and not elsewhere."— Sec. 548 of 12 U. S. C. A. (R. S. 5219). It follows that shares of stock in a national bank located in another state owned by a resident of this state can not be taxed to the owner in this state. Sincerely yours, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p079">. : opinions TAXATION— GRAIN BROKERS, PROPERTY OF— HOW ASSESSED ■■..:'■ April 11, 1931. Hon. William H. Smith, . Tax Commissioner, Capitol Building, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You. ask for our construction of Section 77-1421, Comp. St. Neb., 1929, as to method of assessing the property of "grain brokers," as defined in this section. The pertinent provisions concerning grain brokers in said Section 17-1421 are as follows: .'■■■• ". . . . Grain brokers . . . .shall at the time required by this act, list all real estate and other tangible property and the same shall be assessed in the same manner as other tangible property. The assessor shall determine the average amount of the total investment in the business' and the amount, if any, by which the average total investment exceeds the value of the real estate and tangible property so assessed. In de - termining the excess of the total investment, he shall take into consideration the purchnses and sales during the year and for that purpose he shall have the right to inspect all books of account and check books and other records. The excess, if any, of the average total investment shall be separately listed and shall be taxed at the same rate as the tangible property &amp;nd this tax shall be in lieu of all other taxes." Although we find no Nebraska Supreme Court decision construing this section as last amended in 1921 (Laws 1921, Ch. 133, Art. V), the Supreme Court had occasion to construe the section before its amend - ment: The two casts of Central* Granaries Co. v» Lancaster County, 77 Nebr. 3i9, 327, 113 N. W. 199; and Richards v. Harlan County, 79 Neb. 665, 113 N. W. 194, contain excellent discussions of the old law which throw considerable light on the proper construction to be placed upon the present law. Without going into an elaborate discussion of those cases, we will say that, in our opinion ,the following rules for assessment of "grain brokers" should be observed: </seg>
            <seg id="p080">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL First: AH tangible property, including grain on hand, should be assessed in like manner as other tangible property. Second: The tangible property, including grain on hand may not represent the true '•average amount of the total investment in the business," the grain being a variable quantity. It is, therefore, necessary to ascertain if such "average total investment" exceeds the amount of such tangible propevty. Third: An arbitrary system of totalling purchases and, or, sales of grain and dividing that sum by any fixed number, is neither an accurate nor lawful method of computation for purposes of arriving at the "average total investment." Each grain broker's "turnover" is dif - ferent from that of every other grain broker and his case must be handled individually in this regard. The assessor "shall take into consid - eration the purchases and sales" and for this purpose- may inspect the broker's books. Fourth: If, after making his investigation, the assessor finds that the average total investment is more than the tangible property, in - cluding grain on hand, he must add the amount of such excess to the assessment as an Hem to be assessed as tangible property. Fifth: Corporations and individuals should be treated alike in this method of assessment. The following examples are offered to illustrate these rules: A. Where average total investment exceeds tangible property: ( 1). Real estate leaseholds ■ SIO.OOO.OO ( 2). Motor Vehicles 1 __ $ 3,000.00 ( 3). Office furniture : . $ 1,000.00 ( 4.) Grain on hand $10,000.00 ( . r &gt;). Miscellaneous (tangibles) 5 1,000.00 ( 6). ; ... 325,000.00 ( 7) Items 1, 2, 3 and 5, same as above S15.000.00 ( 8). Average investment in grain . $30,000.00 ( 9). Average Total Investment __' $45,000.00 Average Total Investment __• $45,000.00 (Less) Tangibles on hand ... $25,000.00 (10). Difference— Taxed as tangibles 520,000.00 ■ $20,000.00 ■ Total to be taxed as tangible property $45,000.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p081">OPINIONS B. Where average total investment is less than tangible property: Assuming in above illustration A, that item 8 is S7.000.00, the other items being the same as listed, we have the following: Items 1, 2, 3, and o _ 1-S15.000.00 Average Investment in grain $ 7,000.00 Average total investment $22,000.00 Since this total is less than 525,000.00 total tangible property on hand (Item 6 above) there is no item as (10) above and the assess - ment is based upon (6) alone.

DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS-WATER • APPROPRIATION - AUTHORITY TO GRANT PERMIT TO VILLAGE FOR : • h ' ■■ ; I: ■•■•■ ; January 28, 1931. Mr. Roy L. Cochran, Secretary, Department of Fublic -Works, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: I am of- the opinion that your, department may legally grant the application of the Village of Crofton for an appropriation of water for a village water supply. I assume the village has arranged or will arrange with the owner of the land on which the" springs are situated for a diversion of water therefrom and that the grant from your de - partment is to be construed as a grant of a permit to use such waters when and if they become public waters. In the case of City of Chadron v. Card 107 Neb. 276, the City of Chadron which had previously installed a system of water-works which was supplied with water from Chadron Creek, had occasion to enlarge its works owing to the growth of the city and made application </seg>
            <seg id="p082">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL for a permit "To impound and npply to such uses all unappropriated waters flowing in snid streams, and all storm and flood waters, and all seepage, subterranean, underground and percolating waters, subject to the disposition of the state in the said valley of the Chadron creek, and to impound any and all waters not otherwise appropriated." The Supreme Court held that the application in that case should be granted. Respectfully yours, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General, By GEO. W. AYRES, Assistant Attorney General. STATE AUDITOR— RIGHT TO PERMIT COUNTY TREASURER TO DEFER PAYMENTS TO STATE WHERE COUNTY FUNDS LOST THROUGH BANK FAILURES September 4, 1931. Hon. George W. Marsh, State Auditor, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You submit to this department two letters which you have received from the county treasurer and county attorney respectively of Morrill County. It seerns from their statements that Morrill County has lost *■» heavily in past years from the failure of banks in which the county treasurer had deposited public money but that no part of this loss, has fallen on the state, all of it having been borne by the county. It now appears that the state has not been paid this year the amount which the county treasurer's statement showed was due on June 30th, 1931, and which should have been paid by not later than August. 1st, 1931 (77-1937). The county treasurer as I understand it wishes for a little more time to make payments inasmuch as collections have been slow, and says that if she is allowed to defer payments until the time when the the big payments on personal taxes are usually made she will be able to make all her state remittances. You inquire what shall be your attitude in the matter. In answer to the question you ask I will say that if investigation" discloses that the amount which it appears is now due the state for this past year </seg>
            <seg id="p083">OPINIONS is no more than what would have been the state's share of losses of public money in failed banks for past years I am of the opinion that you will be justified in allowing the county treasurer the time she asks in which to make payment. The case of Lancaster County v. State, 97 Neb. 95, was a case in which the county of Lancaster sued the state by leave given by the Senate to recover taxes which so far as I can see were paid under circumstances almost identical with the circum - stances in this case. In that case the court said: 'Where a county treasurer, under the mistaken idea that a county was the insurer of money received by it from taxes for the benefit of the state, paid to the state treasurer from other money -belonging to the county an. amount equal to the proportion which the state owned of the money deposited in a depository bank, which was lost on account of the failure of the bank without the fault of the county, an action may be maintained, under the permission of the state senate, to recover back such money erroneously pnid, and the fact that certain entries were made in the county books by the treasurer charg - . ing the money lost to certain county funds, under the same .mistaken idea, is no defense to the action." :.'.'■■} Sincerely yours, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General, By GEO. W. AYRES, Assistant Attorney General. TAX SALE— LEGALITY OF ISSUING CERTIFICATES TO VILLAGE WHERE NO MONEY RECEIVED March 12, 1931. Honorable George W. Marsh, .'..- State Auditor, Lincoln, Nebr. Dear Sir: You say that the County Treasurer of Merrick County "has issued tax sale certificates amounting to approximately $20,000.00 to the Village of Clarks on several pieces of property taken over by the village for taxes, same being issued without her having received any money from the village authorities and are now in their possession. </seg>
            <seg id="p084">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL You inquire whether this may lawfully be done. In answer to the question you ask I will say yes in my opinion it may. Section 77-2010, Compiled Statutes for 1929 provides: ' - ,, •_. ; "Whenever any real estate subject to sale for taxes shall be within the corporate limits of any city, village drainage district or irrigation district such city, village, drainage district, or irrigation district shall have the right and power, through its governing board or body, to purchase real estate for the use and benefit, and in the name of said city, village, drainage district or irrigation district as the case may be; and the treas - urer of said city, village, drainage district or irrigation district may assign the certificates of ourchcse by indorsement of his name on the back thereof, when directed so to do by written order of the city council of the city, board of trustees of the village, board of directois of the drainage district, or of the irrigation district as the case may be. No such sale shall be made to any city, village, drainage district or .of the irrigation district by the county treasurer when such lands have been previously sold to the county, but in any such case, the city, or village, drainage district or irrigation district may purchase the tax certificate held by the county; PROVIDED, that the county treasurer shnll not be required to account, to the state treasurer, or to any person, for the amount of taxes due and represented by such certificate or certificates of purchase, until . the drainage district or irrigation district authorities as the case may be, have sold the certificate or certificates of purchase of such real estate, or until, by redemption or foreclosure pro - ceeding, he shall have received the money thereon." You will observe the Village of Clarks had a legal right to purchase land within its corporate limits for the taxes thereon and to receive a certificate of tax sale therefor, but it is not required to account to the State Treasurer or to any person for the amount of taxes due and represented by such certilicate until the village of Clarks has sold the certificates or until by redemption or foreclosure proceedings she hns received the money thereon. That time has not yet come, but the attorney who writes for the County Treasurer advises that in his opinion it will come soon. - I presume this is true but even if it is not I am of the opinion that no liability can attach to the County Treasurer because of these sales for she has proceeded in conformity with the statute. It is quite apparent that when a tax sale is made to a city or village a tax sale certificate is delivered to it, but the law provides that it may be trans - </seg>
            <seg id="p085">. OPINIONS ferred by the city or villnge by indorsement or that it may be foreclosed regardless of the fact that no money is paid for it at the time of the so-called sale. Neither of there things could be done very easily by the city or village if the tax sale certificate was not in its possession. I will add that the sale of land to a county or city or village for the taxes due thereon is merely a paper sale until the land is assumed to some one else who pays the tax in money or until the tax Hen is foreclosed. In case the county or village should neglect to fore - close in the time fixed by statute the lien of the taxes against the land would still remain. (See County of Valley v. Milford, 70 Neb. 313). . . Very truly yours, C A. SORENSKN, Attorney General, By GEORGE W. AYRES. Assistant Attorney General. . ■ . CONSTITUTION- ARTICLE V, SKCTION 21-OMISSION OF WORDS IN COMPILING August 5, 1931. Mr. George R. Mann. Editor, 1931 Cumulative Supplement to 1929 Compiled Statutes 514 Federal Trust Building, Lincoln, Nebraska., Dear Mr. Mann: Your letter of July 29th at hand in which you ask for our opinion as to whether the words "provided for in this article" should be inserted after the word "offices" in the second sentence of Section 21 Article V of the Constitution of Nebraska as it now appears in print in the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, for 1929. In our opinion these words were included in the amendment adopt - ed by the constitutional Convention in 1920, but were omitted in com - pilation of the entire proceedings of that body. We have carefully examined the records of the convention in the office of the Secretary of State, which disclose the following: 1. The Daily Journal of the Cenvention showing that Proposal No. 313 was adopted on March 23, 1920 (The section in question was Section 18 of Proposal No. 313). </seg>
            <seg id="p086">REPORT OK ATTORNEY GENERAL 2. The certificate of A. .1. Weaver, President of the convention nnd Clyde H.

This resolution, as thus certified incorpor - ates in Section 18 of Proposal 313 the words "provided for in this article," as above mentioned, the entire sentence reading as follows: "Vacancies in all other elective offices provided for in this article shall be filled by election, but when the unexpired • term does not exceed two years the vacancy may be filled by appointment in such manner as the legislature may provide." Below this certificate and attached thereto appears the certificate to the correctness of the foregoing engrossed proposed amendments, signed by members of the Committee on Arrangement and Phraseology. 3. The printed and published "Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention, 1919-1920," showing on p. 2fi96, Vol. 2, the section in question (Section 18 of Proposal 313) as submitted on March 23, 1920, in final form to vote on third reading. The sentence in this recoid reads as above quoted. On page 2697 the. vote wrs shown to be 85 for, and 9 against, the Proposal (No. 313). On page 2698, the chair declared Proposal 313 adopted on third reading. 4. Under date of October 19, 1920, the members of the Constitu - tional Convention signed a compilation of the constitution, purporting to incorporate the amendments adopted at the election of Section 21, 1920. This compilation omits the words "provided for in this article" from the section in question. ' Notwithstanding this compilation, we are satisfied that' the sentence shown under No. 2 above, was actually a part of the amendments as approved by the convention and adopted by the election; and that that sentence should appear in Art. V, Sec. 21, as above indicated and including the words, "provided for in this article," in your compilation of the 1931 Cumulative Supplement, to the Compiled Statutes of Ne - braska, 1929, without parentheses or brackets. It might, however, be advisable to asterisk these words with an explanatory note — "Inadver - tently omitted from prior compilations," or words to that effect. Very truly yours, C. A.

Acting Insurance Commissioner, State House, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: This is in response to your request for our opinion on the con - struction to be placed upon the certificates issued by the Woodmen of the World which replaced certain outstanding certificates. The particular point involved is whethei computations of the association's liability under the extended insurance and automatic premium loan provisions of these new certifcates, would be made from the date of these certificates, which was, ujider the conversion plan moved back several years before the actual issuance, or from the date of actual issuance of these new certificates. We have carefully read the opinion 'of the Supreme Court of Alabama in the recent case of Hig^ins v. Sovereign Camp W. O. W., 141 So. 562, upon this particular point, and are inclined to agree with that opinion. The court took occasion both in its first opinion and its opinion upon rehearing ,to analyze at some length the provisions of the new certificates as well as the applications of the members therefor, with reference to the ante-dating of .the certificates as applied to the extended insurance provisions. The court's holding is especially significant in pointing out that, though there was no reserve specifically available for the liability on the particular certificate there involved, the court would, in the absence of a showing to the contrary, assume that there were sufficient surplus funds to justify such a contract. We would say, therefore, that if the new certificate holder has paid thirty-six monthly premiums after the date of the new certificate, though that date be three years or more before the date of its actual issuance, the minimum requirements of the extended insurance and automatic premium loan provisions have been complied with. We are assuming the facts to be as presented in the Alabama case and that the financial condition of the company will, as stated by the Alabama court, "justify such a contract." . .

Since the Corporation is an agency and representative of the Life Insurance Company, the acceptance by the agency of stamps in pay - ment of life insurance premiums, becomes acceptance by the life insurance company of such stamps. The query then is whether life ■ insurance companies may accept trading stamps in payment of pre - miums due on life insurance policies. </seg>
            <seg id="p089">OPINIONS 32 C. J. 1201, reads as follows: ' "In the absence of provisions in the policy or contract of insurance permitting payment in some manner, premiums are payable in cash, and an agent has no implied authority to accept payments except cash, although he may accept that portion, which is equivalent to his commission either in prop - erty., or in the form of a note, instead of cash; but a payment other than in cash may become effective by consent, estoppel or ratification." It follows that if a life insurance company may accept in payment of premiums due trading stamps which some private company has agreed to redeem, it may also accept potatoes, chickens, eggs, hoes, Brazilian Bonds, and Chinese money. In our opinion the statutes do not contemplate that a life insurance company should accept in payment of premiums anything except crsh or its equivalent. There is no specific statute covering this matter, but in our opinion your office has authority to make rules and regulations covering the whole subject of premiums. Under the provisions of Section 44-201 C. S. for 1929, you have power to make needful rules and regulations. We suggest that you make a fule covering this particular situation. If you do, we believe it will be sustained by the courts. Sincerely yours, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General. TAXATION— SCAVENGER SALES— BIDS BY COUNTY BOARD - RIGHT TO MAKE AND CANCEL— DUTY OF . ' .

As to the second branch of your second question, it appears that the last sentence of Section 77-2120, Comp.

Upon this authority we fail to find any statutory limitation based on the county board's inability to pay for want of funds claims filed and allowed against the county.

INSURANCE COMPANIES— RECEIVERSHIPS -APPOINTMENT OF ANCILLARY RECEIVERS April 23. 1932. Honorable Lee Herdman, Commissioner of Insurance. State House, Lincoln, Nebr. • . Dear Mr. Herdman: •. In re: Inter-Southern Life Insurance Co. After an examination of the authorities we have come to the con - clusion that the proper procedure is for the receiver appointed in Ken - tucky to make application in Nebraska for the oppointment of an ancillary receiver. ' In Bodge v. Skinner Packing Company, 115 Neb. 41, the Supreme Court of Nebraska said: "A foreign receiver is a proper party plaintiff in a pro - ceeding for the appointment of an ancillary receiver in this state." An -appointment of a receiver is an ancillary arid pro - visional remedy, and, ordinarily, will not be made upon an original application, except, in aid of the relief sought in the main case upon which it is dependent; but, where a general receiver for a corporation has been appointed by a court of . ' the state of its domicile, having jurisdiction, the courts of this state may, in the exercise of proper discretion, appoint ancillary receivers in aid of the court of primary jurisdiction." </seg>
            <seg id="p092">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "The pendency of a cause in a foreign' state, in which a receiver has been appointed, is .sufficient to authorize the ap - pointment of an ancillary receiver in this stale." The Supreme Court of Nebraska has repeatedly held that a receiv - ership is a purely ancillary remedy and cannot be maintained in a proceeding commenced for that purpose. There must be a main case pending in aid of which the appointment of- a receiver is sought. Bui in the Bodge case it was held that the pendency of appropriate pro - ceedings in the foreign court meets this requirement of the Nebraska laws. Our suggestion, therefore, is that the jcint receivers appointed in Kentucky bring an action in Nebrrska for the appointment of an ancillary receiver of the assests of the insurance company located in Nebraska. Very tiuly yours, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General. INSURANCE— CHARACTER OF CONTRACT AS, WHICH PROVIDES FOR FURNISHING SERVICES OF LAWYER IN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT CASES ■ February S, 1932. Honorable E. H. Luikart, Secretary, Department of Trade and Commerce, State House, Lincoln. Nebraska. Dear Mr. Luikart: From Governor Bryan we have received your request for an opinion on a service contract which the Association proposes to issue. You ask if there is anything in the contract to be termed insurance, and to make the company come under the insurance laws of the state. The contract in question provides that the Association for a certain consideration will procure for' the purchaser of the contract "one S5,000.00-S10,000.00 Public Liability and Su.000,00 Property Damage non - deductable insurance policy for a period of one year." In addition thereto the Association makes the following agreement with its members: </seg>
            <seg id="p093">OPINIONS "The Association will procure the services of n duly licensed and qualified lawyer for member, members of the family and employees in the defense of criminal charges of MURDER, MANSLAUGHTER and MISDEMEANORS arising out of the use and operation of the vehicle described herein. "The Association will procure the services of a duly licensed and qualified lawyer for member, membeis of the family and employees to arrange for a bail bond in case of nrrest arising out of the use and operation of the vehicle described herein. "The Association will procure the services of a duly licensed and qualified lawyer for member in collection of damages caused to the vehicle described herein by collision with an - other vehicle. "The Association will make an investigation and secure an adjustment, if possible, for any overcharge made against a member, by any hotel, public inn, or garage, upon satisfactory showing to the Ass-ciation of such discrimination or over - charge." In our opinion the contract between the Association and its mem - bers containing the provisions above uuoted constitutes an insurance agreement and makes the company subject to the laws governing in - surance companies operating in Nebraska. Section 44-101, C. S. for 1929, defines insurance as follows: "'Insurance' is a contract whereby one party called the 'Insurer' for a consideration undertakes to pay money or its equivalent, or to do an act valuable to another party called the 'insured' or to his 'beneficiary' upon the happening of the hazard or peril insured against, whereby the party insured or his beneficiary suffers loss or injury." In subdivision 12, of Section 44-401, Automobile Insurance is de - lined as follows: "AUTOMOBILE, engine, elevator, insurance. Against any hazard ■ resulting from ownership, operation, maintenance or .use of any automobile and against loss or legal liability for loss resulting- from accident or injury to person or persons, fatal or non-fatal, because of damage to property caused by the use of teams or vehicles, whether by fire, accident or collision or by explosion of any engine, tank, boiler, pipe or tire of any vehicle </seg>
            <seg id="p094">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL and including insurance against theft of the whole or any part of any vehicle. The term vehicle, as herein used, includes in addition to its ordinary meaning, elevators, automobiles, traction engines, motorcycles and bicycles, but does not include ships, ' vessels, boats nor railroad rolling stock." The general Statutory definition of insurance is unquestionably directly in line with the common law definition in 32 C. J. 975. See also State v. Farmers Benevolent Association, 38 Neb. 276. One of the hazards resulting from ownership, operation, or use of an automobile is that of becoming involved in an automobile accident and thereby being subject to prosecution for violation of criminal laws or civil suit for damages. The Association agrees in the event of such a contingency to furnish counsel in defense. We cannot say that the agreement of the association to furnish counsel in the event that criminal charges or a civil suit are brought against the operator of an automobile is not "doing an act valuable to another party," within the meaning of Section 44-101, C. S. for 1929. Kentucky has an insurance statute almost identical with ■ that of Nebraska. In the case of Allen,. Insurance Commissioner, vs. Motorists Alliance of America, 29 S.W. (2nd) 19, decided June 10, 1930, the Supreme Court of Kentucky had before it a contract similar to the one that the Association proposes to issue. The question was whether or not the contract came within the definition of the business of insurance and therefore required a license from the State Insurance Commissioner. Said the Kentucky Supreme Court: "Eliminating all the provisions of that section not applicable to the particular matter under consideration, it reads as follows: 'It shall be lawful for any company organized under this law: . . . . . 'To make any of the following kinds of Insurance .... '(9) upon automobiles and all other cars and vehicles, including public liability, property damage, collision, fire and burglary and theft insurance, and to insure the owners of such automobiles and all other cars and vehicles against such losses as arise out of the owner - ship, operation or maintenance of the same.' "It is not good logic to argue that the furnishing of an attorney to represent the owner of an automobile in his de - fense in court actions is not a loss indemnified against. Insurance </seg>
            <seg id="p095">OPINIONS Companies are authorized to indemnify 'against such losses as arise out of the ownership, operation or maintenance of ah automobile. If., in the operation of his automobile, he has a loss resulting in a claim against him the collection of which is prosecuted in a court, he must have an attorney and pay for his services, and it would be futile to argue that the contract in question does not indemnify him against loss. If it provided for the payment of an attorney fee not to exceed a certain sum when the owner of the automobile should be haled into court by reason of something growing out of his ownership or operation of his automobile, we believe that - no one would argue that it was not insurance. The difference is one of form and not of substance. The contract provides against any loss growing out of the payment of attorney fees by the simple expedient of agreeing to furnish and pay the attorney. The above question from the Statute was inserted by Chapter 14 of the Acts of 1922. Its purpose was to authorize the owner of - an automobile to insure against such losses as arise out of the ownership, operation or maintenance of the same. The contract holder is required to do nothing other than to notify appellee that he needs an attorney, and, upon such notification, he is relieved of all expense incident to the empoyment of an at - torney to ' represent him in his defense. It is true that the contract does not provide for the payment of any sum directly to. the contractee, but it does provide for the relieving of the contractee of the expenses of employment of an attorney. The attorney is but the agent representing the contractee in the case in court, and payment to him directly cannot well be distinguished from the act of paying the contractee directly and him paying the attorney who may represent him." In Physicians' Defense Co. v Cooper, 111 N. W. 396, the Supreme Court of Minnesota held' that a contract to furnish legal counsel in the event of suit against physician members of the association consti - tuted an insurance contract. The same question was before the United States Circuit Court of Appeals, 9th Circuit, in the case of Physicians' Defense Co. v Cooper, 199 Fed. 576, 47 L. R. A. N. S. 290, in which case that court said: "Such a contract, in our opinion, cannot be classed as a contract for personal service. The Company is not itself an attorney and does not undertake the defense as such. What it does undertake is, in case of suit, to employ a local attorney, in whose selection the holder shall have a voice, who with the company's attorney, will defend the case, and to relieve the holder from the expense thereof, an expense which must follow </seg>
            <seg id="p096">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL the happening of the very contingency provided against. Not only this, but the company must relieve the hoider -of paying the costs of suit. Suppose the contract had been to repay to the holders whatever sums, not exceeding $5,000 he should be required to pay out for attorneys and costs in case of such litigation. Could there be any question that there would be a contract of insurance? We think not. Can it change the character of the contract in this respect that it purports to hold the holder harmless against the pnyment of such expenses and costs? The contract reduced to its simplest idea, is but an agreement to pay the expenses and ccsts that the holder would have to pay in the contingency specified. This is indemnity pure and simple, and with whatever verbiage the contract may be clothed it does not serve to cover its real purpose, which is one to indemnify Uie holder against damage and liability for attorney's expenses and costs of defense, in the event that he is sued for malpractice." The case of Vredenbrough v. Physicians' Defense Co., 126 Illinois Appellate 509, is contrary to the authoiities we have cited. However, this case never reached (he Supreme Court of Illinois. The Physicians' Defense Co. v. Laylin, 73 Ohio State 90, 76 N. E. 567, is also contrary However, in that case the court calls attention to the fact that ther° was no statutory definition of insurance in force in Ohio as there now is in Nebraska. The Attorney General of Kansas. Mr. Roland Boynton. recently had before him the same ouestion as you have presented to us In an opinion dated August 3, 1931, to Mr. George M. Brewster, Assistant Commissioner of Insurance of Kans;s, on this subject he said in part: "Under the plan of the Association, it undertakes to in - demnify the member against risk of certain expenses for ser - vices of a surgeon or physician. These provisions come within the definition quoted in 3Cth Kansas at page 587, supra. "There are decisions upon what constitutes insurance in 30th Kansas, 585 supra, and in the case of the State of Kansas ex rel Coleman, vs. Wichita Mutual Burial Association 73 Kans. 179. "These decisions point towards the conclusion that the plan of the National Automobile Association constitutes a plan for insurance. In the care of Brandon vs. Saint Paul Mercury Indemnity Company, 132 Kansas, 68, 70, it was held that the indemnity company's policy of insurance in the particular case was one of liability upon which recovery could be had directly by the injured person. The policy was referred to as an insur- </seg>
            <seg id="p097">OPINIONS ance contract. The Ccurt said: 'The policy, it appears, was one of insurance against liability rather than one of indemnity. the company agreed to investigate any claim for damages, to negotiate settlement as may be deemed expedient by the company, to defend suits for such damages, even if groundless, in the name and on behalf of the assured until the company shall elect to effect settlement thereof. It agreed to pay all costs taxed against the assured in any legal proceeding defended by the company and interest accruing upon a judgement rendered." While the subject is not free from doubt yet in view of the all - inclusive language of our statutes and the recent decisions on the subject to which we have referred, we are unwilling to say that the proposed contract is not insurance withir the meaning of the statutes. In view of the lack of certainty as to the law on the subject, we would welcome a legal adjudication of the question. Sincerely yours, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney' General. TAXATION— INTANGIBLE PROPERTY— NOT SUBJECT TO FOR PAST YEARS— CRIMINAL LIABILITY FOR FAILURE ' . TO DECLARE February 16, 1932. Mr. Wm. H. Smith, . Tax Commissioner, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You submit to this department for answer a letter received by you from A— H— in which he asks the following questions: "If a party holds- real estate mortgages on property outside . of Nebraska and fails to list this property how long back is this tax retroactive? If a party holds class A property and fails to list this how long back is the tax on this property retro - active? If a party owns Class A and Class B property and i fails to declare this on his intangible tax schedule and signs the oath that he has none, knowing that he has, is he guilty of perjury and subject to criminal prosecution." </seg>
            <seg id="p098">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL The first two questions may be answered together. Intangible property is personal property and I fail to find any express statutory ( authority for the placing of intangible property on the tax list after the current year for which it was levied. 77-1614 provides for placing omitted lands on the tax list for prior years and 77-304 provides that when it is made to appear to the Tax Commissioner that any property has ■ been improperly omitted from the tax list or assessment roll for any year, he may call the atten - tion of the State Board of Equrlization to the matter and that board may appoint a special assessor to assess said property provided action is taken before December 1 of the year for which the assessment is made. , The general rule is that "In the absence of special statutory authority therefor the officer or board of eaualizalion or review cannot act as an original assessing body and make an assessment de novo or add omitted property." 37 Cyc 1088 . In answer to the third question asked by Mr, H— I will say that the statute (77-703) requires that a return of intangible property shall be made under oath and one who swears fnlsely to such a return if he is aware that he is swearing falsely is subjeet to punishment for perjury in my opinion (See 28-701).

The law does not in express terms forbid the withdrawal of such certificate, and inasmuch as the term of the certificate terminates when there is a transfer of ownership (60-310) and sanctions the trans - fer of ownership otherwise than by the vcluntary act of the registered •iwner, it occurs to me that the department will be justified in per - mitting; the withdrawal of a certificate of registration in its possession, but whose term has expired by reason of a transfer of ownership of the motor vehicle for which it was granted to be used in such a way as may be necessary to enable the new owner of the motor .vehicle to obtain a certification of registration of same in his own name, but "The Department of Public Works may in its discretion require from the transferee .before registering such motor vehicle, such additional information regarding such involuntary loss of ownership by the former registered owner as may be satisfactory to said Department of Public Works."

The applicant transferred the number from this car to another on the 27th of May and now desires to have it transferred back to the originally registered car. By doing this it would exempt the car for a portion of the year's registration. It appears to us that both cars should bear a separate license regardless of only one car being used from the 27th of May to date." I do not at this writing recall any provision of statute which authorizes a transfer of registration from one car to another. Section 60-310, Compiled Statutes, does provide among other things that: "Upon the transfer of ownership of any motor vehicle, its registration shall expire., and the person to' whom ownership of such vehicle is registered, and the person to whom ownership of such vehicle is to be transferred, shall forthwith join in a statement of said transfer, endorsed upon the reverse side of the. certificate of registration of said motor vehicle, in the space provided for said purpose, which statement shall be .signed by the transferer in the manner and form of his signature, con - tained on the face of said certificate, and which statement shall likewise be signed by the transferee who shall also set forth, below his signature, his postoffice address.

Clayton, Bureau of Child Welfare. Lincoln, Nebraska. ' . Dear Madam: I have been unable to find any provision of statute which in express terms or by necessary implication gives the Bureau of Child Welfare the power either to adopt a child or to give its consent to such adoption, 43-215, Compiled Statutes, 1929 provides: "It shall be lawful for the parents, parent, guardian of any child, or other person having the right to dispose of a depend - ent or neglected child, to enter into an agreement with any association or institution incorporated under any public or private law of this state or any other state, for the purpose of aiding, caring for, or placing in homes such children and being approved, as herein provided for the surrender of such child to such association or institution, to be taken and cared for by such association or institution, or put into a family home, such agreement may contain any and all proper stipulations to ■ ■ that end, and may authorize the association or institution by its . attorney or agent to appear in any proceeding for the legal adoption of such child, and consent to its adoption; and the order of the court, made upon such consent, shall be binding upon the child and its parents or guardian, or other person, the same as if such person were personally in court and con - sented thereto, whether made party to the proceeding or not." The Bureau of Child Welfare, however, is not an incorporated association or institution and the above quoted provision of statutes confers no power upon it. </seg>
            <seg id="p104">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 83-506, Compiled Statutes, 1929 provides: "The agent of the board of control, acting under the instructions of the board, is hereby authorized to consent to the adoption of any child who has been committed to it by a court acting under the juvenile court law, (43-201 — 43-228) and such committal shall be held to be an order authorizing the board of control to consent to its adoption by any person or persons it deems fitted to become the guardian of such a child." But this section of statute if literally construed is not applicable to the Bureau of Child Welfare. L I will add that in the case of an illegitimate child the mother is given by statute the power to authorize by a written .instrument some person, association or corporation to procure the adoption of her child by some suitable person (See 43-102). Although the Bureau of Child Welfare is not strictly speaking either a person, corporation or association, I am inclined to the opinion that where the mother of such a child without being under duress has authorized the Bureau of Child Welfare by an instrument in writing to procure the adoption of the child by some suitable person, she will be held to be estopped from questioning such adjoption, afterwards.

State Sheriff State House. Lincoln, Nebr. Dear Mr. Endres: This is in answer to your letter of July 18j 1932. You request opinion us to whether, under the Nebraska Supreme Court decision of July 8, 1932, in State v Bishop, officers can execute a liquor search warrant in a private dwelling house without proof of liquor sale or disposal from said house. ■. . In the Bishoo case the court's opinion and decision do not in any manner construe, touch upon or tiffed existing law with reference - to the obtainment, issuance and service of liquor search warrants for private dwelling houses and other places within this state. In the Bishop case the court held that a person has ' a right to have in his possession in his private dwelling house for his personal use a reasonable amount of intoxicating liquor, whether said liquor was obtained before or after the prohibition law took effect. The court also held that sixty -nine pints of beer was a reasonable amount of intoxicating liquor to be kept in one's private dwelling house for his personal use. These two points are all that were decided by the Supreme Court of Nebraska in the Bishop case. The scope of the Bishop decision is thus confined wholly to matters of defense which do not arise until after liquor is found by search warrants or otherwise and prosecution is instituted for unlawful posses - sion, disposal, bootlegging,- manufacture or transportation, as the case my be. ■ ■ . . The law on obtaining, issuing and serving search warrants in liquor cases, now as before State v. Bishop, is as found in Section 53 - 136, Comp. St., 1929, which is too lengthy to be set out here but to which you have ready and convenient access. . Of course, in view of the clear pronouncement in the Bishop case as to a person's right to have a reasonable 'amount of intoxicating liquor in his private dwelling house for his personal use, officers and </seg>
            <seg id="p107">• OPINIONS private persons will not be expected to apply for search warrants, nor will magistrates be expected to issue the same, where all the evi - dence o_r knowledge at the time of the proposed issuance, points to the dwelling house possession of only a small amount of liquor obviously -intended for use and used only for the owner's private consumption. Such was the law even before the Supreme Court said so. On the other hand the dwelling house possession of an unusually large amount of intoxicating liquor, especially when attended by some evidence of liquor disposal, manufacture transportation or any kind of liquor traffic to, from, in, around or about said house, does call for the- issuance and service of a search warrant and the follow-up of the same with all indicated prosecutions. Thus both before and after the Bishop decision, the determination of Questions as to when to ask for, issue and serve liquor search warrants follows the rule of reason and common sense and is com - mitted to the sound discretion of the officers and magistrates un - hampered by any fancied refinements of interpretation in the Bishop case or anv other case. Evidence of a liquor sale from a private dwelling house most certainly would justify the issuance and service of a search warrant for liquor against such house and its occupants. But other, further and different circumstances, enumerated or referred to in this letter and your letter, such as a "load" of liquor in the private dwelling house, would also, in cur judgement, be equally potent in justifying or requiring search warrant process in the premises. With kind personal regards, we are. Sincerely yours, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney Gneral, By CLIFFORD L. REIN, Assistant Attorney General. AUTOMOBILES— FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY LAW— EFFECT ON JUDGEMENTS OBTAINED AFTER LAW TOOK EFFECT FOR ACCIDENT OCCURRING BEFORE LAW TOOK EFFECT .'■ May 13, 1932. Mr. Huber D. Addison, County Attorney, Wayne, Nebraska. • Dear Sir: This is answer to your letter of May G, 1932. You request opinion as to whether, under the financial responsibility law (Sec. 60-603, 1931 </seg>
            <seg id="p108">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Supplement), suspension of driver's rights m-y be had upon unsatisfied judgements obtained after the law took effect for accidents occurinn before the law took effect. The precise question appears to be unsettled both in this and in other jurisdictions. Hence, no answer to this question is entirely free from doubt. We are aware that in the nbsence of a clearly dis - closed intent or purpose to the contrary, the statutes are not to he construed as operating retrospectively or retroactively (State v: Ins. Co., 117 Neb. 98). Furthermore, we have not overlooked the uniform holdings that motor vehicle statutes do not apply to accidents or alleged violations occuring before their enactment (42 C. J 624, Note 25). But is the financial responsibility law retrospective or retroactive as applied to suspension of driver's rights for unpaid judgments ob - tained after the law's effective date for accidents occuring prior thereto? To this question both the clear language and the obvious purpose of the law require, in pur. opinion, a negative answer.' The law everywhere plainly says that the suspension is not for causing the accident but for failing to satisfy the judgement, viz., the adjudicated responsibility for causing the accident. The reiteration of this thought discloses the law's renl purpose, which is not to punish the faulty and damaging operation of motor vehilces, but to keep off the public highways of this stale persons who have failed to discharge their responsibility for the safe and proper operation of motor vehicles in this state. In this view of the language and policy of the law, it is immaterial when the accident happened if the judgement establishing the responsibility and the default in the payment thereof took place after the law took effect. To this we might add that no one has a vested right to operate a motor vehicle in this state; and, of course, no vested right to be irre - sponsibly negligent or wilfully at fault in operating motor vehicles to the damage of another. The statute is, therefore, purely remedial and leaves no substantial ground for complaint on the part of the suspended licensee merely because the incidence of the liability for which the unsatisfied judgement was obtained pre-dates the taking effect of the statute. . . We are therefore of the opinion that the department of public works has authority under the financial responsibilty law to suspend an operator's license if the unsatisfied judgment was obtained after </seg>
            <seg id="p109">OPINIONS the law took effect, even though the accident for which the judgment was rendered occurred before the law took effect.

MOTOR VEHICLE REGISTRATION FEES— OVERPAYMENT BY COUNTY TO STATE— REIMBURSEMENT April 7, 1931. Hon.. Dan L. Ough, House of. Representatives, State House, Lincoln, Nebr. Dear Sir: ■ - You state .that a large number of counties have overpaid to the state the amount due the state from motor vehicle registration fees. There are two ways to reimburse, the counties: 1. The legislature can appropriate out of the treasury an amount equal to the excess payments made to the state by the various couties and provide for the payment thereof to the various counties. 2. The legislature by law could provide that the state auditor in connection with the Department of Public Works should determine the excess payment made by each county and that each county should receive credit for such excess payment. If this latter plan is adopted then each county could deduct the excess payment already made from any future amount due the state. If the Governor wishes to introduce any such bill, of course, we will be very glad to draft it. The Attorney General's office held in January, 1926, that the proper construction of the law is- to first deduct the 5 cent registration, then deduct and remit 2 J ,i% of the balance remaining, and then again to deduct and remit 30% of the then remaining balance. Yours very truly, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General. </seg>

Trenmore Cone, . ■ Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire "as to whether or not a county board, in advertising for work or materials to be furnished to a county, under the. laws of this state, have the privilege to take into consideration a"ny matters or rates in any different manner than the advertised bids asked for. In other words, can a county board advertise for bids, to illustrate, for gravel delivered F. O. B. cars, at any station in the county, and can they, the county board, consider a bid for gravel delivered upon the roads hauled by truck?" In answer to the question you ask, I will say that in my opinion where a county board is required to advertise for bids for work to be done or material to be furnished and to let the contract to the lowest and best bidder it has no legal right to consider a bid for. work to be done or material to be furnished which does not conform substantially to the terms and conditions called for by the advertisement. If in the advertisement the right is reserved to reject any and all bids, that can be done, and bids can be advertised for again. Of course, if the law does not require any advertisement for bids, but the board does advertise, it can accept an offer which does not conform with the conditions set forth in the advertisement.

            <seg id="p111">OPINIONS I.KGISLATURE— CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS— BILL AUTHORIZING STATE TO INCUR BONDED INDEBTEDNESS OF 325,000,000 INVALID March 14, 1931. Senator Kenneth Wherry, Senator Arthur Bowring, Senate Chamber, Lincoln, Nebraska. Gentlemen: Each of you having asked the opinion of this ofTice as to the constitutionality of Senate File No. 175- if enacted into law,, we take the liberty of answering both of you by one communication. Every presumption must be indulged in favor of the constitutionality of any act of the Legislature. When two constructions are possible that which will sustain the Act must be adopted. Nor of course is il the slightest concern of this ofTice as to whether the Act is econ - omically wise or not; that question is the sole concern of the Legislature and Governor. The question here involved is whether the Legislature has power under the State Constitution to do what is contemplated by the proposed bill. We think not. Senate File No. 175 reads as follows: '"' "Section 1. Issuance of bonds or other obligations. The and of the State of Nebraska is hereby auth - orized and directed to issue, in installments not exceeding $8,000,000 for the .first and second calendar years, being 1931 and 1932 and $9,000,000 the third calendar year, not exceeding $25,000,000 bonds, notes, debentures or other obligations of the State of Nebraska, mnturing in annual instalments of $2,500, - 000 or more beginning in 1934 .for the purpose of providing funds for the acquisition, construction and improvement of roads and bridges throughout the State, bearing interest at not more than 5? 2 % per annum, payable semi-annually, and to sell, execute and deliver the same at a price not lower than a price which is equivalent to a 5^% interest yield basis as computed from standard tables of bond values. </seg>
            <seg id="p112">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "Section 2. Nature of bonds or other obligations. The faith and credit of the Stnte shall not be pledged to the pay - ment of any of such bonds, notes, debentures or other obli - gations, or the interest thereon, and they shall be payable solely from the revenues of the State to be derived from taxes upon gasoline and other motor fuel and from motor vehicle license fees. No indebtedness of the State shall be deemed created by the issuance thereof, and. no obligation or liability except to collect and apply such motor feul taxes and motor vehicle license fees to the principal and interest thereof. Such bonds, notes, debentures or other obligations shall be, and shall have and are hereby declared to have all the qualities and incidents of, negotiable instruments under the negotiable instru - ments law of the State, without, however, consituting an in - debtedness, obligation or liability of the State or a pledge of the faith and credit of the State in violation of other provisions of this section. "Section 3. Means of Payment. In each year while any of such bonds, notes, debentures or other obligations shall be out - standing, it shall be the duty of the to set aside into a special fund from the first collections of all taxes upon gasoline or other motor fuel and all motor vehicle license fees now authorized by law, sufficient sums to pay the interest thereon and to provide fbr the payment of the principal thereof as such interest and principal shall fall due." I. Senate File No. 175 contravenes Section 1 of Article XIII of the Constitution of Nebraska which reads as follows: "The state may, to meejt casual deficits, or failures in the revenues, contract debts never to exceed in the aggregate one hundred thousand dollars '....' Th« bill provides for the Issuance by the State of Nebraska, in the language of Section 1 of the bill, of "825,000 000 bonds, notes, debentures or other obligations of the State of Nebraska." This constitutes, in our opinion the contracting of "debts" exceeding "in the aggregate one hundred thousand dollars." Every purchaser of these bonds would be a lender of money to the state and the state the borrower. The contract of indebtedness would be between the state and the' bond buyer; there would be no other parties to the transaction. With the issuance of each bond a debt would be .contracted by the state. ' A common sense, "natural arid obvious meaning" of the word "debt" or "indebtedness" as used in the section under consideration, is thus limited in its owning of money. (31 C. J. 411) </seg>
            <seg id="p113">OPINIONS The slate pnys its debts only from its revenues. To say that the state does not become indebted when its particular revenue as dis - tinguished fcom its revenues as a whole are pledged or in any way impounded to pay a money obligation, is to cur minds, to ignore this fundamental principle. Once the gasoline taxes, so called, reach a stale treasury, they are just as much a part of the general revenue and r.ssets of this state as are the taxes collected from levies on tangible property. The fact that the gpsoline tax collections are at once set apart into a distinct fund in" no way changes the fundamental character of the fund as a general asset of the state which, if the Legislature should see fit, could be devoted to Ihn payment of any kind of general state ndebtedness. It is not a trust fund. Neither is it a "special fund," as that term is used by the courts. The purpose of the constitutional provision was to provide a system of finance under which the expenses of the state government should be paid out of money in the treasury or from taxes levied during the liiennium in which- the expenses were incurred. It is true that where the bonds are not to be paid out of general taxes collected by the state but out. oi some trust fund or out of money raised, by the state in some other manner Iran by its taxing power, that the bonds do not constitute a debt vuthin the meaning of 1.he constitutional provision. The Supreme Court of Washington in State vs. Clausen 235 P. 364, held that a law authorizing a bond issue for the erection of state capilol buildings the principal and interest to he. payable only fiom revenues derived from the lease and sale of lands granted to the slate for such purposes by the federal govern - ment, did not create a debt in violation of a constitutional provision similar to the one in Nebraska. In kasch vs. Miller, 135 N. E. 814, the Supreme Court of Ohio held that an act authorizing the initiation and construction of a proposed improvement for the conservation of flood waters be paid for by the issue and sale of bonds in the name of the state, the principal and interest to be paid, entirely out of the revenues derived from the improvement or from the sale of the corpus in case of default, a state debt was not created within the purview of the state constitution. But that i3 not the situation in. this case. Our Supreme Court has held the gasoline tax, as it is popularly called, to be an excise tax levied under the authority of Section 1 of Article VIII of the Consti - tution which provides that "taxes other than property taxes, may he authorized by law."The gasoline tax is purely a revenue measure iipplicable to all persons who import gasoline into the state. The proceeds of the gasoline. tax become a part of the general revenue of the state and are expendable only as such. The fact that after they </seg>
            <seg id="p114">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL are received by the state treasurer he placfs them to the credit of a fund known as the "Gascline Highway Fund" doe's not change their fundamental nature as a general asset" of the state. In Lesser v. Warren Borough, 85 A. .839. 43 L. R. A. N. S. 839, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held that Borough bonds issued to purchase water-works and secured solely by the water-works without any further liability on the part of the Borough constituted nevertheless a "debt" within the meaing of the constitution limiting municipal indebtedness, the term "debt" being given its ordinary general meaning,, to wit, "a contractual obligation to pay in the future for considerations received in the present." In Renfroe v. Atlanta, 78 S. E. 449, the Supreme Court of Georgia held that where a contractor enters into a contract with a municipal corporation for the construction and equipment of a light and water plant under the written agreement whereby some of the contract price is to be paid in installments through a series of years after the contract was completed, the effect of the contract was to create a "debt" within the meaning of the constitution limiting the power of municipalities to contract debts. In State of Montana ex rel Diederchs, v. State Highway Commission of Montana, et al,. Code No. 6832 decided by the Supreme Court of Montana on February 21, 1931, a similar question was passed upon. The constitution of that stale provides: "* * :s hut no debt or lirbiliay shall ■ be created which shall singly, or in the aggregate with any existing debt or liability, exceed the sum of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) except in case of war, to repel invasion or suppress . insurrection, unless the law authorizing the same shall have been submitted to the people at a general election * * *" (Mont. Const. Art. XIII, Section 2.) The Legislature of Montana, (Laws 1931, Ch. 1) had just authorized the sale of state highway debentures in the sum of 36,000,000 at the rate of $1,500,000 for each year from 1931 to 1.934, inclusive, maturing serially in the years 1934. to 1940, inclusive. Principle and interest, it was provided, were to be paid out of excess taxes on motor fuels which taxes should not be reduced so long as the debentures were outstanding and unpaid. Chapter VI of the laws of Montana, 1931, fixed this excess tax on motor fuels at five cents per gallon. The court held the statute unconstitutional, as a violation of the constitutional provision above quoted. Although the court classifies </seg>
            <seg id="p115">OPINIONS the proposed debentures as a "liability," ns that term is used In the constitution, as distingushed from "debt," as therein used, the reasoning of the court is most pertinent to the subject at hand. The following are excerpts from the court's opinion: "The fact that a special fund is created by the imposition of the license or excise tax on motor fueh with which to pay the debentures is of no importance. "Undei this contention the legislature, or the debt-con - •traclinrr authority, could divide the public revenue into numerous subdivisions, calling one the 'road fund,' another the 'school fund..' another the 'agriculture fund, 1 another the 'public health fund.' and others almost without limit Debts could then be contracted in unlimited amounts and payable in the far distant future, and still be immune from attack as violating constitutional provisions limiting indebted - ness provided each debt was made payable out of some one of the specially designated funds into which all the revenue collec - ted by taxation from the people had been divided. A mere state - ment of the proposition carries with it, ft seems to us its own refutation. (Crick v. Kash, 190 Ky. ... 229 S. W. 63.) "The fund " raised from the Motor fuels' excise tax results from one of the constitutional methods of raising public revenues. (State v. Sunburst Oil Ref. Co., 73 Mont. 68, 236 Pac. • 428.) They are state funds and the state has the right to devote the proceeds of this tax to any public purpose it sees fit." "The general rule is stated as follows in 25 R. C. L. 898: ■ "The phrase 'shall never contract any indebtedness, as used in stnte constitutions, limiting the amount of indebted - ness which a state may lawfully contract, includes any obli - gation which the state undertakes or is obligated to pay or discharge out of future appropriations; that is, appropriations not made by the legislature creating the debt or obligation, and to be paid from moneys to be derived from levies other than those made by the then existing legislature, which must • necessarily he raised by levying a tax upon the property of the entire state,- as distinguished from a mere city, county or district levy." The case of Crick v. Hash (Ky.), 229 S. W. 63, shows how the courts of that state may hold that debt payable out of a special fund </seg>
            <seg id="p116">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL not be a "debt" within the constitutional inhibition, pointing out the constitutional provision that allows creation of indebtedness "if pro - vision is made in the net crentnR it for its payment." There is no such provision in Nebraska. Even under the Kentucky rule which would not define ns a "debf within the constitutional inhibition, an obligation payable only &lt;:ut of a special fund, such fund must have the characterstic of a trust fund. The court in Crick v. Rash, supra, has this to say with reference to this essential characteristic of the "special fund:" p "The 'special fund' out of which n debt shall be paid in order to relieve it from the operation of the lirriting provisions of the constitution is a fund which does not belong to the state, county, or other municipality creating the debt, but which belonged to others and to which the holder of the debt must look for its payment." The court, in referring to the authorities reviewed in citations from L. R. A., said: "There Is not found in any of them a single case where the authority contracting the debt may specialize a fund out of which it may be paid at some time in the distant future when it becomes clue, and thus validate the debt al though exceeding the constitutional limitations, upon the ground that it is payable out of a 'special fund'." (Crick v. Rash, supra.) Bloxton v. State Hightway Commission, 8 S. W. (Ky. Ct of \pp ) S92 (June 27, 1928), 225 Ky. 324, is a case on pledging "special funds!" This was a declarative judgment on the State Highway Toll Bridge Act of 1928. Held: (a) Net delegation of legislative power (toll fixing) to commission., but a delegation of administrative power which was valid under the constitution; (b) not violation of debt limit clause of constitution in, "view that act did not authorize a debt to be contracted by commonwealth or create any indebtedness against it, since only the bridge acquired under the act are affected by it." (Note: Law pro - vided if tolls should in any, case be insufficient, then the bonds were a lien on the bridge or bridges.) ■ The court, in speaking of the tolls to be charged, said: "Tolls are not taxes within the meaning of Section 181 of the Constitution. For tolls are collected from every one who uses the bridge, whether a resident of this state or a non - resident, while taxes may only be levied upon residents of this state, or property having its situs in this state. Tolls are, strictly </seg>
            <seg id="p117">: OPINIONS speaking, compensation paid for the use of the bridge and are similar to the lolls paid to a ferryman where a ferry is used. See Klein v. Louisville (t\y.) 6 S. W. (2d) 1104, decided May 22, 1928." Further, with reference to the "indebtedness" created: , ■*■ • "The bondholders must look to the tolls and the bridge property for the payment of the bonds. No property which the state now owns is put in lien for the bonds. Only the bridges acquired under the act are affected by it." Other Kentucky cases holding that Indebtedness payable only out of "special funds," as that term is defined in the Crick case, supra, is not a general indebtedness within the meaning of the constitutional limitation are: ' State Highway Commission v. Veiling, 230 Ky. 381, 19 S W. (2d) 967. Klein v. City of Louisville, 6 S. \V. (2d), 1104. ■--■'■■■. City of Bowling Green v. Kirby, 220 Ky. 839, 295, S W 1004. " Estes v. State Highway Commission, 29, S. W. (2d) 583. In Bates V. State Bridge Commission, (W. Va. May 13, 1930), 153 S. E. 305, involving the constitutionality of Ch. 8, Acts 1929 (of W. Va.), similar in its provisions to the bridge law of Kentucky, the court said: . "The great weight of decisions is that bonds of a state or political subdivisiqn payable solely out of revenue derived from a utility of a public nature acquired by the money derived from bonds do not create debts within the constitutional inhibi - tion against the contraction of public debt, but partake of the nature of purchase money mortgages." (Citing Ind., Wis., N. C, Wash., Ky., and Ala. cases, herein referred to.) ■ The court however makes the identical distinction which Kentucky makes in this regard between bonds payable out of general revenue and bonds payable from tolls. The court, in this connection and referring to the provisions of Sec. 4, 'Art. 10, of the West Virginia Constitution limiting state indebted - ness, eaid: . </seg>
            <seg id="p118">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "The payment of the bonds vs to be mnde exclusively from the revenue derived from the bridges. No oiher revenues are ■ applicable. Taxation for their redemption in any form can not be imposed. ■ "The debts against wVich the (constitutional) prohibition lies are those for wl ich suit may be maintained or the states' revenues and resources pledged or" sequestered." Fox v. Bicknell, 193 Ind. 537, 141 N. E. 222 (cited in Bates case, supra), applies the rule announced in the Eates case to bonds issued by the city of Bicknell, Ind. in the purchase of a water-works plant, the bonds being payable only out of pl:&gt;nt revenues. In this case the court carefully distinguishes this method of payment from payment out of general revenues. The court said in this connection: "There will not be one cent of money derived from taxa - tion gcing into this fund that woul.l not go into the coffers of the Bicknall Water Company if it continued to operate the plant." • In Hesse v. City of Watcrtown, 232 N. W. (So. Dak.) 53, decided September 22, 930, a question similar to that under consideration was presented. The city council had attempted to issue bonds for enlarge - ment of its existing electric light plant, payable out of revenue of entire plant. The statute authorized the city to "borrow money on the credit of the corporation . . J . and to issue negotiable bonds therefot when authorized at an election". ! The court distinguishes the case from cases pledging revenues from specific property to pay for the acquisition of such property from those cases where the revenue pledged is part of the general revenue owned by the state or city . The court cites City of Joliet v. Alexander, 194 111. 457, 62 N. K. 861, as a case which though often cited has never had its reasoning '"successfully Impeached." The court quotes extensively in Joliet v. Alexander, in part as follows: " 'In addition to mortgaging the existing system, the ordinance proposes to take the income now derived from it, amounting to about 350,000 a year, and devote it to the payment of the certificates. This is existing property and income of the city derived annually from the present system of waterworks, independent of the extension, and in no manner resulting from or depending upon it. The city is to lose property in the. form of established income for the purpose of paying the cer - tificates. (Above paragraph itrlicized in book). </seg>
            <seg id="p119">OPINIONS 'What is said relative to mortgaging property owned by the city, or pledging its existing income, is not intended to apply to a mortgage purely in the nature of a purchase-money mort - gage .payable wholly out of the income of property purchased, or. by resort to such property. This is not a case where there is no obligation of the city except the performance of a duty in the creation and management of a fund, and where the water-works, upon paying for themselves, will become the property of the city. The reasoning in Winston v. City of Spo - kane, 12 Wnsh. 524, 41 P. 828, can not be applied to a case like this, and could only apply to property or a fund which the city never had, where the property, is to be paid for by its own earnings without imposing any further liability on the city. " 'H does not make any difference that the certificates are payable out of the special fund, if the city is the owner of the fund. All its obligations are payable out of some particular fund." (Hesse v. City of Watertown, 232 N. W. 59). In analyzing the cases cited we have sought to recognize a distinc - tion which practically all the courts have made between "special funds" and general revenue funds. Special funds, as that term is generally employed by the courts in this type of cases, partake largely of the characteristics of purchase money mortgages. That is to say, the courts have not classified as "debts" those obligations payable out of tolls or funds derived directly from specific property which is acquired subject to the specific charge or lien against such, tolls or funds. It is recognized that such tolls never properly become general assets of the state at all but in their very creation are given the character of a trust or some such similar attribute. But where the obligation is payable out of the state's revenues, as ore taxes imposed on the importation of gasoline, then a debt is clearly created within the meaning of the Constitution. ■ II. Senate File No. 175 contravenes Sections 22 and 25 of Article III of the Constitution of Nebraska reading as follows: "Each Legislature shall make appropriations for the ex - penses of the government until the expiration of the first fiscal quarter after the adjournment of the next regular session, and all appropriations shall end with such fiscal quarter (Sec. 22, Art.

There is no such thing as an implied appropriation in this state. State v. Wallichs, 15 Neb. 609; Fischer v. Marsh, 113 Neb. 153. We must carefully distinguish this rule from that applicable to the situation which arises when the state acquires funds as a trust fund which, under the provisions of the trust itself, are expendable in a specified manner. For examrle, in the rase of grants of public lands to the state for the use and support of- the university and agricultural college, the Supreme Court has held that the grant itself together with our statutes and constitutional provisions making the funds therefrom 'forever inviolate' (See Sec. 9, Art VII, Const, of Nebl) . constitute "a complete appropriation to the beneficiary" and biennial appropriations of such funds by the Legislature are not necessary. — State v. Brian, 84 Neb. 30. There is, however, no such thing in Nebraska as a continuing appropriation. In State v.

Moore, supra. - The Kentucky legislature meets biennially, appropriating money for state expenses on an annual basis. Question arose as to the validity of Highway Commission's contracts for road construction. In Billetter &amp; Wiley v. State Highway Commission, 203 Ky. 15, 261 S. W. 855, the court held: . (Syl. 2) "State Highway Commission cannot let contracts aggregating in ultimate cost more than revenues of current fiscal year though they do not require an expenditure in any one fiscal year in excess of available funds for that year, under Act approved March 16, 1920 tLaws 1920 Ch. 17) Sees. 3, 9. . • (Syl. 7) "Legislature may not authorize state highway com - mission to let contracts aggregating in ultimate cost more than revenues of two years, of its term, though such contracts will not require expenditure in any one year in excess of available funds- for that year, since it cannot tie its successor's hands by making future levies.'' In Premier Const. Co. v. Kimmel, 230 Ky. 439, 20 S. W. (2d) 77, (June 7, 1929), the rule announced in Billetter &amp; Wiley v. State Highway Com., supra., was followed and applied as to city indebtedness. The court held: "Without vote of the people, city could not by making con - tract for construction of street incur liability, which when added to other liabilities then incurred, exceeded its revenues for any. one fiscal year." State v. Executive Council of State, 207 la. 923, 223 N. W. 737, decided March 5, 1929, is relevant. The Legislature of Iowa hod passed a "Road Bond Act" (Acts. Ex. Sess. 42d. Gen. Assembly Ch. 2) and adopted by the Electorate providing for issuance of $100,000,000 road bonds of the state, payable by levy of direct tax but providing </seg>
            <seg id="p122">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL" for so budgeting of the primary road fund that such fund would be first applied to payment of the bonds and credited to the general levy otherwise provided for in the act. The Constitution of Iowa provides, among other requirements, (Sec. 5, Art 7) that no debt in excess of $250,000, can be contracted unless: (a) specifically authorized by law: (b) such law to impose and provide for ccllecliin of a direct' annual tax, sufficient to pay interest and principal, within 20 years from time of contracting the debt;' and (c) vote of Electorate. It was provided in the Iowa statute under consideration (Sees. 13 and 15) that the laws of the state relating to motor vehicle license fees and gasoline license fees accredited to primary road fund should not be amended until the bonds were pr.id. The courts opinion on this point is clear and powerful: "The purport of the foregoing is to pledge irrevocably the fund arising from gasoline taxes and motor vehicle licenses to the payment of the bonds. The plrintiff challenges the validity of these sections. The act as a whole is one for the creation of an indebtedness in excess of S250.000. The power of the Legisla - ture to create it is circumsciibed by the limitations of the Constitution. Within the limitations of the Constitution, and pursuant to its procedure, the 42d General Assembly had power to create the debt and to render its enactment thereof irre - vocable by any future general Assembly. It had the constitu - tional power to impose a 'direct tax' for the payment of the debt it had created. No future General Assembly could repeal the levy of such tax while the debt remained. But this is so because the Constitution makes it so. In the absence of any constitutional provision to such affect, no General Assembly has power to render its enactment irrevocable and unrepeatable by a future General Assembly. No General Assembly "can guarantee the span of life of its legislation beyond the period of its bi - ennium. The power and responsibility of legislation is always upon the existing General Assembly. One General Assembly may not lay its mandate upon a future one. Only the Constitution can do that. It speaKs as an oracle and stands as a monitor over every General Assembly. The funds resulting from license fees and gasoline- taxes are within the legislative power, and are necessarily subject to the control if the existing- General As - sembly. Its enactment in relation .thereto will' continue in force until repealed. The power of a subsequent General Assembly either to acquiesce or to repeal is always existent. It must be held, therefore, that sections 13 and 15, above quoted, were and are wholly ineffective and void." </seg>
            <seg id="p123">OPINIONS State v. Moorer, 152 S. C. 455, 150 S. E. 269, is contra in principle to the rule announced in the Iowa case supra, the decision being made by a strongly divided court. The point is passed over very briefly by the court but strongly nsserted by the dissenting justices. However, the rule as laid down by the court is, on its face, inapplicable in Nebraska by reason of our constitutional inhibition against continuing appropriations. The court said: "In the absence of constitutional prohibition, the Legislature may make continuing appropriations; that is those the pay - ment of which is to be continued beyond the term of a session of the Legislature by which they are made." The legislature in our opinion is limited in making appropriations by revenues which will accrue during the biennium. It cannot for any purpose mortgage the future tax revenues of the state. If this session of the Legislature has authority to allocate, appro - priate, or otherwise tie-up all or part of the revenue which the slate may receive during the next ten years from its tax on gasoline, then it may also of course mortgage the revenue which the state will, receive from the general property tax. intangible property tax, or an income tax during the same period. If the Legislature in 1931 can by law provide how the state shall spend the money which it may raise by taxation in the ten years to come, then it may do the same as to what the state shall do with its revenue during .the next 25, 50, 100, or 500 years. The whole proposal is contrary to the spirit and intent of the constitution that no one session of the Legislature shall tie the hands of any future session. The doctrine of "pay as we go" is firmly rooted in the govern-, mental policy of this state. There is and can be no outstanding bonded indebtedness of any consequence. In the Constitutional Convention of 1919-1920, an effort was made to raise the debt limit from $100,000 to §500,000, but it failed. That convention thus recognized and reaffirmed this established fiscal policy. We do not believe that the courts will look with favor upon any proposal which seeks indirectly to evade the plain provisions of the constitution. If it is desirable for the state to bond itself, and to pledge Its taxes on gasoline, to the amount of $25,000,000 for road purposes, tne amendment to the state constitution authorizing such a program, by Legislature can submit to the voters in 1932 for approval or rejection an following that course all question as to the validity of the proposed </seg>

            <seg id="p127">OPINIONS In. answer thereto permit me to say in my opinion: First, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Trade and Commerce, and the Secretary of Public Works are by law (Sections 81-102, 81-103, Compiled Statutes for 1929) the "departmental" and "executive," heads, for the Governor, of the De - partments of Agriculture, Labor and Public Welfare, Trade and Com - merce, and -Public Works respectively, created to aid the Governor in the execution and administration of the laws. (Section 81-101, Compiled Statutes for 1929.) Said Sections 81-101 and 81-102 read as follows: "The civil administration of the laws of the state is hereby vested in the Governor. For the purpose of aiding the Governo.r in the execution and administration of the laws, the executive and administrative work shall be divided into the following departments, to-wit: Department of Agriculture, Department of Labor, Department of Trade and Commerce, Department of Public Welfare nnd Department of Public Works. The secretary of the Department of Labor shall be ex-ofTicio Secretary of the Department of Public Welfare." "The Governor shall appoint executive heads for the various departments. Such officers shall be designated as follows: The Secretary of Agriculture, for the Department of Agriculture. The Secretary of Labor, for the Departments of Labor and Public Welfare. The Secretary of Trade and Commerce, for the Department of Trade and Commerce. The Secretary of Public Works for the Department of Public Works." Second, these Civil Administrative Code ' Departments are not, within the meaning of the Constitution, "Executive Departments" of the state government, comparable in status to the Board of Control, State Normal Board, State Railway Commission, and the various state executive office's but are merely subdivisions and departments of the office of Governor. : ■ Section 81-7001, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929, relating to these departments, reads as follows: "Wherever by this act, any executive authority is vested in, or any duty imposed upon a department, the word 'depart - ment' or the words 'department of finance,' 'department of agriculture,' 'department of labor,' 'department of trade and commerce,' 'department of public welfare* or 'department of </seg>
            <seg id="p128">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL public works ' shall be construed to menn the governor of the state." In the recent case of Eidenmiller v. Stnte, 233 N. W. 447, the Supreme Court of Nebraska said: ■ ' "The Legislature declared the civil administration of the . laws of the state to be vested in the Governor and, 'for the purpose of aiding the Governor in the execution and adminis - tration of the laws ' divided the 'executive and administrative work' into six 'departments of the state government,' " At the time the Administrative Code Law was adopted (1919) the Legislature did not possess the power to create' new executive offices or departments. The state constitution as it existed at that time designated by name the various state executive officers and then specifically provided that "no other executive state office shall be ... created." (Sec. 26, Art. V.)The Code law would therefore be unconstitutional if the various departments set up were, to be considered as independent executive departments and the secretaries executive state officials. The Code law can only be sustained os constitutional upon the assumption that the. secretaries are not executive officers but simply clerks and assistants of the Governor. The right of the Legislature at that to provide by law for the appointment of assistants and deputies to discharge new and additional duties placed upon state executive officers is unquestioned. The law against the establishment of new executive state offices had frequently been gotten around by creating commissions made up of state officers and then authorizing the' appointment of deputies to do the work. Sometimes only the Governor was named Commissioner. While those who carried on the work were in fact perhaps executive heads, they were in legal theory only servants and mouthpieces of some executive state officer or officers. In Merrill v. State, 05 Neb. 509, the rule was reiterated and applied to the then recently created "Food Commission," of which the Governor was named Commissioner. He was given authority, to appoint a" deputy commissioner with fixed salary and duties. The following excerpts from the court's opinion are pertinent: "It is competent for that body (the legislature) to enact all needful and necessary laws for the government and welfare of the people not prohibited by that instrument, and to provide </seg>
            <seg id="p129">OPINIONS especially for the administration and enforcement of such laws by one or more officers of the executive department, and also to provide for such deputies or assistants as seem to be nec - essary for, the discharge of. such additional duties, if such necessity there be. * * * "The legislature may, we apprehend, prescribe what are the duties of a deputy officers as well as the principal." As stated in lams v. Mellnr, 93 Neb. 438, 140 N. W. 784 .following the decision above mentioned: "It became the practice in this state to create executive boards, the members of which were composed of existing- state officials; and, in order to relieve these officers from the onerous additional duties imposed upon them, the several acts provided for the employment of deputies or secretaries to aid in or carry on the administrative details necessitated in the work of the board. These acts have been uniformly upheld." . .From the foregoing, it is apparent that the creation of the several Code departments and the allocating of them to the Governor as an executive officer of this state was a subject altogether proper for legislative determination. We have no serious doubt as to the validty of the Code law from a constitutional standpoint. In 1920 the state constitution was amended to permit the creation of "such other executive departments as may be established by law," and to provide that: "The heads of all executive departments established by law, other than those to be elected as provided herein, shall be appointed by the Governor, with the consent of a majority of all the members elected to the Senate and House of Represen - tatives meeting in joint session, but officers so appointed may be removed by the Governor. Subject to the provisions of this constitution, the heads of the various executive or civil de - partments shall have power to appoint and remove all sub - ordinate employees in their ■ respective departments." (Sec. 1, • Art. IV, Constitution of Nebraska.) The Constitution was further amended to read as follows: "No executive state office other than herein provided shall be created except by a two-thirds majority of all members elected to the Senate and House of Representatives respec - tively." (Sec. 27, Art. IV.) </seg>
            <seg id="p130">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL There was no attempt on the part of the Constitutional Convention . in 1920 by any provision or amendment to mnke the then existing Code departments executive departments, or their heads executive state officers. The provisions for the creati-n of new executive depart - ments must be taken as authority for the future only. The Code law, as it existed at the time of these constitutional changes of 1920, remained unaffected thereby. Furthermore, so far as we have been able to ascertain, the legislature has not attempted to change the status of the Code departments and the heads thereof so as to make them executive state departments or executive' state officers, respec - tively, under the authority of the constitutional amendments of 1920. It is true that independent acts have been passed since 1920 which, define certain powers and duties of particular secretaries of depart - ments. But we would not hesitate to construe such powers and duties as additional or incidental to those already provided for in the Code law and as a supplement to the Code rather than a fundamental change in its status or make-up as an agency or governmental arm of the Governor. Third, the executive head of each of the Code departments (desig - nated in the statutes as "secretary') must be appointed with the advice nnd consent of the State Senate. Section 81-110, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929, reads as follows: "Each secretary of each department created by this act shall be appointed by the governor, by and with the advice and consent of the senate. In any case of. vacancy in such . . offices during the recess of the senate, the governor -shall make a temporary appointment until . the next meeting of the senate, when ' he shall nominate some person to fill such office; and any person so nominated who is confirmed by the senate, shall hold his office during the remainder of the term and until his successor shall be appointed and qualified. If the senate is not in session at the time this act takes effect the governor shall make a temporary appointment as in case ' of a vacancy." Even though these secietaries are only administrative assistants of the Governor, the Legislature unquestionably had the right to make the Senate a party to their appointment. The appointing power is not inherent in the Governor; it does not exist ex officio.— State v. Boucher (N. D.), 5G N. W. 142, 21 L. R. A. 539; United States v. Hartwell, 73 U. S.— 6 Wall. 385, 18 L. ed. 830; State v. Bowden (S. C), 75 S. E. 866, Richardson v. Young (Tenn.), 125 S. W. 664, and 12 C. J. 336. The chief executive has no prerogative powers as in monarchial governments but only such as are vested in him by fundamental law. </seg>
            <seg id="p131">OPINIONS It is a matter of history that the constitutions of the original thirteen states, first adopted, placed most of the appointing power in the Legislature because they feared abuse of that power by the executive which they believed they had suffered under the govern - ment of England. The statute providing for confirmation by the Senate is designed to secure for heads of the various Code departmente persons who possess confidence and approval not only of the Governor but also of the Senate. Fourth, any purported appointment of the head of any of the Code departments is illegal and ineffective if not submitted to and confirmed by the Senate. On this point 46 Corpus Juris, pp. 953, 954, states: "Where the appointment is made as a result of a nomination by one authority and confirmation- by another, the appointment is not complete until the action of all bodies concerned has been had . . .Where there is a failure to confirm on the part of the confirming body, it is the duty of the nominating power to make a new appointment." 22 Ruling Case Law 433 reads as follows: "Wherever under' a constitutional or statutory provision the- appointment is required to be made with the approval of some officer or body, such appointment must be approved before the person is legally entitled to the office. If on the expiration of the term of a public officer, nn appointment of a successor is made by the Governor but.it is not confirmed by the state senate as required by a law of 'this type ouch successor does not obtain the right to enter on the duties of the office but the former incumbent may hold over until a successor is properly appointed and confirmed." Of course, where the former incumbent has resigned and abandoned the office he does not hold over even if new appointee is not confirmed. In such case there is a vacancy in the office. Fifth, the statutory requirement that each Secretary of a Code department shall be appointed "by and with the advice and consent of the Senate" cannot be evaded by gving the person appointed some other title than "Secretary" if such person is in fact made the head of the department and under the direction of the Governor performs the duties and assumes the statutory powers of the Secretary. </seg>
            <seg id="p132">REPORT OF ATTORNKY GENERAL An animal that brays is n donkey notwithstanding that its master may call il a cow. The law regards the subslance, not the formal of things. The &lt;iue&lt;stion is not what such an appointee calls himself but what authority is he attempting to exercise. If a person. is clothed by the Chief Executive with all the authority ■ &gt;f the Secretary of a Code department and assumes to exercise all ul that official's prerogatives, and powers, he is in fact the head of that department and subject to all the laws governing the appointment of the heads of the Code departments. Any other interpretation of the law would make possible utter nullificati n of the statute requiring confirmation by the Senate. The case of Fox v. McDonald (Ala.), 21 L. R. A. 529, illustrates in part this point. The Legislature had created a board of Commission - ers of Police for Birmingham. with power to. certify to the mayor of that city the appointment of a chief of police. The law provided that the board should appoint a chairman and "clerk." Instead a chairman and "secretary" were appointed. The mayor refused to honor the ap - pointment of a chief of jx lice on the ground that the certificate was not executed by the "clerk" of the commission but by some one calling himself "secretary." Said the Court in disposing of this objection: : "It was competent and necessary for the commissioners to organize for systematic work by electing a presiding and clerical officer. They did so by electing a chairman and sec - retary. The act says they must appoint a 'clerk.' This they did by appointing a person charged with the duties of a clerk. That they dcsignaled him by the synonymous title of 'secretary' is wholly immaterial. The. duties of the officer were the same, whether you call him clerk or secretary." Confirmation of the p.DDointment of the actual heads of the various Code departments is required by law regardless of what may be the label pinned on them by the appointing power. Sixth, the Governor, however, apparently cannot be required to appoint a Secretary of any particular department if in his judgment no departmental or executive head of that department is needed. Section 81-108, Compiled Statutes for 1929, provides that the Gover - nor may "discontinue the service of any secretary . . . when, in his judgment, the same is not longer required." This power arbitaraily to end the services of on officer under certain conditions would seem </seg>
            <seg id="p133">OPINIONS to include the authority under the same conditions not have the services commence. To-say that the Governor must appoint some person »s secretary whose services he will discontinue ns soon as the appoint - ment is confirmed is to reouire a useless and meaningless thing. », ,^, Ut L H mUSt be "° ted that Under the Provisions of said Section ? 1-108 the Governor may discontinue the services of a secretary only upon the ground that in his judgment the services of a departmental o.- executive head for that particular department are "not longer re - quired." He may not refuse to appoint a secretary of a department under the implied authority of this section if he proposes to appoint a person under some other name or title to perform the identical duties of such secretary. For then it cruld not be said that the services of a secretary were "not longer reuuired." This section appears to be applicable, either where there are no services for the head of a department to perform, or where the Governor believes he can and wishes to perform the duties of the secretary himself. The various departments were created and appoint - ments of secretaries authorized for the purpose of aiding the Governor in administering the laws of the state. The secretary of any such department acts for and in the name of the Governor. This section seems to give the chief executive authority at any time to take over personally the work of any one of his employees, including secretaries of the Code departments, whenever in his judgment the services of such employees are no longer required. Neither the Legis - lature nor the courts coiUd pass on the soundness of the judgement used in discontinuing the services of any particular appointee. Whether or not any appointments made by the present Governor come within the scope of this opinion is a question of fact which I do not decide. I have given here only my interpretation of the law gov - erning your questions without determining whether or not they are moot or relate to an actual situation. Respectfully submitted, C. A.

            <seg id="p134">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ■■■.'■ ■ . ■ f TRIAL BY JURY— CONSTITUTIONAL POWER OF LEGISLATURE TO ENACT LAW PERMITTING VERDICT BY LESS NUMBER THAN ALL OF JURORS IN CRIMINAL CASES January 16, 1931. Honorable John S. Bishop. House of Representatives, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Bishop: You inquire if the Legislature has authority to provide that in criminal cases a verdict may be rendered by a less number than all of the jurors. We doubt if the Legislature ht&gt;s any such authority. Section 6 of Article I of the State Constitution reads as follows: "The right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate, but the Legislature may authorize trial by a jury of a less number than twelve in courts inferior to. the district court, and may by general law authorize a verdict in civil cases in any court by not less than five-sixth of the jury.'' 35 C. J. Page 234,- reads ns follows: "It is an essential attribute of a valid jury that the members constituting the jury shall be unanimous in the verdict ren - dered, and any juror may dissent from a verdict to which .he has previously agreed at any time before it is- recorded, whether the verdict is written or oral or whether the jury is polled or not. It follows that any legislation authorizing a verdict by less than the whole nulber of jurors in any case where a jury trial is a matter of right is unconstitutional, unless such legis - lation is expressly authorized by constitutional provision." The reason why such an act of the Legislature would be unconsti - tutional is because the courts have repeatedly held that the worlds "trial by jury" were used by the framers of the Constitution of Nebraska in its common-law sense and at common-law a verdict by less than the full number of jurors could not be received. 16 R. C. L. 221, reads as follows: "The essentials of a jury at common law are that it should </seg>
            <seg id="p135">OPINIONS be composed of twelve men, that they should be impartial, and that their verdict should be unanimous." In connection with this question it should also be said that the constitutional right to a trial by jury of twelve men and a unanimous verdict applies. only to cases in which that, prerogative existed at common law or was secured by statute at the time the State Constitu - tion was adopted. It does not apply to crimes which did not exist at common law or which had not been defined by statute at the time of the adoption of the constitution. So, for example, the legislature has the authority to provide that persons found guilty of transporting intoxicating liquor may be tried without a jury, or if by a jury, that the verdict need not be unanimous because transporting intoxicating liquor was not a crime at common law and was not a crime under the statutes of our state at the time that our State Constitution was adopted.

Bryan, Governor of the State of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska. . Dear Sir: - We are in receipt of your letter of June 19th in which you ask: "One: May a Nebraska corporation legally own and hold stock in a going Nebraska State Bank corporation? "Two: May a foreign or out of state corporation legaUy hold or own stock in a going Nebraska State Bank corporation?" In the absence of a specific statute authorizing corporations organ - ized under the law of Nebraska to own, hold and vote stock in state bank corporations chartered by the State of Nebraska, we are of the opinion that neither domestic corporations nor foreign corporation* may hold and vote stock in Nebraska banks. </seg>
            <seg id="p136">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL For detailed discussion of this question we refer you to our opinion to E. H. Luikart. parties 192, 196, Report of Attorney General of Nebraska for Biennium of 1929-193J. Section 24-201, C. S. for 1929, declares that "any number of persons may be associated and incorporated for the transaction of any lawful business." We are inclined to believe that the word "person" as used in said section does not include corporations. Words and Phrases, First Series, Volume 6, page !&gt;329, reads as follows: "The word 'person,' as used in acts relating to the formation of corporations, has been held not to include the word 'corpor - ation." See Factors' &amp; Traders' Ins. Co. v. New Harbor Pro - tection Co., 37 La. Ann. 233. 238; Denny Hotel Co. v. Schram, 32 Pac. 1002, 1003, 6 Wash. 134, 36 Am. Rep. 130." In Nebraska Shirt Company vs. Horton, 3 Neb. (unof.) 888, 93 N. W. 225, the Supreme Court of Nebraska held that "unless authorized by statute a corporation has no power to subscribe to the capitol stock of another corporation." In Bank of Commerce vs: Hart; 37 Neb. 197, 55 N. W. 631, the Supreme Court of Nebraska held that a "banking cor - poration organized under the laws of this state, has no power to become a stockholder in an insurance company." . :. '.• ■ The State Constitution seems to contemplate that stockholders iu banking corporations should be natural persons. Section 7 of Article 12, reads in part as follows: "Every stockholder in a banking corporation or institution shall be individually responsible and liable to its creditors over and above the amount of stock by him held to an amount equal to his respective stock or shares so held, for all its liabilities accruing while he remains such stockholder ." It is obvious that if a private corporation may own and vote stock in a state banking corporation,- then the double liability provision of the Constitution could easily be avoided by the formation of a dummy corporation. Stockholders in any existing bank could organize a corporation and transfer their shares of stock to it. Such a corpor - ation might only have ten dollars in paid-up capital stock even though it owned and voted a hundred thousand dollars of bank stock. Bank - ing is a quasi-public business. Upon the stockholders the law has imposed peculiar and heavy responsibilities. We do not believe that it was the intention of the Legislature to authorize private corporations to become stockholders in state banks. </seg>
            <seg id="p137">: OPINIONS The other question as to whether a foreign corporation may own and vote stock in a Nebraska State Bank is not so hard to answer bection 1 of Article 12 of the State Constitution reads in part as follows: ■ "Foreign corpornlions transacting or seeking to transact . business in this state shall be subject, under general law, to regulation, supervision and general control, and shall not be given greater rights or privileges than are given domestic cor - porations of a similar character." If under the laws of our state . a domestic corporation may not own and vote stock in a state bank, then it would be an act of special Drivilesje and a greater right to allow foreign corporations to exercise that right. While there may be some doubt as to what the courts may say r-J k t" d l l thiS QUestion is Presented for adjudication, we have no ■ doubt but that the Department of Trade and Commerce may by rule and regulation forbid owning and voting of stock in Nebraska state banks by other than natural persons.

SCHOOL DISTRICT VALIDITY OF WARRANT ISSUED FOR CURRENT EXPENSES WHEN NO FUNDS IN TREASURY . —VALIDITY OF SUCH WARRANT TO ERECT OR REPAIR SCHOOL BUILDING December 22, 1931. Hon. Charles W. Bryan, Governor of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska. . - Dear Sir: You submit to this department for answer a letter received by you from Honorable George W. Woods, Bank Commissioner, in which he makes a statement of facts and asks questions thereon as follows: "1. School District No. 1 has insufficient cash funds in its treasury to pay wages, salaries and other items of current operating expenses. The board makes an estimate of such ex- </seg>
            <seg id="p138">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL penses for one month or more and then issues 'a warrant for the estimated amount directly to a l~cal bank which buys the warrant, sets up a credit in the name of the treasurer of the District, who then draws checks on this amount in payment of bills for which otherwise regular registered warrants would have been issued. IS A WARRANT THUS ISSUED AND NEGO - TIATED TO A BANK ENFORCEABLE AGAINST THE DIS- . TRICT IN THE EVENT ITS LEGALITY BE CHALLENGED BY A TAX PAYER IN THE' COURTS? 2. School District No. 2 negotiates a warrant directly to a bank for. credit in order to make repairs on school building . or to erect a new building without submitting a bond issue to the voters of the district for their approval. ASSUMING THAT THERE BE NO FRAUD AND THAT THE SCHOOL BOARD ACTS IN GOOD FAITH, CAN A WARRANT THUS ISSUED BE ENFORCED AGAINST THE DISTRICT OVER THE LEGAL PROTEST OF A TAX PAYER?" I find no provision of statute which in express terms either author- . izes or condemns the issue of school district warrants in the manner above set out. 79-2523 as amended by Chapter 143 Session Laws of 1931 does provide among other things that "School districts, containing cities of 1,000 or more inhab - itants, may borrow money to the amount of 70% of the unex - pended balance of the current existing levy, and may execute and deliver in evidence thereof their promissory notes which they are hereby authorized and empowered to make and nego - tiate, bearing a rate of interest not exceeding 6% per annum, and maturing not more than one year from the date thereof. Such notes, before they are negotiated, shall be presented to the treasurer of the school district and registered by him, and shall be payable out of the funds collected upon the levy in the order of their registry after the payment of prior registered warrants, but prior to the payment of any warrant subsequently registered: Provided, that, if both warrants and notes are registered, the total of such registered notes and warrants shall not exceed 100% of the unexpended balance of the current existing levy." Aside from the provision of statute above quoted I find no provision of statute which even by implication authorizes a school board to borrow money on behalf of a school district unless it is authorized </seg>
            <seg id="p139">OPINIONS so to do by a vote of the electors of the district. The issue of the school . warrants in question,, is, I taVe it, in effect a borrowing of money for and on behalf of the district and I assume that in neither case was the issue authorized by a vole of the electors. If this assumption is correct, I am of the opinion that, the issue of the warrant in each instance is irregular. I am of the opinion, however, that the payment of the warrant in the first case mentioned by Mr. Woods will not be enjoined after it has been negotiated and pt-yment therefor has been received from the bank. The money received is used in ppying current school expenses and the Supreme Court held in the case of State v. Gardner, 79, Neb 101, that "There is no restriction in the school law upon the power of school district officers to issue warrants in payment of teachers' wages nnd current expenses payable out of the general fund, and warrants issued for a liability of this nature incurred during the previous years may be paid out of funds derived from taxes levied and collected during the current years." The Supreme Court also held in the case of Lincoln Land Company v. Village of Grant, 57 Neb. 70, that "Where a municiprl corporation receives and retains sub - stantial benefits under a contract which it was authorized to make, but which was void because irregularly executed, it is liable in an action brought to recover the reasonable value of the benefits received." Similar rulings were made in the ense of Cathers v. Moores, 78 Neb. 17, Rogers v. City of Omaha, 76 Neb. 187 and Neb. Bitulithic Co. v. City of Omaha, 84 Neb. 375. The correct answer to the second question is not so clear but even in that case if the warrant is issued in good faith and the bank pays a fair consideration for the same I doubt whether the school dis - trict can receive and retain the consideration and successfully defend against paying the warrant or rendering its equivalent. It is to be borne in mind, however, that n school wnrrant is not a negotiable instrument and anyone who accepts such and instrument takes it subject to any valid defense the school district may have.

            <seg id="p140">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL BANKS RECEIVERS OF FAILED STATE BANKS-AUTHORITY OF GOVERNOR OVER July 10, 1931. Hon. Clarence G. Bliss, ■ •"• ' . Receiver of Various Failed State Banks, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Your letter of July 7th at hand in which you say: "You are probably aware through press reports of the controversy which has arisen relative to my position as receiver of approximately 200 state. banks. I have been informed by Hon. Charles W. Bryan, governor, that I am not to have access to the records of these receiverships and that I nm not to exercise further control or authority over the assets of these banks. "I wish to call your attention to the fact that I have been appointed by the various district courts in this state as receiver of approximately 200 banks and I have qualified as such by taking the oath of office and (jiving bonds in each case which aggregate the approximate sum of two million dollars, and that I have heretofore had comnlele charge and legal possession of all of the assets and records of all of said bank receiverships subject to the order of the courts appointing me. "During the last six months the governor has; without my consent, discharged many experienced and trusted employees, replacing them with his political friends. He has undertaken to replace local attorneys who were handling pending litigation with attorneys from the other end of the state. His appointees have been forced upon us even though we had no work for them to do, and I have been reliably informed that shortly after the first of July he expected to put a further large number of his political friends on the payroll of' my receiverships and that many of these people were already in the city. "In view of the position taken- by the governor, I wish to ask your opinion on the following subjects: "1. As receiver of these banks, am I entitled to the full control and supervision of the books and records of these banks, nnd does the governor have authority to dispossess me of these records? . - </seg>
            <seg id="p141">OPINIONS "2 The governor has advised me that I am a nominal receiver and thnt he has the authority to select all attorneys and assistants doing work for my receiver - ships, together with such other help ■as he ■ sees fit. I wish to inquire, if I permit and consent to appointees of the governor to carry on the work of- these receiver - ships and if loss should result to the depositors by reason of said npp&lt; intecs' careless and negligent per - formance of said work, would I be liable under the bonds which I have given?" In answer thereto permit us to say in our opinion, That as receiver of any hank you are entitled to such control and supervision of the books and records of the bank as is necessary for you to perform your duties ns receiver. The order of the court appoint - ing you receiver specifically directed you to take charge and be responsible for all the records, books and assets of the failed bank. You have no authority to turn over to any other persons such records or assets without an order of the court appointing you. You cannot go wrong if you will always remember that you are a servant and employee of the court in which the receivership pro - ceedings are pending. In the recent case of State, ex rel Sorensen v. Thurston State Bank, decided June 19, 1931, the Supreme Court of Nebraska in an opinion by Chief Justice Goss referred to George I. Parker, Receiver of this failed state bank as: "an arm of the court." In Re Estate of Graff, 86 Neb. 535, 125 N. W. 1091, the Supreme Court of Nebraska said, speaking of the appointment of a successor to the first receiver appointed: "If the original order appointing receiver was valid, the property and assets of the Chnmberlin Banking House were under the control of the district court." The case of Carlon v. City Savings Bank, 91 Neb. 790, 137 N. W. 852, was a suit for personal injuries against defendant bank in receivership, the receiver being charged with repairs and collection of rents. The court said: "The district court therefore not only directed the receiver to collect the rents but directed him how to apply them. In collecting and in distributing them, he acted under the orders </seg>
            <seg id="p142">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL of the court. As agent he was not under the direction of the defendant (the bank). He learned his duties from the court, and not from defendant as his principal. In referring to. the status of a receiver, the Supreme Court of the United States in Booth v. Clark, 17 How. (U. S!) 322, 331, said: 'He is an officer of the court; his appointment is provisional. He is appointed in behalf of all parties, and not of the complainant or of the the defendant only. He 1 is appointed for the benefit of all parties who may establish rights in the cause. The money in his hands is in custodia lcgis for whoever can make out a title to it.' Atlantic Trust Co. v. Chppman 208 U. S. 361, 371. The law is the same in this state; Vila v. Grand Island E. L. &amp; C. S. Co., 68 Neb. 233, 239." . The state of Iowa has a statute similar to that of Nebraska. It provides that the superintendent of banking ' shall be the sole and only receiver for failed stale banks. In the. case of Andrew v. Bevington Savings Bank, 221 N. W. 668, The Supreme Court of Iowa held this statute to be prospective and not retroactive in operation and that, "receiver appointed for insolvent bank under laws in force at time of his appointment, held not ousted ipso facto" by the statute making the state superintendent of banking receiver. South Dakota also had a similar law. In the recent case of In Re State Bank of Manchester, 206 N: W. 231, the Supreme Court of South Dakota said: . "The Superintendent of Banks must administer affairs of insolvent bank through court and subject to his orders." The rule in Nebraska was laid down many years ago in the case of State v. Bank of Hemingford, 58, Neb. 818, 80 N. W. 50, in the following language of the Supreme Court-: "The receiver is' at all times an officer of the court, subject to its orders and directions, -and agent, the scope of whose authority is limited by law." You also inquire if you are liable on your bond if the employees selected for you by the chief executive should waste and dissipate the assets for any of the banks in your charge as receiver. Without question you would, be liable. The court, not the Governor, appointed you receiver. You are under bond, he is not. He cannot be held responsible for any of your acts as receiver. All the acts of youi employees in connection with the handling of the assets are your </seg>

BOARD OF CONTROL-CUSTODY OF CHILD-NECESSITY OF NOTICE TO AND PRESENCE OF PARENTS WHEN CHILD ADOPTED July 22, 1931. Honorable H. S. Thorpe, Chairman Board of Control, Lincoln, Nebraska. ■ Dear Sir: You say: "We would like an. opinion from your office as to whether </seg>
            <seg id="p144">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL or not a Ounty Judge may insist upon the presence or notifi- , • cation of the parents of a minor child when such child has been taken away from said parents by a court, and awarded . to the Board of Control, who having' found suitable foster - parents for the child, applies to a County Court for adoption paper for the foster parents." The correct answer to your question is not entirely free from, doubt. ' ' 43-107 provides among other things that: "in the event that the parents or either of them reside within the state, and personal service can be had upon them, such service shall in all such cases, be had. upon such parent or parents." This section of statute was passed in 1897. This was fourteen years before the act was passed which made the Board of Control the legal guardii-n of all children in the custody of the State School for Dependent Children and gave its agent acting under instructions of the board power to consent to the adoption of such children as have been committed to it by any court acting under the provisions of the juvenile court law. It may be the. courts will hold that this later enactment supersedes and does away with the prior enactment that the parents should be notified of pending proceedings for adoption in so far as the adoption of children who have been taken away from their parents and awarded to the custody of the Board of Control, is concerned, but it is not entirely clear that it will do so in all instances. The Supreme Court of Wisconsin held (three judges dissenting) in the case of Lacher v. Venus, 188, N W 613, that "The judicial proceedings for adoption under St. 1921, c. 173, are entirely distinct, separate, and independent from 'those for the commitment of dependent children to the care of the state under chapter 48." "Unless there is an abandonment of the child by its natural parents, and such abandonment be found by the court, the written consent of, or actual notice to, the parents is essential . to the jurisdiction of the county court to make a lawful order . of adoption for such child, and thereby deprive the parents of </seg>
            <seg id="p145">OPINIONS their natural right to the child; such notice or consent being expressly required by St. 1921 Par. 4022 et seq., and being essential even in the absence of statutory requirements." "Notice to, and participation by, the natural parents in proceeding for the commitment of the child to the state school as a dependent cannot be substituted for the written consent or actual notice to the parents required for valid adoption proceedings, since there is no element of consent by the parents in their appearance in the commitment proceedings to the institution at some other time and place in some other court of adoption proceedings in which the status of the family relationship may be permanently and entirely changed." "The written consent of the state board of control or of any guardian cannot be declared to be a legal and sufficient substitute for the written consent of the living natural parents, where required in adoption proceedings." "The right of the natural parents to the custody and com - panionship of their children is a right of substance, though based on sentiment." "The fact that it may interfere with the adoption of chil - dren committed to the state home to require notice of pro - ceednigs for such adoption to be given to the natural parents of the child, and thereby injuriously affect the welfare of the child by preventing its transfer to a good home, does not justify the disregard of constitutional guaranties by permitting the parents to be deprived of their rights to such children without notice." In that case the child whose adoption was being considered was committed to the Board of Control along with other children of her family for the reason that she was without care, her parents being unable to care for her. There was no finding that they had wilfullv abandoned her. . " In cases where the parents have been notified of the pendency of commitment proceedings and there is a specific finding of the court that they have abandoned their child made in the commitment proceed - ings, I am of the opinion that further notice in adoption proceedings is unnecessary. ; • Unless there is such a finding made in the commitment proceedings I am of the opinion it will be prudent to have notice of proposed </seg>

Dear Mr. Bass: You inquire if a mortgage on an oil station takes precedence over gasoline tax due you. In our opinion it dues. The law does not make the gasoline tax a lien on the real or personal property of the person or corporation operating the gasoline station. Section 66-407, C. S. for 1929, provides that a civil suit may be .brought for the recovery of the tax. Section 66-410, makes it a crime to fail to pay the tax and provides punishment of any person found guilty of failure to pay the tax. Sincerely yours, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General. CORPORATION,— NON-PAYMENT OF OCCUPATION TAXES AS DISSOLUTION OF . August 10, 1931. Hon. Frank Marsh, Secretary of State, Lincoln, Nebraska. Bear Sir: This is in answer to your letter of August 4, 1931, in which you state and inquire: </seg>
            <seg id="p147">OPINIONS "A domestic corporation which has made no reports or paid no taxes for a long period of years and marked dissolved for non-payment of taxes on our records as provided by Section 24-1722 C. S. 1929, but no legal action ever taken by the Attorney General to dissolve the corporation.. "This corporation desires to make ■ reports and pay back taxes up to date and reinstate. In your opinion does the marking of the records in this office that the corporation is dissolved for non-payment of taxes without any other legal action, constitute a valid dissolution, or does it merely" suspend the corporation and giving it the privilege of reinstating by paying up back taxes, after it is marked dissolved." Sections 24-1717 and 24-1722 are concurrent and cumulative pro - visions of the same law for enforcing the payment of occupation taxes by corporations. Section 24-1717 provides for judicial dissolution or annulment of corporations, at the suit of the attorney general and on request of the secretary of state, for wilful and intentional default in such corporation's occupation tax obligations. Section 24-1722 provides for the automatic dissolution of corporations by the secretary of state upon failure to pay delinquent occupation taxes after ninety days' notice so to do.' Reading the two sections of the same law together as it seems that we must, we are of the opinion that the legislature intended an absolute forfeiture of corporate status only upon judicial determination of willful rind intentional default in payment of occupation taxes. Accordingly, the automatic dissolution by the secretary of state operates, in our judgement, as r decree nisi. It is a dissolution unless the corporation so dissolved cames in, pays up .its back taxes and penalties and reinstates. Such action is, of couise, quite conclusive evidence that the corporation's delinquency is not willful and intentional. A dissolution by judicial action or court decree is, of course, final and thereafter there is no such corporation which can be re-instated. This construction, of course, proceeds upon the principle that the law abhors forfeitures, and statutes should be construed to prevent forfeitures, if possible. Sincerely yours, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General, By CLIFFORD L. REIN, Assistant Attorney General. ' </seg>

            <seg id="p151">OFINIONS ■ • ■ ■ ' It seems to us that there can be only one answer. The AKSARBEN society is not a state department, agency or institution. Any appro - priation for that organization is a gift which the Legislature is iindei no obligation. to make and which bears no relationship to the-function - ing of our slate government under the laws and Constitution of the State. The wording of the call by the Chief Executive has tied the hands of the Legislature as to the proposed appropriation. ■ Respectfully submitted, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General. LEGISLATURE— APPROPRIATIONS— EFFECT OF THREE-FIFTHS VOTE ON VETO POWER OF GOVERNOR June 15, 1931. Hon. Tremore Cone, Member of the House of Representatives. State House, Lincoln, Nebraska. ■ ' ' ' Dear Sir: You ask for a construction of the provisions of Section 7 Article IV of the Constitution, that, ■ , ■ ' "No appropriations shall be made in excess of the recom - mendation contained in such budget unless by three-fifths vote of each house of the legislature and such excess so approved by a three-fifths vote shall not be subject to veto by the Governor." As applied to amendments placed in an appropriation bill upon the recommendation of a conference committee, in answer to your question I will say that, in my opinion, the bill, as finally- amended should be passed by a three-fifths vote and if so passed, so far as the items that are properly classed as budget items are concerned, it is not subject to veto by the Governor. In the case of Elmen v. State Board of Equalization and Assessment reported in 231 N. \V. at Pace 772 thereof, it is said: "Legislative appropriations in excess of recommendations contained in Governor's budget message, made by three-fifths </seg>

SORENSEN, Attorney General, By GEORGE W. AYRES, Assistant Attorney General. LEGISLATURE -APPROPRIATIONS, EFFECT OF BUDGET- - POWERS AND DUTIfcS OF GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE REGARDING June 11, 1931. To the State Senate: In answer to your inquiries of June 9, 1931. permit me to say: Section 7 of Article IV of the Constitution of Nebraska reads in part as follows: "At the commencement of each regular session (the Governor) shall present, by message, a complete itemized budget of the financial requirements' of all departments, insti - tutions and agencies of the state for the ensuing biennium. * * * No appropriations shall be made in excess of the recommendation contained in said budget unless by three-fifths vote of each House of the Legislature, and such excess so approved by a thrae-fifths vote shall not be subject to veto by the Governor." The chief executive is therefore charged with the responsibility of preparing and submitting to the Legislature his best judgment of the financial needs of the various departments, agencies and insti - tutions of the state for the two years beginning July 1, 1931. The making of the budget is a matter in which the Legislature has no part in the first instance. The theory of the executive budget system is that the Governor as head of various executive departments is in a better position to know than any legislative committee the financial requirements of the expending agencies of the state. The Governor formulates a plan but the final approval, modification, or rejection of the plan is left to the Legislature. When the Governor presents his budget the Legislature may do one of four things as to each item: </seg>
            <seg id="p153">OPINIONS 1. Approve. 2. Reduce. 3. Strike out. 4. Increase. • Only a majority vote of both houses is necessary to approve, reduce, or strike out. To increase takes a three-fifths vote. In other words the Governor's budget recommendation is equi\alent to a block of one-tenth of the votes in each house, that is the difference between a majority and a three-fifths vote. Stated another way it may be said that when the Governor sub - mits his recommendations as to appropriations he thereby vetoes In advance all increases in appropriations above the amounts recommended in his budget, and it takes a three-fifths vote of both houses to override that veto. The action of the Governor may be called an anticipatory veto of all increases above the amounts set out in his budget. Since ns to any budget item the Governor has vetoed any increase in advance, he has no power to later veto any excess made by the Legislature if passed by a three-fifths vote of both houses. Elmen v. State Board of Equalization and Assessment, (Neb.), 231 N. W. 772. It should also be said that the failure of the Governor to recommend to the Legislature the making of an appropriation requested by any department, institution, or agency of the state is a veto of the requested appropriation, and any such requested appropriation omitted fom the budget : by the Governor can only be made by a thee-fifths vote of both houses. But, having passed both houses by such a vote, the appropriation is beyond the veto power of the Governor. It needs to be remembered nlso that the Governor's power to veto in advance requested appropriations applies only to appropriations for the "departments, institutions and agencies of the state." It docs not take a three-fifths vote to pass appropriations that do not come within the scope of that language. If the Governor inserts in his so - called budget message an item which has no connection with the financial requirements of any department, institution or agency of the state, then the Legislature may increase that item by a bare majority vote of each house. The power of the Governor is strictly construed In this matter and the insertion of a non-budget item in the so-called budget of the Governor does not in fact make it a part of the legal budget. Such budget item, however, would of course be subject to the veto of the Governor after passage by the Legislature. In Elmen v. State Board of Equalization and Assessment, supra, the Supreme Court of Nebraska said on this subject: </seg>
            <seg id="p154">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "The amendment of section' 7, art. 4 of the Constitution of Nebraska, which we have heretofore discussed and inter - preted, is limited hy its express tern"S in its application to 'the financial requirements of .-11 departments, institutions and agencies of the state.' It is manifest that there are certain appropriations that nre not within but- outside of the limitations thus expressed. As to. the appropriations made pursuant to the budget and pnssed, but which have bren amended by the legislature so as to exceed the recommendations contained in the budget messngc and such excess approved by three-fifths vote, this ammendnient provides that such appropriations 'shall " not be subject to veto by the governor.' " We come now to your suecific questions. Your first question is: "Dres the Governor have a legal right to submit a sup - nlementary budget after the fifteen days mentioned in said Section 81-302 and if so by what authority?" Section 81-302, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929, reads as follows: "Provided, however, 'hat in case- of a change of admin- ' ist ration, the outgoing governor shall deliver the budget to the legislature previous to the close of his. term, and the incoming governor shall have fifteen days in which to review the budget as prepared and delivered by his predecessor and may send to the legislature a supplementary budget message making sug - gestions of any changes which he deems wise, and the consti - tutional requirement for a three-fifths vote to increase the items and recommendations contained in the budget shall relate to the supplementary mess'age of the governor." We, however, are of the opinion that notwithstanding this statute the Governor has a legal right to. submit a supplemental budget after the expiration of said, fifteen days if done within a reasonable time and prior to a vote by either house on any bill containing appro - priations for any state department, institution, or agency. This fifteen-day requirement is not in the Constitution; it is an net of the Legislature. The Legislature would be without power to unduly restrict the authority and duty of the Governoi in the submission of his budget. We are of the opinion that the provision as to time is directory and not mandatory. .The United States Supreme Court in French v. Edwards, 80, V. S. 511, 20, L. Ed. 702, held that the term "mandatory" does not "apply to statutory requirements intended for </seg>

            <seg id="p156">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ■ ' ■ power of coursa is suhject. to great abuse. Ful the authorities on the subject advocate such right on the part of tie executive in ordor to meet conditions thnt could not be anticipated. A supplemental budget may be necessary on the recount of laws requiring the expenditure of money enacted after the transmission of the original budget. The executive in transmitting the budget may have been grossly misin - formed as to the financial needs of the institution and wish to supple - ment his budget in order to prevent finanrinl injury to a 6tate insti - tution. Fire might burn drwn a state building arid obviously make necessary a change in the appropriation for an institution. To not hrld that the Governor could submit a supplemental budget after the expiration of the fifteen davs could lead to absurd situations. To illustrate: Assume that the Board of Regents requested an appro - priation of SIOO.OOO.OO for an additional building on the Agricultural College campus but that the Governor, in his original budget message to the Legislature disallowed the item. Suppose then that some time later but before the action on the hudget, one of the main buildings, on the campus is destroyed by fire. If the Governor could not by message to the Legislature change this originpl budget so .as to recom - mend an appropriation of 100,000.01) for a new building, then no ap - propriation for such a building could be made by the Legislative if forty-one votes in '.he U&lt; use were opposed. In other words, even though the Governor and three-fifths of the members of the Hou«e minus one. and three fifths of the members of the Senate minus one ■ favored such an appropriation they would be powerless to act. We do not believe that the Constitution intended to make possible such a situation. Furthermore, suppese'that the Governor during his first month in office is sick and unable to perform the duties of his office. Would anyone say that he then had no authority to submit the budget later, if done before the Legislature zcted on the requests of the various institutions and departments for appropriations? Your question No. 2 reads as follows: "If the Governor has a legal right to submit a supple - mentary budget after the fifteen days mentioned in said Section 81-302 would he have the right to disregard the time fixed in said section for submitting a supplementary budget and submit it at any time during the legislative session to suit his own convenience?" • •.

In this instnnce the Governor has submitted a supplemental budget prior to the introduction of any appropriation bill. It therefore is not necessary to express an opinion as to how much l-.nger he might wstt before taking such action. We recognize that this power could be abused, but the remedy might be pditical rather than legal. Your question No. 3 reads as follows: "Does the Governor have a legrJ.right to submit a budget at the special session convened today and if so by what authority?" -- Our answer is contained in the answers to the foregoing questions. Your question No. '4 reads as follows: "What budget or budgets are legally before the legislature and should be considered by it in passing appropriation bills?" From an examination of the message of the Governor to this special session and the budget transmitted to the Legislature, we are of the opinion that although designated as a "supplementary budget" it is in fact a substitute budget transmitted to the Legislature in January, 1931. This new budget submitted to this special session is therefore the only one that should be considered in passing appropriation bills. Whether or not nn appropriation requires a three-fifths majority of each house will be governed by whether or not it is in excess of the recommendations in this last budget submitted. Your question No. 5 reads as follows: "If any items In the original supplementary budget sub - mitted within the fifteen day period provided in said Section 81-302 are omitted from any supplementary budgets later submitted can such items be restored in the appropriation bills by a majority vote of each house of the legislature and not be subject to veto by the Governor?" • "■ We have answered this question above in referring to the standing of items, omitted from the budget. The omission of a budget item is a veto in advance, by the Governor of any appropriation for such an item and if an appropriation is made at all for such an item it must be made by a three-fifths vote of both houses, assuming of course that the requested appropriation is for a state department, institution, or agency. If it is not, then it may be passed by a bare majority vote </seg>
            <seg id="p158">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL of both houses even though the item was in the original budget of the Governor. Being a non-budget item it hcd no place in the Governors budget. But of course such an item not coming witl in the constitutional limitation as to budget items will be subject to veto by the Governor regardless of the vote by which it passed both houses. Your question No. 6 rends as. follows: "Ift new items are added to the appropriation bill by a three-fifths vote of each house of the legislature, are such new items subject to the veto of the Governor?" Our answer to No. 5 is an answer to this question. If the new items added to the appropriation bill are for the maintenance or up-k'tep of any state department, institution, or agency, then if passed by a three-fifths vote it is not in our opinion subject, to veto by the Governor. By omitting that item from his budget the Governor ex - ercised his veto power in advance. But if the item is non-budget in character, that is if it is not for the support of any state department, institution, or agency, then it only needs a bare majority of both houses to pass, but may be vetoed by the Governor even if passed by both houses by a three-fifths majority. The power of the Governor to veto items in appropriation bills which are non-budgetary in char - acter, is provided in Section 15 of Article 4, of the State Constitution which reads in part as follows: "The Governor may disapprove any item or items Of ap - propriation contained- in bills passed by' the Legislature, and the item or items so disapproved shall be stricken therefrom, unless repassed in the manner herein prescribed in cases herein prescribed in cases of disapproval' of bills." The Supreme Court of Nebraska in the Elmen case held that this provision of the Constitution governed non-budget items but not items properly in the budget message of the Governor. I call your attention, however, to the- call of the Governor for this special session. It reads as follows: "Passing the appropriation bills necessary to provide finan- . cial means to enable the state government to function during ihe biennium of 1931-1933." Section 8 of Article IV of the State Constitution reads as follows: "The Governor may, on e.xtiaordinary occasions, convene </seg>

" Dear Mr. Jones: You inquire if under the call of the Governor for a special session the Legislature may appropriate money to pay the claim of Scotts Bluff County for bridges built some years ago. We entertain serious doubts on the question. The proclamation of the Governor calling the special session confines the Legislature U. the following: • "Pasing the appropriation bills necessary to provide finan - cial means to enable the state government to function during the biennium of 1931-1933." I fear that the courts would not hold that an appropriation to pay a debt of the state to Scotts Bluff County was an appropriation "nec - essary to provide financial means to enable the state government to function during the biennium of 1931-1933." • I regret to have to come to this conclusion.

            <seg id="p160">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ■ MISSOURI RIVER VALIDITY OF EXEMPTING FROM LAW FORBIDDING USE OF FISH TRAPS April 17, 1931. Hon. M. J. Clashing. House of Representatives, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Mr. dishing: With reference to youi inquiry the legal question is whether or not the proposed law exempting the Missouri River (except for a certain number of feet on both sides of the mouths of streams entering that river) from the operation of the general law against the use of fish traps and seines is arbitrary and constitutes a classification of the sti earns of the state not based on c'ifTerent conditions. In other words, can it be fairly shown that the reason for prohibiting the use of seines arid fish traps generally in the stale is not applicable to the Missouri River as exempted? Does the discrimination between the Missouri River and the other rivers of the state bear any relation to the purpose of the law which 13 to preserve fish? .•■••■' The answer to your question is therefore not so much a mutter of law as of fact. The general law is clear but there probably is not an agreement as to the facts. 26 C. J. 625 reads in part as follows: "The legislative regulations or restrictions of fishery rights must of course come within such tin itations as have been im - posed by the federal and state constitutions, but the courts should not, by a narrow construction of constitutional provi - sions, destroy such statutory regulations. The regulations must not be such as will infringe vested rights,,deprive a person of his property without due process &lt;f law, grant special privileges, or interfere with the powers of congress to regulate commerce, or to dispose of the public domain. A statute which regulates or restricts fishing rights in particular waters or particular por - tions of the state and which applies equally to all persons who may avnil themselves of such rights, is_ not a violation of the' constitutional provision against denying to nny person the equal protection of the laws." Some years ago Michigan passed a law prohibiting fishing with nets "in any of the waters of this state except Lakes Michigan, Superior, </seg>
            <seg id="p161">OPINIONS Huron, and Erie and the bays nnd harbors connected with said lakes " In People vs. Neal, 106 N.' W. 857, a prosecution under that law was sustained. However, no direct attack was made on the constitution - ality of the statute. Other states have sustained the proposition that a state may exempt certain waters from the operation of its fish laws. See 26 C. J. 626 pnd casses cited in Note No. 18. See also Sherrill vs. State, 64 Ark. 470, 106 S. W. 967. But such discrimination between rivers must bear proper and reasonable relation to the subject matter of the law. In the case of Jonesboro vs. Adams 174 S. W. 527, the Supreme Court of Arkansas declared unconstitutional n law which exempted four townships in that state embracing a large body of water, known as Big Lake, from the general statute regulating the shooting of geese and ducks :ind their shipment as conferring on that territory special privileges. Said the court: "All citizens of the state have equal rights to enjoy the privileges of hunting and fishing, and no citizen or class of citizens can be granted a privilege which does not belong equally to all citizens . . ." "The Legislature may preserve game and fish, and may select territory where preservation is found necessary and pre - . scribe regulations there which are not imposed elsewhere, without violating Const. Art. 2, Sec. 78, prohibiting the grant - ing to any citizen or class of citizens special privileges or im - munities, though some citizens may, by reason of inconvenience, be excluded from the enjoyment of the privilege of hunting and fishing in the territory excluded from regulatory provisions; but the only justification for any regulation is the necessity for the preservation of game and fish, and any unjustifiable regula - tion or exclusion in a given territory is obnoxious to the Con - stitution, where it results in denial to one class of citizens of the privilege of hunting and fishing on equal terms with all others." ■ ■ .

The Legislature should only appropriate money for the payment of salaries of state officers holding offices created by the Constitution or the laws of the state. The officers enumerated having no existence in law, any appropriation for them would be a nullity. If, however, the Legislature intends to create such offices then an appropriation should be made for the payment of the salaries of the proposed new state officers. We understand that a bill to that effect is pending. The various Code -Departments still exist. Section 81-101, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929, reads as follows: . - "The civil administration of the laws of the state is hereby vested in the Governor. For the purpose of aiding the Governor in the execution and administration of the laws, the executive and administrative work shall be divided into the following departments, to-wit; Department of Agriculture, Department of Labor, Department of Trade and Commerce, Department of Public Welfare and Department of Public WerKs. The secretary of the Department of Labor shall be ex-officio Secretary of •the Department of Public Welfare." ■These departments can only be abolished by the Legislature: they cannot be abrogated by the Governor. Under the provisions of Section 81-108, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929, the Governor has power to discontine the service of the secretary of any Code Depart - ment, but that does not give him the right to abolish the Department. Under the authority of said Section 81-108, the Governor has power to appoint in each Code Department such assistants, employees, and clerical help as he may deem necessary. An appropriation should be made for each department to cover the • salaries of such assistants, employees, and clerical help. Section 81-103, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929, provides for the salaries of secretaries of the various Code Departments. The Legislature may make an appropriation to pay such salaries. If the Governor appoints no Code Secretaries then the appropriation for the. salaries of Code Secretaries will lapse. Such an appropriation could not be used for any other purpose than to pay such salaries. Very truly yours, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General. </seg>

Price, Chairman, Legal Redress Committee, Omaha Branch, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Omaha, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You state that a cnfe in Omaha has in front n sign reading as follows: "No Colored Patronage Solicited." You ask if the display of such a sign is a violation of the law: In our opinion it is. Sections 23-101, 102, C. S. for 1929, reads as follows: ■ "All persons within this state shall be entitled to a full and equal enjoyment of the accommodations, advantages, facil - ities and privileges of inns, restaurants, public conveyances, barber shops, theatres and other places of amusement; subject only to the conditions and limitations established by law and applicable alike to every person." "Any person who shall violate the foregoing section by denying to any person, except for reasons by law applicable, to all persons, the full enjoyment of any of the accommodations, . advantages, facilities, or privileges enumerated in the foregoing section, or by aiding or inciting such denials, shall for each offense be deemed suilty of &amp; misdemeanor, and be fined in any sum not less than twenty-five dollars, nor more than one hundred dollars, and pay the costs of the prosecution." The sign in question for all practical purposes means "Stay Out." It tells the colored people of Omaha that they are not wanted in that particular eating place.

Mutz, 1304-5-6 Sharp Bldg., I Jncoln, Nebraska. - ■ ■ Dear Sir: The firs" L U as n fono° w ;: PrOP&lt;:Siti0nS ° Pini ° n ° f S? «&lt;**«™^ "1. Can competition be met by a different article than the article offeiecl at a reduced price? Thnt is if a competitor reduces oil to 15c a uuart. can the competition reduce gasoline to meet that competition?" I have been unable to find any authority directly deciding this " OIn 1 t . and . 1 ""therefore only give my opinion as to what a court would probably hold should this ouestion be presented to it. Should this issue be presented in a prosecution under our anti - discrimination laws I believe our courts would hold that it is not a defense to a prosecution for cutting the price of gas, for example, that the defendant's competitor had cut the price of oil. I believe that the price can only be reduced to meet the price of a competitor on the same article or commodity. If this were not the rule it would be almost impossible ever to secure a conviction fo. unfair discrimination in price for competition, unless it is limited to the purchase or sale of the same commodity which seems to me to be clearly what the le fi islature intendeded, could always be found in some form or other such as would justify anv price a dealer might see fit to fix. </seg>
            <seg id="p168">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENLRAL For example: If this form of competition could be pleaded as a defense a seller of bread might justify his cut in price on the ground that he was merely meeting the competition of a seller of meat "or potatoes; a seller of coal could cut price to ineet the competition of natural gas or of fuel oil; the seller of lumber could cut his price In meet the competition of a seller of cement; a seller of candy might well plead that he must cut his price to meet the competition of the seller of cigarettes. Every person who sells any commodity or service is in a very real sense, competing agpinsl every other person who sells any commodity or service to net hold of the purchaser's dollar, but this is not the kind of competition which justifies a seller in reducing the price of his commodity in one locality below the price he main - tains in another locality in the state. Your second question is as follows: "2. Can different grades of gasoline be sold at different prices? If so, on what must the difference be established? Will the mere fact that the gasoline is different permit the seller to establish a different price according to his own choosing or must he establish his difference on the basis of cost?" I believe there can be no question but that different grades of unsoline may be sold at different prices. I believe also that the seller may lawfully establish any price he sees fit for each grade of gasoline that he sells provided he maintains a uniform selling price for each ijrade at every point in the state where he sells gasoline. Our laws do not undertake to fix pi Tees or to prescribe any rule or method by which prices shall be fixed. They only forbid the sellei from discriminating in price between different communities, sections or cities of the state for the purpose of destroying competition. Under this question you state as. an example that certain companies sell gasoline containing tcti aethyl lead which makes an, actual differ - ence in cost of about one cent a gallon yet they sell it at three cents a gallon more. I think this practice is not illegal in the absence of any misrepresentation or fraud on the purchaser. You also state that some concerns sell what is known as competition gasoline which is actually a different quality than the other gasoline they are selling and they reduce the price of this competition gasoline to the price of the cut price competitor without reducing the price of their regular lines. I believe this practice is lawful if there is no misrepresentation to the public and if the seller maintains a uniform price throughout the state for the grade known as "competition" gas - oline. </seg>
            <seg id="p169">OPINIONS Your third question is as follows:- • "3. Interpret for us the meaning of competing territory. Is it based on distance, city incorporation lines, county lines or state lines? That is, if a chain concern has a competitor who -. cuts the price, to what distance will this compel the chain operator to cut the price?" The courts, in construing statutes forbidding price discriminations have recognized the right to vary the price of a commodity to -neet the price of a bona fide competitor in the same section or locality I have been unable to find any legal definition of the term "competing territory" or of any synonymous term. It seems to me clear, however that it does not depend on geographical or political boundary lines liut refers rather to commercial trade territory. Our legislature seems to have adopted this meaning for in Section 51.-509 Compiled Statutes, 1929, relating to discrimination in priors paid for cream and butlerfat it specifically provides as an exception to the application of the law cases where a different price is beinc pmd by a bona fide competitor "fn such place or its trade territory." The trade territory is by its terms that territory from which trade or patronage is customarily drawn, and such territory is of course not limited by such artificial political boundaries as city, county or stale limits, nor to a very great degree by natural geographic boundaries such as rivers, mountains, etc. It follows that when two bona fide competitors occupy the same trade territory each has the right to meet the other's prices regardless of whether they are in the same or different towns, counties or states. Your fourth question is as follows: "4. Will the service given at a station be considered a part of the price in meeting competition? That is, if a person operating two or more stations gives a different service at a different station in the same city, is this possible?" I believe the service given can not properly be considered a part of the price. If a gasoline seller wishes to give a different service at. each of his different stations in the city it seems to me that it is per - missible. The reasons given in my answer to your first question apply with equal, force here. Under this question you suggest as an example the following illus - tration: </seg>
            <seg id="p170">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "(a) A concrete example. Suppose a chrin concern owns stations 'A' and 'B'. 'A' is a station with a large investment. . • They give free tire service, wnsh windshields, run charge accounts, etc. Station 'B' is an inferior station with practically no investment, gives no service, has no charge accounts. Would • station 'B' be permitted to sell for a less price per gallon be - cause of the lack of service than station 'A'?" I think, in the example you give, that the concern could not justify charging a higher price for gasoline at station "A" than at station "B" on the ground that it furnished more or better service at station "A" than at. station "B". It could, however, make a charge for the service given at "A", in addition to its price charged for gasoline. I believe the same rule would apply to the second example you give of two grocery stores located in the same city and belonging to the same company one of which delivers goods to its customers and runs charge accounts while the other operates on a "cash and carry" basis. The same price must be charged for the same commodities at each store but the company has the right to make a charge for delivering the goods to the customer and for carrying his account on its books at the store rendering the greater service. I have not considered in these pnswers the question of establishing intent to destroy competition but have assumed in air cases that such intent exists and can be established by proof. The statute condemns discrimination in price between different sections, communities or cities only when done "for the purpose of destroying the business of a competitor." Proof that a discrimination in price has been made is prima facie evidence, however, of intent to destroy the business of a competitor. You also ask for our interpretation of the opinion of the Supreme Court of South Carolina in State v. Texas Co. (S. Car.) 134 S. E. 211. That case was a prosecution for violation of Section 3536 of the Code of Laws of South Carolina of 1922 which section is almost an exact duplicate of our anti-discrimination statute, Section 59-501, Com - piled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929. The defendant company was charged with having violated this statute by selling gasoline to a customer in the city of Columbia for 19 cents per gallon whereas the prevailing price in said city at the time was 20 cents a gallon, said sale being for the purpose of destroying the business of a competitor. </seg>
            <seg id="p171">OPINIONS The trial court overrruled a motion for a non-suit but later sus - tained a motion for a directed verdict in favor of the defendent on the ground that there was no evidence which would warrant a jury in finding that the defendent had any intent to destroy the business of a competitor. • &lt;t.' The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court but on ojher grounds .It held that there was evidence of intent to destroy a competitor's business sufficient to require the case to go to the jury as far as that ground was concerned but it also held that the statute "does not contemplate the lowering, of prices at different points within the same city," and inasmuch as it did not appear that the defendant charged a different price outside the city of Columbia from the price charged by it within the city it was not guilty of violating this law. Should our courts follow the same interpretation placed on this statute by the Supreme Court of. South Carolina they would have to hold that a company maintaining two or more stations within the corporate limits of the same city did not violate the law by charging different prices for the same grade of gasoline at its different stations within the city. It is only when the company operates stations in differ - ent cities, sections or communities and discriminates in its prices be - tween such different ciUes, sections or communities that it violates the law. This decision is, of course, not binding on the courts of Nebraska, and .the interpretation of the statute by the South Carolina Court might not be adopted here, but the decision would no doubt have considerable argumentative force with our courts.

If he approves he shall sign it, and thereupon it shall become a law but if he do not approve, he shall return it with his objections to the house in which it shall have originated, which House shall enter the objections at large upon its Journal, and proceed to reconsider the bill. If then three-fifths of the members elected agree to pass the same, it shall be sent, together with the objec - tions, to the other house, by which it shall likewise be reconsid - ered and if approved by three-fiftrs of the members elected to that house, it shall become a law notwithstanding the objections of the Governor. In all such cases the vote of each house shall be determined by yeas and nays, to be entered unon the journal. Any bill which shall not be returned by the Governor within five days (Sunday excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, shall become a law in like manner as if he had signed " it, unless the legislature by their adjournment prevent its re - turn; in which case it shall be filed with his objections, in the office of the Secretary of State within, five days after such adjournment, or become a law. The Governor may disapprove any item or items of appropriation contained in bills passed by the Legislature, and the item or items so disapproved shall be stricken therefrom, unless repassed in the manner herein pre - scribed in cases of disapproval of bills." • 25 Ruling Case Law, page 893, on this subject reads as follows: "But in the absence of provisions to the contrary, it has been held that a bill may be returned to the house in which it originated, although the house is not, at the moment of the return, in actual session. If it has adjourned for the day, or for three days, if there has been no final adjournment, it still has an organized existence as a legislative body, with its president, secretary and other officers, to whom under such circumstances, a constitutional delivery of the bill and message may be made It has even been said that in case neither the presiding officer nor the clerk can be found, the deposit of the bill on the presiding officer's table or desk, or in the office of the clerk, would doubtless be sufficient." 36 Cyc. page 962, in a note on the subject reads as follows: "A return to be effectual must be such as places the bill </seg>

Rep. 432), or cf the secretary of state, in case the legislature has adjourned (State v. Junkin, 79 Nebr. 532, 113 N. W. 256).

A 'day' in this sense begins at 12 o'clock midnight, extends through twenty-four hours to the next 12 o'clock midnight.' ■ If Senate File No. 33 was presented to one or more of the officers of the State Senate before midnight of the fifth day, in our opinion the veto was effective even if these officers of the Senate refused to accept the biU and the veto message of the Governor. The Senate not •being in actual session the Governor attempted to make delivery of the bill and his veto message to the officers of the Senate.

            <seg id="p176">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL \ LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATIONS -VOTE REQUIRED TO APPROVE IN EXCESS OF BUDGET' April 15, 1031. Honorable George F. Frush, ' State Senate, . , . • Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Your letter of April 13th at hand in which you say: "Please advise at your earliest convenience, if in your opinion, H. R. 242 was regularly and legally passed by the House of Representatives, and if not, would a conference report adopted by both Houses cure any defect in the bill on account of the manner in which it passed the House." An examination of the records- of the House of Representatives shows that House Roll No. 242 having received more than fifty-one votes did pass that House. No appeal was taken from the ruling . of the speaker of the House on the subject. In law it is presumed that all steps necessary to effect the legislative result evidenced by a bill transmitted from one branch of the Legislature to the other have been regularly taker, unless the' contrary appears from the records themselves of the transmitting legislative body. House Roll No. 242 contains appropriations for various departments and branches of the state government. A comparison of. the appro - priations made in said House Roll with the recommendations of the Governor of the State to the Legislature in his budget message shows that several of the amounts in the bill -are in excess of the amounts recommended by the Governor. .Section 7 of Article IV, of the Con - stitution of Nebraska, reads as follows: "No appropriations shall be made Tn excess of the recom - mendation contained in such budget unless by three-fifths vote* of each House of the Legislature, and such excess so approved by a three-fifths vote shall not be subject to veto by the Governor." • . : The records of the House of Representatives do not show that the items in House Roll No. 242 which are in excess of the amounts recommended by the Governor received a three-&gt;fifths vote of the House. It therefore follows that all such appropriations made in excess </seg>
            <seg id="p177">OPINIONS of the recommendations of the Governor are unconstitutional and void. • * The failure of House Rcll No. 242 containing appropriations in excess of the budget recommendations of the Governor to receive the constitutional three-fifths majority was not equivalent to an amend - ment striking from the bill those portions of the bill containing such excess appropriations. An amendment to strike out any part of a bill must be proposed by some member of the House and is only effective after being submitted to a vote of the House and rceiving the necessary majority. Furthermoie, all amendments to either add to a bill or elim - inate portions of the bill must be made before the final vote on the bill itself. Therefore, the excess appropriation items not having been stricken from House Roll No. 242 by any vote of the House, art still in the bill but void. In the present status of the bill they are mere words and surplusage. The remaining portions of the bill are valid. Ij An examination of the budget of the Governor and the provisions of House Roll No. 242 show certain provisions in the bill which do not increase appropriations recommended by the Governor but transfer appropriations from one expending agency to another. For example, the Governor recommended an appropriation of three thousand dollars for the printing of the Nebraska. Blue Hook but placed the disburse - ment of the money under the Board of Educational Lands and Funds. House Roll No. 242 as passed by the House contains also an appro - priation of three thousand dcllars for the printing of the Nebraska Blue Book but leaves the spending of the money to the Legislative Ref - erence Bureau. In our opinion since the amount of the appropriation v/as not increased, the provision therefore is valid although the Gover - nor's suggestion as to who should handle the money was not followed. Under the Constitution the recommendations of the Governor are binding only as to amounts and net as-to who shall expend the money. Where a statute provides that a certain department shall have charge of the spending of the appropriation for a certain activity of the gov - ernment, the question of transferring the spending of that appropriation to some other department is purely legislative In character. If the Senate by a three-fifths -vote adopts amendments to House Roll No. 242 which provides for appropriations in excess of the recom - mendations of the Governor, and if such amendments are adopted by the House by a three-fifths vole, then in our opinion such excess appropriations are valid and not subject to veto. If the senate and the house cannot agree and a conference committee is appointed, and if the report of the conference committee is adopted by a vote of three - fifths of both lit uses of the Legislature, then in our opinion the </seg>

The last and final vote on the bill of each house governs. Our opinion is based on the provisions of i.he State Constitution and a number of court decisions, among which are Loomis vs. Callahan (Wis.), 220 N. W. 816; State vs. Steen, (N. D.) 212 N.

County Treasurer, . : ' Flattsmouth, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You make inquiry as 'follows:. </seg>
            <seg id="p179">: opinions "In reference to Section 77-2508 of the Compiled Statutes of the State of Nebraska for 1929, would a county treasurer, In determining the amount of a deposit in banks whose securities have been approved by the county board in accordance with this section, be required to consider securities at the present market value or at face value? 'In the event a bank clrsed, and the market value of its securities was not sufficient to cover the amount the county treasurer had. on deposit, and the county board passes a resolution to hold the securities, w uld the county treasurer be liable for the deficiency at the time the bank closed?" I will endeavor to answer the above questions in the order in which they are asked.' 1. I am of the opinion that a county treasurer will be justified in insisting that the market value of securities pledged to secure a deposit of county funds shall at least equal, at all times the amount of the deposit. It may be that the legislature when it provided for the substitution of securities "the total value of which in the case of bonds alone shall at all times equal twenty per cent more than the maximum amount of the deposit to which the' bank is entitled" had in mind the face value of the securities which is a fixed amount when the substitution is made rather than the market value which may vary from day to day, but whether that be true or not it is obvious there will not be adequate protection unless the actual value of the secuiities at any time is at least equal to the am: unt of the deposit they were given to secure. ' i- • ■ ' 2. In the event a bank closes and the market value of securities approved by the county board to protect the deposit of county is in - sufficient for that purpose, I am of the~ opinion that the county treasurer may in some cases be held financially responsible for any loss the county my suffer because of the insufficiency of the security. If the county treasurer under all the circumstances negligently and carelessly failed to protect the county by requiring the bank to put up additional securities when he knew, or was charged with know - ing, that the market value of the securities was far less than the deposit of the- county, he and his bondsmen in our opinion might be held liable. If the county treasurer sat idly by for weeks and months while the secuiities placed in escrow to protect the county deposits depreciated in value from, say, 25 per cent to 75 per cent, it could hardly be said that he had exercised ordinary prudence and </seg>
            <seg id="p180">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENKRAL care in the matter. The statute places the responsibility of requiring securities squarely upon the treasurer. If he is under no obligation to ;ict when the securities become of less value than the amount of the deposit, then there is no limit to the losses that the county may sustain. But the burden of proving negligence would in our opinion be upon the county. The county treasurer ci.uld not be charged with more than ordinary care and prudence in the matter.

Dear Sir: You inquire whether lands can be revalued this year or whether a general revaluation of the real estate of a county cannot be had until 1934. The correct -answer to the question you ask is not entirely free from doubt. What is now 77.-1601 was so amended in 1925 as to provide among other things that • "All real property in this slate subject to taxation shall be assessed on the first day of April 1926, and every fourth year thereafter, which assessment shall be used as a basis of valu - ation for taxation until the next regular assessment, except as hereinafter provided." I am of the opinion that when the legislature enacted the above | quoted provision of statute it had in mind that there would only be a general revaluation of real estate for taxation purposes once in every four years beginning with 1926. However, the legislature did not amend at that time or since 77-1702 which defines the duties of the county board of equalization and which reads in part as follows: "At its meeting in 1912 and every second year thereafter equalize the valuation of real property of the county by * * * * lowering the valuation of such tracts and lots as are assessed to.o high * * * *.

"The same lodge has failed to pay the 1930 property taxes and the taxes have been carried as delinquent on the County Treasurer's books since May 1, 1931, and said lodge claims, that under the recent decision it does not ' have to pay the 1930 property taxes." Your question is whether or not Gage County has legal right to collect the 1930 and 1931 taxes. As the taxes are now shown on the records of Gage County and as no claim of exemption appears to have been made to the . Board ol Equalization, either in the year 1930 or in the year 1931, there appear* no way for the lodge to be relieved of this tax.

Kolzow County Clerk, Madison, Nebr. .' . Dear Mr. Kolzow: . -&gt; Your letter of March 12 at hand. We know of no law that provides for the election of delegates to the county convention. The delegates should be selected by party caucuses. Precinct committeemen are no longer elected either. Sections </seg>
            <seg id="p183">. . OPINIONS 32-1172 and 32-1174, C. S. for 1929, were suspended by the filing of a referendum petition in 1921 and defeated by a vote of the people at the general election in 1922. Section 32-1173, C. S. for 1929, is the statute that now governs the holding of county coventions. This section was adopted in 1919 and assumes that the delegates will be elected at the. primary election, but there is in fact no statute at the present time providing for the election of delegates or the selection of party committeerhen at the primary election: Section 5 of Chapter 90, 1919 Session Laws, provided that at the primary election there should be elected delegates from each voting precinct, to the county convention of the political party with which they affiliated. This section was amended by Chapter 85, 1921 Session Laws. Said Chapter 85, however, was suspended by the filing of a referendum petition and was nullified by a vote of the people in November, 1922. This left Section 5 of Chapter 90, 1919 Laws, in effect. But said Section 5 of Chapter 90 providing for the election of delegates to the county conventions was repealed by Chapter 78, 1923 Session Laws, Page 216. Said Chapter 78 repealed Section 2165 of the 1922 Compiled Statutes, which was said Section 5 of Chapter 90, 1919 Session Laws. As we have stated, there is, therefore, today no law authorizing the election by the voters of delegates to the party conventions. Each party may select such delegates by the caucus system.

Article XIV, Section 1, of Amendments to the United States Consti - tution, provides that "all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdictiin thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside." : Since you were born in the United Stntes and are now and always have been subject to its jurisdiction, you are a citizen of the United States and of the State of Nebraska, unless, as a matter of law, your marriage in this country in 1899 to nn unnaturalized German national expatriated or deprived you of American citizenship. That your said marriage did not divest you of American citizenship is made plain by the following federal court decisions: "At common law a woman who was a citizen of the United States did not lose her citizenship by mai-tiage to an alien unless she removed from the country." In re Fitzroy, 4 Fed, (2nd) 541. "An American woman marrying an alien prior to the act of March 1907, 34 Slat., 1228, and residing continuously in the United States since her marriage, did not by reason of such marriage lose her status as a citizen.

            <seg id="p186">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL INSURANCE— ASSESSMENT HAIL ASSOCIATION WHICH ALSO WRITES FIRE, TORNADO AND AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE —BOND REQUIRED OF TREASURER June 1, 1932. Mr. Lee Herdman, Acting Commissioner of Insurance. Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Herdman: This is in answer to your letter of May 25th requesting an opinion on the provision of Sec. 44-912. Comp. St., 1929, requiring the treasurer of an assessment, hail association to furnish and deposit with the Secretary of the Department of Trade and Commerce a $50, - 000.00 bond, as applied to an assessment hail association that also writes fire, tornado and automobile insurance. In our opinion, the bond is. required. The provisions of Article 5 of Chapter 44, Comp. St. 1929, relating to assessment companies and especially of Sec, 44-912 of that article must be regarded as special requirements which would govern over general requirements of the insurance laws, even if there were a conflict between the general and special laws on the subject. However, we hot only find no such conflict but rather a consistency, between the general and special provisions. Section 44-401 is for the most part general in its nature, simply authorizing the organization of insurance companies for the writing of the various kinds of insurance in the combinations therein specified. We find nothing in that section which conflicts with the special re - quirements of Section 44-912, as above mentioned. Section 44-402, C. S. Supp. 1931, also general in its nature/author - lzes the organization of insurance companies "upon the assessment plan to transact the kinds of insurance described" etc. Section 44-403 requires that "Contracts for each of the kinds of insurance specified in the subdivisions of Section 1 (44-401) of this article shall be separate and distinct policies," with certain exceptions. Also that: "Contracts for hail insurance on growing crops shall be </seg>
            <seg id="p187">OPINIONS written in separate and distinct policies." These sections certainly do not conflict with the provisions of Section 44-912. In fact, since the hail policy must be a separate contract and the company is authorized to transact that business "upon the assessment plan" we must look to the more specific requirements of Section 44-912 to find just what the "assessment plan" means as applied to this particular contract. ' It appears to us that.it would be strange indeed to construe the statutes above mentioned so as to eliminate a plain requirement as to hail contracts simply because this type of business may lawfully be conducted in conjunction with other types of insurance business. Such union, in the absence of a clear proyisirn to the contrary, should not . strip the individual lines of their respective statutory characteristics. Very truly yours, . C. A.

Billeter, County Highway Commissioner, ■■ Sidney, Nebraska. ; Dear Mr. Billeter: You state that the county of Cheyenne purchases annually, for highway purposes, many carloads of gasoline. You ask if the federal government is authorized under the 1932 federal revenue act to collect a t*x of one cent per gallon on such gasoline sold to the county for highway purposes. In our opinion the United States Bureau of Internal Revenue has no authority to collect such a tax on gasoline sold to the county for use in building and maintaining its roads. Cheyenne County is a subdivision of the state for administrative purposes. The maintaining and building of highways constitutes a governmental function. Gasoline purchased by the county is therefore used for governmental purposes. The tax on gasoline would constitute </seg>
            <seg id="p188">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL an interference, therefore, of the governmental functions of the sub - divisions of the state. In Indian Motorcycle Company, v. United States, 283 U. S. 570, the Supreme Court of the United Stales said: s.' "The principle that the instrumentalities, means and oper - ations whereby the states exert their governmental powers are exempt frorri taxation by the United States, is not affected by the amount of the particular tax or the resulting interference, but is absolute. . . ' "Where a motorcyicte is sold by its manufacturer to a municipal corporation of a state for use by such corporation in its police service, the transaction cannot constitutionally be taxed by the United States ....." A similar case is Panhandle Oil Co. v. Knox, 227 U. S. 218, where . it is held that the state could not place an excise tax on gasoline sold to the United States Government for the use of its coast guard fleet ■ and its veteran's hospital. In that case the Supreme Court of the United States said: "It is immaterial that the seller and not the purchaser is required to report and make payment to the state. Sale and purchase constitute a transaction by which the" tax is measured and on which the burden rests ... to use the number of gallons sold to the United States as a measure of the privilege tax is in substance and legal effect to tax the sale . . . and that is to tax the United States — to exact tribute on its transactions and apply the same to support of the state." It, of course, follows that if the state cannot tax gasoline sold to the United States Government, then the United States Government cannot tax gasoline sold to the state or any of its subdivisions, county, municipality, township, or school district, when used for governmental purposes . . ■ According to the United States Daily of July 2, 1932, the Bureau of Internal Revenue has announced orally that it is not taxing gasoline sold to counties and states by manufacturer if the gasoline is used for governmental purposes.

In the Primary Election there were three candidates, namely, Lewis H. Blackledge, J. W. James and George J. Marshall." . You inquire whether a vacancy exists as to nominees in the Tenth District for the office of District Judge, and if it does exist whether it may be filled by nominating a candidate by petition at this time. I will endeavor to answer the above questions in the order in which they are asked. 1. 32-1204, Compiled Statutes reads in part as follows: "It is hereby provided that if, after a primary election, there shall, through any cause whatsoever, be a vacancy upon the ballot for any office upon the non-political ballot in districts comprising more than one county, said vacancy may be filled by filing petitions with the Secretary of State forty days prior to the general election. : ■ "A vacancy shall be deemed to exist when the number of candidates for each office shall be less than twice the number . of positions to be filled."

It will be a most beautiful road and give travelers an opportunity to see one of the loveliest stretches of Nebraska. People are pretty generally granting a right-of-way. The Greggsport Improvement Club, sponsoring the scheme, has asked me whether the State will permit the rond builders an ensement without cost through one corner of the State's block on the hill-top four blocks from our main building.

Where the mother of a minor child is insane and its parents are in poor circumstances financially and are unable to support it properly and it has been fcund to be a dependent child or a neglected child by a juvenile court and has been committed as such to the Board of Control, I am of the opinion that the uoard of Control can consent to the adoption of said child. The section of statute which provides that the parents may relin - duish the custody and control of a minor child and consent to its adoption (43-102) was passed in 1R97. ■ The section of statute which provides that the Board of Control may authorize its agent to consent to the adoption of any child which has been committed to it by a court acting under the provisions of the juvenile court law, was passed in 1911. It is the later enact - ment and as such it may be considered to modify and take precedence over the earlier statute in so far as the two are in conflict.. I am of the opinion, however, that it will be well to get the consent in writing of the father also in all such cases. The courts have great regard, and rightly so, I think, for the claim of parents to the care and custody of their children but it would be going far, to allow the fact that an insane mother was incapable of consenting to an adoption to prevent a child from being adopted into a good family where it would have a good home when the father of the child and the Board of Control to whom its custody had been given by a juvenile court are both willing and anxious to have such adoption take place.

Dear Dr. Bass: You state that you have been nsked to make a refund of the gasoline tax on gasoline which was wasted by being allowed to run out on the ground. You state that the draining out of the gasoline was done by thieves or vandals. It is a great hardship on the corporations which lost the gasoline if they have to pay the tax. As a matter of public policy no payment' should be asked or if payment has already been made, the state should made a refund. But the law and good morals are not always the same. We know of no law by which you are authorized to make a refund. Section 66-405, C. S. for 1929, authorizes the state treasurer to refund "tax paid on motor vehicle fuel destroyed by fire or act of God." The gasoline in question was not destroyed by Sre nor by "act of God." An act of God has been defined as "a disaster with which the agency of man has nothing to do .which could not have been occasioned by the interference of man, but proceeds from the physical causes alone." Another court defined "act of God" as meaning "some inevitable accident which cannot be prevented by human care, skill or foresight, but results from natural causes, such as i lightning, tempest, floods, and inundations." ■ .

            <seg id="p201"/>
            <seg id="p202">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL The Nebraska Supreme Court has apparently never decided the venue of prosecutions for failure to pay gasoline taxes. It follows that no lawyer's or other person's answer to your question can be safely regarded as entirely free from doubt. Nevertheless, with the aid of court decisions in other states upon gasoline-tax and other laws similar to our own gasoline-tax law, we have formed upon your question an opinion which we are willing to express for what it may be found to be worth. It appears that the Nebraska constitutional and statutory provisions pertinent to your question, are as follows: "In. all criminal prosecutions the accused shall have the light to .... a speedy public trial by an impartial jury of the county or district in which the offense is alleged to have been committed." Art. I, Sec. 11, Neb. Const. "Every dealer .... shall .... pay a tax of four cents' per gallon upon all motor vehicle fuels .... remitting said tax to said State Treasurer, who shall receipt the dealer there - for, and pay the State Treasurer all of the money thus re - ceived " Sec. GG-405, 1931 Supp., P. 116. "Any dealer, person, firm, co-partnership, company, agency, . association or corporation who shall violate' any of the pro - visions of this act, or who shall fail or refuse to pay such tax when due .... shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor : and upon conviction thereof, 1 shall be punished by a fine of not less than twenty-live dollars nor more than five hundred dollars or by imprisonment in county jail for not less than thirty nor more than ninety days for each offense." Sec. 66-410, Comp. St., 1929. It thus appears that the gasoline tax is not payable to anyone in the county wherein the gasoline is originally imported into this state. Instead the gasoline tax is payable to the' state treasurer whose office and place of public business are generally known to be, and judicially recognized as being, in the State Capitol in Lincoln, Lancaster County, Nebraska. This command of the gasoline-tax law to pay the lax to the state treasurer, of course, points pretty clearly to Lancaster County as the county in which all offenses of failing to pay gasoline taxes are committed and in which all such offenses should be prosecuted. </seg>
            <seg id="p203">. OPINIONS . The Kansas gasoline-tax law requires all gasoline taxes of that slate to be paid to the state oil inspector, whose office and place of public business are generally known to be, and judicially recognized as being, in Topeka,- Shawnee County, Kansas. The pertinent provisions of the Kansas law read as follows: "That said tax shall be paid by the dealer to the state oil inspector .... "The state oil inspector shall forthwith receipt the dealer for the amount of the tax. and penalty paid." Sec. 79-3005, 1931 Supp. Rev. Stat. Kansas, 1923. "Any dealer, person or ass-ciation or (of) persons, firm or corporation, violating any of the provisions of this act .... shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not more than one hundred dollars, or by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than thirty days, or by both such fine and. imprison - ment." Sec. 79-3011, 1931 Supp., Rev. Stat. Kan. 1923. Under these provisions of the Kansas gasoline-tax law, in the case of State v".

Upon his conviction the defendant appealed to the Kansas Supreme Court and contended that he was not subject to prosecution for failing to pay the lax in Shawnee County but w'as subject to prosecution for such offense only in Cheyenne County where he did business. But the Kansas Supreme Court held otherwise and affirmed the conviction for the reason stated in the syllabus as follows: . "The venue of prosecutions for the refusal or failure of dealers to pay the tax on motor vehicle fuel to the state oil inspector, as provided by Chapter 274 of the Laws of 1925, is at the state capitol nt Shawnee County, in which the state oil inspector maintains his office."

            <seg id="p204">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL In the body of the opinion in the Snell case, the Kansas Supreme Court elaborated its views as follows: "The staute does not expressly provide the place of pay - men, but does require it to be made to the state oil inspector, and it is a reasonable inference that it must be paid at the office ■ maintained by the state oil inspector: There he keeps his ac - counts with, dealers, and there reports by dealers are filed and preserved for future reference. The state oil inspector is a state office created by law, and we must take notice of the existence of his office and the place where he transacts business with the public. It is a matter of general and common know - ledge that the office is at the capitol of state in Shawnee County, the headquarters of other state office'rs. Upon making collections, the state oil inspector is required to make daily transfers of the tax collected to the state treasurer, whose office is in the state house near that of the inspector." "Our view is that payment of the tax was to be made to the state oil inspector at his office at the state house in Topeka, Shawnee County. The omission to comply with the statutory requirement occured in Shawnee County and the pro - secution was rightly brought in that county." State v. Snell, 131 Kan. 370, 291 P. 737. In this holding and reasoning of the Kansas Court, our own" re - search, criticism and reflection have revealed no infirmity or imper - fection worthy of legal notice. Hence, in framing our own conclusion on your question, we can paraphrase the last paragraph of the above quotation from State v. Snell as follows: Our view is that payment 'of the tax was (is) to be made to the state treasurer at his office at the state house in Lincoln, Lancaster County. The ommission to comply with the statutory requirement (as to payment of the tax) occurred (occurs) in Lancaster County and the prosecution was (is) rightly brought in that county. It is therefore our opinion that upon the arrest of any persons anywhere in this state for importing or otherwise possessing gasoline in this state without paying the lawful tax thereon, such persons should be brought to Lancaster County, Nebraska, for prosecution for such offense in the courts of Lancaster County.

            <seg id="p205">OPINIONS TAXATION— VALUATIONS OF REAL ESTATE— LEGALITY OF REDUCTIONS BY COUNTY BOARD OF EQUALIZATION July 15, 1932. Hon. William H. Smith, State Tax Commissioner, State House, .';'•■ Dear Sir: Your letter of July 13 at hand. You ask our opinion on three propositions. 1. You say: "First — The abstracts of assessment are being received from the county assessors. These abstracts indicate that in most counties, real estate valuations have been reduced from 10% in some counties to bb much as 30% in others. "In your opinion, are these reductions legal?" • In answer permit us to say thnt your question cannot be answered without knowing .the methods followed by the various counties. The statute provides how a county board, of equalization may reduce the assessed value of property. If the satute was followed the reductions would be legal; otherwise not. What is now 77-1601, Com. St., 1929, was amended in 1925 to provide among other things that "AH real property in this state subject to taxation shall be assessed on the first day of April, 1926, and every fourth years thereafter, which assessment shall be used as a basis of valuation for taxation until the next regular asessment, except as hereinafter provided.™ ' '. ' * • ' '■ We are of the opinion that when the legislature enacted the above quoted provision of statute it had in mind that there would only be a general revaluation of real estate for taxation purposes once in every four years beginning with 1926. However, the legislature did not amend at that time or since 77-1702, Comp. St., 1929, which defines the duties of the county board of equalization, and which reads in part as follows: "At its meeting in 1912 and every second year thereafter </seg>
            <seg id="p206">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL equalize the valuation of real property of .the county by .... lowering the valuation of such tracts and lots as are assessed too high .... In cases of evident error of assessment or of apparent gross injustice in over valuation . : . . of real prop- " erty . .... the county board of equalization may at its annual meetings consider and correct the same .... by lowering the assessed valuation of real property." In this connection it should be borne in mind that the State Constitution contains a provision that "taxes shall be levied by valu - ation uniformly and proportionately upon all tangible properly." (Sec. 1 of Article VIII of the Constitution of NebrasVa). It follows, therefore, that in no case could the assessed valuation of real estate be lowered below the assessed valuation of other classes of tangible property which have the same actual value. If the assessed valuation of real estate is reduced below its actual market value in the ordinary course of trade then all other classes of tangible property must be reduced to the same level. . . We are of the opinion that a county board of equalization had authority to change the assessed value of real estate this year when they were convinced that such real estate was assessed above its - actual value at the present time and much greater than its proportionate value as compared with the assessed value of other classes of tangible property in the county. . • ... In the case of Welch v. Douglas County, 103 Neb. 469, the Supreme Court held that: "A county board of equalization may upon proper notice raise or lower the valuation of real estate for taxation to. correct an apparent gross injustice. Rev. St., 1913, Sec. 6437. "In such cases, no complaint is necessary." In our opinion the proper procedure was for the owners of the real estate which it was alleged was valued too high to join in a petition to the county board of equalization asking that the valuation be reduced on the ground of error or apparent gross injustice in the valuation fixed. Such a petition should not only contain the names and addresses of the owners, or their representatives, but should also contain a legal description of the land owned by each signer of the petition. The petition should ask the county board of equalization to grant a hearing on a day to be fixed. At the time of the hearing evidence should have been produced to sustain the allega - tions of the petition that the real estate was overvalued and not </seg>

" WH E«EFORE, we respectfully pray, that a hearing be held in this matter and each of us asks that - after due con - sideration your honorable body reduce the valuation for taxation purposes of his tract of land whose description is set opposite his name to the extent of 25 per cent or such other per cent as may seem to you just in order that said land may not be valued for taxation purposes above its actual value and above the assessed value of other tangible property both real and personal located in the same taxing district. "NAME ADDRESS DESCRIPTION OF LAND OWNED" 2. You state: . "Second-Irrespective of the action of tlie various counties the state board is required to equalize between counties and between the different classes of prcperty therein. In your opinion, is the State Board justified in accepting the findings of the counties, irrespective of the methods employed in arriv - ing at those findings?" You are not justified in accepting without investigation the findings </seg>
            <seg id="p208">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL of the various county boards of equalization. The county board of equalization in one county may have reduced the assessed valuation of farm real estate ten per cent, in another county the reduction may have been thirty per cent and in another county there may not have been any reduction. It is your duty to determine whether or not ten percent is too little a reduction, thirty per cent too much, and whether 01 not some change should have been made in the valuation of the third county. I strongly urge you to read the case of Hncker v. Howe, 72 Neb. 385, 101 N. W. 255. That case contains an excellent discussion of the duties and powers of the bonrd of equalization in equalizing between counties. . ■ The court in that case said in part: "The statute does not limit the state board in the matter of equalization to the aggregate vnlue as shown by the returns of all the different counties. Its provisions are that the board may increase or decrease hy per centum to be added to or deducted from the aggregate value of the different counties to make them conform to law .... The valuation of property assessed for taxation is primarily for cssessing officers, and .... boards of equalization except as conferred by statutes are not authorized to change the result, and then only in order to effectuate an adjustment of values so as to bring about uniformity. Our statute, we think, contemplates that the state board of equalization my equalize valuations as between the different counties in the sense the word is usually and ordi - narily understood. That is, the state board is empowered to correct and adjust inequalities in valuation to the end that all property shall relatively be valued on the same basis for the purposes of taxation, as near as the same is practicable." Briefly, therefore, in order to effect an equalization it is the duty of the board to ascertain whether the valuation in each county bears a just relation to that in all other counties, and if it does not, the board should increase or diminish the aggregate valuation in any county by adding or deducting such a percentage as will in its opinion be neccessary to produce such relation of equality. The sound discretion of your board in the matter will not be disturbed. With reference to county boards of equalization the Supreme Court of Nebraska in Meridian Highway Bridge Co. v. Cedar County, 117 Neb 214, 220 N. W. 241, said: "The sound discretion reposed in the board of equalization to hear and determine the valuation of property will not be disturbed by this court, unless so manifestly wrong that reason - able minds cannot differ thereon." </seg>
            <seg id="p209">OPINIONS To the same effect is the case of Hacker v. Howe, referred to above. 3. You state: . . "Third— In determining the present value of real estate for taxation purposes, what elements, in your opinion, are taxing authorities justified in considering?" Section 77-201, Comp. Si., 1929, answers your question in the following language: "All property in this state, not expressly exempt there - from, shall be subject to taxation, and shall be valued and assessed at its actual value. 'Actual value' as used in this act, shall mea.n its value in the market in the ordinary course of trade." In the recent case of Schmidt v. Saline County, 239 N. W. 203, the Supreme Court of Nebraska said that "The net income derivable from real estate prudently used for the purpose for which it is best adapted, is a proper factor to consider in determining its actual value." In 26 R. C. L. 365, Sec. 322, market value is defined as follows: "By fair market value is meant the amount of money which a purchaser willing but not obliged to buy the property would pay to an owner willing but not obliged to sell it, taking into consideration all uses to which the property is adapted and might in reason be applied/ 1 Permit me to call your attention to another rule that your board must keep in mind, namely, that "While, under the statute, all tangible property should be assessed at its actual value for the . purpose of taxation, if assessed at less than actual value, then all should be assessed at the same proportion of actual value." — Schmidt v. Saline County, supra. . It was formerly the rule in Nebraska that no one could complain that his lands were assessed too high if not assessed at more than their actual value.

"In a village of second class with six councilmen and a mayor, can members of the council sell to the city without a contract legally?" A. No, but if the city accepts and retains the benefit of the articles so sold to it by a councilman, the city is liable to the council - man for the reasonable value of said- article (Sees. 17-517, 18-301 Comp.

Nebraska. Dear Mr. Jones: '■ This is in answer to your letter of October 21, 1931. We fail to find any law requiring Richardson County to have a permanent appointed official known as a county engineer. Many of the duties which a county engineer would perform are already required ftf the county surveyor who is a regular elective county officer hold - ing an office which the county must fill by election (See Sees 26-1601 and 32-1C9, Comp: St., 1929). We are, however, convinced that when </seg>
            <seg id="p214">REPORT. OF ATTORNEY GENERAL the services of an engineer are required for any work which the ciiunty board is empowered by statute to mpnage, the ccunty board has for the appointment of an engineer for such work on implied power or authority which we can in no manner restrain or control. It is clear to us that for any abuse of the ccunty board's discretion in appointing engineers when required for public works managed by the board, the redress is rather political than legal. Hence, in answer to your first question we are constrained to advise that the county board may in its discretion retain or dispense with a county engineer but is . not obliged to take upon itself or upon its members the professional responsibility involved in actually doing engineering work for the county. You next inquire as to the statutory provision of salaries for county officers, deputies for -the same and the compensation of - deputies. - According to our information Richardson County has 19,826 people. If this is the fact, we find the yearly salaries of county officers of Richardson County to be fixed by law as follows: Clerk, District Court, (Laws 1931, Ch. 65) $2,200.00 County Attorney, (33-111, C. s! 1929) •__' $1,500.00 Register of Deeds, (Laws 1931, Ch. 65) $1,500.00 County Clerk, (33-131, C. S. 1929) S2.000.00 County Treasurer, (33-131, C. S. 1929) 82,000.00 County Sheriff, (Laws 1931, Ch. 65) .$1,750.00 County Judge, (33-133, C. S. 1929) _ $2,200.00 County Assessor, (Laws 1931, Ch. 69) .... $ 300.00 Instead of allowing the county surveyor to retain the fees for his services provided by law, the county board in its discretion may require the surveyor to account to the county for his fees and pay the county surveyor a salary of not to exceed SI 800.00 a year (Laws 1931, Ch. 65). . The county commissioners each receive' for their services from the county general fund five dc liars per day and ten cents per mile for time and travel necessarily spent and done in the duties of their offices. The total amount thus received from the general fund' by each commissioner as such per diem and mileage must not exceed $1,500.00 per year. For each day actually employed in directing road work in his district each member of the county board is also entitled to be paid the sum of five dollars per day to be paid out' of the road fund of his district (Laws 1931, Ch. 65). </seg>
            <seg id="p215">OPINIONS The county superintendent's compensation depends upon the county's school population which the state superintendent's office in - forms us is 6,308. If this is correct the county superintendent is entitled to an annual salary, to be fixed by the county board, of not less than twenty-one hundred dollars (33-130, C. S. 1929). We fnil to find any law which absolutely requires county officers to have deputies or other assistants and helpers. However, a general law (84-801, C. S. 1929&gt; allows the register of deeds, treasurer, sheriff, clerk and surveyor each one deputy (See also 33-132, C. S 1929) Bv a special statute (84-804, C. S. 1929) the county sheriff can appoint such number of deputies as he sees fit, subject to the county board's power in iU discretion lo fix the number and compensaton of such deputies (State v. Harris, 100 Neb. 745). Other statutory provsions for deputies assistants and helpers of county officers are as follows: A. Clerk, District Court. "If the clerk of the district court thinks necessary, said clerk may with the approval of the county board be allowed one deputy at a compensation of. not to exceed one-half of the amount paid the clerk of the court, and such other assistants at such compensation and for such time as the board may allow, all to be paid out of the general fund of the county" (Laws 1931, Ch. 65). B. Bailiffs, District Court. "The -judge of the district court may, if the business ol the court requires, appoint a bailiff or bailiffs in counties having less than 60,000 inhabitants the appointment shall continue only so long as is necessary .... Bailiffs shall receive for their services in counties having less than 60,000 inhabitants three dollars per day" (33-110, C. S. 1929). C. County Attorney. "The county attorney may appoint one or more deputies who shall act without any compensation from the county, to assist him in the disehar K e of his duties: Provided, the county attorney of any county may, under the direction of the district court, procure such assistance in the trial of a person charged with the crime of felony, as he may deem necessary for the trial thereof, and such assistant or assistants shall be allowed such compensation for his services as the county board shall </seg>

"Provided, further, in counties having more than sixteen thousand inhabitants, each register of deeds may appoint one deputy and such assistants as are necessary for the proper conduct of the office, all such appointments to be approved by the county board, and all deputies and f ssistants to be paid monthly out of the general fund of the county, to wit: In count - ies having more than sixteen thousand and less than twenty-five thousand (25,000) inhabitants, no more than twelve hundred (S1200.00) dollars per annum for the services of each deputy nor more than sixty dollars ($60.'.0) per calendar month for the services of each assistant" (Laws 1931, Ch. 65). E. Sheriff. "The Board of County Commissioners .... shall furnish the sheriff with such deputies as they shall deem necessary and shall fix the compensation of such deputy who shall be paid by warrant drawn on the general fund" (33-122, C. S. 1929). F. Assessor. "The compensation of the county deputy assessor and the precinct assessor shall be five dollars per day for the time actually and necessarily employed in the discharge of their duties. Vouchers for the amount claimed by the county deputy assessor and the precinct assessors as such compensation shall be approved by the county assessor before the claims are allowed by the county board" (Laws 1931, Ch. 69).

Dear Sir: You inquire whether one who has his name on a primary ballut as a candidate for a party nomination for office may also have his name on the same ballot as a candidate for election to the office of delegate to the national convention of a political party. The correct answer to the question you ask may not be entirely free from doubt but I am inclined to the opinion he may. 32-505 which provides that the name of no candidate shall appear on the ballot more than once was passed as a part of the general law and was last amended in 1903. four years before the primary ejection law was passed. When it was enacted it had reference solely to the ballots used at the general election and after the nominations had been made.

Lawson, State Surveyor, Capitol Building, Lincoln. Nebraska. Dear Mr. Lawson: You request an opinion from this office interpreting the provisions of Section 39-610, Compiled Statutes, 1929, requiring the perpetuation of corners of land surveys and providing for. the restoration of lost corners. . • From a consideration of both the language and the purpose of Section 39-610, Compiled Statutes. 1929, I am of the opinion that it imposes. a positive duty on the county surveyor to perpetuate corners which are liable to be obliterated or destroyed by road work or some other cause, and that the county surveyor is not required to wait until the Department of Public Works, the highway commissioners or road overseers notify him that any such corner is liable to be destroyed. I am further of the opinion that the county surveyor is entitled to his statutory compensation for perpetuating corners liable to be destroyed even though he has not been authorized by the county board to per - petuate such corners. " It is true that Section 39-610, Compiled Statutes, 1929, provides that it shall be the duly of the Department of Public Works, the high - way commissioner and every road overseer in the construction and maintenance of the public highways where work is to be done that may cause the destruction of any corners of land surveys, to notify ihe </seg>
            <seg id="p220">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL county surveyor, rnd Section 39-611 further provides that any road overseer, member of the township board, board of county supervisors, hoard of county commissioners or any highway con nnssioner who shall fail or neglect to notify the county surveyor of anv corner" that is liable to be destroyed shall be liable for the expense of the re-survey nnd restoration of such coiners lost or destroyed and for nny damage sustained by the. land owners by reason thereof. Tl is, however, does not, in my opinion, carry the inference that the surveyor must wait until so notified before he can take steps to nerpetuate corners liable to be destroyed. It merely imposes a duty to notify the surveyor of such cases on the officials nnmed as an additional safeguard against the destruction of these corners, inasmuch as both the state and federal governments regard the destruction of land survey corners as a very serious matter. Where the corner is actually lost so that a re-survey is necessary to establish it the county surveyor is not entitled to compensation for such re-survey from the county unless he has been ordered by the county board to make such re-survey to re-establish the lost corner. The term "lost corner' has been defined by the United States General Land Office in a pamphlet entitled "Restoration of Lost or Obliterated Corners and Subdivision of Sections", issued June 1, 1909. to be as follows: "A lost corner is one whose position can not be determined, beyond reasonable doubt, either from original marks or reliable external evidence." The same pamphlet points out that an obliterated corner is not the same as a lost corner, It defines an obliterated corner as follows: "An obliterated corner is one where no visible evidence remains of the work of the original surveyor, in establishing it. Its location may, however, have been preserved beyond all question by acts of landowners, and by the. memory of those who knew and recollect the true situs of the original monument. In such cases it is not a lost corner." I would say, in general, that any corner which it is possible to locate without a re-survey is not a "lest corner'' even though it may be obliterated so as to require some search and digging to locate it. but wherever there is danger that any corner, even though it is ob - literated, is liable to be destroyed by road work, so that all trace of it is lost, it becomes the absolute duty of the county surveyor to perpetu - ate such corner by proper means., and he is entitled to compensation </seg>

"Each day's receipts, after deducting the estimated daily ex - penses and the estimated amount necessary for reserve require- - ments. have been divided 50-50 into a Withdrawal Fund and a Loan Fund. The Withdrawal Fund has been used to retire ■ the withdrawal notices filed in the order filed. The Loan Fund has not been absorbed by making new loans and a substantial amount has accumulated in this fund out of which the Directors have been paying certain withdrawal requests irrespective of .what position they may held on the withdrawal list and in some cases funds have been' paid to shareholders who did not have a notice of withdrawal filed. "The.

Dear Governor: Pursuant to your request we have investigated the question pre - sented by Mrs. Sellhorn, Secretary of the Board of Cosmetology Exam - iners, as to whether a licensed barber who does fingerwaving could be successfully prosecuted for practicing cosmetology without a license. Section 71-2002, Compiled Statutes, 1929, defines "barbering"' as follows: "Any one or any combination of the following practices (when done upon' the upper part of the human body for cos - metic purposes and not for the treatment of disease or physical or mental ailments and when done for payment either directly or indirectly or without payment for the public generally), constitutes the practice of barbering.

It is my opinion that this definition' of barbering is not broad enough to include fingerwaving, . which is a method of dressing the hair but could hardly be c: lied, I tl ink, either cutting, singeing, shampooing or dyeing the hair or applying hair tonics.

DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND COMMERCE-BANK RECEIVER SHIPS-AUTHORITY OF SECRETARY TO RECEIVE pSdGE OF ASSETS TO SECURE DEPOSITS-PROTECTION FROM LOSS THROUGH FAILURE OF DEPOSITORY BANKS January 23, 1932. Hon. Charles W. Bryan, Governor of Nebraska, . State House. Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Governor Bryan: folloliitaLr^ *° y ° Ur rBCent f ° r ° UP °" inI ° n « «» First: Is the secretary of the department authorized to demand or cmT V ,%\ P M Be aSS6tS ° f a State bank to Becure de P° sit « °f «taS collected by the secretary as receiver of failed banks? </seg>
            <seg id="p226">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL In the case of Bliss v. Pathfinder Irrigation Tistrict, ense No. 28019, decided January 7, 1932, the Supreme Court of Nebraska held: "A Nebraska state bank is without nu'liority to pledpe any of its assets to secure a deposit of funds exce-it in these instances where it is expressly authorized so to do." The court suecificallv held in that case that sirce the irrigation district, though a "public" corporation was not a "municipality", it could not lawfully hold assets of a bank pledged to secure the district's deposits. The court in this connection was construing Section 77-2001. Comp. St., 1929, which cuthorizes suit on contracts securing deposits or loans of "public monevs, or other funds belonging to the state or to any county, school district, city or municipality." Since we fail to- find any statute wherein state banks are "ex - pressly authorized" tr&gt; pledge assets to secure banl;-receiyershir&gt; moneys, we are constrained to advise that such pledge is unlawful. Second: How may the secretary of the department protect these receivership funds and also himself as such receiver as against possibil - ity of loss due to the failure of the depository bank? In the Pathfinder Irrigation District case, supra, the court, in arriving at its conclusion concerning the pledging of assets to secure deposits, had occasion to refer to Section 8-140, Comp. St., 1929, which makes it a felony for any officer, director, stockholder or employee of a bank, or any other person, "to pay any money or give any consid - eration of value, or render any service for, "or at the request of, a depositor or any other person as an inducement, in addition to the legal interest, for making or retaining a deposit in the bank." Under this section the depositor is also guilty of a felony in any such case. In State v. Nebraska State Bank (Nebr. 1929) 225 N. W. 778 the last sentence of the section above quoted was up for consideration. The court said: . "The statute is highly penal and should be strictly con - strued — • "The purpose of the statute is to penalize corrupt agree - ment entered into with intention of evading the law as to allowable interest: and while contracts which plainly and inevitably result in an 'infraction are within the spirit of the prohibition, we do not think that the legislature intended to anathematize transactions not tainted with an evil purpose, and which merely may or may not result, arid that only incl- </seg>
            <seg id="p227">OPINIONS dentally, in nn unimportant advantage, and which can only be brought under the cendemnation of the statute by an attenuated process, of reasoning." In 7 C. J. 642, it is said: "A bank deposit may be subject to any agreement which the depositor and the bank may make with respect to it. so long as the rights of tl-.ird persons are not injuriously affected." In McFerson v. Nationi.1 Surety Co., 72 Colo. 482, 212 Pac. 489, the court held: "To obtain deposits a bank may give .security for them, and the giving of indemnifying bonds for such purpose is a matter of ordinary business within the bank's authority." In First American Bnnk &amp; Trust Co. v. Town of Palm Beach, (Fla, 1928) 117 So. 900, the court, quoting from U, S. F. &amp; G. Co. v. Village of Bassfield, 148 Miss. 109, 114 So. 26, said: " 'A bank may receive special, specific and general deposits and give security for them.' " — Citing Morse on Banks and Banking, Vol. 1, Sec. 63, p. 122. While the court might hold a surety bond furnished by the. bank to secure deposits to be an "inducement". for the deposit within the meaning of the above Section 8-140, we seriously doubt if it would do so. At any rate, until the court definitely holds that such a surety bond comes within the ban of the statute, we would say that a bank may secure a depositor by furnishing him a surety bond. If the furnishing of a surety bond is impossible or impracticable, investments of funds in liquid, guilt-edge securities might be author - ized by the court in the receivership proceedings. This method may or may not be practicable due to the condition of the investment securities market, the length of time the funds are to be. held before distribution., etc. As to the [ secretary's liability for possible loss of receivership funds by failure of depository banks, we believe his liability, unless other - wise specifically defined in his bond,' is not materially different from that of any other receiver or trustee. He is required as Euch fiduciary to exercise good faith and ordinary care or the "same degree of care and prudence which ordinarily careful men would exercise in similar matters." 53 C. J. 164, 156. We would suggest that he secure the </seg>

This question has been asked especially in regard to dividend payments to secured creditors. Section 8-1,102, Comp. St., 1929 pro - vides: . ' r "The claims of depositors, for deposits, not otherwise secured and claims of holders of exchange, shall have priority over all other claims, except federal, state, county and municipal taxes," etc. In the recent case of State ex rel. S6rensen, Attorney General v. First State Bank of Alliance, 239 N. W. 646, the court in applying this section to a secured deposit of city funds, held: "Where city, on state bank's insolvency, received proceeds of collateral securing deposits, claim for excess over proceeds of security is one 'otherwise secured.' and not entitled to share assets on equality with, depositors in class 'not otherwise secured'." .- .' This holding excludes all secured deposits from the class entitled to priority under Section 8-l,102,supra. Yours very truly, • C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General. . • By L. R. NEWKIRK.

Inasmuch as this land became the property of the state before the lien thereof of the 1930 tax accrued and lands belonging to the State are exempt from taxation by reason of both constitutional and statutory provisions it seems clear that the taxes under consideration never became a lien on the land and may be stricken from the tax list.

You refer to Sections 2714, 2723, 2731 and 5015, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922. With reference to the construction of these statutes you inquire as follows: "1.

In answer to your fiist question permit us to say that Section 5015 leaves no doubt that in cases of bridge work performed by the county the county surveyor or county engineer has charge of the work. Your county undoubtedly has a county surveyor and if it does, we see no reason why he would not be in charge rf this work under the. statute In answer to your second question permit us to say that Section 2714 leaves no doubt that brid S e jobs involving the expenditure of more than S500.00 must be let to competitive bidding. With this thought in mind we have heretofore consistently advised that when the county does the work itself it should advertise for bids for the material. We do not however, believe that it must advertise for bids for the labor or for any expense in connection with taking care of the labor, such as a cook-shack, supplies and food for the bridge gang. The language of the statute is that there must be a letting of bids when the cost and expense for furnishing materials in connection with the bridge exceed S500.00. Sincerely yours, C. A.

Dear Sir: ' I do not recall any provision of statute that fixes the time county offices must be open and in the absence of such a provision I doubt the legal right of the county board to dictate the time.

            <seg id="p231">OPINIONS The Civil Administrative Code Law provides that all secretaries, deputies, assistants and employees in the several departments shall work not less than eight hours each day except on Sundays, legal holidays and Saturdays.

State Auditor, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: , I have your letter of February 13th reading as follows: "My attention is directed to the action of the State Senate and later to your recent opinion respecting the qualifications for the heads of the several administrative departments under the Governor. "The Auditor's office cannot draw warrants ngains'fc-Htate-.— • funds except upon vouchers signed by proper officials for which a specific appropriation has been made. "May I. upon vouchers from departments where the Gover - nor has in charge some person known as a 'Deputy' or 'Code secretary', recognize the signature of the 'Deputy' or 'Assist - ant' as the 'Head' of the department? "In the past vouchers have been signed by the several secretaries of the several administrative departments,' certify - . ing that the claim is 'Just and Correct'. Such approval that the claim is just and correct is the authority which the auditor must require in passing upon vouchers as it is impossible for this office to check every item purchased or service rendered the state.' These vouchers, have in the past, also received the rubber stamp approval of the Governor appended in the Tax </seg>
            <seg id="p232">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Commissioner's office and wl ich I interpret as merely the approval of such an expenditure, but not certifying that the bill is correct and just. "If heads of the several administrative departments are not appointed and confirmed rs provided for, who is this office to recognize as the proper official to certify that the claims are correct and just from these various departments?" Section 84-304, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929, makes it the duty of the Auditor "to audit, adjust and settle all claims for services rendered or expenditures made for the benefit of the state." In the case of Fisher vs. Marsh, 113 Neb. 153, 202 N. W. 422, the Supreme Court of Nebraska declared that the State Auditor " before drawing a warrant must satisfy himself that the appropriation has been made within the biennium for the specific purpose for which the claim is filed, and that the claim is just. Section 84-307, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929, reads as follows: . . "The auditor, whenever he may think it necessary to the proper settlement of any account, may examine the parties, witnesses or others, on oath or affirmation, touching any matter material to be known in the settlement of such account." The lav/ dees not provide that claims for services performed by employees in the various Code departments have to be approved by the head of the department. It is of course a requirement that in your discretion you have a right to ask. In the absence of secretaries, the Governor is the head of each of such departments. Furthermore, by Section 81-108, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929, the Governor his authority to fix the salaries of all appointees in these departments. Therefore, under the circumstances, only by a statement from the Governor have you any way of knowing who the appointees are and what salary each one is to receive. The Governor is the proper official to certify that the claims in the various Code departments are just and correct. You state that the vouchers contain the rubber stamp approval of the Governor appended by the State Tax Commissioner. In our opinion that form of approval is the approval of the Governor. The fact that it is made with a rubber stamp is immaterial if the Tax Commissioner has the authority to use the stamp for the Governor. By Section 81-106, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929, the State Tax Commissioner is given specific authority to act for the Governor in the supervision </seg>

House Roll No. 281, Chapter 25 1929 Session Laws, appropriated forty thousand dollars for the payment of the salaries of the secretaries of the various Code departments. No part of this appropriation may be used to pay tbs salaries of clsrlts-, assistants, and deputies in the Code departments.

In said appropriation bill is the following restrictions: "No person receiving compensation from a 'Salaries and Wages' appropriation shall receive additional compensation from any 'Maintenance' appropriation, or from any appropria - tion of fees.

LEGISLATURE— RIGHT OF MEMBER TO HOLD OFFICE OF DEPUTY COUNTY ASSESSOR— PROCEDURE TO TEST RIGHT September 18, 1931. Honorable Henry J. Beal, • County Attorney, • . . Omaha, Nebr. Dear Mr. Beal: . Your letter of August 31st at hand in which you say: "A delegation of five people were in to see me about bring - ing quo warranto against C. K. </seg>
            <seg id="p234">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "It seems that Mr. K was a member of the last legislature and introduced a bill, which was later passed, creating the job . - of Field Deputy under County Assessor Sam Greenleaf. Then a month ago Greenleaf appointed K to this position, and these people contend he has no right to hold this position, and ask that quo warranto be brought against him. "I would appreciate it if your office could handle this quo warranto." '"■.'■ As I understand it the contention is that the appointment of Mr. K. is in violation of Section Hi of Article 3 of the State Constitution which reads as follows: . "No person elected or appointed to the Legislature shall receive any civil appointment to a state office during the term for which he has been elected or appointed, and all such ap - pointments shall be void; nor shall any member of the Legis - lature, or any state officer be interested, either directly or in - directly in any contract, with the state or any county or munici- ■ pality thereof, authorized by any law enacted during the term for which he shall have been elected or appointed, or within one year after the expiration of such term." ■ The first question is whether or not K received "any civil.appoint - ment to a state office". I do not think so. The office of deputy . county assessor in our opinion is not a. state office. - In Hastings v. Jasper, 314 Mo. 144, 282 S. W. 700, it was recently held: "We have held that the words 'state officers' as used in the constitution refer to such -officers whose official duties and functions are coextensive with the {government of the state. Following this rule, we have held that a sheriff, deputy sheriff, and a clerk of the circuit court are not state officeis for the reason that their jurisdiction is confined to a county." In other crses digested in Words and Phraees, state officers are ti.us distinguished from county offices. This dis - tinction was also, in my opinion, known, intended and observed by the framers of our Art. Ill, Sec. 16. This intent to confine the disability to state as distinguished from county offices, is even plainer in the former constitution (1875, Art. Ill, Sec. 13) where the current, elected legislator was declared ineligible to "any civil appointment within the state from the governor and senate." When the present, 1020, Art. Ill, Sec. 16 was submitted to the electors, it was explained by the framers that the amendment was only for the purpose of imparting the disability to current appointed as well as to current elected legis - lators (See Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention, 1919-1920, Vol. II. Page 2842). The amendment left undisturbed the class of offices for which the legislator's disqualification existed. </seg>
            <seg id="p235">OPINIONS The second question is whether or not K is disqualified for the deputyship by being "interested, either directly or indirectly in any contract, with the state or any' county or municipality thereof, author - ized by any law enacted during the term for which he shall have been elected or appointed, or within one year after the expiration of such term." • We doubt that K's relationship to the county is based upon a contract. A public office is not based upon a contract — 46 C. J. 928, Note 95. In Baker v. State, 112 Neb. 654, 200 N. W. 876, the Supreme Court of Nebraska held that a deputy county treasurer was a public of - ficer subject to the laws with reference to county officers. The interest of Mr: K in the deputyship is in the compensation and emoluments there - of which he is entitled to receive if nt all not by reason of any contract but by reason of appointment to the office. ' "Where provision is made by statute for the position of deputy, such deputy is appointed as a public officer." 46 C. J. 1062, Note 90; 1063, Notes 4, 5, and 6. It is also suggested, we understand, that Mr. K violated his oath as a" legislator by accepting this deputyship. The oath required K among other things to refrain from accepting any promise of office for supporting any bill. No proof has been presented to us that there was any agreement between the county assessor and Mr. K that Mr. K would, be appointed a deputy if the hill raising the salary of the assessor was passed. But assuming for the purpose of argument that the charge is true, we do not believe that it is a basis for quo warranto action. His oath is what is known in law as a "promissory oath". Under the Constitution each House of the Legislature is the sole judge of the qualifications of its members and it has been repeatedly held that "this power is exercised to the exclusion of every other tribunal". — 25 R. C. L. 379, Note 5. If a special session of the Legislature should be called, undoubtedly the question of whether or not Mr. K has violated his legislative oath could- be raised by some member. I doubt seriously the right of any court to disqualify Mr. K as a legislator on the scle ground of having violated his oath. For a reason that has not been mentioned, however, I am inclined to believe that Mr. K is not entitled to hold his position. Said House Roll 346 is entitled, "an act to amend Section 33-129, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929, relating to fees and salaries; to provide a schedule of salaries for county assessors in counties hav - ing a population of over . one hundred thousand and less than two hundred thousand, and in counties haying a' population of over two hundred thousand and to repeal said original section." </seg>
            <seg id="p236">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL It is observed that this title makes no mention of a purpose or object to create the offices of chief field deputy and chief office deputy to the assessor in counties of oveir two hundred thousand people. However, the text of said law purports to create said offices and certain other employments in the following language:' "He (county assessor in counties having a population of over two hundred thousand) shall have two chief deputies; a chief field deputy- whose salary shnll be three thousand drllars per annum, and a chief office deputy whose salary shnll be twenty-five hundred dollars per annum; and such other clerks, and assistants to be appointed by him as the county board may . find to be necessary whose compensation shall be fixed by the county board." The title of this law thus confines it to the subject of compensation of county assessors. The text expands the law to include not only compensation of county assessors but the provision of additional official and non-official help to county assessors in certain classes of counties. A question therefore arises as tq whether this law complies with the following provision of Sec. 14, Article III, Nebraska Constitution: "No bill shall contain more than one subject which shall be clearly expressed in its title." The following quotations from Ruling Case Law are very instruc - tive: - ' "There can be no surer test of compliance with the con - stitutional requirement of singleness of. subject than that none of the provisions of an act can he read as relating or germane to any other subject than the one named in the. title." — 25 R. C. L. 844, Note 11. "There is not a sufficient compliance with the consti - tutiontal requirement if. the act is broader than the title, even though other provisions .besides those contained in the act could have been included in one act having a single broader . subject expressed in its title, and so much of the law as is not " embraced in the title is invalid." — 25 R. C. L. 866, Notes 3-5. "The constitutional requirement is violated where the body of a statute covers a subject affecting a class that is broader and more comprehensive th'an the one expressed in the title."— 25 R. C.

SORENSEN, Attorney General, CITIES AND VILLAGES— FRANCHISE TO POWER COMPANY - MAXIMUM RATE FIXED— POWER OF COMPANY TO RAISE RATE SO FIXED August 24, 1931. Mr. R. R. AJlison. "The Laurel Advocate", Laurel, Nebraska. Dear Sin . . &lt; In your letter of August 14, 1931, you inquire: "Supposing that the people of this town voted to. sell to them (high line companies) the local plant and grant them a franchise in which the rates were specifically stated, would it be possible for the high line company at some later date, while the franchise was still in effect, to raise their rates by application to the railroad commission or any other body that might have jurisdiction? Would the rates stated in the fran - chise be compulsory on the company to whom the franchise is granted? Is the franchise a contract between the two parties or not and w.hat would be action if the company at any time did desire to raise their rates over those stated in the franchise." The questions asked are so bound together as to the subject matter involved that we will attempt to answer them without reference to their order. </seg>
            <seg id="p239">OPINIONS Assuming that Laurel is a village as distinguished from a city of the second class, the pertinent statutory law is found in Sections 17-427 and 17-440, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929, as foHows: "In- addition to the powers hereinbefore granted cities and villages under the provisions of this chapter each city and village may enact ordinances for the following purposes: (1879 p. 210; 1S81 p. 172; 1883 p. 117; 1885 p. 162; 1887 p. 291; Ann. 8912; Comp. 1788; R. S. 1913, 5105; C. S. 1922, 4278.)" "To grant a franchise to and make a contract with any person, company or association for the privilege of granting to such person, company or association the furnishing of light for the streets, Innes, alleys and other public places and prop - erty of said city and the inhabitants thereof, and to levy a tax for the purpose of paying the crsts of such lighting the streets, lanes, alleys and other public places and property of said city; and the furnishing of power to the residents, citizens and corporations doing business in such city. ((1887 p. 295; 1895 p. Ill; 1905 p. 252; Ann 8926; Comp. 1802; R. S. 1913, 5118; C. S. 1922, 4291)." These sections are practically identical to those formerly relating to. like powers of secnod-class cities in this state. Therefore, the decision of our Supreme Court in the case of City of University Place v. I.inc - coln Gass &amp; Electric Light Co., 109 Neb. 370, 191 N. W. 432 (1922) may be regarded as authority on part of the questions you present. That case in an opinion by Judge Redick, ably reviews several of the leading cases in this country and holds: "By Section 1708, Comp. St., 1909, set forth in the opinion, a city of. the second class not having - power, to regulate rates . had power to contract for the furnishing of gas to the city and its inhabitants and fix therein a maximum charge for such service." "An ordinance reciting 'that, in consideration of the rights and privileges granted herein, the grantees shall have a right to charge not in excess of. S1.50 per 1,000 cubic feet of gas,* etc. .which is accepted by the company, constitutes a contract the obligation of which may not be impaired by either party." The court, however, left undecided the specific question you raise as to the power of the Slate to step in, through direct legislative action or by some regulatory body, and abrogate the franchise contract in so far as it attempts to fix rates. The court said in this connection: </seg>
            <seg id="p240">. REPORT OF ATTORNKY GENERAL "Whether or not the state by the exercise of its paramount authority to reguiate rates which may be charged- by public utility corporations, may intervene upon a showing that the rate fixed by the contract is unreasonable or confiacatory," not decided." . While that decision, standing alone, seems to leave the question open in this state, we have other decisions by our Supi-i-inc Court th'af are more definite on this point. For example, in the case of Marquis V. Polk County Telephone Co, 100 Neb^ 140, 1&amp;8 N. W. 9£7, it was held: "Unless expressly authorized and empowered by the legis - lature so to do. a municipal corporation has no power by con - tract to deprive the state of the lifjht of regulation of rates of a public service corporation." "A contract or agreement made in a franchise ordinance by which the maxiuum rates to be charged by a telephone company for the u£e of telephones by the inhabitants of the city are determined is made subject to the right of regulation." "Since the adoption of the constitutional amendment cre - ating the state railway commission and the passage of the iaw . specifying the duties of said commission, that body has power to regulate the rates charged for the use of telephones in cities of the second class." The federal courts, for the most part, follow the decisions of the state courts in construing state constitutional and statutory provisions as applied to the questions raised. Therefore the decisions of our own Supreme Court, will, in all likelihood govern in any suit in the fed - eral courts involving these questions. We would say that the weight of opinion in this country and, we believe, the view of our own courts may be summed up in four rules, as follows: 1st: That if the power to contract as to rates has been granted by the legislature to the municipality, a contract entered- into between the municipality and a public utility company will be valid and binding as between the parties, whether or not the rates later prove excessive or inadequate. 2nd: That it is legally possible for the state to thus limit or sus - pend its sovereignty in the exercise of its police power if the term involved is not unreasonable in point of time. ' </seg>
            <seg id="p241">OPINION'S 3rd: That suspension of such police power will be given strict construction in favor' of the stale. 4th: Whether the state may abrogate or terminate such contract - ual provisions by later legislation or regulation through public utility commissions will be. determined by the particular constitutional and statutory provisions in each slate, as construed by the highest courts thereof; and, in the absence of such construction the federal courts will make their own construction, resolving every doubt in favor of the inherent or reserved power of the state. A late decision of the federal Supreme Court is in the case of Raidroad Commission of California v. Los An K cles Railroad Corpor - ation, 280 U. S. M5. 74 L. Ed. 232. 50 S. Ct. 71. ..The following are pertinent excerpts from the opioion of the. court in that case: "I- H is possible for a state to authorize a municipal cor - poration by agreement to establish public service rates and thvreby to suspend for a term of years not grossly excessive the exertion of governmental power by legislative action to fix just compensation to be paid for service furnished by public utilities. Detroit v. Detroit Citizens' Ry. Co., 184 VS. 368, x --. 382, 22 S. Ct. 410, 40 L. Kd. 592; Vic: sburg v. Vicksburg Water Works Co., 206 U. S. 496. 508. 515, 27 S. Ct. 762, 51 L.

And where a ci'.y. empowered by the state so to do, makes a contract with a public utility fixing the amounts to bo paid for its service, the latter may not be required to serve for less even if the specified rates are unreasonably, high. Detroit v. Detroit Citizens' Ry. Co_ supra, 184 U. S. 389, 22 S. Cl. 410, 46 L. Ed. 592.

Ed. 273; Denney v. Pacific Tel. Co, 276 U. S. 97, 48 S. Ct. 223, 72 L. Ed. 483." There was a strong dissent by three justices (Brandeis, Holmes and Stone) in that' case. Although both parties in the suit agreed that, under the constitution and laws of California the commission, although established after the contract in question, could legally abrogate the rates therein established, there was a sharp issue as to whether it had actually done so. Justice Brandeis also raised the point that the grant of the franchise was sufficient consideration to bind the company to the contract rate, and, on this point we believe that your village nan secure for itself the maximum of protection, even assuming that the state may later abrogate the contract. That is to say if in your fran - chise contract you make the very existence and life of the grant de - pend upon the rate or maximum rate you fix in the grant, the courts will have difficulty in sustaining a continuance of such life or term in the face of an increased rate from whatever source such increased rate may be authorized. . As held in the university case and by the federal court of this circuit in the case of Nebraska Gas &amp; Electric Co. V. Stromsburg, 2 F. (2d) 520, the contract as between the parties' will be binding. Therefore, if the continued existence of the maximum rate is necessary to the continued existence of the life of the grant, there would seem to be no good reason why the courts., after nn increase over such maximum rate, should force the village to continue on a bargain expressly repudiated in the grant itself. Since a village in this state has now no power to regulate rates of public utilities, and since there is now no public regulatory body in charge of this matter, it would seem that the fixing of maximum rates in any proposed franchise to a private utility company is al - together advisable for the protection of the people's rights. Whether therefore, it is possible for the state to abrogate those rates is at present an academic question. At least -temporary protection is af - forded and, as above suggested, it is altogether possible 'that con - ditioning the life of the grant on the continued existence, of such maximum rates may. for all practical purposes, prove to be an absolute protection to the village against excessive rates, Legally, of course, in case rates are not fixed in the franchise, any excessive rate is subject to attack in the courts, but since the courts do not fix rates, their power is limited to simply annulling such excessive rates. Practically, therefore, especially in the case of a village with limited funds and experience in such matters, it will find its chief protection in the ex - press terms of the franchise it grants. </seg>

Each figure in a fraction must also be 3 inches in height, .he placard or sign on which the figures are posted must not be less than 8 inches by 10 inches in dimension and must have a white background.

Your request for an opinion, under date of December 22, 1930, has come to us through the Department of Trade and Commerce. You inquire as to the right of membeis of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association to vote at stockholders' meetings, both at elections for directors and on all other questions, and as to the number of votes the members may cast. You classify the lembers as follows: 1. Holders of more than one "fully paid share." 2. Holders of "installment stock certificates," (a) Having a credit balance of less than $50.00; (b) Having a credit balance of more than $50.00 and less than S100.00; (c) Having a credit of $100.00 or more. 3. Holders of "loan . stock." We will outline our opinion under these classifications. Under Art. IV of the Articles of Incorporation of this association it is provided that "every matured share shall have a matured value of $110.00." This clause fixes .the par of all stock. Art. IV also in accord with 8-302, Comp. St. Neb., 1929 (Sec. 8084, Comp. St. Neb,, 1922), provides: "The capital stock of the association shall consist of the cumulative payments made by the members and dividends credited thereto and shall be represented by shares.' Article I of the Constitution (by-laws) of the association limits each member to fifty shares owned "in his own right"; and provides "any person may become a member by becoming an owner of one or more shares either by subscription or by transfer." </seg>

            <seg id="p250">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL businesses, this rule would still prevail. However, it is at once appar - ent that to allow voting rights to installment shareholders equal, in proportion to the par value - of their stock, to the voting rights of holders of fully paid shares upsets the balance or mutuality, so char - acteristic of this type of corporation. A subscriber of. $5,030.00 in - stallment stock who had paid only a small fraction of the par value of such shares would thus have voting privileges equal to those of a holder of 35,000.00 pai-d up -stock. As a matter of plain justice and application of the principle- of mutuality such a rule should not no-w be in effect. In the absence of statute, however, the question would . still present considerable difficulty. Our statute seems to settle this question. It provides: "The capital stock of every such association shall consist of the accumulated payments made by its members and dividends credited thereon, and shall be represented by shares." The only fair construction of this provision, as applied to voting rights or installment shares is that payment is essential to make any share constitute a part of the capital stock. It therefore follows, as stated in 14 C. J. 902: • ■ . ' ■ ■ ■' "It is obvious that whi^n payment is essential to the owner - ship of the stock, one who has not made the payment essential to the acquisition of ownership is not entitled to vote it." The statute by thus characterizing enpital stock as stock paid for would seem clearly to require that installment payments which, in the aggregate, together with credited dividends equrl the par value of one or more fully paid shares, should entitle the payor to vote the number of shares thus represented. We believe the rule stated in 14 C. J. 902, to be applicable: "It has been held that one who under a contract will be entitled to a stated number of shares on payment of a certain sum may vote such a proportionate part of such shares as is equal to the propor - tion of payment which he has made, notwithstanding he hns not com - pleted the entire payment." Since a whole share is the accepted unit in corporate capitaliza - tion, organization and management (See 165 Fed. 945, syl. 15), we see no right in the member who has paid only an amount equal to a fractional part of the par value of a single share, to vote as to such fractional share, there being no statute or provision in the articles or by-laws to the contrary. </seg>

Dear Sir: In answer to your inquiry of January 9 wherein you state that you have built up a fund from the operation of an electric distribu - tion system of the village and inquire as to powers of disposition of such fund. We are of the opinion that under the provisions of Section 17-516, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929 (Laws 1929, Page 193) the board may by resolution authorize this fund to be transferred to the general fund of the village. As a part of such fund it may in our opinion be devoted without a vote of the people to the payment of legally incurred indebtedness of the village. Although case of Carr v. Fenstermacher, 228 N. W. 114, decided by our Supreme Court on December 10, 1929, might be considered as authority for the proposition that the fund would be available to be applied on new contracts without going through the procedure of statutory appropriation, we would not advise such application with - out a vote of the people, except as hereinafter stated. Under the provisions of the recent power law adopted as an in - itiative measure by the voters of the state at the last election the vil - lage is authorized to pledge revenues of a plant to pay the cost there - of and, under the holding of the case above mentioned this fund could also be thus employed without vote of the people and solely upon the authority of the board, Therefore. . if you should desire to immedi - ately enlarge the present plant the board could authorize the applica - cation of this surplus fund to the payment of the cost of such im - provements and could pledge (without binding the village generally) the net revenues from the operation of such plant to pay the balance of such cost. If you have in mind entering into some form of new contract bind - ing the village generally we would suggest that the board transfer the fund in question to the general fund and that the appropriation be authorized by an election or petition as provided in the usual case of an appropriation not provided for in the annual appropriation ordin - ance. . ■ Yours very truly," C.

River Bridge Board of Trustees. ■■■••■'. Gentlemen: We have a copy of the opinion of Hon. John F. Morlarty, City Attorney of Omaha, under date of December 5th, 1930, upon the fol - lowing questions submitted to him by your honorable board: 1. May the city council or the electors of the city of Omaha issue bonds of the city of Omaha, to aid in the financ - ing of a bridge to be built across the Missouri River, pursuant to the provisions of an Act of Congress, popularly known as the Howell-Trustee Plan? "2. If no authority 'exists under present law to issue such bonds, how may such authority be acquired?" In our opinion, the electors c-f the city of Omaha may, under ex - isting laws, vote at a general election or at a special election called for the purpose to issue bonds of the city to aid in such financing. This matter is governed by the provisions of 14-1201 to 14-1228, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929, a law passed by the legislature in 1929 (Laws 1929. Ch. 176). This law is very broad in its scope and is applicable to the bridge proposed to be erected under the provisions of the "Howell-Trustee Plan" (House Roll 9806, Sec. 3; 71st Congress, 2nd. Session). • . / The recent decision of the Supreme Court of Nebraska in the case of Carlberg v. Metcalf, (No. 27675, Dec, 23, 1930) is to our minds most pertinent. That decision involved the question of the establishment by vote of the electors of the city of Omaha of a municipal university under the provisions of Chapter 200, Laws of 1929 (14-1301 to 14-1320, Comp. St.. 1929). Objection to this statute and to the vote at a recent city election to establish such university was made that the law was in conflict with the Home Rule Charter of the city of Omaha, and that the whole matter, being one of purely municipal concern as distin - guished from state concern or interest, was governed by the Home Rule Charter. The court reviewed its decisions on the scope and effect of the Home Rule Charters in this state, and held as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p256">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "It is the well-established law of this state that, in mat - ters of strictly municirjal concern, cities which have adopted a home rule charter under article XI of the Constitution are not subject to state legislation. But, In such cities state legis - lation is not excluded upon such subjects as pertain to state affairs as distinguished from strictly municipal affairs." "Education has always been a matter of stnte concern in Nebraska, as distinguished from a matter of strictly municipal concern." "The schools, in which are educated the children who are to become in time the directors of our political destinies, are matters of state and not of strictly municipal concern.'' "The constitutional provision by which certain cities may adopt a home rule charter does not render invalid legislation which provides that such a city may establish and maintain a municipal university." "In accepting the privilege conferred upon it by such legislation, the city, in providing said educational institution, acts as a political subdivision of the state in a matter of state concern." In our opinion, the matter of the construction and operation of s bridge across the Missouri River at Omaha is even more distinctly one of "state concern' 'than is a municipal university in that city. The bridge will extend not only beyond the city's borders but into an adjoining state; it will cross a navigable stream which is peculiarly a subject of federal jurisdiction and control; it will be a most important part of the state and federal highway system, forming. a neck of the bottle through which a large volume of traffic and commerce between this state, Iowa and many other states of the union will flow. A strictly governmental as distinguished from corporate or proprietary function is involved. The city in aiding in the financing of this project, as stated in the municipal University case acts as a "political subdivision of the state in a matter of state concern." Its power and authority is not derived from; limited by or subject to the provisions of the Home Rule Charter. The act of the legislature (Ch, 200, Laws 1929) is distinctly one of the "laws of this state" to which city charters in Nebraska are subject (Const, of Nebr., Art. XI, Sec. 2). We agree with Mr. Moriarty to the extent that as a matter of precaution, the city charter might be amended. We would not regard such a step necessary but it would do no harm and, if we should turn out mistaken in the view above expressed, it would be vital to the val - idity of the bonds. However, such a charter amendment could be Bub- : - </seg>
            <seg id="p257">OPINIONS mitted at the same time the question of issuance of bonds is submitted to the electors. In fact, the amendment itself might be framed to incorporate the bond features, This would avoid an extra election. • We see no legal objection against providing for reimbursement to the city for thus aiding the project by pledging and assigning tolls from the bridge, subject to any prior liens or charges which the bridge and tolls therefrom may be subjected to in the main plan of financing the project. This feature would, no doubt, prove of con - siderable benefit in procuring a favorable vote at such election, in view of Omaha's past experiences in submitting bridge proposals to the voters. It might be feasible to secure the bonds themselves by sinking fund provisions based upon toll receipts. The franchise to the trustees certainly contemplates and authorizes such a plan. There is, of course the practical difficulty of making the maturity date of the bonds con - form with the time of receipt of tolls, especially if the bonds are sub - ject to underlying securities which must be first paid out of tolls. Callable or optional provisions would, perhaps, solve this practical difficulty. Yours very truly, G. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General. By L. R. NEW KIRK, Assistant Attorney General.

Villages have power to enforce all ordinances by inflicting fines or penalties for the breach thereof not exceeding 100.00 for any one offense, recoverable with costs, and in default of pay - ment to provide for confinement in prison or in jail, and at hard labor upon the streets or elsewhere for the benefit of the village (Section 17-428. Comp. St., 1929), Fines may in nil cases, and in addition to any other mode provided, be recovered by suit or action before a justice of the peace, or other court of competent jurisdiction, in the name of the state (Sec. 17-504, Comp. St., 1929). These statutes tend to show that suits for the recovery of fines under village ordinances, or, as they are sometimes called, prosecutions for the violation of village ordinances ' are regarded- by general law as within justice-r'f-the-peace jurisdiction. However, Sections 18-201 to Sections 18-214, Comp, St., 1929, provide for the organization of police courts in cities and villages. These give to the police magistrate ex - clusive jurisdiction of offenses against village ordinances (Sec, 18-201). They also provide for the appointment by the chairman of the village board of an elector of the village, to serve as police magistrate during the absence of regularly elected, duly qualified and acting police mag - istrates (Sec. 18-212). Conformity and compliance with all these statutes would seem to require an appointment of the township justice to the place of police magistrate of the village if it is desired to have him try offenses against the village ordinances.

"A must pay the tax on the real estate. Must A. pay the intangible tax? He contends that it is double taxation." </seg>
            <seg id="p260">REI : ORT OF ATTORNKY GENERAL The contract for a warranty deed appears to have been erroneously lisle-d for intangible taxation under Sections 77-701 Vi 77-713. Comp.

"An executory enntract'for tie sr-le of land rnder which the vendee is entitled to or does take possession" is deeded a mortgage &lt;&gt;f the hind for the unpaid balance of the purchase price under Section 77-1501, Comp. St.. 1929. This contract "for a warranty deed wns, therefore taxable as provided by Sections 77-1501 to 77-15:5, relating to the taxation of mortgages. According to this law. the payment of the full tax on the land for the current year included payment of the - full tax on the mortgage or contract interest in said land. If ir addition to paying the tax on the land, after having taken the same back for default under the contract, A. is' required to. pay the in - tangible tax. on the contract, the taxation wiU be double. While there is nothing unconntitutional about double taxation the revenue laws of the state are ■ so construed anl applied us to avoid it wherever possible. Thus the intangible tax law (Sees. 77-701 to 77-713) excludes mortgages on Nebraska real estate from intangible taxation, and said mortgages including executory contracts for the sale of land are taxed as provided by Sees. 77-1501 to 77-1505. We are accordingry of the opinion that A. having paid the full tax on the land for the current year, Has therein and thereby paid all taxes legally due and owing for said year on the contract for ti deed, which as aforesaid, is not subject to intangible taxation. Under Section 77-1006; "the county clerk, with the approval of the county board, may correct the tax list before the tax is paid in case of erroneous assessments." Should the clerk and board fail to strike the intangible tax on this contract for a deed from the tax list.

Nebraska. ..'.•'■' Dear Sir: You say: "School District No. 98 of York County, Nebraska, at their annual meeting in June 1930, voted to raise the sum of $900 00 by taxation. The county superintendent's records show a request for $900.00 from District No. 98. The assessed valuation of the District No. 98 is $279,440.00 which includes both personal and real property. The county clerk of York County placed a levy on the personal and real property of District No 98 of 4.06 mills. The county clerk delivered to the county treasurer the tax books early in October of 1930. Some of the personal taxes in District No, 98 have already been paid. </seg>
            <seg id="p262">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "County clerk states to the ccunty treasurer that school district No. 98 has a building fund and county trecsurers' office has no record of such a -building fund.

He does not state to the county treasurer what the increase in the levy amounts to in mills." You inquire: "1. Can county clerk take real estate tax books from the treasurer's office in January 1931, and change tax levies made on real estate in school district No. 98? "2. Can county clerk come to treasurer's office and change, either real or personal tax books after they have been deliver - ed to county treasurer for collection, except to correct, a mani - fest error?" I will endeavor to answer your questions in the order in which they are asked. 1. I do not recall any provision of statute which in express terms authorizes the county clerk to take the real estate tax books from the county treasurer's office after they have been delivered but 77-10(Xi does provide among other things that: "The county clerk may correct" the tax list before the tax is paid, in case of clerical errors, and the county clerk, with the approval of the county board, may correct the tax list be - fore the tax is paid in case of erroneous assessments, and in making such corrections a record shall be kept of the same • in the back part .of the tax list, showing all additions and re - ductions, the amount of tax added or reduced, with the reason therefor, and the page upon which such change was mr.de, all changes to be made in red ink, drawing a line through the original or erroneous figures' but not erasing the same." This seems to me to be authority for a change in erroneous assess - ments under certain conditions where the taxes have not been paid. It is quite possible that none of the 1930 taxes on real estate in District No. 98 had been paid at the time the change was made.

I am of the opinion the county clerk may go to the office of the county treasurer and there make changes in the tax list to correct clerical errors and erroneous assessments if the treasurer will give him access to the books for that purpose and if he does not exceed the authority given him by 77-1006. That means he should have the ap - proval of the county board in the matter of changing erroneous assess - ments. Yours very truly, C. A. SORENSEN. Attorney General. By GEORGE W.

Section 39-1308 requires the highway 'commissioner, prior to the first day of January of each year to file a written report with the county board of all work performed the amount of funds available for road work, the amount expended, balance on hand, etc. He also should make such recommendations as. he deems necessary for further im - provements. Other duties too numerous to mention are prescribed in the stat - utes but the above noted provisions give a general idea of the nature of his duties. It was apparently the intention of the legislature that the general questions of policy regarding the building and maintaining roads and bridges, such as the determining of what roads or bridges should be constructed or repaired, the amount of money to be expended on such projects, raising of the money, etc. should be determined by the county board, while the actual work of building or repairing such roads or bridges, once the board had decided that this should be done, is left to the county highway commissioner, who is authorized to exercise his own judgment as to how the work shall be done provided it is done in a manner satisfactory to the county board. The county board, with reference to highway construction and re - pair, exercises the legislative functions of government. while the high - way commissioner exercises the executive functions. The board, in' its powers and duties, corresponds to the board of directors of a cor - poration while the highway commissioner corresponds to the general manager of the business who has actual charge of the business subject to the general policy outlined by the board. It is a special application of the fundamental principle which pervades our system, of govern - ment that the legislative and executive branches of government should be kept separate — one officer or group of officers makes the laws or determines the policy of the government, and another officer or group executes and enforces them.

You inquire ss to the right of the state welfare department to revoke the license of a dentist for operating what is called an "adver - tising office". You ask if you are permitted to advertise fees and the various forms of work done, either by window signs, cards, news - papers, or. radio. In our opinion a dentist is entitled to advertise his business, the scale of fees charged, the forms of work performed and services rendered, as long as his advertising contains nothing which is false or misleading, and is done strictly in his own name and not under the name of someone else or some company or corporate name. The law makes unprofessional conduct a ground for revocation of license, and defines unprofessional conduct to be any of the follow - ing acts: ■ ■ ■ I ■ • ' ' "1. Solicitation of professional patronage by agents or persons popularly known as 'cappers' or 'steerers,' or by profit - ing by the acts of those representing themselves to be agents of the licensee. 2. Receipt of fees on the assurance that a manifestly incurable disease can be permanently cured. 3. Div - ision of fees or agreeing to split or divide the fees received for professional services j with any person for bringing or re - fering a patient or assisting in the care or treatment of a patient without the consent of said patient or his legal repre - sentative. 4. Advertisement of any medicine or means where - by the monthly periods \ of women can be regulated Or the menses reestablished if supressed. 5.

Dear Sir: . . • ■ You inquire: "What are the qualifications of a county superintendent in a county -of less than two thousand population? "Also can an election to an office be contested ' after the candidate has taken office?" ' In answer to your first question I will say that 79-1501 does not specify any qualifications for a county superintendent in a county hav - ing Jess than 2000 population. I presume it may be implied that the superintendent should be a citizen of the United States and a resident of the county and at least twenty-one years of age. Possibly it may be inferred that he should also be the holder of some kind of certifi - cate, although the section of statute under consideration does .not ex - pressly say so. . | ,.-..-, Whatever qualifications he is required to have in order to hold the office he should have at the time of the election, I am of the opinion that the contest of an election should be com - menced within twenty days after, the votes are counted.

County Attorney, Albion, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In answer to your recent letters regarding the right of a party claiming a car under a conditional sales contract to take possession of it after it has been taken in the act of unlawfully transporting liquor, I think the law is clear that such party, by vtluntarily yielding poss - ession of. the car to one who has used it for illegal transportation of liquor thereby forfeits all property rights in the car. This seems to be the plain import of the language of Section 53-137, Comp, St., 1929, and is the holding of our Supreme Court in Sandlovich v. Hawes, 113 Neb. 374, 203 N.W. 541. This seems to be the last case decided which involves that point. . • As to the right to tax as costs against the defendant money paid out by the sheriff to informers in an endeavor to locate the defendant, I doubt very much if this can be done. It is true, as you suggest, that, under Section 53-151 money paid out for liquor can be so. taxed as costs, but I find no provision authorizing money spent on informers to secure evidence. Section 53-135 specifically provides that county boards shall pay ''all bills incurred — for the detection and punishment of all violations of this act, and for all inquiries arid proceedings of every nature for the purpose of disclosing evidence," etc., but there appears to be no provision for taxing such expenses as costs against the defendant.

Gentlemen: i ■ • ■ Speaking for the Village of Lindsay you make a statement of fact and propound inquiries as fellows: "The City Treasurer is a stockholder and officer of the only bank in the Village, which refuses to apply to become a depository or to furnish bond. The Village Treasurer ar - • ranged to procure a surety company bond, but in order to procure same the Board of Trustees was advised that it must expressly waive the furnishing of a depository bond by the bank. "In your opinion, is the provision of the section requiring the deposit in a state bank doing business in the village mand - atory in all cases, or under the above circumstances, is the village entitled to arrange for the keeping of its funds else - where? "Will the Board . of Trustees assume any liability in ex - pressly waiving the furnishing of a depository bond and the' keeping of the moneys in a regularly designated bonded de - pository? "Assuming that a depository bond can be procured, is the village legally entitled to arrange to reimburse the depository either for the cost of the bond or by way of a service charge, such charges to be regularly approved and paid by warrant and' not deducted from the interest payable by the depository." . I will endeavor to answer your questions in the order in which they are asked. 1. 17-515 does not in terms require a state bank to give bond to secure a deposit of city money. It expressly exempts state banks from the requirement that a bond shaU be required to secure a deposit of city money. </seg>
            <seg id="p270">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL It is probable that this exemption is an oversight, but I -think it doubtful if a city treasurer can be held for a deposit of city money in a state bank in his town which has been approved by the city or town board. This does not apply to school district money which the city or villiage treasurer may have in his possession as school district treasurer. I know of no statute which authorizes the deposit of school dist - rict money in a bank by the district treasurer under any circumstances, 2. I take it that the lnw requires the village funds to be kept in some bank in the village provided there is such a bank which will agree to act as a depository and to pay interest at the rate of two per cent at least upon the average amount of the deposit. If the bank in which the deposit is to be made is a national bank, it is also required to furnish a depository bond, I know of no law which authorizes a deposit of city or village funds in .1 bank "outside the city or village. 3. The Board of Trustees assumes no personal liability in my opinion in authorizing the deposit of village money in a state bank in the village which has. not given bond provided it asks to be made a depostory and will pay the two per cent interest on the deposit. 4. I know of no law. at the present time which authorizes a village board to pay for a depository bond. It is quite possible, I think that the present Legislature will pro - vide such a law.

I COUNTY ASSESSOR, OFFICIAL BOND, APPROVAL OF February 18, 1931, Mr. Ralph J. Nickereon, County Attorney, Tapillion, Nebr. Dear Sir: You say the County Assessor who was elected in your county this fall filed an official bond in the sum of SI. 000 and had it approved by the Board, The law requires a bond in a much larger amount and also requires that it shall be approved by the County Judge. You inquire as to the effect of the failure to comply with the statutory provisions in the matter of the amount of this bond and its approval. Allow me to say in answer to your question, that the statute provided that "If any person elected or appointed to any office shall </seg>
            <seg id="p272">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL neglect to have his official bond executed and approved as nrnvided by law, and filed for record within the time limited by this chapter, his office shall thereupon ipso facto become vacant, and such vacancy shall thereupon immediately be filled by election or appointment as the law may direct in other ' cases of vacancy in the same office."- Section 12-115, C. S. 1929.. In construing this provision of the statute the Supreme Court has held that. "The failure of a state or district officer to have his official bond apnroved and filed for record in the proper office within the time fixed by statute creates a vacancy in the office to which he has been elected or appointed, "In such case the state may waive its right to oust the in - cumbent, and elect to deal with him as the person entitled to the office." Paxfon v., State, 59 Neb, 462 I am of the opinion that in strict law the failure of party elected to the office of County Assessor to file a bond in the required amount and approved by the proper officer created a vacany in the office. I am further of the opinion the County may waive its right -to declare a vacancy, and am of the opinion that will be the proper course to pursue in this case if the incumbent will file a new bond in the re - quired amount and approved by the proper officer in the near future. I make this statement upon the assumption that the officer intended to comply with the law. In any event, I am of the opinion that the County Clerk does not continue to perform the duties of County Assessor if the electors of the county have voted to restore the office of County Assessor, Sincerely yours, ". .

            <seg id="p273">OPINIONS JUSTICE OF THE EEACE, RESIDENCE, TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION February 20, 1931. Mr. Herman Nave, Milford. Nebraska. : . ' ' * Dear Sir: This is In answer to your letter of February 17, 1931, requesting opinion as to whether it is necessary for you, as justice of the peace in Crete precinct of Saline County, to have your residence in the city of Crete, in order to try caees within justice of the peace jurisdiction in the city of Crete in said Crete precinct. Section 22-213. Comp, St., 1929, provides: "In each precinct in counties nnt under township organiza - tion there shall be elected one justice of the peace in the year Nineteen Hundred and Fourteen (1914) and very two years thereafter, and in each city or village within such precinct having Five Hundred (600) inhabitants or more, there shall be elected in the year Nineteen Hundred Twenty-Two (1922) and every two years thereafter, one justice of the peace." It thus appears that in Saline County, not under township organi - sation, both Crete Precinct and Crete city in said precinct have each a justice of the peace. Section 21401, relating to the civil jurisdiction of justices of the peace, provides: "The jurisdiction of justices of the peace in civil cases shall unless otherwise directed by law be limited to the justice of the pea«e district within which they are elected and where they shall reside." ./.,••. * The underscored language of this statute indicates that the precinct justice not residing in the city of Crete has no civil jurisdiction therein, However in Jones v. Church of Holy Trinity, 15 Neb. 81, the Supreme Court of this state held: "While the law requires a justice of the peace to exercise the functions of his office in the precinct for which he is elect - ed or appointed, yet having jurisdiction co-extensive with the </seg>
            <seg id="p274">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL limits of the county, a judgment rendered by him in any other precinct thereof is not void on that account." "If a justice of the peace, regardless of his duty in this respect, fix his place of business in another precinct of the county, and it is acquiesced in, we have no doubt whatever that his judgments rendered there etr.nd on the same footing, and are equally as valid as if they had been rendered in his own precinct." We, therefore, conclude that in civil cases in justice jurisdiction, the precinct justice, not residing in the city within said precinct, may exorcise jurisdiction in the city only with the' consent of both parties to the case; and that if either or both parties to the case, personally or by attorney, object to the juiisdiction of such extra-mural justice in a city case, his jurisdiction over said case thereby abruptly termin - ates. Sections 29-201 and 29-601 make justices of the peace magistrates with criminal jurisdiction co-extensive with the county in preliminary examinations and trials where punishment by imprisonment • cannot exceed three months and by fine S100.00 or both.(Art V, Sec. VIII. Neb. Const,). We, therefore, conclude that in criminal, cases within justices of the peace jurisdiction, committed in the city of Crete, the extra-mural justice of Crete precinct may exercise jurisdiction.

            <seg id="p276">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL • ' ■ ' ■ •■ ' of action of assessor to the owners of real estate whose taxes thereon were increased. Taxpayers are now organizing in Gage County and threaten to enjoin collection of taxes on said added valuation. "Of course quite a number of the property owners came to the cqunty clerk's office and actually knew that a raise in valuation was made. This controversy relates only to city pro - perty. "There are two questions: (1) May county board at this time make reductions of the raises made by the county assessor without notice? (2) Is assessment made by assessor without notice legal?" For correcting erroneous assessments, including those caused by val - uations increased withcut notice to the property owners affected, there is a clear and explicit statutory formula reading in part as follows: "The county clerk, with the approval of the county board, may correct the tax list before the tax is paid in case of erron - eous assessments," etc.— (Sec. 77-1006, Comp. St., 1929). Your statement that taxpayers are threatening to enjoin the col - lection of the taxes in controversy, indicates to our mind that said taxes have not yet been paid. Hence, in answer to your first question, our opinion, based on Section 77-1006, is that the county clerk, with the approval of the county .board may at this time make pro tanto reductions of the raises made by the county assessor without notice. Your second question involves the legality of real estate valuations increased by the county assessors without notice to the owners affected. Such notice was first provided for by Laws 1927, Page 519. This pro - vision now appears in Sec. 77-1612, Comp. St., 1929, and reads as follows: "In years in which real estate is assessed for taxation par - poses (See Sec. 77-1601, Comp. St., 1929), it shall be the duty of the county assessor, before such filing, to notify the record owner of any piece of real estate which has been valued at a higher figure than at the last previous assessment. Said no - tice may be given by post card, addressed to said owner's last - know address. It shall describe said real estate and state old and new valuation thereon, and the date of the convening of the board of equalization." This provision for the notice is evidently mandatory. As new matter brought into the revenue law in 1927, it must, upon the most </seg>
            <seg id="p277">• OPINIONS notorious principles of statutory construction, be given the meaning and scope clearly, directly and unambiguously appearing on the face of its text. Concerning this provision for notice, our Supreme Court in Radium Hospital v. Greenleaf, 223 N. W. 667, 669, said: "It may be well to state that the Legislature by Chapter 179, Laws 1927, requires the assessor in the years in which real estate is assessed for taxation, before returning his assessment rolls, to notify by postal card the record owner of the real estate which has been assessed al a higher figure than at the last previous assessment and Rive date of convening of board of equalization." Furthermore, in the more recent case of Northwestern Bell Tele - phone Co. v. State Board cf Equalization, 227 N. W. 452, 454, the Nebraska Supreme Court expressed itself upon the subject of tax valuation increased without notice in the following plain and unmis - takable language: . . . "The great weight of authority, as disclosed by the text-writers and adjudicated cases, cleaily holds to the proposition that an assessed valuation of prcperty cannot be increased 1 without due notice to the owner of such property, and this to the end that he may first be heard." We are, therefore of the opinion that so. much of the taxes as are represented by the increase in valuations made without notice to the property owners affected, are illegal and unccllectable.

Dear Sir: This is in answer to your kind letter of February 17, 1931, re - questing opinion as to whether persons not admitted to the bar may practice law in county courts of this state in their own behalf in any case within the court's jurisdiction and in behalf of others in cases within a justice of the peace's jurisdiction. In all cases in the county courts and any other courts of this state, persons not admitted to the bar may practice or act as attorneys for themselves (See Section 7-110,' Conip, St., 1929).

            <seg id="p279">OPINIONS which is squarely decisive of the question of whether persons not admitted to the bar may practice law for others -in the county courts of this state in cases within the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace. However, Section 7-101, Comp. St., 1929, prohibits unlicensed persons from practicing law for others "in any court of record in this state". As to the status of the county court as a. court of record, our Supreme Court in Scott v. Flowers, 61 Neb. G2(), 85 N. W. 857, held as follows: "The county court is r I ways and under all circumstances a court of record. The county judge, in whatever official ca - pacity he may act, is a judge of a court of record; he is not a justice of the peace even when exercising the ordinary powers and jurisdiction of a justice." ■ These authorities indicate that it is the status of the court, before whom the unlicensed person purports to practice law for others, as one of record or not of record, which determines his eligibility for such law practice in such court, regardless of whether the case wherein he purports to practice law for others, is within or without a justice of the peace's jurisdiction. To hold otherwise, would be to say that in cases within a justice of the peaces jurisdiction an unlicensed person could practice law for others in the districts courts and supreme court: a manifest legal solecism. We are, 'therefore, of the opinion that persons not licensed to practice law are ineligible to practice law for others in the county courts of this state in any case within or without the jurisdiction of justices of the peace.

Dear Sir: This is in answer to jlour letter of February 19, 1931, in which you state and inquire: </seg>
            <seg id="p280">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL . "We have a local telephone company, operating in Keith and Arthur counties, and with headquarters in Keith county. This company has not paid any of the personal taxes levied against it in Arthur County, for a number of years, but has paid its taxes in Keith County. Its only agent or officer re - ceiving any money, is its manager, whose cffice is in Keith county, and therefore it does not seem that Sec. 77-1922, Comp. St., 1929 applies ca a meai.s of c llection. - "Can a distress warrant be issued and levied upon, and a sale had by the sheriff thereunder, of enough of the poles and wire situated in Arthur County, to satisfy the taxes, and the ■ ' poles and wire, and phone boxes, if necessary, be removed by the purchaser at such sale? If not, what procedure should we take to collect the taxes? Will you kindly give me your opin - ion as definitely as possible in this matter, as we are facing the question of collecting the taxes from the corporation in some way." Since this company has no agent in Arthur County we are inclined to agree with you that the remedy by criminal proceedings against resident agents, as provided by Section 77-1922, is unavailable for collection of the Arthur County personal taxes of this company. The more serious question is whether the collection of said com - pany's delinquent personal taxes in Arthur County, may be enforced out of its poles, wires, boxes and other instruments by distress pro - ceedings resulting in the disconnexion and removal of said appur - tenances from the public utility system by the distress purchaser. In this connection it must be firmly held in mind that for the collection of taxes the distress is of the "personal property belonging to the person against whom (the personal tax is) levied" (Sec. 77-1915; 37 Cyc. 1237, Note 2). .Aside from the boxes which are leased' pro - perty of the patrons, the other appurtenances, such as the poles and the wires are annexed to the easement or right of way, which is usually classed as real estate (37 Cyc. 1617; 5 Corpus Juris, 765, Note 61; C. B. &amp; Q. Ry. v. Custer County, 69 Neb. 429, 95 N. W. 859). Furthermore, " it is generally held that the poles, wires, conduits and instruments are assessable as real estate" (37 Cyc. 854, Note 47). Hence, in the absence of a Nebraska Statute or Supreme Court decision definitely declaring that the telephone property in question is personal property subject to distress, the trend of authority does not warrant us in giving ex parte so much scope to so harsh snd summary a remedy. Another important requirement of the statute (Sec. 77-1915) is that the distress is to be made "in the manner provided by law </seg>
            <seg id="p281">OPINIONS for the levy and scle of personal property on execution." This, of course, can only mean that if the removal from the company's telephone system of its pcles, wires, boxes and other things essen - tial to the continued and uninterrupted rendition of its public tele - phone service, cannot be legally enforced by execution, it is equally incapable of enforcement by distress. That property essential to the enjoyment of public fanchise is not subject to execution, except as modified by constitutions and statutes, is trite legal learning (23 Corpus Juris. 356, Note 82). In Sherman County Inigatioii Ltc. Co. v. Drake, 65 Neb. 699, our Sup - reme Court held: &gt; "In the absence of statutory enactment the property of a quasi-public or public service corporation, necessary for carry - ing cut the objects of its creation, like the rights of way of railroad, turnpike and canal companies, and fixtures thereto, : cannot be seized and sold upon legal process in ordinary ac - tions, although the company is insolvent, and has been guilty of non-user and abandonment."

Means, 33 Neb. 857, the Nebraska Supreme Court declared: "Property of a public corporation, such as a bridge com - pany, which is essential to the exercise of its franchise and the discharge of the duties it has assumed toward the general public, cannot, in the absence of statutory authoiity, be seized and sold to satisfy an ordinary judgement. The only remedy of creditors in such cases is to obtain the appointment of a receiver and a sequestration of the company's earnings."

It seems to us that the authentic proceedure for the collection of these taxes would be as follows: Have the treasurer issue the distress warrants to the sheriff and have the latter return them unsatisfied for want of goods found in Arthur County to satisfy Bame, Then sue the company in Arthur or Keith counties (Sees. 20-406 and 20-409) for the taxes as provided </seg>

Village Clerk, Callaway, Nebraska. Dear Sir: I This is in answer to your letter of February 25, 1931, requesting information as to the legality or enforceaLility of the solicitor clause of your village's occupation tax ordinance reading as follows: "Each agent, solicitor or peddler selling dry goods, clothing, notions, jewelry, or services, either trade or professional, such as tailoring, pressing, or soliciting for the sale of such goods i. or services or any other articles or services which -may come in competition with the home merchants selling any of- the merchandise or services, per day Five ($5.00) Dollars." Section 17-436, Compiled" Statutes of Nebraska, 1929, gives vil - lages the power by ordinance "to raise revenue by levying and col - lecting a license tax on any occupation or business within the limits ' of the city or village, and regulate the same by ordinance.'" Such power to tax any occupation carried on in the village necessarily in - vclves and implies power to select for taxation certain kinds or classes of business only such as agents, solicitors or peddlers of goods, wares and merchandise also dealt in by established merchants having a permanent place of business in the village. Upon this power one ■ </seg>

OPINIONS limitation is that "all such taxes shall be uniform in respect to the classes upon which they are imposed" (Sec. 17-436); that is impose the same tax on every person enj-aged in the kind or class of business taxed The other limitation is that villages have no power by taxation or otherwise to impose direct and substantial 1 urdens on interstate com - merce; a limitation which prevents the collection of the tax from any agent, solicitor or peddler who can prcve that he is distributing in their original packages goods brought into the village from some point outside of Nebraska (Purchase v. State, 109 Neb. 457). We are therefore of the opinion that the occupation tax ordinance in question is valid and enforceable against such agents, solicitors and peddlers doing business in the village as are not engaged in inter - state or foreign commerce.

SCHOOL DISTRICTS-CONSOLIDATION-RIGHT OF CONSOLI - DATED DISTRICT TO FUNDS AND PROPERTY OF ORIGINAL DISTRICTS u pl , ,„ „, February 28, 1931. Hon. Charles W.

Dear Sir: You call the attention of this office to a letter you have received from the county superintendent of Thayer County in which it is stated that some years ago (more than ten) two rural school districts were consolidated with the school district in which the town of Belvidere is situated and inquiry is made as to who is entitled to this money If each of the rural school districts was annexed in its entirety to the Belvidere school district otherwise known as District No. 34 said Dis - trict No. 34 is entitled without question to all the money or other school property that each of them had at the time the districts were consolidated. . ■ In the case of Clother v. Maher, et al, 15 Neb. 1, it was held that consolidation being effected the new district not only became invested with all property rights of the former but also became answerable for its debts." I do not doubt that a like rule obtains in the instant case. </seg>

Speaking with reference to real estate conveyed nearly fifty years ago by quit claim deed by a school district but without any record that the conveyance was authorized by a vole of the electors of the district, you say the parlies inleiested have inquired: "Can the school board at present by the consent of the electors at the annual meeting this summer give deed that will make title good or remove cloud that objectors claim is on same even though adverse possession has run against claimants? Some say court action is only thing that will ac - complish this. Are they right?" In answer to the question you ask I will say that in my opinion a court action is not necessary to give good title to this land but it is probable that a very conservative examiner of titles will insist upon a court action to quiet title in order to have it judicially determined that the title is good. ■ The object of an action to quiet title is not to give title where i ■ - </seg>

Dear Sir: We have your letter of the 5th regarding the young man who claims to be a resident of Colorado and registers his automobile in that state but who actually lives with his father in Gnrfield County practically all of the time; and is in Colorado only a few days each year. You ask what procedure your office should take. Section BO-302, Compiled Statutes, 1929, requires every resident of Nebraska who owns a motor vehicle to register it in the county where he resides. Section 39-1106 makes it a misdemeanor for such owner to register his automobile in any other county than that in which he resides. Section 60-324 forbids the driving of a motor vehicle on the public highways without having its registration certificate attached. Section 60-327, Compiled Statutes, 1929, however, exempts non - residents of Nebraska from registering their motor vehicles in this state, except foreign corporations, to the extent that their laws grant like exemptions to residents of this state, provided such non-resident shall have complied with the laws of his own state relative to regis - tration. Colorado grants non-residents a period of 90 days exemption from registration there provided they have complied with the registration laws of their own state. Section 1346, Compiled Laws of Colorado, 1921. The chief legal difficulty to a prosecution in this case seems to us to be the difficulty of proving that this young man is a resident of Garfield County, Nebraska, and not Colorado.

If it can be established to the satisfaction of the court that this party is actually a resident of Garfield County, Nebraska, then it seems clear to me that he is violating both Sections 60-302 and 39-1106 by operating his automobile on the public highways of this state without securing a certificate of registration from the County Treas - urer of Garfield County and that he could be proceeded against ac - cordingly. Whether the evidence is sufficient to establish the fact that he is a resident of Garfield County, you, of coursa, are in a much better position to judge than we are. Very truly yours C. A.

Under this statute we rre clearly of the opinion that the surplus sewer-bond funds you describe may be transferred by the city council to any other city fund in the discretion of the council. Section 17-568, Comp.

Dear Sir: This is in answer to your kind letter of March 10* 1931, in which you state and inquire: "In 1925 a Scavanger sale was held in our county and sev - eral parcels or tracts of land were sold at said sale. </seg>
            <seg id="p289">OPINIONS "A party bought a lot in one cf the villages at said scaven - ger sale, and has never paid any subsequent taxes or any part of them, but in fact has made default.

The purchaser at a scavanger sale, which is confirmed, obtains a deed giving him a fee simple title wholly disconnected from any previous title or titles (Sec. 77-2141). For this reason we are of the opinion that a subsequent purchaser at a piivate tax sale is required to pay only the taxes accruing after the taxes involved in the scaven - ger sale, viz., the 1925 and prior taxes. The 1925 and prior tax titles were, in our judgement, merged in the title conferred by the scavanger deed. Sincerely yours, C. A. SORENSfcN, Attorney General, By CLIFFORD L.

            <seg id="p292">REPORT OF. ATTORNEY GENERAL The pertinent statute is -Section 33-143, Comp. St., 1929. It pro - vides in part that "no juror shell be entitled to pay for the days he is voluntarily absent or excused from service by. the order of the court." We are therefore of the opinion- that a juror who comes to the court - house and is excused is entitled to no pny for the day of reporting for service or for any part of said day. It is also our opinion that the word day as used in said Section 33-143 refers to calendar days and that all fractions of a day count as a full day. Hence, a juror out on a case for 48 hours is entitled, in our judgement to $4.00 for every calendar day that accrued during said 48 hour period. Thus, if a jury went out on a case at 10 o'clock A. M. Monday and came in with its verdict at 10 o'clock A. M. Wed - nesday, each member -thereof would be out for 48 hours and be entitled to S4.00 a day for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday or a total of $12.00.

Mrs. Mable Walker Willebrandt, Washington, D. C. Dear Madam: Your letter of the 10th instant in re tax paid in the State of Nebraska upon gasoline used by American Airways, Inc. in interstate commerce has been received and contents noted. In Nebraska all dealers by which is meant all persons who either import into the state or produce in the state motor vehicle fuel are required to pay a tax upon such fuel so imported or produced. The tax is paid to the State' Treasurer and authority is given to him to refund the motor fuel tax paid him under certain conditions, but there is no express authority of statute for a refund of the tax collected from interstate air transport companies or from any other companies or </seg>
            <seg id="p293">OPINIONS persons engaged in interstate commerce.

I do not understand, however, that the laws of the United States require a refund in a case such as this. If there are any cases in which the United States courts have held that private parties are entitled to a refund of the amount of the motor fuel tax paid by the dealer of whom they purchased motor fuel used by them in interstate commerce I shall be glad to consider them.

The mere fact thrt seivice is had withcut the vigilance Of a station attendant would, in our judgement, be entirely too remote, conjectural and speculative a basis upon w) ich to predicate a finding thnt such pumps are fire nuisances in themselves. One cafeteria pump company asserts that for ten years they have operated such pumps in several different localities, without a fire 1-iss attributable to such pumps.

Spenca, c o Northwest Nebraska News, Crawford, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Some time ago you wrote a letter to this department concerning the practice of cream buyers of paying what they call a "shipper's price- 4 ' of from two to five cents per p: und more for cream that is shipped in than they pay for cream that is delivered to their station by the seller himself. The practice you mention is the cruse of a great deal of dissatis - faction throughout the state but under cur present law it is exceedingly difficult to regulate it. . . ■ Our law (Section 59-509, Compiled Statutes, 1929) forbids a cream buyer from discriminating in price between different sections, lo - calities, communities, cities or villages in the state, by paying a- higher rate in one locality than is paid in another for the same commodity, "after making due allowance for the difference, if any; the actual </seg>
            <seg id="p295">OPINIONS .1 cost of transportation by train, truck or other carrier from the locality of such purchase to the' locality of manufacture or of sale of such milk, cream or butter fat, " etc. The buyers contend that they are authorized to pay a higher direct shippers rate than their station price, provided they make the rates uniform over phe state because of the diH'erence in cost of the service given a patron who delivers at the buying station and one who ships his cream in. They argue that the patron who delivers his cream at the station is given more expensive service because he brings in, on an average, a smaller quantity of cream than the direct shipper, yet the time consumed in handling and testing it is the same, the acids, etc. used are the same, he is given immediate service and is paid at once. The shipper ordinaiily ships in larger quantities at a time, his cream can be tested and weighed at the convenience of the buyer and the buyer can consult his own convenience in performing the clerical work, drawing the check, and making the entries necessary to keep a proper record of the transaction. While our law does not expressly recognize and permit an allow - ance for this difference in the ccst of service which the cream buyers say exists, it is highly probable that, if they can prove such actual difference, the courts would permit them to make a variance between their direct shipper and station prices to meet it as otherwise the law would be unconstitutional as an unreasonable interference with the right of contract. . - We think jit is clear, however, that the cream buyer has no right .to pay a greater difference between his direct shippers' and his station price than the actual cost of the difference in service. . The cream buyers themselves, I believe, admit this. The obvious difficulty in a prosecution of this kind is to prove what the actual cost of the dif - ference in service is. All the facts upon which to base such a prose - cution are in the hands of the cream buyer and, in a criminal prosecution, all he has to do to win an acquittal is to raise a reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury. The department of agriculture as well as this department has de - voted a great deal of study to this problem and the legislature is also giving it considerable attention but it is a hard problem. I enclose copy of a bill, H. R. 495, how before the legislature, which attempts to strengthen the present law on this subject. - Very truly yours, C. A. SOREN SEN, Attorney General, By HOMER L.

The same statute also provides that for each day actually employed in directing road work in his district each member of the county board shall be paid the sum of $5.00 per day to-be paid out of the road fun of his district. Section 26-130, Compiled Statutes for 1929, provides that no county officer shall, either directly or indirectly, be pecuniarily interested in or receive the benefit of any contracts executed by the county for the furnishing of supplies or any other property. Under this pro - vision a county supervisor could not be hired by the board to perform work for the county in addition to his regular duties as county super - visor and director of road work under the law, and he could not be paid additional compensation to that already provided by law.

Dear Sir; This is in answer to your letter of April 6, 1931, in which you state and inquire: "In a specific case, land of one individual was raised. Notice was sent from this office to the town near which such land was situated. No other address was known at the time of such party. Said notice came back and placed on file. The man pnys his taxes under protest and desires a hearing. Can he do so when notice was sent but such man was not to be located?" . If, under Section 77-1612, the town to which the notice preceding the raise of valuation was sent, was the "owner's last known address," then, in our opinion, he has no cause for complaint on the ground of defective notice. Under Section 77-1702, at its meeting in 1930 following the raise and notice to the owner tlie board of equalization on this owner's application, could and should have given him a hearing on the ques - tion of whether his property was overvalued. But if, as appears to be the fact, he did not object at the 1930 meeting of said board, his present objection, in our judgement, comes too late. Sincerely yours, C. A.

In a case of Iris kind, should I be entitled to mileage in going after a prisoner under these circumstances? "Second:-If in your opinion I .would not be entitled to mileage in Kansas, could I collect mileage to the state line and expenses from there on? "Third:-In case I take my car and go down as previously stated, and bring back the prisoner, how would I arrive at what my actual expenses would be, as a person should be entitled to something for wear and tear on his car, in case I went on the train I would have to go a considerable distance east and then make it back west again, which would amount to more than the mileage across would come to, the wear and tear on a sheriff's car is more severe." It appears from your statement that in bringing back from Kansas a man who has waived extradition you are not an extradition agent appointed by the governor and entitled to actual expenses as provided by Sections 29-701 to 29-706, Compiled Statutes, 1929.

Hoagland, Carr &amp; Hoagland, Attorneys-at-Law, North Platte, Nebraska. Gentlemen: In your letter of April 4th you ask our opinion as to the power of the County Board of Equalization, after July 10th, to "adjust a matte'r of taxes which they had not adjusted prior to that time." In this connection, you call our attention to certain corrective action taken by the State Board of Equalization after the time for their regular sitting. The County Board of Equalization, as such is a body with powers and duties strictly defined. Its jurisdiction is confined to a twenty days session each year. Sec. 77-1702, Comp. St. Neb., 1929. Its powers cease at the end of this statutory period. Farmers . Co-Op. Creamery &amp; Supply Co. v. McDonald, 100 Neb. 33, 158 N. W. 369^ After it has submitted to the State Board of Equalization its report, on or before July 10th (Sec. 77-1707) its only function is to await the action of the State Board and then, on the twentieth and last day of its session, make the county levy. Sec. 77-1801, Comp. St. Neb., 1929. However, there are other provisions which afford ample oppor - tunity to the county authorities to adjust errors in assessments. Sec - tion 77-1006 places such powers in the hands of the county assessor, county clerk and county board. Section 77-1614 makes it the duty of the county clerk to place on the tax list lands not assessed or taxed for any former year or years. Sections 77-1930 and following, dealing with the responsibility of county treasurers in connection with his duties as a collector of taxes </seg>
            <seg id="p303">• • OPINIONS also contain several provisions authorizing certain adjustments and correction of errors in tax records. The powers and duties of the State Board of Equalization are statutory and, we believe, the provisions pertaining to that body are of no particular value in any question dealing with the powers of the County Board of Equalization which are also statutory. Yours very truly. C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General, By L. R. NEWKIRK, Assistant Attorney General. SCHOOL DISTRICTS -LIABILITY OF ONE TRANSFERRING INTO TO PAY BUILDING FUND TAX - April 17, 1931. Mr. Fred H. Richards, County Attorney, Fremont, Nebraska. Dear Sir: ■ ■ • You say: "There is a transfer from District 36 into District 50 of Dodge County. District 50 has a building fund and the county clerk has assessed him up with general school tax and building fund and he objects to paying the building fund, as the school law says he has no right to vote on bonds and he takes the position that the building fund is the same as a bond and he does not pay on bonds issued for building purposes when he is transferred into the district. The question is, 'Should he pay on the building fund or should he pay only the general school taxes?." In answer to the question you suggest, I will say that in my opinion the party transferred should pay the building fund tax levied in the district to which he is transferred for the year the transfer is in force and effect. Such is the literal reading of the law. 79-2101 provides among other things that: "The county clerk shall be empowered, and it is hereby made his duty, to place the school taxes except for the payment •4 </seg>

Under the laws of Nebraska as interpreted by the supreme Court, slot machines, lotteries, and all other, schemes of chance are illegal and the operators thereof are subject to prosecution. They come not only within Section 28-946, but also under Section 28-962. No state official has direct, charge of the suppression of slot machines or other gambling devices. That duty rests primarily upon city and village officials. I hope that you will take steps to enforce the law with reference to them. Sincerely yours, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General, </seg>

Dear Sir: •&lt;■ ■ ■ . - -I i You ask: "Does a road vacate itself by reason of not being used or I . worked all, or just that portion not being used when it has been ordered opened up and worked according to law by the county board of commissioners in 1887?" Under our law as it now stands, and as it has been since the year •1909, the only way in which a road that has once been legally established can be vacated is by consent of a majority of the voters living within two miles of such road and not living in a village or city. Section 39-103, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929. Prior to 1909 the law provided that all roads that had not been used within five years should be deemed vacated (Sec. 5256, Compiled Statutes of Nebrska, 1907). This provision of the law was repealed by the legislature in 1909 and the law in substantially its present form was enacted. In the case of Krueger v. Jenkins, 59 Neb. 541, decided by our Supreme Court in February, 1900, while the old law was still in effect, it was held under the provision of the statute " 'that all roads that have not been used within five years shall be deemed vacated', applies only to roads which have been entirely abandond. It does not apply to the unused parts of a road lying on either side of the line of travel." You also ask: . "What is the lawful width of an established road where the petition does not state any width therein?" Section 39-102, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929, provides; "All public roads shall have a width of not less than forty feet nor more than sixty-six feet to be determined by the county board," etc. Very truly yours, C.

Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of April 20 asking our opinion as- to the exemption of taxation of the Mennonite Church as to eighty acres of land leased by the church which uses the income therefrom for church purposes you are advised that this property is not exempt from taxation. Article VIII Section 2 of the Constitution and Section 77-202, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929, exempt "property owned by and used exclusively for- agricultural and horticultural societies, and property owned and used exclusively for educational, religious, char - itable or cemetary purposes, when such property is not owned or used for financial gain or profit to either the owner or user." It has been repeatedly decided by our Supreme Court that the test of exemption is the use to which the property itself is put. As stated in the case of House of Good Shepherd v. Board of Equal - ization, 113 Neb. 489 at page 492 "property of a religious, educational or charitable institution which is leased to others and ueed as a com - mercial enterprise is not exempt from taxation, even though the in - come from such property is devoted to educational, religious or char - itable purposes. The test is the use of the property itself, and whether it may be fairly and reasonably said to be used for such purposes." Other cases are: First Christian Church of Beatrice v..

Hubka, County Attorney, Beatrice, Nebraska .;:':' - You say: "The Gage County bonrd of supervisors have drawn war - rants to the amount of eighty-five per cent of the 1930 levy. "Two weeks ago about 810,000.00 of fees were paid into the treasury's general fund from various offices in Gage County, and as taxes have not been paid, the general fund was depleted and warrants had to be registered. The above mentioned $10,000.00 was placed in the general fund and $10,000.00 of warrants were retarded and paid. . "Question: Where the county board has issued warrants to the limit of the levy, and not sufficient taxes paid into the genertl fund causing the warrants to be registered, and the registered warrants being paid from other sources than taxes for such year, 'as fees from county offices, prior taxes, and other fees collected and paid into the general fund,' has the board the power and authoiity to issue warrants to the amount that was retarded and paid-by the fees into the general fund or must the county board wait till all the warrants are paid, and then draw warrants on cash? "Where the county board has issued warrants to the limit as provided by law, has it power to issue warrants for pay - ment of county officers' salaries, and if not such power and authority, can it approve the salary claims of said officers so that the officers may be able to assign and transfer? "Where the county board has issued warrants to the limit as provided by law, has it power to approve general claims filed against the county so that the claimant may receive it for purposes of transferring and assignments?" Section 26-116, Comp. St., 1929, provides that: "It shall be unlawful for the county board of any county in this state to issue any warrants for any amount exceeding </seg>
            <seg id="p308">REPORT OF ATTOr.NEY GENERAL the aggregate of eighty-five per cent of the amount levied by tax for the current year, except there be money in the trea - sury to the credit of the proper fund for the payment of the same; nor shall it be lawful for the county board to issue any certificate of indebtedness in any forin in payment of any ac - count or claim, nor to make any contract for or to incur any indebtedness in any form in payment for any account or claim, or to make any. contract for or to incur any indebtedness against the county in excess of the tax levy for county expenses during the current year; nor shall any expenditure be made, or -indebtedness be contracted to be paid out of any of the funds of said county in excess of the amount levied -for said fund." The Supreme Court of Nebraska, has said in construing the above quoted provision of statute that: "It is not unlawful for a county board, after estimate made and prior to its meeting as a board of equalization, to antici - pate the levy for the current year,- and contract an indebtedness upon a particular fund within the estimate, although there is at the time no money in the treasury to the credit of such fund for the payment of the indebtedness, if in contracting such indebtedness the board remain within the limits prescribed by the constitution and the statutes." (Austin Mfg. Co. v. Brown County, 65 Neb. 60). The decision in thjs case was approved in the more recent case of Central Building and Construction Co. v. Saunders County, 106 Neb, 484. I mention the above quoted provision of the statute and the de - cision of the Supreme Court because they throw some light upon the questions you ask and which I will now endeavor to -answer. 1. I doubt whether in strict law. the county board is authorized to issue warrants in payment of claims which accrued in 1930 in excess of eighty-five per cent of the levy for that year unless there is money in the treasury with which to pay them. 2. Even though the county board has issued warants to the amount authorized by law against the 1930' levy and there is no money in the treasury, I am of the opinion that it has the legal right to approve the claims of the county officers for salaries earned dur - ing the year 1931, and the same may be said of valid claims for other services rendered or for materials furnished in 1931. </seg>
            <seg id="p309">OPINIONS In fact I am of the opinion, although the question may not be entirely free from doubt, that warrants may now be drawn against the proposed 1931 levy to pay officer's salaries and other legitimate county expenses incurred during the year 1931. In the body of the opinion written in the case of Austin Mfg. Co. v. Brown County, supra, it is said: "The first step in the levy of taxes, that is, making the estimate, has been taken; and there is no doubt of the author - ity of the board to anticipate the- levy for the current year, remaining within the constitutional and statutory limits, and to enter into such contracts as the welfare of the county may require."

            <seg id="p312">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL SCHOOL DISTRICT— RIGHT TO ORGANIZE CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN VILLAGE May 11, 1931. Mr. Q. J. Miller, Burwell, Nebr. Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of inquiry of the 7th instant, I will say that Burwell can maintain its village organization if it desires to do so, although it has a sufficient population to be a city of the second class. The law does not compel it to become a city of the second class (Sec. 17-101). • The fact that Burwell chooses to remain a village does not pre - vent, however, the school district of which it forms a part from be - coming a city school district as that term is generally used, that is to say; a district organized under what is commonly known as Article XXV of the School Law. In fact the law provides that where there is either a city or village having a population of one thousand or more within the district, -it shall be a city school district (79-2501). The law makes no provision in such a case for the electors determining whether they wish to be governed as an Article VI district or an Article XXV district. I am therefore of the opinion that you should be governed in strict law as an Article XXV district, but there are, I believe, sev - eral school districts in the state that have retained their organization as Article VI schools when the law has declared them to be Article XXV schools. I do not think that it is necessary to have the electors of the district vote upon the question of whether thy will do what the law says shall be done. If at the time of the next general city election a board of education is elected in conformity with the provisions of 79-2503, the change in organization will have been made in my opinion. This could have. been done at the last annual village election or in fact at any annual village election, since Burwell bttained a population in excess of 1000. I do not wish to be understood as of being of the opinion, however, that what you have done or may do in the future will be illegal, because you are organized as an Article VI school when you should have been organized as an Article XXV school. </seg>
            <seg id="p313">OPINIONS The law provides that: "At the first election in cities organized under this article ' . two members shall be elected for the term of three years, two for two years, and two for one year, and annually thereafter two members shall be elected for three years and until their successors are elected and qualified and installed in office:"— 79-2603, C. S. for 1929. I suggest that a feasible way to handle the matter will be to elect a board of education at the next annual village election and, mean - time, to announce at the annual school meeting held this coming June that the district should now be organized as a city school district and that a board of education will be elected next spring. The two plans of organization are much the same. There are, however, some differences. To illustrate: An 'annual school meeting is not held in a city school district. Sincerely yours, C. A.

Until that time the trustees elect are not the proper officers of the district." — State v. Weatherby, 17 Neb. 553. 2. I am of the opinion that the present board of school trustees can elect a teacher for the ensuing school year although I think the legisla - ture intended otherwise when it amended what is now 79-603 in 1929. The law as amended provides among other things that "In the election of teachers no members of said board of trustees may cast a vote in the election of any teacher in favor of said teacher when said member on the board is related by blood or marriage within the third degree to said teacher and whose term of office extends beyond the date of the term of such posi - tion contracted for."

Dear Sir: You say that the City of Beatrice is about to file a claim against Gage County for a share of the road tax, claiming that it is entitled to one-half of the road tax collection by the county in Beatrice since 1886.

Apparently the fact that a county is under township government does not preclude a city within 3&lt;£&gt;06° Unty fr ° m ClaiminB one - half the r °*d tax as provided in Section I am of the opinion that the fact that the county has never formed road districts would not affect the validity of the claim.

Section 17-107 contains the only statutory provisions relative to the office of policmen in second class ciiies. These provisions read as follows: "The mayor, by and with the consent of the council, shall appoint such a number of regular pclicemen bs may be neces - sary and may also appcint special policemen from time to time as emergencies arise. All police officers appointed by the mayor and council, in accordance therewith, shall be removable at any time by the mayor." It is thus observed that the statute gives the mayor and council the right to provide for the appointment of policemen removable at any time by the mayor. It is also observed that the statute imposes upon the mayor and council no limitations as to the method of providing for the appointment of policemen. The mayor and council may, there - fore, make provision for the appointment of policemen either by ordinance or by resolution. It is further observed that the statute makes for such policemen no provisions for a term of office except that their offices begin with their appointment by the mayor with the council's consent and end with their removal by the mayor alone.

It is thus apparent that your city should have municipal legislation fixing- policemen's terms of office subject to the mayor's power of removal. Since, as above stated, there are no statutory limitations on the method of exercising such legislative authority, the council may do it either by a general ordinance prescribing the terms of office of policemen, or by appropriate term-fixing language in the resolution confirming the mayor's appointment of a policeman. If such term-fixing legislation exists in your city, but does not provide for hoi; ing over of incumbents until a successor is appointed and legally confirmed, then, of course, a policeman whose term has expired is simply a policeman whose term has expired. He is no longer apoliceman, and whatever may be the validity of his acts as a de facto officer where third parties' and the public's rights are involved, he does not hold over and he is not entitled to a policeman's pay or to other perquisites and emoluments of a policeman's office. ■ " On the other hand, if such term-fixing legislation exists in your city and it provides for policemen holding over their terms until their sucessors are appointed and legally confirmed, then, obiviously they do hold over, they are policemen and they are entitled to a policeman's pay, perquisites or emoluments until their successors have been appointed and legally confirmed. Of course, if no such term-fixing legislation exists in your city which is more apt to be the fact- a policeman once regularly appointed and legally confirmed, holds his office and is entitled to the pay, perquisites and emoluments thereof until the mayor removes him; an event which may occur at any time and be unattended by prescribed ceremonies such as notice, hearing and time or opportunity to be heard. .'.'.; Sincerely yours, C.

Dear Sir: You call attention to the term "county roads" found in line 6 of </seg>
            <seg id="p318">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Section 77-2218, Comp. St. 1929. You ask our opinion as to whether the term "county roads" as there used should be interpreted to mean any road in the county or those roads .laid out under a special statute and entitled "county roads". I am of the opinion that the term "county roads" as used' in Section 77-2218 means any road in the county which it is the duty of the county to maintain regardless of whether it belongs to the system of roads designated as "county roads" as provided in Section 39-227, Comp. St. 1929 or not. My chief reason for this view, aside from the apparent purpose of the statute, is that Section 77-2218 was oiiuinaliy passed by the Legislat - ure in 1901, whereas Section 39-227 providing for a system of county roads was not pessed until 1917. The term "county roads' as used in Section 77-2218 could hardly be said to refer to something which did not exist until sixteen years later. You also call attention to the following language found in Section' 77-2218, Comp. St. 1929: "It shall be lawful for the County Board of any County having a population of not moie than 50,L00 inhabitants, to use such fund in the manner herein provided for the improvement of any cut or fill and for the gracing of any public highway. The County Board in such ci unties in making such improve - ment, shall have the option of letting the same by competitive bid as herein set forth or in any other manner as shall to them seem to the best interests of the County." ' . You state that York County is under township organization and that certain members of the county board wish to take the inheritance tax and divide it equally among the sixteen townships, i. e. expend equal portions in each township, while other members contend that the statute means that the inheritance fund tax should be expended only under the direction of the county board and upon such county highways as the county board deems necessary. You ask for our view. It seems to me that the language of the statute can bear only one construction: That the fund is to be expended by the board acting as a body "for the improvement of any cut or fill and for the grading of any public highway" wherever it may deem such work necessary without regard to the amount spent in any particular township. Further- </seg>

Anslinger, Commissioner, Bureau of Narcotics, Treasury Department, Washington, D .C. . Dear Sir: Pursuant to a request for an opinion thereon from the Honorable Robert G. Simmons, Congressman from Nebraska, you ask our opinion as to whether, under the laws of Nebraska, a physician may prescribe and dispense narcotic drugs in this state for the treatment of animals in localities where veterinary surgeons are not available. Section 71-1802, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929, relating to the practice of pharmacy provides that among those excepted from the law prohibiting any but licensed pharmacists from selling drugs and medicines at retail shall . be "3. Persons who are licensed to practice drugs and medicines, dentistry, or veterinary medicine who dispense drugs and medicines as an incident to the practice of their profession. 5. Licensed doctors of medicine in any town or village of three hundred fifty (350) population or less where there is no registered pharmacist, and located ten (10) miles or more from any town or village having a licensed or registered pharmacist." . The foregoing appear to be the only exceptions to our law permit - ting only licensed pharmacists to sell drugs and medicines at retail applicable to the case you present. Section 71-7909, Comp. St., 1929, defines the practice of veterinary medicine and surgery which may only be practiced by licensed practi - tioners. However, Section 71-1904, Comp. St., 1929, enumerates certain </seg>
            <seg id="p320">REPORT OK ATTORNEY GENERAL exceptions among which arc persons who gratuitiously advise or assist others in the care or treatment of their domestic animals. • From a consideration of the above mentioned statutes I believe that our laws permit a physician to diagnose diseases and prescribe drujrs and medicines frr domestic aiiiinnls provided he makes no charge for this service and that he may lawfully sell drugs for such purpose in any village of 350 population or less where there is no registered pharmacist and none located within ten miles thereof. Should the physician charge for his service in prescribing treatments or should he sell drugs for the purpi se indicated within a distance of ten miles from where a licensed pharmacist is treated, or in a village having a greater population than 350 peisons, I believe he would be violating our laws.

Jordan, City Attorney, Gordon, Nebraska. Dear Sir: .. This is in answer to your letter of May 26, 1931. You first request information as to whether taxes levied and col - lected to pay interest and principal of city bonds and resulting in city funds commonly called "interest fund" and "sinking fund" res - pectively should be retained and handled by the county treasurer or be turned to the city treasurer for handling. The county treasurer is, of course, the "collector of all city taxes including those in question (See Sees. 17-567 and 77-1901). Upon de - mand of the city treasurer, the county treasurer must report and pay over to the former the amount of the collected, city taxes includ - ing the taxes in question (Sec. 77-194J; State v. Roderick, 23 Neb. 505). This duty of the county treasurer may be enforced by madamus (State v. Roderick, 23 Neb. 505), and "being thus- compellable to make this payment to the city treasurer, the county treasurer should do so </seg>
            <seg id="p321">OPINIONS voluntarily (See Chickaminf; v. Carpenter, 106 U. S. 663). Since the city treasurer is the legal custodian of all the city's money (Sec. 17-514) the due performance of his duty in making and enforcing his demand on the county treasurer for the tax moneys in question, will no doubt soon relieve the described confusion in the management of city funds. You next request information as to the liability, if any, of the council or city ' treasurer for transfening to the general fund the proceeds of taxes levied and ci lUcted to pay interest and principal of city bonds. We find that each statute authorizing city bond issues for a given purpose, contains special provisions of its own as to violahility or inviola - bility of the funds raised by taxation to discharge all the obligations of the bonds. The usual provision is that the taxes to pay the interest and principal of the bonds can be used only for those purposes. Thus the water bond taxes are required to Le retained in a fund known as the "water fund" (Sec. 17-441). If transfers, consolidations or mutations of the funds result in the expenditure of the taxes for some unauthorized purpose leaving no other city money applicable to the interest and principal of the bonds when ciue, personal liability of the officials responsible for the condition may result. It is clear that the official managers of multiple, municipal funds act upon their own .responsibility and at their own risk in manipulating or intermingling them and that the only safe course is to keep separate and distinct the funds specified by the statute.

Mr. M. L. Smith, ' City Clerk, Osceola, Nebraska. Dear Sir: This is in answer to your letter of May 28, 1931, in which you state and inquire: "Where a regular county road goes through a town, is it the duty of the county . or the city to repair the bridges on said road? Where there is a county road on the boundary line of the town, whose duty is it to build and repair the bridges on this road?" </seg>
            <seg id="p323">OPINIONS If the intra-mural budge consitules a part of a thoroughfare which is both a city street and-a continuation of a county road through the city, and is over sixty feet in length, the county must keep the same in repair. (Sec. 17-307, Comp. St., 1929). But if such intra-mural village-street and county-road blidge is less than sixty feet in length the village must keep it in repair (Sec. 17-507, ibid.). The county board may in their discretion, when there are funds available in the county road fund, repair any bridge in any Village or city in the county (Sec. 39-820, Comp. St., 1929). If the boundary-road bridge exceeds sixty feet in length its repair is the obligation of the county but if less than sixty feet in length, the city repairs the intra-mural and the county the extra-mural portion of the bridge (Sees. 17-5U7 and 39-132, Comp.

Dear Sir: In reply to your inquiry of June 2 asking our opinion as to the authority of the state of Nebraska by the Department of Public Works to acquire private property for state highway purposes by right of eminent domain within the corporate limits of the village of Mullen it is our opinion that such right of eminent domain may be exercised in the village. Section 39-1401, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929, as amended by Senate File No. 9 of the legislative session just closed very clearly contemplates the running of state highways in and through villages and towns. You will note that the following appears in this section with reference to the highway through Mullen: "Highway 74. Commencing at Brewster, running near or through Dunning, Thedford, to Mullen. </seg>
            <seg id="p324">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "Highway 75. Commencing at Mullen, running near or through Whitman, to Hyahnis." Although there is some rather vague language used in the opinion in the case of Wookey v. City of Alma, ll^Neb. 158, J61, 223 N. W. 153. the court in that case was considering only the provisions of what is now Section 39-1404 as ammended-by House Roll 459 of the recent legislature. It would clearly cripple the state highway progranf as to con - nections through villages if this right of eminent domain could not be exercised within the limits of such village. The village is not build - ing the highway in such cases and the state directly is the only gov - ernmental body which would seem to he. interested in such condemna - tion proceedings.

Scott, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire if foreign pipe line companies are required to file a report or undertaking of any kind with the attoiney general. Section 59-804, Comp. St., 1929, requires foreign corporations to file an undertaking and an annual report with the attorney general but exempts from this requirement "common carriers and corpora - tions owning or using property exclusively in connection with the business of transportation." Section 75-1101, Comp. St., 192&lt;J, provides: "Any company, corporation or association, formed or cre - ated for the purpose of transporting, transmitting or convey - ing crude oil, petroleum or the products thereof, or gases, from one point in the state of Nebraska to another point in- </seg>
            <seg id="p325">OPINIONS the state of Nebraska for a consideration are hereby declared to be common carriers;" etc. There is a serious question,, however, whether Section 75-1101, supra, is valid as to those pipe line companies which transport only their own product. It has frequently been held by the courts that a private carrier cannot be converted into a common carrier by a legislative command. Michigan Commission v. Duke, 266 U. S. 570, •15 S. C. 191; State ex rel v. Kuykendall, 275 "U. S. 207, 48 S. C 41* Big Bend Auto Freight v. Ogers, 148 Wash. 521, 269 P. 802. I am of the opinion that if a pipe line company is in fact a com - mon carrier, serving the public generally in the transportation of gas or petroleum products, it is not required to file a report or undertaking with the attorney general. If, however, it is in fact a private carrier and is not serving the public generally, 1 believe it should file with the attorney general the annual report arid the undertaking required by Section 59-804, Comp. St., 1929. Very truly yours, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General, By CLIFFORD L. REIN, Assistant Attorney General. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION LAW— FEES FOR VARIOUS TYPES OF MEDICAL SERVICE June 11, 1931 Hon. Frank L. Bowman, House of Representatives, Washington, D. C.

            <seg id="p326">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL In the Nebraska Workmen's Compensation Law, the only refer - ence to medical services and expenses is found in Section 48-120, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska. 1929, reading as follows: "The employer shall be liable for reasonable medical and hospital services and medicines as and when needed, subject to the approval of the compensation commissioner, not, how - ever, to exceed the regular charge made for such service in similar cases unless the employe refuses to allow them to be furnished by the employer. In cases of injury requiring dis - memberment,'or injuries involving ' major surgical operation, the employe may designate to his employer, the physician or surgeon to perform the operation. If the injured employe refuses or neglects to avail himself of medical or surgical treatment furnished by the employer except as herein and otherwise provided, the employer shall not be liable for an aggravation of such injury due to such refusal and neglect," It would thus appear that all medical services including allopathic, homeopathic ahd osteopathic services, are recognized and paid for on the same basis by said law.

Mr. Ernest Olson, . - Box 57, Malmo, Nebraska. ; . ' Dear Sir: . . . You inquire if a person not registered as a veterinary surgeon may lawfully caponize roosters and make a charge therefor. Section 71-1901, Comp. St., 1929, defines the practice of veterinary medicine and surgery, and the practice as there defined might be con - sidered broad enough to include the caponizing of roosters for com - pensation — assuming that the term "domestic animals" as therein used would be construed to include poultry. </seg>

I am inclined to believe that the Legislature intended and assumed that this law should not be construed to permit only registered veterinary surgeons to charge for caponizing fowls.

TAXATION, COLLECTION OF TAXES UNDER DISTRESS WARRANTS, FEES AND MILEAGE^ June 20. 1931. Mr. Merwin O. Johnson. County Attorney, Rush vi lie, Nebraska. ■ ... ' Dear Sir: • " You say: "Approximately six hundred Distress Warrants have been issued by the Treasurer of our County and placed in the hands of the Sheriff. The Sheriff made the proposition to the County Commissioners" that he would attempt collection of the taxes due under the Distress Warrants, providing the Commissioners would agree to pay ten cents per mile, under the warrants that were satisfied, for the reason that they could not afford to collect them under the fees and mileage that is allowed under the statutes. "It is my opinion that the Sheriff is obliged to collect the delinquent taxes under the Warrants, as a part of the duties of his office; that it would be illegal for the county Commissioners to allow mileage of ten cents per mile, out of the General Fund of the County, on those collected. It is my opinion also that the Sheriff is compelled to levy the distress warrants where the party against whom they are issued does not pay the taxes, and where there is a sufficient amount of property upon which to levy. However, under the circumstances it would be </seg>
            <seg id="p329">OPINIONS n physical impossiblity for the Sheriff to levy and hold sales under the Six Hundred Distress Warrants, within the sixty day period provided by statute, or in fact for several months. "Some of the taxes included in the Distress Warrants are from previous years, and were not collected by the former Sheriff and County Treasurer. Wouldn't the former Sheriff and County Treasurer be liable on their bond for Iheir failure to collect the taxes, provided by statutes, more especially in cases they wilfully neglected to do so?" I agree with you that a part of the official duties of a Sheriff is to serve distress warrants for the collection of taxes that are placed in his hands for service. He must render this service also for the compensation provided by statute. The mileage or traveling expense aUowed him is set forth in 77-1917 Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929 which provides that he shaU not be allowed a sum in excess of five cents a mile for each mile actually and necessarily traveled by him on each warrant. There is a further provision that all fees including mileage shall be taxed to the parties against whom the distress warrants run, and shall be collected as the original tax, T find nothing in this section to indicate that the sheriff is entitled to ten cents per mile payable' out of the general f un d o f the county. I presume the former county treasurer and sheriff might be held liable on their official bonds for wilful neglect to perform their official duties in the matter of the collection of taxes if by reason of such neglect the taxes or a part of them were lost but they would not be liable in my opinion for taxes that can be collected ultimately or for taxes that were uncollectible even if they had done their best to collect them. Nor do I believe they would be' liable jointly. The sheriff would not be liable for the collection of taxes where no distress warrant was placed in his hands for their collection and the treasurer would in no event be liable where he gave the distress warrant to the sheriff in due time and the failure to collect was caused by the failure of the sheriff to serve it.

            <seg id="p330">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL CRIMINAL PROCEEDURE— VENUE IN NO-FUND CHECK PROSE - CUTION—NO-FUND CHECKS ON JOINT ACCOUNTS June 22, 1931. Mr. H. W. Ojendyk," Ashton, Nebraska. Dear Sir: . This is answer to your letter of June 18 1931, addressed to the undersigned. You request an opinion as to whether a resident of Buf - falo County should be prosecuted in Buffalo County or in Sherman County for drawing and delivering in Sherman Ccunty an insufficient - fund check of $32.04 You also inquire whether the fact that the check in question is drawn on the joint account of two or more per - sons, is a legal bar to the prosecution. Article 1, Section 11 of the Nebraska Constitution provides in sub - stance that the venue or legal place to conduct criminal prosecutions is the county in which the offence was committed. The law relating to the offense of giving no-fund or insufficient-fund checks is found in Sections 28-1212 and 2«-1213, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929, reading as fellows: "Any person who, with intent to defraud, shall make or draw, or utter, or deliver, any check, draft, or order for the payment of money, upon any bank or other depository, know - ing at the time of such making, drawing, uttering or delivering, that the maker, or drawer has not sufficient funds in, or credit with, such bank or other depository for the payment of such check, draft or order, in full upon its presentation, shall upon conviction, be punished as follows: If such check, draft or order so issued, be for a sum not exceeding thirty-five dollars ($35.00), then and in that case the person so convicted shall be fined in any sum not less than five dollars ($5.00) nor more than one hudred dollars ($100.00) or shall be imprisoned in the county jail not more than ninety (90) days, or both, at the discretion of the court and shall pay the costs of prosecution.. And if such check, draft or order, so issued, be for a sum greater than thirty-five dcllars ($36X0), then and in that case the person so convicted shall be fined not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), or imprisoned in the penitentiary not exceeding seven years, or both, at the discretion of the court." </seg>
            <seg id="p331">OPINIONS. "In any prosecution under this act as against the maker or drawer thereof, the making, drawing, uttering or delivering of a check, draft or order, payment of which is refused by the drawee because of lack of funds or credit, shall be pre - sumptive evidence of the intent to defraud and of knowledge of insufficient funds in, or credit with such bank or other depos - itory, provided such maker or drawer shall not have paid the payee thereof the amount due thereon, together with all costs and protest fees, within five days after receiving notice that such check, draft or order shall have been protested, the no - tice of protest thereof sh&amp;ll. be admissible as procf of such pre - sentation for payment, non-payment and protest; and if such notice of protest or the drawee's notice of dishonor thereof, shall state that payment of such check, draft or order was ". refused because of lack, of funds or credit of the maker or drawer, then such notice of protest or notice of dishonor shall be presumptive evider.ee that there was a lack of funds in, or credit with, such bank or ether depository, for the pay - ment of such check, draft or order." ■ Thus from Section 28-1212 it is observed that the offense, briefly slated, is the giving of the check with knowledge at the time of in - sufficient funds for its pcyment and with intent to defraud. This of - fense is, therefore, committed in the county where the check is drawn or delivered with the knowledge and intent referred to. You state that the check in question was both drawn and delivered in Sherman County. Such being the fact, we entertain no doubt that the proper venue or place to commence and conduct the ciiminal prosecution on the check in question is, Sherman County. The fact that the account on which this check was drawn was a joint one, may, of course, result in a good defense to the accused. Without the knowledge of the drawer of this check, the other owner of the account may have drawn it down to where it was insufficient to pay this check on presentation. Thus, one essential element of the offense, namely, knowledge of insufficient funds to pay the check, might fail of proof beyond' a reasonable doubt and result in the ac - quittal of the accused. Eut even as against the fact of a joint account thus drawn down by the other owner to insufficiency without the knowledge of the drawer of this check, the prosecution would be en - titled to the statutory presumptions of guilty knowledge and fraudulent intent arising from the drawing and delivering of the check in ques - tion (See Sec. 28-1213, above quoted). The joint-account weakness is, of course, one which will justify the county attorney in refusing to commence and continue the pro- </seg>
            <seg id="p332">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL secntion. The county attorney is vested with a discretion, substantially uncontrolled by law, as to what alleged offenses nnd offenders he will prosecute. Hence, when a cose offered the county attorney for pro - secution presents facts clearly making it doubtful whether a con - viction may be obtained, no citizen has just cause for complaint when the county attorney declines to prosecute such a case. Since crim - inal laws are very strictly construed agsinst the state and in faVor of the accused, (Lane v. Sate, 232 N. W. 96) a lawyer often hesitates to bring criminal prosecutions to which the layman sees no obstacles. We observe that the offense involved in drawing and delivering a S32.04 insufficient-fund check is only a misdemeanor (Sec 29-102 Compiled Statutes, 1929). It carries punishment by fine from $5.00 to S100.00 or by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding ninety days or both (Sec. 28-1212, above quoted). For such offense the pro - secution should be brought in the county rather than the justice court upon whose jurisdiction there is a three'-months-imprisonment limit which in some months of some years might be exceeded by the maximum ninety-day imprisonment period authorized for this offense (See Article V, Sees. 16 and 18, Nebraska Constitution). For such offense, if the county attorney does not care to make, file and prosecute the complaint in the county court, the defrauded party, in the absence of the county attorney, may do so himself with or without the assist - ance of counsel (Sees. 7-710, 29-404 and 29-603, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929). ■ ■ . • However, we know of no case of this kind where the county attorney has been properly urged by the defrauded party to prosecute and has refused to do so, except where it appears that the defrauded party will refuse to testify if he is paid the amount of the check.

Dear Sir: This is in answer lo your letter of June 22, 1931, requesting our opinion as to . whether the Seward ordinance levying an annual oc - cupation tax of $50.00 upon cafeteria, gasoline stations with curb pumps, but leaving untaxed gascline stations with curb pumps giving service thrrugh attendants, is vcid for •discrimination or denial of equal protection of the laws. We fail to find any state or federal court decisions which are directly responsive to your question. In this state of the law, it is probably true that no ex parte, legal opinion upon your question is entirely free from dcubt or entirely exempt from legitimate legal dis - pensation.. Nevertheless upon the question you present, we have for - mulated an opinion, which, knowing that it will not be taken for more than it is really worth, we are not unwilling to express. The pertient Nebraska statutes are Sections 17-427 and 17-436, Comp. St., 1929, reading in part as follows: "Each city . . . may enact ordinances for the following purposes: "To raise revenue by levying and collecting a license tax on any occupation or business within the limits of the city... . and regulate the same by ordinance. All such taxes shall be uniform in respect to the classes upon which they are imposed." The mast pertinent Nebraska Supreme Court decision . appears to be Caldwell v. City of Lincoln, 19 Neb. 569. Here the court construed the same statutory language as that found in the second paragraph of the above quotation from Section 17-436. In this case the court held as follows: "While cities of the second class . . . have authority to impose a tax on any occupation or business within the limits of the city, yet such ordinances must be so framed as to make </seg>
            <seg id="p334">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL such taxes uniform in respect to the classes upon which they are imposed; and such taxes must be reasonable, considering the nature of the business, and not so high as to be prohibitive." Since your inquiry is in terms directed not to the confiscatory but to the discriminatory aspect, if any, of the ordinance in question, we find no demand for giving critical consideration either to the amount of the tax imposed by said ordinance or to the internal nature of the cafeteria, gasoline-station business thereby taxed. The crucial inter - rogatory involves only the constitutional power of the city consistently and by the same act of municipal legislation to tax the cafeteria stations and leave the others untaxed. Upon this precise question, we find the following rules of con - stitutional law to be more or less directly pertinent: "Subject to limitations of equality and uniformity, trades, occupations, professions and privileges may be classified for purposes of license or occupation taxes, and different licenses or taxes be imposed upon the various classes, provided the * classification is reasonable." 37 Corpus Juris, 198, Note. 24. "General classes may be subdivided into particular classes, and in the interest of the public particular occupations or classes of business may be licensed or taxed, and other occu - pations or businesses be entirely exempt therefrom. Such dis - crimination "between classes must rest Upon some reasonable ground of difference which has some relation to the business or occupation. . . .Acts or ordinances are unconstitutional and void as class legislation and as a denial of the equal protec - tion of the laws where they arbitrarily impose different rates of taxation or different terms and conditions upon different oc - cupations or privileges without- any reasonable basis for such distinctions." 37 Corpus Juris, ]99, 200, Notes 25, 26, 27, 30. "A license tax must bear equally and uniformly upon all persons engaged in the same class of business or occupation or exercising the same privileges; and if it makes an arbitrary distinction between persons similarly situated and does nof fall alike on all persons engaged in the same particular class of business or avocation, it is unconstitutional and void, as where it arbitrarily and unreasonably exempts part of a class, </seg>
            <seg id="p335">OPINIONS or arbitrarily and unreasonably discriminates between different modes of conducting the same business, unless there is some - thing, in the one mode which makes it more dangerous to the public." 37 Corpus Juris 200, 201, Notes 32-3C, citing In re Yot Sang, 75 Fed. 983, 171 U. S. 686, holding void an ordin - ance "imposing a license tax of twenty-five dollars per quarter upon every laundry establishment other than a steam laundry conducted by a male laun - dryman with an assistant, but allowing steam laundries to be conducted under a license of only fifteen dollars per quarter." Conformably to the above principles, we find no unreasonable and unlawful discrimination in an ordinance levying . an occupation tax on all greoline stations with curb pumps and leaving other businesses untaxed. But we do fail to observe any reasonable basis for taxing the cafeteria, curb-pump stations and leaving the other curb-pump stations untaxed. Between gasoline stations' equipped to allow the customer to service himself, and those equipped to require the cus - tomer to be served by a station attendant, we see no greater and bet - ter distinction upon which to found the differences of police and taxation treatment by governments, than the distinction which sub - sists between hand and steam, laundries and which was tidld not to warrant a different rate of license, or occupation taxation for each kind of laundry (In re Yot Sang, supra). It has, of course, often been urged upon us that cafeteria, gasoline pumps are more danger - ous to the public as fire hazards than those giving service through the offices of an attendant; a circumstance which under the above rules (37 Corpus Juris, 201, Note 36) might justify severe police or taxation treatment for cafeteria, gasoline stations. But after careful examination of the question, we " have concluded and advised that cafeteria gasoline pumps are not in themselves more dangerous to the public as fire hazards or nuisances than gasoline pumps giving service by attendants (See copy of letter to Fred E. Maurer inclosed herewith). We are, therefore, of the opinion that for want of a reasonable basis for classification or distinction, an ordinance levying an annual occupation tax of S50.00 upon cafeteria, gasoline stations with curb pumps but leaving untaxed gasoline stations with curb pumps giving service through attendants, is unenforceable as discriminatory or denying the equal protection of the laws. Sincerely yours, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General, By CLIFFORD L. REIN, Assistant Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p336">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL COUNTY OFFICERS— SALAKIKS BASED ON POPULATION— "POPULATION" DEFINED ' - . June .26, 1931.- Mr. E. G. Reed, , County Attorney, Kearney, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You call attention to the fact, that the amount of the salary of certain county officers is 'made dependent by statute on the population of the county: In Buffalo County is located a State Normal School with an enrollment of eeveral hundred students from all parts of Nebraska and from other states, a sanitarium containing a number of patients and a State Industrial School where boys under a certan age are committed by the courts from all parts of the state. You ask if persons such as the students in the State Normal School, patients in the sanitarium and inmates of the State Industrial School for Boys should be counted in determining the population of Buffalo County for the purpose of determining salaries of county officers. I believe that the word "population" as used in the statutes referred to is intended by the Legislature to mean the number of inhabitants of the county. Some of the statutes expressely so state. Section 33-112, Comp. St., 1929, for example, provides that when the county has more than a certain number of "inhabitants" the salary of the Register of Deeds shall be, etc., while Section' 33-111, Comp. St., 1929, fixing the salary of county attorneys says: "In counties having a population of one thousand or less," etc., indicating as it seems to me, that by the term "population" the Legislature meant the number of inhabitants. The term "population" has. usually been defined by the courts as meaning the number of inhabitants, although courts have occasionally held that it means the number of citizens of a given district. See Words and Phrases (2nd Series) Vol. 3, p. 1092. Assuming, therefore, that by the term "population" as used in the statutes the Legislature meant the number of inhabitants of the county the next question is: What is an "inhabitant" of a county? The word "inhabitant" is denned by Funk and Wagnall's New Standard Dictionary to be: "One making his home or dwelling per - - manently in a place, as distinguished from a lodger or visitor." </seg>
            <seg id="p337">OPINIONS The Oxford Dictionary defines it as, "one who inhabits; a human being or animal dwelling in a place; a permanent resident." Webster's New International Dictionary defines it as "one who dwells or .resides permanently in a place, as distinguished from a transient lodger or visitor." Bouvier's Law Dictionary defines inhabitant to be "one who has his domicile in a place; one who has an actual fixed residence in a place." In State ex rel Thayer v. Boyd, 31 Neb. 682 (727), 48 N. W. 739 (752) the Supreme Court quotes with approval a passage from the opinion an State v. Primrose, 3 Ala. 546. in which the definition given by Bouvier is. cited. . The term has frequently been defined by the courts in construing constitutional and statutory provisions. See Words and Phrases 1st Series, Vol. 4, p. 3594 et seq., 2nd. Series, Vol 2 p. 1067 et seq In practically all the cases where the term has been defined by a court the definition has been substantially the same as those given above except where the clear context and meaning of the provision in which the word occurcd required a different meaning to be given it .It will be noted that one element of the definition of the word 'inhabitant? which is found in the definition given by practically all the authorities is the idea of fixity or permanence of residence. The term is usually defined to mean something more than a mere resi - dent, who may be only a transient lodger or sojourner. An inhabitant is one who actually inhabits or dwells in a place with the intention of making that place his home. Clearly a mere transient visitor, a temporary lodger at a hotel, for example, could not be classed as an inhabitant. On the other hand, the fact that one resides in the county for only a short time does not mean that he is not an inhabitant. The time element has little to do with the question, apparently, except as it goes to show intent. the real test seems to be the intent of the person. If he settles in one spot even for a day with the intent of establishing his home at that place I think he should be classed as an inhabitant. In the case of a student, for instance, if he moves to a city with the intention of making it his home while, he is attending school, even though he expects to leave when he has completed his education, I think he might be properly classified as an inhabitant. If he considers the place to be his home even though, he does not expect it to be his home for long, he is an inhabitant as long as he maintains his home at that place. </seg>
            <seg id="p338">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL The same is true of patients in the sanitarium. One who tempor - arily occupies a room while he is' recovering from an operation, for example, and who at no time thinks of the sanitarium as his home or dwelling place is not an inhabitant, but one who is living there with the intent that it is his home — his fixed place of abode for the present - and not a mere temporary absence from his regular habitant, should be counted as an inhabitant. ■ . ' In the case of inmates of the Boys Industrial School a somewhat different question is presented because these inmates are not there of their own voluntary will and act. It could be argued, with some plausibility that these inmates could hardly be said to intend to make their homes in a place where they were being kept against their will. However, the institution is undoubtedly their fixed place of abode for the time they are. incarcerated. I am informed that the federal census bureau treats all inmates of public institutions as inhabitants of the political territory where the instiution is located. Our Supreme Court has frequently held that while the United States census reports are not conclusive as to the true population in any given territory they afford very satisfactory evidence of the fact and, unless overcome by competent evidence of some other character, shold be accepted as prima-facie evidence of the total population of the territory under con - sideration. State v. Davis, 66 Neb. 333, 335; O'Connell v. Sioux County, 94 Neb. 826; Gordon v. Lowry, 116 Neb. 359. I am of the opinion, therefore, that the inmates of the Boys Industrial School may properly be counted in determining the population of the county for the purpose of fixing salaries of the county officers. ; .

Mr. William Albers, County Treasurer, Lincoln, Nebraska. ....'.-• - Dear Mr. Albers: You call our attention to the following provision in Section 60-311, Comp. St, 1929: </seg>
            <seg id="p339">OPINIONS "Provided, further, that in case of transfer of motor ve - . hide or in case of loss of possession due to fine, theft, dis - mantelment, or junking, within a period of ninety days from the time of payment of fee as provided in Section 60-314, as aforesaid, the registered owner may, by returning the regis - tration certificate and number plates and after making an affidavit to the county treasurer of such transfer or loss re - ceive a refund of one-half of the amount of such fee." You also call attention to the fact that Section 60-306, Comp. St., 1929, provides that renewal registration fees ' shall become due on the first day of January of each year and delinquent on the first day of February except in counties having a population of over 80,000 in which counties the day of delinquency is March first. You ask if, in a county in which the delinquency date is March 1st, one paying his registration fee some time prior to the last day of February is entitled to claim the refund provided for in Section 60-311 any time within ninety days after February 28th, or must he file his claim within ninety days of the date on which he "actually pays? It is my opinion that a person paying his registration fee any time during January or February is entitled to a refund if he files his claim within ninety days of February 28, even though it may be more than ninety days after the date on which he actually paid the registration fee. . To hold that a party has only ninety days from the date he actually pays, in such cases, would penalize the person who pays promptly on January 1st and give an unfair advantage to the person who delays payment until the last day of February. We believe the statute should be liberally construed in favor of the person who pays his fee promptly when due. Very truly yours, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General, By HOMER L. KYLE, Assistant Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p340">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL BUILDING &amp; LOAN ASSOCIATIONS- CREDITING PAID UP STOCK TO LOANS TO MEMBERS July 2J, 1931. Unique Builders/Inc, 312 Union State Bank Bldg., Omaha, Nebraska. Gentlemen: ■ . •. In your letter of July 18 you make inquiry concerning the practice of building and loan associations accepting paid up stock or credits on stock subscriptions as payment or credit upon loans made by such associations to the stockholder. If the association is solvent and carrying on its business in the ordinary manner, recognizing with - drawals and making payments on stock under such withdrawals, we see no legal objection to the practice mentioned. However, as to those associations in the process of liquidation the practice is not authorized, since it might operate as a preference as between stockholders. (Saunders v. State Sav. and Loan Assn. Neb. S. C. No. 27815, July 2, 1931.) . ; You make further inquiry as to interest rates charged by build - ing and loan associations, mentioning a case where the total of the loan was reduced to S60U.0U but interest is still charged on the full amount of the loan. This matter will be governed by the articles of the association r.nd by-laws of the association and by its contract with the borrower. The usury laws are not applicable to building and loan associations. (8-315 C. S. 1929) Perhaps in the case you mention the payments _have been credited on the stock purchase contract which has formed a part of the loan contract. That is to say, the contract may call for the crediting of payments on the stock rather than on the loan. This has caused much confusion in the minds of many persons dealing with building and loan associations. No doubt the -customer in many cases thinks he. is making payments on his mortgage loan rather than on his stock and, in case of liquidation of the association, the court would probably be inclined to take his view of it. However, so long as the association is solvent and doing business in the ordinary manner the borrower's rights will be governed as above indicated. Yours very truly. C. A.

You say that you have been informed that it is against the law to sell food flavors in panel bottles. in the State of Nebraska. You ask if this is true. Section 81-904 Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929, provides that food products shall be deemed to be misbranded if they are offered for sale "in a container so made, formed, or shaped as likely to de - ceive or mislead the purchaser as to quantity; quality, size, kind or origin of the food therein.". The Department of Agriculture of the State of Nebraska, which has charge of the enforcement of this law, has ruled that panel bot - tles are such containers as are likely to deceive the purchaser as to quantity, etc., and are therefore illegal.

Entires, State Sheriff, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir- Under the provisions ot Senate File No. 3 which goes into effect August 3, 1931, no person, association or corporation may conduct or operate any road house, dance hall, amusement park, or other place of -public amusement outside of the limits of any incorporated city or village, without first having obtained a license from the county board. The penalty is a fine of not less than $10.00 nor more than $50.00 for each day any such place is operated without a license. </seg>
            <seg id="p342">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL In order to obtain a license an application must be filed with the c.:unty clerk. Notice of this application must he published at. the expense of the applicant for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county and precinct where the place of amusement is located. The notice must give the time and place at which the application will be considered by the county board. Any person having objection to the granting of a license may ap - pear before the county board. The county board has full authority to act. It may refuse to grant t ne ii cen se or it may grant the license upon certain conditions, such as that the place of amusement shall close at certain hours! not be conducted in any manner to disturb other people, not to 'open on Sunday, etc. In addition- to Senate File No. 3 the Legislature also passed House Roll No. 63 which also goes into effect August 3, 1931. This bill prohibits all public dancing on Sundays except in cities and villages in which public dancing is supervised and regulated by the municipal authorities and except in rural territory beyond the corporate limits of any city or village where public dancing is supervised and regulated by a special deputy sheriff assigned by the sheriff of the county to such rural dance hall for the purpose of supervising the same. This deputy sheriff must not be an employee of nor in any way related to the proprietor of the dance hall, nor be directly or indirectly interested financially in the operation of the place. Such deputy sheriff must give a bond in the sum of S3.000.00 to the county to cover any negligence of unlawful acts on his part and conditioned upon the faithful per - formance of his duties as supervisor of the dance hall to which he is assigned. The compensation of the deputy sheriff for his services under this law must be paid by the proprietor of the dance hall. Of course these two laws do not apply to dances in a private home, where the public is excluded and no charge is made. We believe that these two laws should be strictly enforced. There has been a great deal of complaint from parents about the manner in which certain public dance halls have been operated. With these two laws in effect the county sheriffs of the state and your own office will not have much further difficulty, I believe, in properly supervising public dance halls and other resorts.

            <seg id="p344">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "First:. I understand the law requiring bus drivers to pay a fee of S12.50 for each person of which their bus is equipped to haul, to apply to persons (not districts) hauling school pupils, when the drivers owns the bus. Would this still be true when the district owns the bus body and the driver owns the chassis? "Second: We have, some farmers who . pick up pupils along the road to school and sometimes have more than 7 pupils and while they do this for hire they use an ordinary touring car. Would the above law apply to them?" The law in question is Section 3 of Senate File 33, 19S1, Legislature. Said law in our opinion applies to persons hauling school pupils when the driver owns the bus. Under the said law, there is no exception of school pupils from the word "persons'* referring to persons carried. This would, in our opinion, still be true, if the school district owned the bus body and the driver owned the chassis. The law, so far as material to your question, excepts only "motor vehicles owned and used exclusively by schools." We do not believe that this law applies to the owner or driver of a touring car, not equipped to. carry more than seven persons, but sometimes picking up and carrying for hire more than seven persons; in this case, school pupils. The SI 2.50 clause is expressed to apply only to "motor vehicles equipped to carry more than seven persons." Sincerely yours, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General, By CLIFFORD L.

Of course if the owner of such a vehicle uses it in the motor transportation business he must also comply with the laws governing that business. You will note that the law provides that: "Duplicate number plates shall not be used for service cars, personal or private motor vehicles of manufac - . tures or dealers, or motor vehicles used for hire," (60-319). It occurs to me that if the Legislature had intended the above enumerated restrictions to apply to the first pair of number plates issued; a dealer, it would have said so. Sincerely yours, . C. A.

" No attempt "was made by the heirs to probate a will which was also made at the same time as -the deed transferring the land. </seg>
            <seg id="p346">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "As county attorney, I commenced proceedings in county court to have an inheritance tax appraiser appointed and the transfer declared subject to an inheritance tax. An appraiser was appointed, end upon his hearing for appraisment, it developed that the deceased left considerable debts against his estate which were not of record. For~this reason the inheritance tax assessed was very small. "The county judge allowed the appraiser a fee of $50.00 for appraising the land in both counties. However, this was more than the amount of the tax, although a very reasonable fee for appraising more than 500 acres of land. The tax was apportioned between the two counties, and the appraiser's fee was also ap - portioned between the two on the same proportion as the tax. This made the amount of the fee in the adjoining county, as well as in this county, more than the amount of the tax re - ceived by it. The neighboring county is now objecting to pay- ; ing any more than the amount ' of the tax received on the ground that the statute provides that the costs shall be paid out of the tax." You inquire for an opinion from this department as to the meaning of the part of 77-2211 which reads as follows: "All costs made or incurred under this article shall be paid by the county treasurer out of any funds he may have in his hands on account of such tax, on certificate of the county judge." In answer to the question you ask I will say that in my opinion the cost of such a proceeding including the appraiser's fee may lawfully be paid by the county treasurer out of any inheritance tax money he had in his hands, and payment is not necessarily required to be made out of the identical inheritance tax moneys received in the case in which the services are rendered.

Fred Ketler, Overseer, Road District Number Five, Wairneta, Nebraska. Dear Sir: This is in answer to your kind letter of August 17, 1931 requesting information as to what an insolvent road district nnd its overseer can do, if anything, to enforce road action or road cooperation by the county board in said district. Under the law of this state the general supervision and control of roads, except state and federal highways is in the county board (Sec. 39-101, Comp. St., 1929). Also under the law of this state, it is the duty of the road districts. created by the county board, through their over - seers to-do with respect to roads what the county board wants done, in the way the county board wants it done, at the time and place the couny board wants it done at, to the extent of the funds apportioned to the district to do it with (See Section 39-601 to 39-618, Comp. St., 1929). If there is any respect in which the road overseer is not virtually the hired man of the county board, the laws of this state fail to point it out. The board, therefore, can replace the overseer who is with other overseers and their teams and helpers. There is no way in which road districts created by the board can compel financial or other contributions to the district by the board. Of course, if the board provides the road district or overseer with no funds, and there are no other funds available for the purpose, the road overseer is under no obligation to improve a mail route out of his own pocket. He can let it alone until the county board decides what it wants to do about it. We also fail to find any law authorizing a iroad district or road overseer to direct the county board in regard to the payment of claims for road work in such districts or in regard to the use of the county road machinery in such district. Three fs also .the proper number of county commissioners (Sec, 26 - 133, Comp. St., 1929). but if more or less than that number acted as such, their acts would be valid as to third parties including road overseers. </seg>
            <seg id="p348">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL There is also no legal way to compel the county beard to grade a road after they have laid it out. Road work is within the board's discretion, and for abuse of that discretion the redress is rather poli - tical than legal. - We, therefore, earnestly suggest that you obtain from the county board of your county all required directions as to how to proceed in the matters submitted in your letter. Sincerely yours, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General, By CLIFFORD L. REIN, Assistant Attorney General. SCHOOL BOARD— RIGHT TO CONTRACT TO INSTRUCT CHILDREN FROM NEIGHBORING DISTRICT August 20, 1931.

Posson, ; ' County Treasurer, Ogallala, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Posson: .You say; "I would like to have your opinion as to whether there is a law as to the legality, of accepting the general taxes levied on a piece of property, where there are SPECIAL taxes levied, and the party makes a TENDER for the general taxes, but refuses to pay the special taxes. </seg>
            <seg id="p350">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "I have in some cases done this, and in the margin of the tax list, 'Paid State and County Only'. .■•■*■ ■ ■ "There is a controversy over the taxes levied for the 'Pax - ton Irrigation Dist' and some are willing to pay their general taxes, but will not pay the special tax." In answer to your question I wilj say that I do not recall any statut - ory provision which in express terms authorizes you to accept payment of state and county taxes while irrigation district taxes remain unpaid. The statute does provide that you shall receive the. amount due on special assessments levied for the use of an irrigation dsitrict. "The treasurer shall receive from any taxpayer at any time the amount due on account of special assessments levied for the use of any irrigation district, whether other taxes on the same real estate are paid or not." (77-1903) It is said however that "The citizen always has the right to pny the amount of any one tax listed against him, while refusing or omitting to pay others" (37 Cyc. 1164) ■ . I am therefore of the opinion that you are justified in receiving the state and county (and school district) taxes even though the irrigation taxes are not paid because the tax payer denies their validity. You will of course, only receipt for taxes you receive and your books will show that the irrigation district taxes remain unpaid. Sincerely yours, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General, By GEORGE W.

Dear Sir: This is in answer to your kind letter of August 18, 1931, in which you state and inquire: </seg>
            <seg id="p351">OPINIONS "Owing to the drouth and grasshopper invasion in Boyd County this year it has been suggested to me that we dispense with the advertising of the delinquent tax list this year. "Am writing if this could in any way be done, and save .the expense of publishing the" delinquent list, and also do away with the 127o interest which the taxes would draw if sold at tax sale. "I think that by October first at least 85% of our real estate will be paid, and possibly more." ■ ■ ■ We regret to say that we fail to find any law authorizing you to dispense with the publication this year of the notice of sale of lands for delinquent taxes due thereon as provided by Section 77-2002, Comp. St., 1929. It would therefore appear that mandamus by citizens and taxpayers would lie to compel the county treasurer to advertise and hold the tax sale in question. It would also appear that the lands are presumed to be worth the taxes and the costs of collecting them, and that, when this ceases to be true, the remedy is to reduce the assessed valuation of the lands. We might add that we fail to find a penalty on the treasurer for omitting to advertise and hold the tax sale mentioned. Hence if the sale and advertisement thereof were dispensed with this year, and no one complained, we can forsee no legal obstacles and complications arising after the event. Sincerely yours,' C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General, By CLIFFORD L. REIN, Assistant Attorney General. PURCHASERS AT PARTITION SALES— LIABILITY FOR DEFICIENCY September 3, 1931 Hon. Dora Nelson, County Attorney, . . • Holdrege, Nebraska. Dear Miss Nelson: This is in answer to your kind letter of September 1, 1931, addressed to the undersigned. </seg>
            <seg id="p352">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Ycu first request Nebraska legal authority as to whether partiiinn - sale purchasers are liable for deficiencies occurring at a second sale from their bids at the first sale- which was not confirmed and enforced asainst the purchasers, but was set. aside and succeeded by the second sale on application of one of the owners now suing the purchasers at the first sale for her share of the deficiencies. We fail to find any Nebraska authorities which of themselves answer this question categorically. Still, from all of the authorities, we are convinced that this question must be answered in the negative. In Neb - raska partition sales are judicial rales (Sec. 20-2185; 92 Neb. 81, 137 N. W 880). Also, in Nebraska a judicial sale, whether for cash or not, is not a sale until it is confirmed (Maul v. Helman, 39 Neb. 322, 328) We are therefore satisfied that in Nebraska judicial sales whether for cash or not, "where a resale is sought by reason of the failure of the first purchaser to comply with his bid, a confirmation of the first sale is nec - essary in order to charge the defaulting purchaser with the deficiency on the resale." (35 C. J. 119, Notes 3. and 4). Since, as appears from your question, the first, sale was not confirmed but was set aside, the liist sale was clearly no sale. Since the first sale after its vacation was no sale, the purchasers thereat were no longer bcund by their bids. And, of course, if said purchasers were no longer bound by their bids at the first sale thus set aside, they could not thereafer be held for any first bid deficiencies occurring at a second sale. The truth is that the setting aside of the first sale accomplished a restoration of all interested parlies to their positions before the first sale was had. 'It left the purchasers in the same shape as though they had made no bids at the first sale (35 C. J. 114, Note 5). Such being the legal effect of setting aside the first sale, it seems clear to us that the plaintiff, by applying to have that sale set aside, waived any right to have the purchasers at said sale held to their bids thereat. When after the first sale it was discovered that the purchasers did not pay their bids, the owners including the plaintiff you mention apparently had two alternative remedies: first, they could affirm the sale by having it confirmed and then sue the purchasers for the amount of their bids; or, second, they, could disaffirm the sale by having it set aside and seek their satisfaction through another sale (See Gosmunt v. Cloe, 55 Neb. 709, 712 and casts cited). But, of course, the plaintiff could not do both. She could not, in. our opinion, disaffirm the sale by having it set aside and getting another sale, and then, when dissatisfied with what she got through her choice of this alternative remedy, reaffirm the first sale and seek to hold the purchasers to their bids at that sale. </seg>
            <seg id="p353">• . OPINIONS This would be pursuing inconsistent remedies, blowing hot and cold, or mending her hold; neither of which are sanctioned at law. Sincerely yours, C. A.

Aibers, County Treasurer, Lincoln, Nebraska. . Dear Sir: This is in answer to your kind letter of September 2, 1931, in which you state and inquire: "To whom are the registration plates the property of in the following case? An individual buys a car from a dealer and then fails to complete payments on same. Dealer takes car back to his place of business, with plates attached. The indivi - dual retains certificate, not giving dealer bill of sale. The in - dividual buys a car from another dealer and wishes to transfer plates to same. First dealer refuses to return plates because - individual has not fulfilled his contract." This is a case of repossession upon default in performance of an executory sales contract. It is governed by the • provisions of Section 60-313, Comp. St., 1929, relating to transfers by operation of law. The registration plates belong to the involuntary transferee upon satisfaction of the Department of Public Works as to the involuntary loss of owner - ship by the former registered owner. When the department is thus satisfied, the involuntary transferee's title to - the registration plates is not, in our opinion, affected by any failure of the involuntary trans - feror to make his part of the joint statement or to do any other act or thing required of him in evidencing the transfer.

            <seg id="p354">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL CRIMINAL COMPLAINT— CCSTS— LIABILITY OF COMPLAINANT FOR September 8, 1931. Mr. P. A. Jacobson, Justice of the Peace, '.'■ Louisville, Nebraska. Dear Sir: This is in cnswer to your. kind letter of September 3, 1931. It ap - pears that you have issued a warrant against a person accused of kill - ing a dog. This you have done on complaint of a person too poor to pay the costs or give security for the costs in a misdemeanor case. You issued the warrant to the county sheriff. The county sheriff took it up with the county attorney. The county attorney refused to prose - cute the case unless the county was saved harmless from liability for costs therein by requiring the person who signed the complaint, known - in law as the complainant, to pay the ccsts or give security for the costs in the estimated amount of $12.00. With reference to this advice of the county alt. rney, you inquire: "Now I want to know if this is right?" In all courts except the Supreme Court, the ccunly attorney has full control over every criminal case no matter who signed the com - plaint therein. The county attorney may even dismiss such a case after some one else has started it (Sees. 26-901 to 26-903, Comp. St 1929- Rickley v. State, €5 Neb. 841, 848, 91 N. W. 867). Having authority to participate or not to participate in the case, the county attorney may make his prosecution of the case conditional upon the -complainant's obligating himself for the costs. This is also made evident by Section 29-2709, Comp. St., 1929, which provides in substance that no costs shall be allowed against the county in misdemeanor cases "unless said suit shall have been instituted with the consent of the county attorney or, after being brought, he shall approve of such action in writing." When the county attorney thus refuses to bind the county for the costs of a misdemeanor case, the justice and the sheriff or constable serving the papers must look for their fees or costs to the complainant or person who signed the complaint. Section 29-405, Comp. St., 1929 authorizes the magistrate to require of the complainant security for the costs where the magistrate is not convinced of the complainant's fin - ancial responsibility. The complainant, may, of course, prosecute a misdemeanor case himself without the assistance of the county attorney. If the complainant cannot in such a case pay or secure the costs, the justice of the peace and the sheriff or constable may, if they wish, </seg>
            <seg id="p355">OPINIONS waive their costs or look for their costs only to the defendant in case he is convicted. Of course, if the justice of the peace and the officer serving the papers insist upon their costs, and the county attorney will not bind the county for the costs,, and the complainant. cannot pay or secure the costs, the prosecution necessarily comes to an end. There is, however, no doubt in our minds that under existing laws the county attorney may refuse to bind the county for the costs of a misdemeanor case, and may refuse to prosecute the same unless the costs are advanced or secured by the complainant or some one other than the county. If any change in this is thought desirable, legislation is, of course, required to make the change. Sincerely yours, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General, By CLIFFORD L. REIN, Assistant Attorney General. COUNTY SURVEYOR— DUTY TO SUPERINTEND ROAD CONSTRUCTION September 10, 1931. Mr. C. D. Hayden, County Surveyor, ■. '. - Curtis, Nebraska. Dear Sir: . This is in answer to your kind letter of September 5, 1931, in which you inquire: "Is it the duty of a surveyor in counties of less than fifty thousand population to superintend the construction of roads and inspect bridges without an order from the county board?" To this question a negative answer is, in our opinion, required by Section 26-1601, Comp. St., 1929, formerly Sec. 5015, Comp. St., 1922. In counties of less than fifty thousand population the superintendence of the construction of roads and bridges is the function of the county highway commissioner whom the law contemplates shall be annually appointed by the county board and who may be the county surveyor, a member of the county board or any practical road builder whether a resident or a non-resident of the county (Laws 1931, Ch. 79, Effec - tive May 6, 1931; Sec. 39-1302, Comp. St., 1929). The board is thus not obligated to appoint the surveyor as county highway commissioner, </seg>

Mr. E. T. A. Alford, Justice of the Peace, Cairo, Nebraska. Dear Sir: This is in answer to your letter of recent date in which you state and inquire: "Have the county board the right to hire a grading outfit to grade roads in your township then expect the township board, to pay them out of township money derived from taxation? That is, if they hire an outfit to grade in a township do they not have to pay them out of the money set aside by the county board for road construction? . ' . "Have not the township board the right to say when and how the money derived from taxes, paid by the township shall be spent?" In answer to your first question we are of the opinion that, unless the township board has contracted with the county board for the latter to do the work- on the township roads, the county board cannot charge such work to the township or require payment therefor from the revenues derived by township taxation for road purposes. (Lynn v. Kearney County, 236 N. W. 192; Laws, 1931, Ch. 80). We are also of the opinion that in all cases where the county board does town - ship road work without a contract therefor with the township board, the county board must pay the expenses of such work, if it pays them at all, out of the revenues derived by county taxation for road purposes.

County Attorney, Bassett, Nebraska. . Dear Sir: You call attention to the provision of Section 20-1603, Comp. St., 1929, as amended by Chap. 36, Laws of 1931, requiring the jury panel to be selected "as nearly as may be, a proportionate number from each precinct in the county." You request our opinion as to whether such apportionment should be based on the population of the several precincts of the county as shown by the last federal census or on the vote cast in each precinct at the last general election. It is my opinion that the county board is not required to accept either the last federal census or the last general election as the basis upon which to apportion the jurors from, the several precincts, but is at liberty to consider either or both and any other method of computation available which is fair and reasonable in determining how the jurors shall be apportioned. Section 20-1601, Comp. St., 1929, prescribes the qualifications of jurors and limits jury service to all males residing in the county over the age of 25 years, not occupying certain offices or subject to a bodily infirmity amounting to a disability, etc. It is clear that the Legislature intended the apportionment of jurors among the several precincts to be based on the actual number of persons possessing the qualifications of jurors residing in each precinct but it is equally clear that the Legislature did not contemplate that the county board must make an accurate enumeration of all persons possessing the quali - fications of jurors residing in each precinct before apportioning the jury panel. '. . The true rule, I believe, is that laid down in Polin v. State, 14 Neb. 540, as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p358">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "The statute is silent as to the mode of ascertaining who, of all the inhabitants of a county, are qualified to serve in this capacity. No provision is made for the county commis - sioners to enter upon a special inquiry with the view to an exact result. A particular enumeration evidently was not contem - plated by the legislature, or provision would have been made for it. They are left to act upon the means at hand, and so long as those adopted are fair, and result in a reasonable ap - proximation to the ratio named, it is all that could have been in - tended, and all that is required." - It is apparent, as pointed cut by our Supreme Court in Nelson v. State, 118 Neb. 812, 226 N. W. 438, that the number of votes cast at a general election no longer furnishes an accurate criterion by which to determine the number of persons qualified for jury service in a precinct because all persons of either sex above the age' of 21, with certain rare exceptions, are entitled to vote whereas jury service is limited to miles above the .ape of 25 years possessing no physical or other disability. Moreover the number of votes cast at an election does not represent the actual number of qualified voters and its ratio to the true number of voters varies greatly with the interest manifested in the election, the state of the weather on election day, and other causes, which make it a very uncertain standard by which to esti - mate even the true number of voters. The federal census would seem to me to afford a more reasonable and accurate basis for such com - putation but if the county board has other means of computation which seems to it to be more fair and accurate as a basis for determining the apportionment of the jury it is its right and perhr.ps its duty to consider such means in making the apportionment.

The office of county superintendent is not established by the const - itution nor is the term fixed by that instrument. The office and the length of term are both fixed by the legislature, but the compensation to he prid in counties having less than fifteen hundred population is not fixed by the legislature but is left to be fixed by the county board 6"ch year but within limits prescribed by the statute.

Thillips, County Clerk, . . . • Elwood, Nebraska. . • Dear Sir: You say: "The county superintendent of this county hns just died and the question has arisen concerning filling the vacancy." ei You inquire: "Would it be your opinion that this appointment should be for the balance of the four years time for which the super - intendent was elected, or would you have the vacancy filled only until the election next fall, at which time the candidates would have to run for a two year's period." </seg>
            <seg id="p361">OPINIONS •- In answer to the question you ask, I will say that in my opinion when the ap'pacintmenl is made to f.H'the vacancy it will be an appoint - ment until the next general election when a county superintendent will be elected to serve out the remainder of the term. In the case of State v. Schroeder, 79 Neb. 759, it was held that: "One appointed to fill a vacancy in the office of alderman of a city (Linci In) - - - holds only until the next general election - - - to wit, the next regular municipal election." ■ Similarly. in the case of State v. CYleman, 91 Neb. 167, it was held that: "Where a vacancy occurs in the ofTice of county asses - sor more than 30 days prior to a general election, the board of county commissioners is required to fill the vacancy by appointment. In such case the person appointed holds the office until the next gener.al election, at which time his successor should be elected for the remainder ofthe iinexpired term." In the case of Slate v. Coleman, supra, the law provided as it does now and as it also does in the case of a vacancy in the office of county superintendent, that the vacancy shall be filled by the county board. In commenting upon that phase of the case and in holding that the iippointee of the board only held until the next general election, Judge Harnes who wrote the opinion said: "The law relating to county assessors simply provides that in case of a vacancy in that office the county board shall fill such vacancy by appointment. Nothing whatever is said as to how long the appointee shall hold the office, and nothing is contained therein which in any manner conflicts with the . general provisions of the statutes upon that subject. It therefore follows that this case must be ruled by such general provisions." I will add that in my opinion the board may simply fill the vacancy wfthout designating the length of term the appointee shall hold. Thai, I think, is a law question and can not be controlled by them. (See State v. Willott, 103 Neb. 798). If all members of the county board are present when the appointment to fill the vacancy Is made, I do not think it matters whether it is made on the 5th or the 6th of October. Sincerely yours, C. A.

And you inquire: "What is the c-rrect charge to be made by the sheriff in collection of distress warrants where no sale is made and what in your opinion constitutes a levy of a distress warrant?" In answer to your question :I will say that Section 77-1917 provides among other things that the fees in such cases "shall be twenty-five cents for issuing each warrant; fifty cents for levy and not exceeding five cents a mile for each mile actually and necessarily traveled by such officer on each warrant." There is a further provision that: "Commissions shall be allowed in addition on all taxes col - lected on distress and sale." The Supreme Court of this state held in the case of Kane v. U. P. Ry. 5 N. 1U5, that a commission could not be collected where distress and sale of property was not made and in the case of Red Willow County v. Smith, 67 Neb. 213, it wns held that in cases where the re - turn made on the distress is "no property found" no fee can be charged for the return. Of course where no property is found no levy is made. The making of a levy as 1 understand it when used to express what is done under the authority of a search warrant, implies an actual siezure of property such as would make the officer a trespasser if it were not for the protection given him by the warrant. </seg>
            <seg id="p363">.

In such a case the only fee to be charged in my opinion is the treasurer's - fee for issuing the distress warrant, and the mileage, of course, as provided by statute.' Sincerely yours, C. A.

Mr. Otto W iley, Clerk of the district Court, Hartington, Nebraska. Dear Sir: This is in answer to your kind letter of September 28, 1931. You first state and inquire: "I am- clerk, of the district court of this eighth judicial district. In conducting this office attorneys file cases and ad - vance cost money in varied amounts. This money I have placed in a bank until it is needed to pay costs in the case, when it is drawn upon. This bank clcsed its doors and I would like to know just the extent of my liability for. the money." The law provides that for each service rendered a litigant in a case the clerk may exact advance payment of the fee (Sec. 33-124, Comp. St., 1929). Thus, before filing a petition, the clerk niay require pre-payment of the $2.50 fee therefore. The law does not, however, ■authorize the elerk to require litigants to make with him an advance deposit' to cover costs anticipated but not yet accrued (Sec. 28-714, Comp. St., 1929). Where an advance-deposit arrangement, such as you describe, exists, it exists wholly by private agreement between the clerk personally and the litigant or his attorney personally. Such an agreement makes the clerk the simple-contract debtor of the litigant or his attorney as to all of the deposit not appropriated to the clerk's A fees already earned. It is, of course, no defense to a debtor that </seg>
            <seg id="p364">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL he has in any manner lost the wherewithal to pay. We are, therefore, of the opinion that you are liable to litigants or their attorneys for unappropriated advance-cost, deposits kept by you in a bank and lost through the. failure of the bank. We are also of the opinion that 41 litigant who has paid advance costs to the clerk, cannot be required to pay again for the same service, when the amount thus paid in advance was by the clerk deposited in a bank and lost through the bank's failure. We are also of the opinion that a clerk of the district court is liable to the county for fees collected by him arid by him deposited. in a bank and lost through the bank's failure. Your next question is whether jurors are entitled to mileage for travelling both ways. We are of the opinion that jurors are entitled to mileage "at the rate of ten cents for each mile necessarily travelled" in going not only from their residences to the court house but also from the court house back to their residences. This opinion is founded on the plain, direct and unambiguous lan - guage of Section 33-143, Comp. St., 1929, relating to mileage and per diem of jurors. This opinion is, of course, unaffected by the fact that a different statute (Sec. 33-144, Comp. St., 1929) provides different mileage and a different per diem for witnesses. Sincerely yours, C. A.

County Attorney, North Platte, Nebr. Dear Sir: . . • . \* You say: . . "Our Court House in this city stands in an unfinished and incompleted condition. There has been presented to the Board of County Commissioners, petitions signed by more than- 55% </seg>
            <seg id="p365">. . OPINIONS of the legal voters in this county based on the average vote of the two preceeding elections, requesting the County Commis - . sioners to make a levy of .9% of one mill for the first year, one mill the second year and .8% of one mill for the third year to provide the necessary funds to complete, furnish and equip the Court House." This levy docs not exceed the maximum gen - eral levy provided by law nor will it raise a fund in excess of $100,000." You inquire whether the commissioners have a legal right to make such a levy.. In answer to the question that you ask, I will say that in my opinion the county board has authority to make such a levy. 26-108 provides among other things: "That the county board of any county in this 'state is hereby authorized and empowered, when requested so to do by a petition signed by at least fifty-five per cent of the legal voters in said county, based on the average vote of the two preceding general elections, to make an annual levy not ex - ■ ceeding five mills upon the dollar on all taxable property in said county for the purpose of providing a fund for the erection of a court house or jail, s; id iund to be used only in the con - struction of a court house or jail or to pay the expenses of tearing down an existing court house or jail or making improve - ments thereon; provided further, the total estimated amount to be raised by such special levy shall not exceed the sum of one hundred thousand dollars and said levy may be spread over a term of years not exceeding five to produce such sum." The maximum amount of the levy made any one year for such purpose is one mill instead of five mills (See 77-1201). I will add that if the proposed levy taken in connection with other levies exceeded five- mills per annum it would take a vote of the electors of the county to authorize it, but as I understand it the proposed levy for that purpose together with all' other levies made by the county board during any one year will not amount to five mills. , • Sincerely yours, C.

Dear sir: You say: "Last June at the annual school meeting of one of our local country districts, the residents at the meeting voted.to close the school because there were so few children in the disrict attending the school. They also voted to' pay the cost of trans - portation of the pupils who wished to attend the York Public Schools from that district. It appears this fall that there are only four children in the district of school age who desire to go to the York Public Schools. The question arises as to how much the school board may pay for transportation of these children from their homes to the York Public Schools and return?" I assume the district is acting under the authority given by 79-218 which provides among other things: "That in any district where there are less than five children who are seven years of age and less than sixteen years of oge residing in the district, the school board may use the school funds of such district receievd from any source to provide for the board and transportation and other expenses of such children while attending school in another district as may • be arranged by the school board of said district."

"Since the parents made no request for transportation for the past two years and since no report was made By the teacher to the school board (attendance reports), kindly advise me if the parents are eligible to transportation and can they collect transportation for back years?" In answer to the questions asked I will say: 1.

In making this statement I as - sume that the teacher will make monthly reports to the school board as the law requires of the school attendance of the children of this family. 2. I am of the opinion although the matter may not be entirely free from doubt that the family can not recover any transportation allowance for the past two years attendance inasmuch as the attendance reports were not furnished by the teacher as a basis of the allowance as the law requires, but it is possible that a court will hold that it was not the parent's fault that monthly reports were not made and that the family can recover from the district the amount to which it would clearly have been entitled had the reports been made.

You say further the father has been advised by a school officer that if pupils reside more than three miles from the school house, they need not attend school. You inquire whether this is so. In answer to your question I will say that pupils are not excused from attendance at school merely because of the fact that they reside more than three miles from school.

BANKS STOCKHOLDER'S LIABILITY NOT DIMINISHED BY PAYMENT OF STATE ASSESSMENTS October 13, 1931. Shelton Mills, . Shelton, Nebraska. Gentlemen: . , ■ Your letter of October 10th at hand with reference to the assessment of stockholders in failed banks. Section 7 of Article XII of the Stato Constitution reads as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p370">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "Every stockholder in a banl.ing corporation or instit - ution shall be individually responsible and liable to its creditors over and above the amount of stcck by him held to an amount . equal to his respective stock or share sn held, for all its liabilities accuring while he remains such stockhc lder, and all banking cor - porations shall publish quarterly statements under oath of their assets and liabilities." The fact that stockholders voluntarily or by resolution of the board of directors contributed money to the bank on the basis of their shares of stock for the purpose of strengthening the bank prior to i.s closing does not exempt them from liability set out in the constitutional provision above quoted. In other words, stockholders in failed banks must pay their double liability regardless of how many assessments they paid prior to the closing of the bank. This is a harsh rule, but it appears to be the law. Sincerely your, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General TAXATION— SEWER MAINTENANCE— STATUTORY LIMIT October 14, 1931. Mr. Allen Johnson, • ■ . City Attorney, Fremont, Nebraska. Dear sir: This is in answer to your kind letter of October 13, 1931.. You state that for the maitenance and repair of sewers Fremont . has levied a general tax of 1.22 mills of which it intends to apply 4. 10 df a mill to the maintenance and repair of sanitary sewers and the remaining 82/100 of a mill to the maintenance and repair of storm sewers. You also state that to this 1.22 mill, sewer-maintenance levy, the C. &amp; N. W.. R. Co. has objected because the same exceeds the 4. 10 of a mill authorized by Section 16-664 to be levied "for maintenance and repairing of any sewers." You request our opinion as to whether the railroad company's legal position in this matter is well taken. The city, the company and ourselves apparently agree that Section 16-664 is the only express authority for levying a tax on all the tax - able property of 'the city for the specific purpose of defraying the ex- </seg>
            <seg id="p371">OPINIONS pense of Maintaining and repairing sewers, both storm and sanitary. The city, the company and ourselves- also apparently agree that und - er Section 16-664 the city cannot levy on all the taxable property of the city a tax exceeding 4 10 of a mill for sanitary sewer maintenance and repair. Between the city and the company the controverted question at&gt; - pears to be whether the city can levy on all the taxable property of the city a tax exceeding 4 10 of a mitl for both sanitary-sewer maintenance an-d repair. The city contends that it can.' The company contends that it cannot. We are asked to construe Section 16-664 and say which of these contentions is correct. • According to the plain, direct and unambiguous language of said Section 16-664, the city, cannot levy "more than four-tenths (4/10) of one mill on each dollar of actual valuation on all the taxable property subject to 'taxation in such city for the purpose of creating a fund for the maintenance and repairing of any sewers in such city," etc. Such being the law's language, what legal authority have we for saying that the underscored phrase "any sewers" excludes storm sewers and means only sanitary sewers? The established doctrine is that "statutes conferring upon municipal corporations authority to impose ' taxes must be strictly construed. It is presumed that the legislature in granting the power has clearly indicated its intention and doubts Or ambiguities arising from the terms used by the legislature must be resolved against the municipality and in favor of the tax - payer." 44 Corpus juris, 1266, Notes 73. 74, 75, and Nebraska cases cited). This rule obviously prevents us from amending Section 16-664 by construction. As a purely law-interpreting agency, we are definitely barred by said rule of strict construction in favor of taxpayers, from saying that "any sewers", which manifestly includes both storm and sanitary sewers, means sanitary sewers only. In' reaching this con - clusion we do not overlook the fact that in Fremont a sewer-main - tenance levy- of 4 10 of a mill will not raise enough money to maintain and repair both storm and sanitary sewers. But in construing a law we cannot give effect to practical consequence against its plain, direct and unambiguous terms. (36 Cyc. 1111, Notes 67-73). The adjustment of laws to. expediency is the function of the legislature. </seg>
            <seg id="p372">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL We are therefore of the opinion that the city of Fremont cannot levy a tax exceeding four-tenths of a mill on all the taxable .property - of the city specifically "for the maintenance and repairing of any sewers" including both storm and sanitary sewers.

Qvale, Supervisor of Permits, Bureau of Industrial Alcohol, Treasury Department, St. Paul, Minnesota. Dear Sir: Your letter of September 30th at hand. Under the laws of Nebraska chiropractors are not authorized to practice medicine generally but by statute are limited mainly to ad - justments by hand of articulation of the spine. Section 71-1101; Com - piled Statutes for 1929, defines chiropractors as "persons who treat human ailments by the adjustment by hand of any articulation of the spine." In our opinion, therefore, chiropractors are not entitled to obtain and use intoxicating liquor or prescribe prescriptions requiring the use of intoxicating liquor as is permitted to physicians generally by Section 53-122, Compiled Statutes for 1929. Chiropractors, however, along with other .persons, may secure and use for any medical purpose alcohol which in the process of manu - facture is required unfit for use as a beverage, if the provisions of Section 53-124, Compiled Statutes for 1929, are followed. In all cases any person having possession of intoxicating liquor has the burden of proving that the liquor is held under authority of law. Sincerely your, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General </seg>

Dear friend Eisler: Some time ago ycu submitted to me evidence that contractors hav - ing contracts with the state for highway work were working their men on Sundays and sometimes "from twelve to fifteen hours per day. You ask what if anything could be done about the matter. You stated that not only did such long houis work a hardship on the men employed, but cut down materially the number of men that could be employed. Under the laws of Nebraska highway construction contracts need not be let to the lowest bidder, but may be let to the best bidder. In our opinion the Department of Public Works is not barred by law from specifying and enforcing specific standards of workmanship. It, cannot be seriously denied that over-worked laborers are not as apt to do as good work as men who work reasonable hours. In this matter the Department of Public \vorks may use wide discretion. In State vs. Board of Commissioners, 105 Neb. 170, 181 N. W. 530, the Nebraska Supreme Court held that the Board cf Control acted judi - cially and exercised a discretionary power in determining the respon - sibility of a bidder. The court held that the Board in making its de - cision was not limited to determining the mere financial responsibility but could consider the general ability and capacity of the bidder to perform the work, and his facilities for the task. Minnesota through its Department of Public Works has limited the number of hours which contractors having state contracts may let their men work. In Wiscon - sin the State Highway Commission passed a resolution requesting that contractors refrain from letting' any of their 1: men work more than sixty hours per week and that the bidders agree to pay a minimum wage of not less than forty cents per hour. The Wisconsin State Highway Commission also requested the contractors, not to allow work on Sundays unless in the opinion of the state highway engineer it was necessary on account of some emergency or because of weather con - ditions. i ■ The resolution of the Wisconsin State Highway Commission on this matter reads as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p374">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "BE IT RESOLVED, By the Wisconsin State Highway Commission "1. It is the judgment of the Commission in the performance of Federal, State, or State Aid contracts, that contractors do not work sep-. arate crews, laborers, workmen, or mechanics, more than sixty (60) hours a week. Contractors are hereby requested to observe this maximum providing that in cases of emergency involving loss of' life or property, or property damage, or on account of weather conditions the state Highway Engineer may approve working longer hours as may seem advisable. "2. Unless in the judgment of the State Highway Engineer it is necessary to work on Sundays on account of an emergency or weather conditions, it is the opinion of the Commission, and they request, that contractors refrain from Sunday operations. "3. Contractors are to employ Wisconsin resident Common Labor and such other Wisconsin resident workmen residing in the vicinity of the work as may be available. "4. In preparing their bids contractors are requested to base their labor estimates on a fair and reasonable wage for the community in which the project is located and the contractor, before an award is made shall agree with the commission to pay not less than such wage. "Failure to observe these regulations will remove such contractor from the approved qualified list of contractors." The Governor of Nebraska as head of the Department of Public Works could of course make the same requests of contractors working in Nebraska. In our opinion no court would interfere with any such agree - ment. If such action were taken, the law against common labor on Sunday would no longer be violated, men would not be over-worked, and a substantial number of men now unemployed would be given work Sincerely yours, C. A. SORENSEN. Attorney General ROAD MAINTENANCE— NO CONTRACT REQUIRED WHEN October 15, 1931. Mr. G. H. Chittenden, Spencer, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Chittenden: You say: "I would appreciate your opinion as to whether or not </seg>
            <seg id="p375">OPINIONS a contract is required for (travel work on jobs under $500.00 in which local help is used." In answer to the question you ask, I will say that in my opinion n county, board is not required to let a contract for graveling a public road or roads of- the county where the total cost of such work is less than $500.00. I arrive at this conclusion from the reading of 39-801 both in its original form and as amended by Chapter 84, Session Laws of 1931. This section of the statute provides among other things that: "The county board of each county has the power to repair or erect all biHpes and the approaches thereto and build all culverts and make improvements on roads the cost and expense of which shall in no instance exceed-five hundred dollars. All contracts for the erection or reparation on bridges and ap - proaches thereto for the building of culverts and improvements ■ on roads and for furnishing materials in connection with the same, the cost and- expense of which shall exceed five hundred dollars-, shall be let by the county board to the lowest and best , bidder." ■ ■'. ' ■ ■ ■ . ■ ' '. I take it thefact thrt where the expense of the improvement will exceed five hundred dollars the statute says the contract shall be let to the lowest and best bidder, but says nothing about what shall be done when the total cost of the improvement will be less than five hund - red dollars, indicates 'that the board can let a contract for such work or can have it done without a contract just as it sees fit. I assume you are speaking of graveling to be paid for out of funds raised by taxation of property in the county generally. If you have reference to graveling done by way of a special im - provement in a special road improvement district established in con - formity with the provisions of 39-401 and following sections and paid for by special assessments on the lands benefited, I am of the opinion the work should be done by contract and that the contract should be let to the lowest responsible bidder as provided by 39-409.

Heinke, County Attorney, Nebraska City, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You say: "On August 6th, 1931, the city of Nebraska City certified to the county clerk its levy for the year 1931. The county clerk thereafter computed all taxes and extended the same on the tax rolls, and on September 19th, 1931 certified .the tax books to. the county treasurer and attached his warrant for the collection thereof. On September 28th, 1931, the city clerk certified to the county clerk an additional levy, which the dis - trict court of Otoe County, Nebraska, by the preemptory writ of mandamus has ordered the city commissioners to levy. The county clerk on an opinion from me refused to enter these taxes upon the tax books. No county officer was a party to the proceeding's for the writ of mandamus. It is now demanded that the county treasurer cause this additional levy to be en - tered upon the tax books under authority of 1931 Sessions Laws, page 380. , "It is my contention that neither the county clerk or trea - surer can enter this on the tax list. It is my contention fur - ther that the Laws of 1931, page 380, have application only to appeals from the county board of equalization. "I should like to have you. give me an opinion on this matter as quickly as possible." I assume from the above statement that the city commissioners should have made the levy which they were mandamused to make, before the county clerk certified the tax list to . the county treasurer and that probably they should have done so on August 6, 1931, at the time the city levy was certified to the clerk. If they had done so at that time or at any time prior to the time the tax list was delivered to the county treasurer the taxes in question would have been placed on the tax list for 77-1801 provides among other things that: </seg>
            <seg id="p377">OPINIONS "On the last day of sitting as a board of equalization, the county board shall levy the necessary taxes for the current year, including all county, township, city, school district, pre - cinct, village, road district and other . taxes required by law to be certified to the county clerk and levied by the county board: Provided, any such taxes regularly voted and certified to the county clerk, after the county board shall have made such levy and before the county clerk shall have completed the tax list, shall be levied by the county clerk, if within the limit of the law, and extended upon the tax list the same as if levied by the county board." This was not done, however, and the question now is has the clerk power at this time to place said taxes on the tax list. I am inclined to believe that he has. The county clerk could have waited until November 1, 1931, to deliver the tax list to the county treasurer. This he did not do, and there is no law which says he shall change the tax list after same has- been delivered to the county treasurer. There is no law, however, which says he shall not make such a change under the circumstances disclosed in this case, and 77-1006 expressly provides that » "The county clerk with the approval of the county board may correct the tax list before the tax is paid in the case of erroneous assessments." It thus appears that the correction of the tax list by the county clerk after it has been delivered to the county treasurer is not forbidden although there is no express provision for it in the instant case. Every - thing considered, I am of the opinion, therefore, that the county clerk may place the additional levy on the tax list for this year if he sees fit to do so. Sincerely yours, C. A.

            <seg id="p378">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL BARKER SHOPS— REGULATIONS OF, CLOSING HOURS. October 19, 193J Mr. George Leclr.ir, II listings, Nebraska. , Dear sir: This is in answer to your letter of recent dale. You request opinion as to whether the city council can pass and enforce an ordinance requir - ing barber shops, including non-union, cut-price shops, to close at 6:30 1'. M. The council would not, of course, have authority to pass and enforce ordinances inconsistent with the state b_arber law and the state barber board's rules pursuant to the law . (Sec. 16-2-17, Conip. St., 1929). But the stale barber law and the state barber board's authorized rules relate unly to the licensure, practice and sanitation of barbering .and do not concern the hours (;f opening or closing barber shops (Sees. 71-2001 to 71-2027, Conip. St., 1929); We therefore conclude that an ordinance rcquiiing barber shops to close at a certain hour, is not void or unenfor - ceable because in conflict with the state barber law and rules. We also note that to the city council the law gives specific power by ordinance to regulate any business carried on in the city (Sec. 1(5-206, Conip. St., 1929). This specific power is amplified by a grant to the council of general police power to pass and enforce any ordinance in furtherance of the peace, good government and welfare of the city (Sec. 16-247, Comp. St., 1929). The Supreme Court of Nebraska has never decided whether a barber shop closing ordinance is valid as tending to promote the peace, good government arid welfare of the city. Hence we do not regard the question as altogether free from doubt, especially in veiw of the Supreme Court of Florida's decision that such an ordinance is not within the scope of the city's police power (Ex Parte Harrell, 76 Fla. 4, 79 S. 166). But because public welfare may be prom - oted by any reduction or limitation of excessive working hours, we are inclined to agree with the new Jersey courts which have held that the city councils may by ordinance prescribe opening and closing hours for barber shops. (See Falco v. Atlantic City, 99 N. J. L. 19, 120 A. 610). It is assumed, of course, that. the ordinance is, and will be, enforced equally and impartially against all barber shops. Sincerely yours, C.

Mr. Ernest Grauer, Secretary, Bonrd of Education, District No. 13, Campbell, Nebraska. Dear sir: You iiu,uire whether school district funds have any preference over other deposits in failed state banks. You also suggest that the law should require banks to give security for school money. In answer to your letter, I will say that Chapter 141, Session Laws of 1931, provides that a school district treasurer may deposit school money in a bank which has been approved as such depository by the school board of the district, but it does not provide that the bank shall Rive security for a deposit of' school money. If such approval was given, the school district treasurer is not liable on his bond for money so deposited, and in my. opinion, the district has no preference over other depositors. If the bank was not appproved as a depository, there was no war - rant of law for the deposit of district money in it and the Supreme Court of this state has said in the case of State v. Ridland State Bank 52 Neb. 1, that "It is not within the power of the treasurer of a school district by a general deposit of funds held by virtue of his office to create between such district and his banker the relation of debtor and creditor. "A banker by receiving on deposit from a school district treas - urer funds known to be held by the latter in his official cap - acity becomes thereby a trustee for the beneficial owner with respect to such funds, and the same may, upon his insolvency, be recovered by the owner as a preferred claim against his estate."

Dear sir; Speaking with reference to Section 1 of Chapter 73, Session Laws of 1931 which amends 37-516 you ask: "Does this section apply to a municipal corporation, or in other words, a city of the first class, maintaining a sewer system? "If the above section applies to a municipal corporation, a city of the first class, just what officer of the city could be ar - rested for violation of the statute? The Mayor, Chief of Police, or a member of the council, or who?" In answer to the above question, I will say: - 1. That in my opinion Chapter 73, Session Laws of 1931 forbids dumping the contents of the sewer system of a city of the first class into any of the waters of the state. It is true the word "corporation" does not always include municipal corporations. Whether it does so or not is to be determined by the context. In the instant case the fact that cities of the second class and villages which are municipal corporations are exempted from the provisions of the act in cases where prior to its passage they had been discharging their sewage into some stream, leads to the conclusion in my opinion that the legislature meant the inhibitions in the act to apply to municipal corporations except in cases where they are expressly exempted from its provisions. Whether the exemption of cities of the second class and villages from the prohibition contained in the act without granting a like exemption to metropolitan cities and cities of the first class, is so disci iminatory as to render the act invalid may be a question (See Gal - loway v. Wolfe, 117 Neb. 824). If Chapter 73, Session Laws of 1931, should be held invalid, 37-516 would remain in full force and this sec - tion exempts from its provisions any municipal corporation "who shall have been using any waters of this state for the purpose of discharging its refuse and sewage therein prior to the taking effect of this act". 2. In answer to your second question, I will say that in my opinion anyone, even though he may be in the employ of the city, who does any overt act to turn the sewage of the city into any of the waters of the state, may be arrested for a violation of the provisions of the statute under consideration. </seg>
            <seg id="p381">OPINIONS It may be too that any of the officers of the city who incite or insti - gate the' discharge of city sewage into waters of the state can be prose - cuted for the act when done.

State, 104 Neb. 56, it was held: ' - "One who incites or instigates the commission of a felony when he is neither actually nor constructively present is an aider, abettor or procurer within the meaning of section 8579, Rev. St., 1913. Lamb v. State 69 Neb. 212." Section 28-201, Compiled Stautes of Nebraska, 1929, provides that: "Whoever, aids, abets or procures another to commit any offense may be prosecuted and punished' as if he were the prin - cipal offender." It occurs to me that the question as to the right of the city of York to discharge its sewage into waters of the state might properly be deter - mined by an injunction suit to restrain such action upon its part, and perhaps, everything considered, that would be the better way.

Clarke, County Attorney, Gering, Nebraska. Dear sir: We have your letter with reference to our telegram regarding sheriff's fees, and I note your request for a statement of the theory on which I base my opinion that the sheriff is entitled to mileage in investigating complaints in the line of duty. </seg>
            <seg id="p383">OPINIONS My opinion was based on the provisions of Section 33-120, Comp-St., 1929, that "The sheriff shall charge and collect fees as follows, to wit: .... traveling expenses for each mile' actually and necessarily traveled within their several counties fifteen cents," etc., and the provisions of Section 26-1410, Comp. St., 1929, as follows: "It shall be the duty of the sheriff by himself or deputy to preserve the peace in his county, to ferret out crime, to ap - prehend and arrest all criminals, and in so far as it is within his power, to secure evidence of all crimes committed in his county, and present the same to the county attorney and the grand jury; to file informations against all persons' who he knows, or has reason to believe, have violated the laws of the state, and to perform all other duties pertaining to the office of sheriff or enjoined upon him by law." It will be observed that the provision for mileage found in Sec - tion 33-120 does not specify that mileage is to be paid only for the performance of certain specified duties of the sheriff, and the necessary inference wns, as it seemed to me, that the sheriff is entitled to mileage whenever it is necessary for him to travel in the performance of any duty imposed upon him by law. Our. law makes it the duty of the sheriff to preserve the peace in his county, ferret out crime, apprehend and arrest all criminals, secure evidence of all crimes, etc., and it ap - peared to me, therefore, that when the sheriff finds it necessary to travel in order to perform any of these duties he is entitled to his mil - eage. . I confess, however, that I have not found much authority to support this view and the proposition is by no means free from doubt. The well established rule is that a sheriff must- be able to point to some statute for his authority to claim any compensaion or fee for any service he performs. 35 Cyc. 1547,- et seq. In 35 Cyc. 1590-1592, Sec C is enumerated the services for which mileage is ordinarily allowed to sheriffs and constables. This section is as follows: . "A sheriff or constable is usually allowed mileage for necessary travel in executing process, serving notices, making returns to court, executing warrants of arrest, taking prisoners before magistrates to the place where they are to be tried, or to their place of confinement, producing in court as witnesses prisoners confined in the penitentiary, taking insane persons - to the insane asylum or paupers to the poorhouse, serving subpoenas on witnesses, summoning jurors, posting election </seg>
            <seg id="p384">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL notices, and making election returns, Eut the right to mileage is purely statutory, and for services in connection with which ' no mileage is allowed by statute the sheriff is entitled to none. And a sheriff or constable who receives a salary 'in lieu of all costs and fees in ciiminal cases' is not entitled to mileage fees for services in such cases. Mileage charges have been considered as 'fees' within a statute providing that fees earned by the sheriff and uncollected at the end of each year shall belong to the county." It will be noted that the investigation of complaints and ferreting out criminals are not enumerated in the foregoing section as services entitling the sheriff to mileage. In Berryman v. Schalander, 85 Neb. 281, our Supreme Court held: "A county or board of county 'commissioners are clothed not only with the powers expressly conferred upon them by statute, but they also possess such powers as are requisite to enable them to discharge the official duties -devolved upon them by law." "The matter of allowing a sum to the county attorney to cover actual necessary expenses incurred while investigating and prosecuting criminal cases' and defending .cases brought against the county is within the sound discretion of said board, and said board may, in the exercise of such discretion, lawfully allow and reimburse the county attorney for such expenditures." Since investigating this question more carefully I am inclined to modify the opinion expressed in my telegram to the extent that I would now say that the . sheriff is entitled to reimbursement of his nctual expenses in investigating compkints and preserving the peace or ferreting out crime but not to milage. However, the amount rea - sonably necessary to reimburse the sheriff rests in the sound discretion of the county board and if, in. the judgement of the board, the mileage fixed by statute will approximately cover the actual expenses of the sheriff I do not see why the amount of his reimbursement should not be computed on that basis. The board, however, is not bound by the mileage fixed by statute in such cases but . may adopt any method of computing the expenses which seems to it to be fair and reasonable. - Very truly yours, C.

Taylor, State Superintendent, Linculn, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You say a letter received by you from a county superintendent reads in part as follows: " 'We have the case of a parent in our county who is also a qualified school teacher but without a school this year. This parent-teacher (not employed this year) was in my office today to announce that she was taking her children out of school and was going to teach them at home. " 'These children are all of the compulsory school age. Can this parent legally keep her children out of school to teach them, being a qualified teacher herself?' " In answer to the question asked I will say that the law does not provide that a parent (even though a qualified teacher) may fail to send his or her child to school because he or she happens to hold a teacher's certificate. The only exemptions from the necessity of attendance as I now recall it are cases where the children are mentally or physically in - capacitated to do the work of the ' school or where the services of a child who is at least fourteen years of age are necessary for its own support or for the support of those dependent upon it.

            <seg id="p386">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL CONSTABLES -CITY MARSHALS -ARRESTS BY November 18, 1931. Mr. George R. Mann, Attorney-at-Law, 514 Federal Trust Bldg., Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: . This is in answer to your letters of November 16 and November 11, 1931, requesting our opinion as to whether a village or city marshal can lawfully pursue and arrest without a warrant an ordinance violator beyond the corporate limits of his village or city; and, if so, how far beyond the municipal limits the marshal's said pursuing and arresting authority extends. It is generally held, in the absence of any statute conferring the power, that municipal officers such as marshals and policemen, have no official power to apprehend offenders beyond the boundaries of their municipalities. Rodgers v. Schroeder, Mo. A. 287 S.W. 860. Sosseman v. Cruse, 133 N. C. 470, 45 S. E. 757. Martin v. Houck, 141 N. C. 317, 54 S. E. 291. Butolph v. Blust, 41 How. Prac. (N. Y.) 491. Lawson V. Buzines, 3 Har. (Del.) 416 Page v. Staples, 13 R. I. 306 Mouk v. DeForrest, 5 Hill (N. J.) 605 Sullivan v. Wentworth, 137 Mass. 233. Ressler v. Peats, 86 111. 275. •• Krug v. Ward, 77 111. 603. Kindred v. Stitt, 51 111. 401. McCaslin v. McCord, 116 Tenn. 690, 94 S. W. 79. State v. Stobie, 194 Mo. 14, 19 S. W. 191. Of this rule, the reason and application are aptly expressed in Rodgers v. Schroeder, supra, as follows: "Statutes authorizing such officers to make arrests upon view and without process, being in derogation of liberty, are strictly construed. Low. v. Evans, 16 Ind. 486. The power of such officers to arrest without process for -mere quasi-criminal offenses arising from the violation of ordinances, is liable to serious abuses and ought not to be enlarged beyond what is ex - pressly granted or necessarily implied in the statute. It is clear </seg>
            <seg id="p387">OPINIONS '•.[.•":.. .that our statute (Mo.) docs not expressly confer upon the mar - shal, assistant marshal or policeman power to make arrests with - out, process beyond the limits of the city, and we see nothing in the' statute (Mo.) from which such power may be implied." It is also very doubtful whether in Nebraska municipal marshals would be held to have implied ; ulhofity to make extra-territorial, non - process arrests. Our doubts in this respect are founded un the following language in Fry. v. Kaessncr, 48Neb. 133, 138: "Doubtless the officer was justified in making the arrest as he did without a warrant, and detaining Kaessner until it cculd be obtained, but the better and the proper ccurse woi.ld heve been to have filed a complaint and obtained a warrant before making the arrest. Kaessner was a busii.css man and a citizen of the "village, and it was reasonable to suppose that he would not flee to avoid the arrest before a warrant could be issued. There was no necessity for his immediate apprehension. It was not claimed that he was committing a breach of the peace or creating disorder. 'But when the offense committed is a mis - demeanor only, then even an officer should not ordinarily ar - rest without a warrant, unless the offender is found by trie of - ficer himself in the act. The reason is obvious. In cases of misdemeanor there is not that probability that the offender will abscond .... as in cases of felony' (Warren, Ohio Crim - inal Law, 48)." We are, therefore, constrained to agree wth you "that in the ab - sence of a special statute that such officer's territorial jurisdiction in making arrests without a warrant is confined to .the corporate limits of his village, especially in misdemeanor cases, and that his power to make such arrests can only be exercised .within the town limits and, therefore, it would be unlawful for him to pursue and arrest an ordin - ance violator beyond the corporate limits." We cannot, however, agree with you that in the Nebraska statutes there is not "a provision which defines or sets forth the territorial juris - diction of such an officer in making an arrest without a warrant." We .readily observe and easily appreciate that the Nebraska statutes do authorize municipal marsh :i Is and policemen to arrest without warrant anywhere in their counties persons, found violating any ordinance of their villages or cities (Sees. 17-118, 17-213, 29-204, 29-206, 29-401, Comp. St, 1929). Sections 17-118 and 17-123 plainly and expressly confer on marshals and policemen the authority to arrest without a warrant persons found </seg>
            <seg id="p388">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL by them to be committing ordinance infractions. In Section . 29-401 this cuthority of the marshals and policemen is clearly and expressly repented and is clearly and expressly extended to sheriffs, deputy sher - iffs, deputy marshals and watchmen. Sections 17-118, 17-123 and 29-401, do not, however, undertake to define the territorial extent or scope of the marshal's non-process, arresting authority for ordinance and state law violations. Of this authority, the territorial extent- or scope is clearly and expressly denned in Sections 29-206 and 29-204. Section 29-206 says that marshals "as such shrll have all the power's and be charged with all the duties of constables in the making of arrests, serving process and preserving the peace, as prescribed in the last two preceding sections (29-204, 29 : 205) in criminal matters." Section 29-204, in endowing constables with police powers, expressly says that their ap - prehending authority is "within their respective counties." Since the abeve mentioned statutes when construed together, expres - sly provide that municipal marshals may pursue and arrest observed ordinance violators anywhere within their counties, we are constrained to the view that municipal marshals may pursue and arrest observed or - dinance violators anywhere within their counties but no further or elsewhere.

Rice, County Attorney, Neligh, Nebraska. Dear Sir: This is in answer to your kind letter of November 18, 1931 asking two questions requiring the construction of Sections 77-2022 and 77-2028, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929, the same being portions of the revenue law of this state. You first inquire whether the notice of an application for a tax deed is absolutely required to state the name the land is assesed in fur the the present year. Section 77-2023 prescribes the contents of this notice. Among the prescribed contents-is "the description thereof in whose nume </seg>
            <seg id="p389">OPINIONS assessed." This must rrean the person in whose name the land is assessed for the present year; otherwise all persons entitled to the notice might not receive it. This statute hrs been frequently held to be mandntory and to require a strict compliance with all its previsions (Brokaw v. Cottrell, 114 Neb. 858; Henze v. Mitchell, 93 Neb. 278; Howell v. Jordan, 94 Neb. 264). It has rlso teen held that the statements required by statute in a notice of this kind are as jurisdicUonal as the service of the notice itself (Thomsen v. Dickey, 42 Neb. 314). We are therefore of the opinion that the notice of an application for a tax deed is absolutely required to state the name the land is assesed in for the present year. You next inquire whether, when the notice of an application for a tax deed is required to be served and is served by publication, the publication is complete upon the distribution of the. third issue of the paper or requires for completion the full expiration of the third week. Section 77-2023 provides that the "notice shall be inserted three con - secutive weeks." Section 20-2228 provides that "whenever the statutes of Nebraska provide for the publication of notices any number of weeks, .... the term 'week* shall be construed to mean either a period of time known as a calendar week beginning on Sunday and ending with Saturday, or any period of seven consecutive days beginning with the date of the first publication of notice." Section 77-2023 is mandatory and strictly construed (Brokaw v. Cottrell, 114 Neb. 858). We are therefore of the ppinion that publication of the notice in question is not completed with the distribution of the third issue of the paper con - taining the published notice, but that said publication requires for its completion either the full expiration of three calendar weeks during each of which the notice is published at least once, or the full expiration of twenty-one consecutive days from the day of the first publication.

Dear Mr. Klasek: You say that you are havfng the county surveyor's office make a map of Saline County shoeing both the county high (m prov!ded for in Section 39-227, et seq. Ccmpiled Statutes, 1029) and the state and federal highway systems. Certain of the roads that were or - iginally in the counly highway system have since been incorporated in state and federal highway systems. Ycu ask how such roads should be designated on the map— whether as both county and state and federal highways or as simply state and federal highways. It is my opinion that such 1 ighways should be designated as state and federal highways only. ,u /.u 6 Stn * utes do not sav so in so many words, but it seems to me that they clearly indicate an intention on the part of the legislature that when a "county road" as defined in Section 39-227, Comp St 1929 is taken into a state highway system that it thereby ceases to be a part of the county highway sys-.em. You will note that such road must be maintained by the state Department of Public Works (Sec. 39-1404 Comp. St, 1929) and the department is given power to make rules and regulations concerning its use and travel (Sec. 39-416, Comp. St. 1929) These provisions, it seems to me are inconsistent with the control and maintenance of such a road by the county board and clearly indicates that such a road when taken over by the slate is no longer to be regarded as a part of the "county road" system. You also inquire whether, in case 25% of the public roads of the county have been designated as county aid roads, must the roads in the system which have been subsequently taken over by the state be includ - ed in the 25%. : . In my -opinion they should not. As already stated, when such - roads have been taken over as a part of the state highway system they automatical^ cease to be a part of the county road system and are not to be included in computing the 25% referred to in Section 39-229, Comp. St., 1929. . Very truly yours, . C. A, SORENSEN, Attorney General By HOMER L. KYLE, Assistant Attorney General. </seg>

The following day I deposited it in the bank here, they sent it to Lincoln and Lincoln to Republican, Repub - lican sent Lincoln a draft on Hastings. Lincoln sent draft to Hastings and received a draft back on Omaha but before draft • could be cashed the Hastings bank closed its doors. "And again, I received a check on the Orleans bank and the next day deposited it in the bank here but before Orleans draft for the check could be cashed they closed their doors. The bank here is holding me for the payments on the checks but are not returning the checks to me. : "Am I liable for payments and if so how can I get it out of the parties that gave the checks?" . Although your questions do not present matters properly within the scope of the official duties of this oflice we will give you our opinion on the same. . The first case (Republican City Bank) is different from the second (Orleans bank). In the former, if the drawer's account has been charged with the amount of the check, the item, so far as he is con - cerned, is paid. This is under the authority of Sec. 62-1806, Comp. St. Neb., 1929, providing: "Where the item is received by mail by a solvent drawee or payor bank, it shall be. deemed paid when the amount is fin - ally charged to the account of the maker or drawer." The Republican bank sent a draft which was not paid, although it evidently was handled for collection by the Lincoln bank in a lawful manner (Sees. 62-1805, 62-1808, 62-1809). This draft was conditional payment only, that is, was payment only if collected. Your remedy is probably, against the Republican City Bank, which, in turn, has a .claim against the Hastings Bank. </seg>

You request opinion as to whether in the publication of village board pro - ceedings the village clerk must publish in full any. ordinance acted on in said proceedings. Section 17-574, Comp. St., 1929, is the law requiring publication of village board proceedings. As we have hitherto consistently construed this law, full publication of ordinances, resolutions, orders; contracts or other matters acted on at a board meeting, is not required. A gene - ral summary or synoptical statement of the subject of the ordinance is sufficient. This will give public informaion of what was acted on so that interested persons will know that the clerk holds the details' for their examination. This is, in our judgment, all that Section 17-574 was designed or intended by the legislature to accomplish.* You will note, however, that Section 17-519, Comp.

Dear Sir: This is in answer to your kind letter of November 24, 1931. You request opinion as to the right of school districts to a pro rata share of scavenger-sale proceeds which are insufficient to pay in full all taxes due on the land sold. One of the pertinent statutes is Section 77-2121, reading in part as follows: ."If the proceeds are insufficient to pay the costs and the regular state, county and city general taxes, the same shall be prorated among the various funds for which levies have been made by the state, county and city respectively in the propor - tion shown in the petition or fixed by the decree." Under this statute it is clear that, if school taxes are "funds for' which levies have been made by the .... county," the school districts having taxes included in the scavanger-sale proceedings, are entitled to their pro rata share of the proceeds of the scavenger sale. That a school district's taxes are for "funds for which levies have been made by the .... county", is made plain by Sections 77-1801 and 77-1803, requiring all .school district taxes to be certified to the county clerk and levied by the county board. We are, therefore, of the opinion that, when lands are sold at scavenger sale for delinquent school .district and other taxes due thereon,, and the proceeds of the sale are insufficient to pay in full all taxes included in the scavenger sale proceedings, the school district is entitled under Section 77-2121 to its pro rata share of said scavanger - sale proceeds.

Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of inquiry of the 23rd instant, I will say I know of no way by which the banks may be allowed lawfully more than one per cent per annum service charge based on average daily deposits and the payment of even the one percent must be ap - proved by the county board. Inasmuch as a service charge is only authorized to be made to banks in which public funds are deposited and on such deposits a bank is required to pay interest at the rate of at least two per cent per annum, this will leave a bank, in which county funds are deposited paying at least one. per cent net on the amount it has on deposit com - puted on its average daily deposits of such money. The county may lessen of course the amount of its deposits in banks by investing a part of its funds in United States Treasury certificates that mature within twelve months from date of purchase. (Chapter 18, Laws of 1931) The amount the ccunty treasurer will have on deposit could be reduced some if the school district treasurers and township treasurer would withdraw the amount of the school district and township moneys in his hands and deposit it in the various banks of the county in the names of their respective school districts and "townships. This I think they could do under the provisions of Chapter 141, Session Laws of 1931 and the law does not provide that any 'interest must be paid on such deposits or that any service charge can be paid the banks for handling deposits of school district or township money made by school district or township treasurers. Neither do the laws require that a bank must secure such deposits. Such deposits then may be made just as the deposits of natural persons are made except that they -should be in the name of the school district or township. I assume that the banks would not refuse to accept such deposits, if they were not required to secure them, or pay interest on them, but I would not care to recommend that this be done unless the de - posits are secured.

            <seg id="p395">OPINIONS COUNTY SUPERVISORS— POWERS AND DUTIES— COMPENSATION November 27, 1931. Mr. Ray N. Rerucha, County Supervisor, David. City, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In y; ur letter of the 23rd ycu ask a number of questions concern - ing the powers and duties of county supervisors. You first ask: "Can a county supervisor draw full pay from the county for his official services and also for manual labor or team work on the same day of the month?" It is my opirion th-t a' c-unty supervisor who draws full pay for a day's service, in performing the duties of his office is not entitled to any other or additional compensation from the county. He is only emitted to one day's pay f r one day's work. However, if he has rented the use of a team of horses to the county he may be entitled to nd( i ional compensation for the use of the horses. I think, though, that the practice of renting horses or equipment from the county sup - ervisors for the use of the county should not be encouraged. The law forbids any county officer from having any pecuniary interest in any contract with the county (Sec. 26-130, Comp. St., 1929), and such practice comes dan^en utly close to beinjr a violation of this law. You also ask: "Can a county supervisor furnish his own team and man to work in his district besides emergency and draw pay from county road fund?" The supervisor can not draw pay for directing road work under such circumstances, if that is what you. mean. He can not draw one salary for his own personal services and another salary for the services performed by a proxy. However, if his hired man wants to rent a team from him and go out and work on the road on his own account I believe such hired man would have a right to do so and would be legally entitled to pay for a man and team. If, on the other hand, the supervisor himself is contracting with the county to furnish a man and team to work on the roads, and the </seg>
            <seg id="p396">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL pay for such work goes to the. supervisor, then it crmes within the prohibition of Section 26-130, .Compiled Statutes, 1929, above men - tioned, and is illegal. You also ask: "Would it be legal to divide county funds such as bridge, county road, county gas tax, and ccurity auto tax equally a - mongst the number of supervisors?' Section 39-206. Comp. St., 1929, provides that in counties under township organization all moneys collected as a county road levy shall constitute a county road fund to be expended by the county beard for the benefit of all the county roads as may be deemed best and no part of said moneys need be paid to the townships in said counties for expenditures by said township officers. This statute seems to indicate an intention on the part of the legislature that the various funds which you mention are to be distributed in the manner which, according to the judgement of the board of supervisors will result in the greatest benefit to the county roads generally. There certainly would be nothing illegal' in a plan of dividing these funds equally, if. in the judgement of the board, that is the method which will best develop and maintain the public roads of the county, but the law does riot require these funds to be divided equally. The board of supervisors is given a large discretion in this matter. You also ask: "Under what supervision would each individual supervisor be authorized to spend his share of the funds? Would it be legal to divide any of the county funds equally amongst the number of supervisors?" Section 26-265, Compiled Statutes, 1929, provides in part as follows: "Each supervisor shall have special charge of the expen- • diture of money appropriated out of the county treasury by the board for roads, bridges and culverts in his district when the board shall direct as to which one of the supervisors shall supervise the expenditure of the money appropriated as afore - said. Said money so appropriated shall not include any money paid as automobile or motor vehicle registration or license fees and shall not be distributed by said board to the individual members thereof to be by them personally paid out upon their </seg>

It appears, therefore, that each supervisor has the duty of directing the expenditure of the funds allotted to his district, but such expendi - tures must be with the approval and under the general direction and supervision of the whole board. I think it would not be illegal if the funds available for the high - way purposes are divided equally among the supervisor's districts, although, as I have already sUd, the law does not require an equal division.

Westwood, City Attorney, Tecumseh, Nebraska. Dear Sir: This is in answer to your kind letter of November 26, 1931. It appears that certain graveled streets of your city are in need of more gravel for making them all-weather highways. Some people claim that this must be done out of the city general fund. Others claim that it must be done by special assessments against the abutting pro - perty. You request an opinion on the matter. Sections 17-431 arid 17-432 are the pertinent laws. We observe that Section 17-432 expressly authorizes the council to "regravel" these streets by special assessments against abutting property. Hence, we entertain no doubt of the power of the council to regravel these streets by special assessments, if Section 17-432 is complied with as to signers or objectors. </seg>

            <seg id="p400">REPORT OF ATTORNEY QENERAL Subject to what is now a 1.7-mill liir.italion (Sec. 77-1201), Section 17-432 authorizes the council to expend from the general fund money for the "repair" of streets. We fail. to iind any Nebnsl.a statute or court decision defining; the word "repair"' as used in Section 17-431. However, as applied to bridges, cur Supreme Court has said that the word repair meni.s "to restore to a siunu or good state after decay, injury, delapidation or partial destruction" (Platte County v. Butler County, 91 Neb. 132). Assuming, as we must, that these streets were originally gravelled and made all-weather roads, if they are now no longer such by reason of wear and tear, we 6ee no reason why they could not be repaired by putting on them more gravel paid for out of the general fund. This would, in our judgement, be nothing but the restoration contemplated in the word "repair". We, therefore, conclude that - within the limitation imposed by Section 17-431, the council may pay for p ull &gt; n S more gravel on these streets out of the general fund. However, since the Supreme Court has never passed on the precise question, those who think differently from us on this question, are not necessarily concluded by this opinion. It is still open to them to secure a judicial construction of this law. Sincerely yours, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General, By CLIFFORD L.

Dear Sir: i ■'■.'.• ■ ' ■ ' ' You state that you are a member of the Welfare Board of Dakota County and the board has to deal with the case of an aged couple who own a well furnished house and lot in town but have no food or fuel and have applied to the county for aid. You inquire: "Does the county have to feed these people without a lien . against their property, or for that matter do we have to feed them at all as long as they have real estate and other property?" </seg>
            <seg id="p401">OPINIONS Our law provides that every poor person who shall be unable to •earn a livlihood in consequence of any bodily infirmity, idiocy, lunacy or other unavoidable cnuse who has no relatives in the state legally liable for his support shall receive such relief as his case may require out of the county treasury of the county in which he resides. See Sections 68-101 to 68-128 inclusive. Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929. •As to whether or not a person owning property can be classified as a "poor person", I quote the general rule as stated in 48 Corpus Juris 43i), Section 4: . "The general rule is that, so long as a person is possessed of property which can be made available for his support he can - not be considered a 'pauper' in the sense that the word is used in the statutes; but if the property which he may own cannot be made available for l.is immediate wants he is within the meaning of the statutes. And in many cases the rule has been laid down that it is iti t necessary, in order to entitle a person to relief as a pauper, Hint he should be altogether destitute of property, but all- that is necessary to entitle him to such relief is to show that he dues not pessess sufficient property for his maintenance and support." In the case of Otoe County v. Lancaster County, 79 Neb. 517, 111 N. W. .132 our Supreme Court attempted to define a "pauper" but the definition is so vague and indefinite as to give very little help. It is my opinion that the mere fact that this couple own property does not necessarily bar them from receiving aid if the property is such thut it cannot be converted into money with reasonable conven - ience or otherwise made available for the immediate relief of its owners. However, if it can be sold or otherwised disposed of or used for the support of tl.is old ci uple, 1 think the county Is not liable for their supRurt until this property' is exhausted. I know of no way by which the county could take or claim a lien of any kind on this property for funds furnished for the supp^ rl of these people. I assume that there are no children, brothers and sisters, or other relatives in Nebraska who are legally liable for the support of these people. Very truly yours, C. A.

Dear sir: • • ■ • You submit to this department a letter you have received from Mr. F. E. Keyes, Secretary of the Board of Trustees of Consolidated School District No. 30 of Hclt County, Nebraska, with which he in - closes a copy of the contract entered into by the district with those who transport its pupils to and from, school and also a copy of the bond given by the bus drivers, and in which he says among other things, that: "School District No. 30 carries Public Liability insurance to the amount of S5000 for one person or $10,000 for more than one person. \ .. "We have not been able to buy a surety bond for our drivers of a Surety Bond Co. therefore we have had our drivers give a bond as per sample enclosed for $2000." . I have no criticism to offer of the form of the contract made with the drivers, and I do not criticise the bond either because the sureties are natural persons. The law does not in express terms require that the surety should be a surety company. The sureties, however, should be persons financially responsible. The amount of the bond ($2000) is, I think, within the law althongh it might well be higher. I see no necessity for including in the bond itself an excerpt from the statute which provides for it and I suggest that in lieu thereof there be inserted in the bond a provision which makes .the sureties as well as the principal liable for all damages that may be caused by any neg - ligence or carelessness in transporting children to and from school. | I &lt;lo not understand that the district would be liable in any event for injuries that may be suffered by the children while they are being transported to and from school and, therefore, I am of the opinion the district does not need liability insurance to protect it against possible claims for injuries suffered by them.

Denney, County Attorney, Fairbury, Nebraska. Dear Sir: This is in answer to your kind letter of December 7, 1931, in which yru state and inquire: "I have been asked by the county commissioners to get your opinion on a matter pertaii.ing to funds that come in from the gasoline tax. Section 6U-411 of the statute provides 'That the moneys so transferee! to tl.e county treasurer shall be credited to the county road fund'. "We have in this c u.ty sever; 1 road districts that have registered warrants and are overdrawn. An auditor who was checking up the county treasurer a few days ago told him that tl is money that comes into the county road fund could be used to take up registered warrants in these districts that have not enough money to pay their warrants. I wish you would write me and give me your opinion that I could show to the county commissioners as to whether or not this money coming into the county road fund can be used to take up the warrants in the districts that are overdrawn." As correctly stated in ycur letter, the county's gasoline-tax allot - ment goes into the county road fund (Sec. 66-411). The county road fund, properly so-called, is defined by Section 39-206 as one-half of all moneys collected as road tax. This fund must be equally divided between the three commissioner districts of the county (Sec. 39-206). Each commissioner district's third of this fund may be expended in the discretion of the county board for the general benefit of the roads of said district. Thus there is no doubt that the county board can retire road district warrants from the one-third of the county road fund, including the gascline-tax allotment, appropriated to the com - missioner district in which said overdrawn road district is located. The district road fund is defined by Section 39-206 as the proceeds of road taxes collected in the road district. .The district road fund of </seg>

Mr. William Moody, Sheriff, • Chadron, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Moody: This is in answer to your Kind letter of December 4, 1931, in which you state and inquire: "I am wondering what ycur opinion is on the law as it is in " section 53-135 of the compiled statutes of Nebraska, for 1029, the material part of which reads as follows: 'It shall be the duty of the county board of each county to pay all bills incurred or approved by the county attorney ■ in said county for the detection and punishment of all vio - lations of this act, and for all inquiries and proceeding of every nature for the purpose of disclosing evidence, making raids, searches and siezures under this act.* "Would the county board in your opinion, be authorized, by virtue of the above section of the Compiled Statutes of Ne - braska for 1929 or by virtue of any other law in force in this state to pay the bills and expenses of making inquiries and for necessary under-cover "men, etc., even though the county ■ attorney refused to approve such necessary expenses to detect liquor law violations?" Since Section 53-135 from which you quote provides in" substance that the bills in question require for their payment the approval of the county attorney, we are, of course, constrained to advise that said statute furnishes no authority for the payment of said bills without the county attorney's approval. . . </seg>
            <seg id="p405">OPINIONS However, when other statutes are looked to, we find that the county attorney is not required either to direct or to approve the work and expenses of detection in criminal cases including liquor cases, in order to legally justify tl.e ccunty beard iji paying what it thinks it ought to for such work. By Section 26-1410 the initiative in criminal detective work through - out the county belongs to the county sheriff and his deputies. The incidence of such work by the county sheriff and his deputies does not require the direction, propulsion, inspiration or prompting of the ccunty attorney or any other officer. By Section 33-122 the county board can provide the sheriff with such deputies and at such compensation as the board decides upon. By Section 33-120, there is for the expenses of the sheriff's staff a mileage provision which is no less available for their detective work than for any of their ether work. By Section 33-120, the mileage is for actual and necessary travel. By Section 26-119 the county board, without the interposition of the county attorney is the court of original jurisdiction in the allowance against the county of all claims, including the claims of the sheriff and his deputies for mileage. Thus, without any action by the county attorney, the county board is the judge of actuality and necessity in travel for which mileage is claimed and authorized in lieu of expenses. By Seclion 53-151, the cost of liquor purchased for use us evidence is taxable to the defendant in ull cases, whether approved by the c&lt; unty attorney as a claim against the county cr not. Thus, without relying on any duty or responsibility of the ccunty attorney in the premises the county board has a complete statutory itinerary for paying what it chooses to have criminal detective work done in the county by the county sheriff's effice. We are, therefore, of the opinion that Section 53-135 is cumulative to and not exclusive of, other means of defraying the expenses of detec - tion in liquor cases. '.;■.:.

Cushing, ; Deputy State Superintendent, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You say that you have received a letter which reads in part as follows: "A number of the local school district treasurers in this ter - ritory were depositors in a local bank which closed several months ago in this county. Said bank since closing, reorganized under a waiver system, and the state department required the new reorganized bank to. put up a reserve or pool fund which was to meet the demands of those not signing the waivers. "The new board of directors has chosen to deny those not signing the waiver, the privilege of drawing this money, in - cluding the funds belonging to the school districts where no waiver was signed. This causes in some Instances hardships on the treasurer due to the inability to meet the payment of the teachers." The writer of the letter inquires whether the school directors who had school money deposited in the bank and who did not sign the waivers will be forced to bring law suits to draw the school money from the reserve or pool fund which was to meet the demands of those who did not sign the" waiver. No reason occurs to me at this time why it should be necessary to bring a law suit to draw from this fund, but, of course, if the bank having oharge of the fund will not pay it with - out suit, it will be necessary to bring suit.

Sir: ■ This is in answer to ycur letter of December 18, 1931, in which y u request us to answer the following question: "May the city council of Clay Center jcin with other depositors of a locr.l bank now insolvent, whereby trustees for liquidation purposes are to purchase the assets cf the b; nk at receiver's sale, the amount of the bid to be credited upon the claims of the depositors joining in the agreement such depositors only to share in the liquidation of the assets so purchased, and payment in cash to be. made to depositors not joining in the agreement in an amount representing the dividend or pro rata shares they would have respectively received had the sale been entirely for cash? It appears from ycur statement of facts that the city treasurer had deposited city funds in the bank after approval of such banks by the mayor and city council as a depository, but that no bond or other security was required from or furnished, by the depository bank to secure such deposits. It also appeals clear that the express provisons and requirements of Section 17-515, Comp. St., as amended by C. S. Supp. 1931 (See Ch. 33, Laws of 1931), were violated by both the treasurer and the bank in connection with the deposits of the city funds in question. The holding of cur Supreme Court in State v. Midland State Bank, 52 Neb. 1, 71 N. W. 1011, which decision still appears to be the law in this state, was to the effect that a treasurer or custodian of public funds, unless expressly authorized by- statute, is without power "by a general deposit of funds held by virtue of his office" to create between his principal and the depository bank "the relation of debtor and creditor"; and that the bank which receives such funds on deposit knowing their character as public moneys "becomes thereby a trustee for the bene - ficial owner with respect to such funds, and the same may, upon (the bank's) insolvency, be recovered by the owner as a preferred claim against" the bank's estate. </seg>
            <seg id="p408">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Moreover, there would appear to be* strong grounds for the ap - plication in this case of the rule recently announced in State v.

Dr. J. W. Benme, Clear water, Nebraska. Dear Sir: This is in anwswer to your letter of December 21 in which you in - quire: • "In case of a stockholder in cne of the reorganized banks having a deposit of $500.00 in the bank, and the bank being </seg>
            <seg id="p410">RE1 : ORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL forced to close, would' this deposit be applied on his double liability, which I understand becomes due Immediately?" The department of trade and commerce ndvises us that the set off referred to is not being allowed in bank receiverships. There is some confusion in the law in this regard. In the case of State v. Farmer's State tank, 113 Neb 497, a suit by a stockholder depositor for the amount of his deposit it was held that collection of this deposit wculd be enjoined or deferred until the amount of his stockholder's liability cculd be determined, to the end that the deposit might be set olF against such liability. In the case of State ex rel Davis v. Banking House of A. Castetter, 110 .Neb. 610, the above case was cited and approved. However, it hns beer; distinctly held by our Supreme Court in the case of State ex rel Spillman v. Citizens State Bank, 118 Neb. 337, 227 N. VV. 868. that the double lial ility of stockholders of a bank is not an asset of the bank but is foj the security of the bank's creditors, under Ihe provisions of Art. XII, Section 7 of the Nebraska Constitution, as amended in 1931, which provides: "Every stockholder in a banking corporation of institution shall be individually responsible and liable to" its creditors over and above the amount of stock by him held to an amount equal . to his respective stock or shares so held, for all its liabilities acciui.ig or existing while he remains such stockholder, and all banking corpoiations shall publish quarterly statements un - der oath of their assets and liabilities. The stockholder shall become individually responsible for .the liability hereby im - posed, immediately after any such banking corporation, or bank - ing institution shall be adjudged insolvent, and the receiver of said corporation or institution shall have full right and lawful authority, as such receiver, forthwith to proceed by action in court to celled such liabilities; and the provisions of section 4 Article :XII, of the Constitution of the State of Neb - raska shall not be construed as applying. to banking corpora - tions or banking institutions." Giving full effect to this holding would seem to require that the set off in question would not be allowable since the right to set off is confined to purely mutual accounts. That is to say, the cross debts must be mutual as between the parties, each owing the other. This would be the case where a depositor owes, the bank on his' note and the bank owes the depositor on his deposit. Under the above holding, the stockholder does not owe the bank as such but owes the creditors of the bank, while the bank as such owes the stockholder on his </seg>
            <seg id="p411">OPINIONS deposit. This would seem to break the mutuality required in cases of set off. In view of the conflict in the above decisions and the practical interpretation and application, rf the .law made by the department through the receiver we are inclined to say that we would not hold that this' set off is allowable until the Supreme Court clearly and def - initely passes on the pcint. Reorganization of the bank, in the absence of specific contracts to the contrary, would not change the rules above announced, since the reorganized bank is a continuation of the old bank. This assumes, of course, that the stockholder involved continued to be a stockholder of the reorganized bank. Ycurs very truly,, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General, By L. R.

Dear Sir: You inquire: "In the event of the death of a county attorney, where there is only one remaining resident attorney, after such death, is it legal and proper for the county board to appoint an at - torney who is. not a resident of the county to fill the vacancy?" I do not find in the statutes any express answer to the question you ask. 32-1701 does provide, however, that every civil office shall be vacant when the incumbent ceases to be a resident of the state, district, county,' township, precinct or ward in which the duties' of his office are to be exercised or for which he may have been elected. I infer from this that strictly speaking, one is not eligible to hold the, office of county attorney unless he is a resident of the county. </seg>

However, a county, board may employ such additional council as they may deem necessary so to do upon petition of ten free holders of the county who are not members of their body in civil matters.

Dear Sir: Speaking with reference to deposits of county money in banks where such deposits are secured by a deposit of securities furnished in lieu of a depository bond you say: "I have, upon the advice of our County Attorney, made with - drawals from our depositories, leaving them an amount equal to 80% of the present market value of the bonds in : escrow and in some cases where Lincoln and Fremont Joint Stock and Land Bank Bonds were placed their deposits have been reduced approximately 50% from the original maximum deposit allowed. "The banks contend that the word 'value', used in connection with these securities, should be construed to mean par value, the value at which these bonds were approved by the County' Board; that upon the failure of the bank the county should hold the securities until their value was sufficient to offset the amount of deposits in that bank; that it is not the duty of the County Treasurer to inquire into the values of these securities and adjust deposits accordingly, and that after these securities </seg>
            <seg id="p413">OPINION? are once approved and accepted by the County Board, said Board is then responsible for any loss suffered by reason of keeping the deposit within 80% of the par value of the securi - ties." and you ask for an opinion from this office upon the question involved. Complying with your request for an opinion, I will say that in my opinion you are justified in pursuing the course you' have taken. I think, it is true that the Legislature when it passed the act providing that securities could be put up in lieu of a -depository bond, had in mind the par value of the securities deposited but at that time it was doubtless supposed that securities of the kind authorized by law to be accepted as security for a deposit of county money would not fall much below par in value. It now turns out that this was a mistaken idea and that in the case of one class of such securities at least the sale value at the present time is at least 40 per cent below par. Bearing in mind that the primary purpose of the deposit of secur - ities in such a case is to protect the deposit of county funds in a bank, it occurs to me that you as the legal custodian of the funds of the county, are acting clearly within your rights when you refuse to deposit county money in a bank or to leave county money therein where it is apparent that' the security furnished by the bank is in - sufficient to protect the deposit. I will say further that I do not agree with the contention that in case of a bank failure the county should hold the securities until their value is sufficient to offset the amount of the deposits in the bank. That time might never come. I take it that such a deposit of securities is in the nature of a pledge and that upon default the securities pledged may be sold in the absence of any express agreement to the contrary. • "It has long been a well settled rule that, upon default by the pledgor in the performance of the principal obligation and in the absence of a special agreement to the contrary, it becomes the right and privilege of the pledgee, in order to satisfy the debt or obligation, to sell the pledged property at - - public auction, without judicial process, upon giving the pled - or reasonable notice of the time and place of sale" 49 C.

LIQUOR LAW VIOLATIONS—CONFISCATION OF CARS -WHAT COSTS AND EXPENSES PAY/BLE FROM PROCEEDS OF SALE OF January 8, 1932. Hon. Clyde Barton, County Attorney, Pawnee City, Nebraska. Dear Sir: This is in answer to your Vind letter of December 31, 1931. You first inquire whether the costs in liquor cases in which an automobile is confiscated may be properly paid out of the proceeds of the sale of the confiscated automobile. In two different places the liquor law (Sec. 53-. 37, Comp. St., 1929) expressly, clearly, directly and unambiguously says that the confiscated automobile shall be sold and the "proceeds paid into the school fund as in the case of fines and forfeitures". From 1 11 other statutes penal in their nature or in dei - ogation of common law, the liquor law differs in that it is to be lib - erdly construed in favor of i.s enforcement and administration as it directs (Sec. 53-153, Comp. St., 1929). The liquor law is, therefore, in our opinion, sui juris; that is to say, in a class by itself. It must be construed without reference to any other laws except to those which it expressly incorporates or to which it expressly refers. In providing for the disposal of the proceeds of the sale of confis - cated automobiles, the liquor law expressly states that they shall be paid into the school fund as in the case of fines and forfeitures This is a clear reference to Article VII, Section 5, Nebrtska Constitution which provides that "all . . . fines . . . shall be appropriated exclusively </seg>
            <seg id="p415">OPINIONS &lt;r&gt; the use and support of the common schods in the respective sub - divisions where the same may accrue." Since the liquor law distributes l he confiscated car-sale proceeds to the scho 1 fund as fines, and since the constitution appropriates all. fines to the school fund exclusively, we see no escape f.-om tie conclusion that the costs of a liquor case wherein an automobile is confiscated may not be paid out of the pro - ceeds of the sale of the car. • There is clear judicial recognition of this view in the neighboring state of ivansas which has a constitutional provision similar to our own Article: VII, Section 5. We quote frcm the Ransas Supreme Court decisions as follows: " 'Proceeds of fines' as used in Const. Art 6, Sec. 6, which provides that the proceeds of fines for any breach of trie penal laws shall be exclusively applied etc., to the support of the common schools, means the moneys collected from the fines, •• the amounts realized from fines, the whole amount and not merely a portion thereof." A. T. &amp; S. F. R. Co. v. State 22 Kan. 1, 15. "The term 'proceeds of fines' as used in Const. Art. 6, Sec. 6, providing that the 'proceeds of fines' for any breach of penal law shall be exclusively applied to the support of common schools or moneys derived from the payment of fines, means the moneys collected from fines, the amounts realized from the fines and just such amounts, no more and no less." State v Stewart, 167 P. 1069, 101 Kan. C&gt;64. It is thus abundantly clear that the reference of our Section 53-137 to our Const. Art VII, Sec. 6, appropriating fines exclusively to the school fund, effectually depiives the word "proceeds" as used in Sec - lion 53-137 of the equivocal meaning which it is sometimes found to possess when used in other laws and instruments importing legal obligation (See Wheeler &amp; Wilson Mfg. Co. v. Winnett, 3 Neb. Unoff. 293). Thus, when the liquor law says in Section 53-137 that confiscated car-sale proceeds shall be paid to the school fund as fines, it means that all of said proceeds shall be paid to the school fund exclusively; and it does not contemplate that any of said proceeds should be used to pay court costs of the liquor case wherein the car was confiscated or for any other purpose except payment to the school fund. You next inquire whether the expense of storing a confiscated automobile pending trial and sale of the automobile, is a proper item of costs where the county maintains no place where the car may be stored. Neither in the liquor law nor in any other statute do we find </seg>
            <seg id="p416">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL language purporting to authorize the taxing of such storage charges as costs. For this reason, and also in part from what has been previously said concerning the indigenous nature of the liquor law, we conclude that the expense of storing confiscated cars pending trial and sale of the cars is not a proper item of costs whether the county maintains storage facilities or not. You last inquire whether the sheriff is entitled to a commission on the sale of confiscated cars. To this question a negative answer is clearly suggested by the fact that no such commission is provided the sheriff in the liquor law, which, as heretofore stated, is to be seg - gregated and isolated in construction from other laws not expressly referred to or incorporated in the liquor law. We are thus precluded from giving effective consideration to Section 33-120, Comp. St., 11)29, which allows the sheriff a commission on "all money received and disbursed by him . . .• on sale of real or personal property." The im - pertinence of this section is also indicated by the fact that under the liquor law (Sec. 53-157) the sheriff receives but does not disburse or otherwise administer confiscated car-sale proceeds. He simply serves as a conduit for such proceeds in their flow to the school fund. We are, therefore, constrained to view that under Section 33-120 the sheriff's right to commission is confined to judicial sales in civil pro - ceedings wherein the sheriff administers sale proceeds for the benefit of the parties thereto; and that the sheriff is not entitled under the liquor law to a commission on the sale .of confiscated automobiles.

REIN Assistant Attorney General GASOLINE TAX AND REGISTRATION FEES— APPORTIONMENT OF AMONG COMMISSIONER DISTRICTS • January 9, 1932. Mr. W. D. Troxel, County Commissioner, . Wauneta, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Troxel:- You request our opinion as to how the gasoline tax and license plate money should be divided among the commissioner districts of your county. You state that your county is divided into three districts. District No. 1 has six townships and a population of 931. District </seg>
            <seg id="p417">OPINIONS No. 2 has six townships and a population of 1247. District No. 3 has eight townships and a population of 1425. District No. 3 has more main farm-to-market roads than the other two districts together. At the present time the funds you mention are divided equally among the three districts. You ask if it would be legal to give District No. 3 a larger share of this fund than the other two districts because of its greater population and area and greater mileage of main roads. The county's share of the gasoline tax must be credited to the County Road Fund (Section 66-411, Compiled Statutes, 1929). The fees from automobile registration are placed in a fund known as the High - way Fund (Secti:n 60-317, Compiled Statutes, 1929). Both statutes above mentioned evidently' refer to the same fund which is the fund designated in Section 39-206, Compiled Statutes, 1929, as the "county road fund." . • . ■ .. Section 39-206, Compiled Statutes, 1929, provides: "One half of all moneys collected as road tax shall constitute a county road fund which shall be divided equally between the several commissioner districts," etc. I believe, therefore that you have been correctly advised by your county attorney.

" You ask for an opinion upon the question. Complying with your request for an opinion, I will say that I think that when the act was passed the Legislature had in mind the par value of the securilies deposited to secure a deposit of county funds, but inasmuch as the statute can be construed to mean actual value, I am of the opinion that the safe course for a county treasurer to pursue is to insist that the par value shall not be less than twenty per cent in excess of the amount of county money he may have on deposit at any time in a bank and that the actual value shall at least equal the amount of such deprsit at all times.

Hubka, County Attorney, Beatrice Nebraska. Dear Mr. Hubka: We have your letter of the 11th requesting our opinion regarding the procedure in connection with town meetings and as to the effect of the amendment in- 1931 pertiining to election of road overseers. Under Section 26-22J, Compiled Statutes, 1929, as amended in 1931, the road overseer of each road district. in the township is elected by qualified voters of his road distiict at the annual town meeting. The statute is silent as to how the names of candidates for road cverscers of the several districts shall be placed on the ballot and, in fact, makes no provision for the printing and preparation of ballots, but simply provides that certain officers shall be elected by ballot. Apparently the legislature contemplated that etch elector would write on his ballot the name of the person for whom he was voting for road overseer of his district and did not require, therefore, that a ballot bearing the names of the candidates should be prepared in advance. </seg>
            <seg id="p419">OPINIONS I believe that the' law requires that the tt wn meeting should open in the morning (Sec. 26-240) presumably between the hours of 9 and 10 (Sec. 26-232). After being optned the meeti.ig must remain open until 6 o'clock in the afternoon unless a majority of the voters present vote to adjourn at an earlier hour, if the business before the meeting shall have been concluded (Sec. 26-240). I think it would be well for the notice of the meeting to state the hour of opening and also the hour of closing in some tuch language as the following: "The meeting will open at the hour of A. IkL, and will close at 6 o'clock P. M. ; unless a majority of the voters present vote to adjourn at an earlier hour, if the business before the meeting shall have been concluded." I do not think that the new law makes any difference in the con - duct of the town meeting except to require that road overseers be elected rather than appointed as was formerly done. The writer has consulted with Mr. Ayres of this department on the questions raised by your letter and our views coincide. Ycurs very truly, . C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General, By HOMER L.

Dear Sir: ■;'••; You ask our opinion as to the authority of a city treasurer to de - posit city funds in a bank in another town, there being no banks in the city. Section 17-515 is quite strict in its provisions as to the deposit of city funds (cities of second class and villages) in local banks ap - proved by the city council. However, Section 77-2601 provides: "In all cases in which public moneys, or other funds be - longing to the state or to any county, school district, city or </seg>
            <seg id="p420">REPOKT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL municipality thereof have been deposited ■ or loaned to any person or peisnns, corporations, bank, co-partnership or other (inn or association of peisons; it shall be lawful for the officer or officers making such deposit or loan, or his or their succes - sors in office, to maintain an action or actions -for the recov - ery of such moneys deposited or loaned, and all contracts for the security or payment of any such moneys or public funds made shall be held to be good and lawful contracts binding on all parties thereto: Provided nothing herein contained shall be construed to in any manner affect the liability of any surety or signers of any official bond hereafter given or mauu in this state.' 1 Even if the treasurer woi Id be liable on his bond if any money were lost if dep, sited in some other town the foregoing section seems to assure collection agsinst such olhe"r bank and against bondsmen. The Supreme Court of Nebraska has just passed upon the effect of scid Section 77-2601 as applied to deposits of monies of a school distiict. This is the cose of Liberty Fiigh School District of Sioux County v. Currie, No. 27U19,' Decided December 81, 1«31. The court held: "It is lawful for a bank to give a depository bond to a a school district to secure, a deposit, of its funds. Sureties on such a bond are bound thereby, notwithstanding there is no statute expressly authoring the deposit of such funds in a bank." . • The court cites Sec. 77-2601, stating that while the section "does not expressly authoiize the deposit of school district funds, it does pro - vide specifically that it shall be lawful for the officers making such deposit to maintain an action for the recovery of moneys deposited, tnd that all contracts for the secuiity or payment of such moneys shall be good and lawful contracts, Linding on all parties thereto."' The court continued: "In Bliss v. Mason, 121 .Neb. 484, 237 N. W. 581, this court held that said section 'authorizes a state bank to contract for indemnity of securities on a depository bond given by such bank to secure deposit of public funds.' Certainly if the bank were authorized by this statute to indemnify themselves on a depository bond, the bank and the sureties would likewise be held liable upon such n bond. </seg>
            <seg id="p421">OPINIONS "Defendants argue that the brnd is not now in force be - cause it had expired on the 1st day of January, 1930. and cite Section 77-2509, Comp, St., 1929, as iUJ porting their contention. I n.s section, however, applies only to slate and county funds and is inapplicable t., depcsils of school district funds. This court is committed to the rule that Secli ,n 77-2601, supra makes valid the contract of a depository bank to indemnify the deposit of such public funds as are specifed in said section. We therefore conclude that the bond is a valid obligation." (Italics ours) Under the authority of the above case we believe that the citv treasurer can protect himself .by taking adequate security from an out of town bank covering deposits therein made. In such a case Section W-ol5 is not applicable although we would suggest that the treasurer's action have the oflicial sanction of the city council. Yours very truly, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General, By L. R. NEW KIRK, Assistant Attorney General. POOR RELIEF— LIABILITY OF CITY FOR • January 20, 1932. Hon. K. E. Dueker, Mayor, Bayard, Nebraska. . .

KEIN Assistant Attorney General ELECTRICITY— VALIDITY OF CONTRACTS FOR PURCHASE OF AT WHOLESALE Bi CITIES OVER TERM OF YEARS January 22, 1932. Burns and McDonnell Er.j i.eerinj; Co., ■Jim Interstate Building, 417 East 13th Street, Ivans.. s City, Missouri. Genllmen: This is in answer to yc.ur letter of January 16, asking our opinion as to whether a Nebraska city can contract for a public utility service wholesale at the city gates for a term of years, without the necessity of renewal at times of change of city administration or at the begining of each new fiscal year or term. Section 16-501, Comp. St., 19£9 pertaining to first class cities (5,000 to 25,000 population) and Section 17-572, pertaining to second class cities and villages, provide that no contract shall be made by the city council or board of trutees "whether the object of the expenditures shall have been ordered" by the ci.y council or board of trustees or not, "unless an appropriation shall have been previously made concerning such expense, except as herein otherwise expressly provided." These sections standing alone seem to limit the contract under consideration to the picliminnry requirements therein set forth. How - ever, other statutes and court decisions must be considered in this con - nection, especially in connection with the method of financing such contract. For example in Carr v. Fenstermacher, 119 Neb. 172, it was held that a contract under which the village of Sargent, Nebraska, purchased a Deisel engine to be paid for only out of electric light fund moneys on hand and the balance from net earnings of the municipal lighting </seg>
            <seg id="p423">OPINIONS riant, was not within, the requiremert of the appropriation statute i.bove mentioned. This decision is based on the ground that the pay - ment not being made or based upon istue of bonds or tax collections as provided by Sections 18-102 and 1E-103, C mp. St., 1929, it could not be said that another method r.pp; rently lawful could not be employed for the pupose. This method of financing such contracts as applied to intercon - nection of municipal plants and systems was authorized by the express previsions of an intiative law edopted in November,1930. (Sections 70-601 to 70-603. C. S. Supp., 1331). Moreover, ii. was held in the case of Village of Oshkosh v. Fairbanks, Morse and Co., 8 F. (2d) 329 (8th C. C. A. 1925) that under Section 18-101, Comp. St., 1929, providing: "Cities of the first class, cities of the second class, and villages shall have the power to purchase, construct, maintain and improve heating lighting systems and ice plants for the use of their respective muncipalilies and the inhabitants thereof" there was granted a power to contract which came within the express exception of the appropriation sections above mentioned. The court applied the well established principle that the methods of financing such contracts by taxes and bond issues (Sec. 18-102 and 18-103) did not restrict the power to contract or affect the validity of the contract, whether the statutes prescribed an adequate method of financing or not. In that case the court held the contract valid although the bond issue and tax levy was insufficient to pay the obligation created by the contract. A similar rule was announced and applied in the case of Slocum v .City of North Platte, 192 Fed. 252 (1?U. 8th C. C. A.), a suit involv - ing the purchase by the city of a system of waterworks under the pro - visions of a franchise contract containing an option in the city to buy the works. The city had exercised the option but had refused to go through with the terms. The court enforced the contract. In the case of Village of Cshkosh v. State of Nebraska, 20 F. (2d) 621 (8th C. C. A.), the court ordered, by writ of mandamus, the village to levy taxes to pay the judgement ■ recovered by Fairbanks, Morse &amp; Co., .on the contract, involved in the earlier Oshkosh case above cited. The principles announced in the first Oshkosh case and the North Platte cases, supra, were followed by the Nebraska Supreme Court in City of North Platte v. North Platte Waterworks Co., 56 Neb. 413, 76 </seg>
            <seg id="p424">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL N. W. 906. That case involved the same franchise contract involved in the Slocum case, supra. The court held that the power to contract for water works contained in another section of the hw pertrining to cities of the class of North Matte was within the exception of the ap - propriation section above mentioned. The court said in this connection: "To hold that the city could not contract for water or hydrant rentals without an antecedent appropriation to defray the sums to fall due wculd effectu- lly prevent the making of contracts in advance for the furnishing of water for any period of years. We are therefore of the opinion that in the case at bar it was not necessary to show an appropriation to have been made as a condition precedent indispensible to a right of re - covery of judgment against the city.' In Chicago Bridge &amp; Ircn Works v. South Sioux City, 108 Neb. 827, 18D N. W. 367, the ccurt cited and followed the principle announced in the North Flatte case last above cited, holding: "... Neither an estimate nor an appropriation was neces- V' sary to the validity of the contract." "The authority of a municipal corporation created under the statutes governing ci ies of the second class and villages, to contract for the construction of waterworks is measured by the statute, and not by the value of the bonds voted for that purpose." While the exception contained in the appropriation sections above mentioned (Sees. 16-501 and 17-572) in the words "except as herein otherwise expressly provided" (italics ours), would seem to be limited to the provisions of other sections of the oiiuinal acts containing such sections, respectively, the Oshkosh case, supra, apparently makes the exception apply to all contracts authorized to the particular class of cities concerned. Applying this principle, we may say that, in our o - pini. n, the type of utility contract you mention if authorized in gen - eral terms, is not invalid bee;. use extending over a term of years and beyond the current fiscal peiiod. ■ ■■'• Since your question is general in its terms and does not refer to any particular kind of utility service we have not attempted to refer to the sections which might be constiued to authorize the particular utility contract you have in mind.

Dear Sir: You request our opinion as to whether the county board of Flatte County may lawfully make a contract with a physician to serve as county physician for one year and furnish such medical services to the poor of the county as may be required for an agreed salary of $1800.00 • • - Section 68-104, Compiled Statutes, 1929, provides: "The county board of each county shall be the overseers of the poor and are vested with the entire and exclusive super - intendence of the poor In such county: Provided, the county board may employ a physician by the year to furnish such med - ical service as may be required by the poor of their county: Provided, also, the salary of such county physicians shall not exceed two hundred dollars in any one year." I am of the opinion that this statute is valid and that under it, any contract by which the county board agrees to pay a greater sal - ary than $200.00 per year would be illegal. If the county physician is called upon to render services for the county other than furnishing medical attention to the poor I believe, under the decision of the Supreme Court in Plumb v. York County, 95 Neb. 655, 146 N. W. 938, that he would be entitled to a reasonable compensation for his services in addition to his salary as county physician. I am also of the opinion that if a poor person should require medical or surgical attention' which the county physician can not give because of lack .of skill or for some other reason, the county board could lawfully employ some other physician to render such service arid allow him a reasonable compensation therefore.

Grose, Scribner, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of inquiry of the 22nd instant, I will say that in my opinion the State Superintendent is within the law when he refuses to allow your school district to share in the state apportion - ment if you lacked one month of having your school taught by a legally qualified teacher for the required time. 76-411 of the Compiled Statutes provides that "No money belonging to the district shall be paid for teaching to any but legally qualified teachers." 79-218 provides that school shall be taught by a legally qualified teacher and that . . . "No district shall receive any portion of the state funds unless school shall have been lawfully taught therein for the time re - quired in this act." and 79-2003 provides that "No district ... which shall have failed to sustain a school . for the length of time required by law shall be entitled to re - ceive any portion of the fund." (state apportionment) I presume that the State Superintendent acted within the law in holding that the Omaha Business College was not an accredited school so far as giving instruction to teachers is concerned. In the instant case a strict application of the law works a hardship inasmuch as you had eight months school taught by a teacher who was unquestionably legally qualified and one month by an experienced teacher whose only lack of qualification apparently was that a part of her work was not done in an accredited school, but I know of no way that this can be helped so long as the State Superintendent adheres to. his ruling. I will add that I presume the State Superintendent conceives it to be for the best interests of the schools of the stale to adhere to the law governing the certification of teachers.

Nunnally, Justice of the Peace, Monroe, Nebraska. Dear Sir: We have your letter of January 26th in which you ask certain ques - tions regarding township matters. Your first inquire: </seg>
            <seg id="p428">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "1. Can the annual township meeting dictate to the board who they shall hire to operate thtir tracts r and grader? Also, can they dictate what the wages shall be?" I am of the opinion that the eljctors at the annual township meeting do not have authority to desiyna e who shell be hiied to operate trau - tois and graders used for building and mrintaining roads, and that they do not have authority to fix the wages for such work. Any ac - tion on these .natters which the nieetiny niigl t take would be merely advisory and not Linding on the township officers. • You also inquire: "Can a man reside in a village and be elected road over - seer in a district, said distiict surrounding the village?" I am of the opii inn that he can not. An incorporated village or city is not included in any road district (Section 39-601, Comp. St., 1929). The law seems to require that a public officer shall be a resident of the district or political u,.it for which he is elected and in which his official duties are to be performed (Sec. 32-1701, Comp. St., 1929). However, if a person elected as overseer, even though he lives cutslde the road cMslric , shun Id actually quelify and serve \wthout objection fiom some rne in thedistrict, I believe that he would be a de facto efficer and entitled to compensation for his services. Ycu also refer to Section 29-1201 Comp. St., 1929, and the pro - visions therein that a township 1 ighway superintendent shall receive S3.00 per day for his services. You ask what would be called a day und also whether he is enti.led to mileage and, if so, what his legal mileage would be. - The word "day" when used as it is in this statute, ordinarily is held by the courts to mean the number of hours of work which com - mon usage and custom regards as a day's work in that occupation (See Words and Phrases, 1st Series, Vol. 2, page 1836). I do not believe that the township highway superintendent is en - titled to mileage as I can find no statute which authorizes him to receive mileage for such work and, under the decisions of our Supreme Court, in the absence of such a statute, mileage cannot be allowed (Maltman v. Adams County, 119 Neb. 826, 231 N. W. 29). You also inquire if the annual meeting can require the board to publish a quarteily statement or do any other thing not required l»v statute. </seg>
            <seg id="p429">OHNIONS I' believe not. The law requires tl.e'tcwn board to meet and audit the accounts of the township clerk three times during the year (Sec. 26-253) and also requires the town clerk to prepare an itemized state - ment of all moneys received and paid out during the year within ten days after the first Tuesday in January (Sec, 26-25 J). I think the town meeting is without power to prescribe other duties on town officers than those prescribed by the statutes, particulai ly when the statutes have already prescribed the duties of the officers' in such matters. You also state and inquire: "A levy of $2075.0 J was made, but inly $75.00 was desig - nated, for a certain fund. How could balance be divided in fairness to road districts including village?*'.

COUNTY TREASURER— HOW VALUE SECURITIES PLEDGED BY BANK TO PROTECT DEPOSIT OF COUNTY FUNDS— i LIABILITY FOR LOSS February 4, 1932. Mr. John E. Turner, County Treasurer, -. -. Plattsmouth, Nebraska. Dear Sir: ..-■-■ : You make inquiry as follows: "In reference to Section 77-2508 of the Compiled Statutes of the State of Nebraska for 1929, would a county treasurer, in determining the amount of a deposit in banks whose secur - ities have been approved by the county board in accordance with this section, be required to consider securities at the pres - ent market value or at the face value? "In the event a bank closed, and the market value of its securities was not sufficient to cover the amount the county treasurer had on deposit, and the county board passes a resolu - tion to hold the securities, would the county treasurer be lia- ■ ble for the deficiency at the time the bank closed?" I will endeavor to answer the above questions in the order in which they are asked. " 1. I am of the opinion that the county treasurer will be justified in insisting that the market value of securities pledged to secure a deposit of county funds shall at least equal at all times the amount of the deposit. </seg>
            <seg id="p431">OPINIONS It may be that the legislature when it provided for the substitu - tion of securities "the total value of which in the case of bonds alone shi.ll at all times equal twenty per cent more than the maximum a - mount of the deposit to which the bank is entitled" had in mind the face value of the securities which' is a fixed amount when the sub - stitution is made rather- than the market value which may vary from day to day. but whether that be tiue or not it is obvious that there will not be adequate piotectinn unless the rctual value of the securities at any time is at least equal to the amount of the deposit they were given to secure. 2. In the event a bank closes and the market value of securities approved by the county board to protect the deposit of county funds is insufficient for that purpose, I am of the opinion that, the county treasurer may in some cases be held financially responsible for any loss the county may suffer because of the insufficiency of the security. If the county treasurer under til circumstances negligently and carelessly failed to protect the ccunty by requiring the bank to put up additional securities when he knew; cr was charged with knowing, that the market value of the secuiities was far less than the deposit of the county, he and his bondsmen in our opinion might be helU liable. If the county treasurer sat idly by for weeks and months while the securities placed i i escrow to protect the county deposits de - preciated in value from, say, 25 per cent to 75 per cent, it could hard - ly be said . that he had exercised ordinary prudence and care in matter. The statute places the responsibility of requiring securities squarely upon the treasurer. If he is under no obligation to act when the securities become of less value than the amount of the deposit, then there is no limit to the losses that the county may sustain. But the burden of proving negligence would in our opinion be upon the county. The county treasurer could not be charged with more than ordinary care and prudence in the matter. : Very truly yours, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General. </seg>

D.ear Sir: You say: "The Gage County poor fund needs financial aid and the Gage County Board of Supervisors desire to know whether it is legal to transfer a portion of the. inheritance tax fund into the Gage County general fund and then transfer the said funds to the Gage County poor fund." I agree with your opinion that the money collected as an inherit - ance tax must be placed in the county road fund "for the sole purpose of the improvement of the county roads," and that the county board has no authority to transfer it to the general fund or any other fund. See Section 77-2218, Comp. St., 1929. . 1 You also inquire if the county board has power to borrow from the inheritance tax fund or from any other fund. I am unable to find any statute which authorizes the board to borrow from the inheritance tax fund for the benefit of any other fund, or, in fact, to borrow from any fund for the benefit of another. I am of the opinion that, in the absence of such statutory authority, it is not permissible. However, Sections 26-123 and 26-716, Comp. St., 1929, authorizes the transfer of surplus funds, which have been raised for a specific purpose that has been met, to the general fund. Section 26.-717 author - izes transfers of funds from the general fund to other county funds ns long as the general fund is not reduced below the sum of $2,000.00. It is possible that your county may have a surplus in some special fund which could be transferred to the general fund .under authority of- these statutes. Very truly yours, C. A.

Dear Sir: This is in answer to your kind letter of February 4, 1932. You re - quest an opinion as to whether a county officer by agreement or acts amounting to an agreement may accept for his official services less than the compensation provided by law. In two cases, the Nebraska Supreme Court has held that he may not. We quote from the syllabi in these cases as follows: "A contract between an orpointive officer of a city whose salary is fixed by statute or ordinance, and a city council, by which such appointive city officer agrees to perform the duties of his office for a sum less than that prescribed by law, is a - gainst public policy and absolutely void." Gallaher v. Lincoln. 63 Neb. 339. "An agreement, expressed or implied, by a public officer to serve for less than the compensation fixed by law is contrary to public policy and void." Abbot v. Hayes County, 78 Neb. 729. There is, of course no law which prohibits persons including pub - lic officers from making, and the county from accepting, donations of money and other property. To this effect the United States Daily for February 5, 1932, at Page 3, in the third column, abstracts from the opinion of Attorney General Bettman of Ohio the following: "A public officer may lawfully, if he sees fit, draw his salary or compensation and donate a portion or all pf it to the poli - tical subdivision from which it was drawn. "Although the general rule is that the acceptance of less compensation than that established by law for the office does not estop an officer from subsequently claiming the legal com - pensation, circumstances may be such that an officer who, vol - untarily with full knowledge of his right to compensation, ml moved by force of an independent consideration, fully accepts, a lesser amount in full satisfaction of his services will be pre - cluded from later claiming more than Ihe anicunt so accepted." </seg>
            <seg id="p434">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL, ! . ' Still more persuasive are the court decisions which uphold the dona - tions in question.

Newell, 146 la. 415, 125 N. W. 324, it is said: "The courts have sustained gifts and trust for public im - provements; to aid in the payment of the public debt; for a public park; for the support of free public schools in a certain district; to pay salaries of additional school teachers; for the erection of a court house; the drainage of land; and for many other similar purposes - ■ "It constitutes no reason tor holding a gift void that . it is made for a purpose for which other and perhaps ample pro - vision has been made by law." Your letter also presents the question of whether such a donation of salary by a county officer running for re-election would constitute a violation of the corrupt-practices law (Sec* 32-2001, Comp. St., 1929). Minnesota has an. election-bribery law similar to our own Section 32-2001. The United States Daily for February 5, 1932, at Page 3 of the third column, abstracts from the recent opinion of Attorney General Benson of Minnesota as follows: "The acceptance of a voluntary reduction in salary by a public officer would constitute a violation of the Minnesota election bribery statute if the reduction was accepted to influence voters at a future election. "An offer to serve for less than the legal salary made by a candidate for office in the course of his campaign is a viola- . </seg>
            <seg id="p435">OPINIONS lion of the Minnesota statute forbidding the offer or payment of money or other things of value to influence votes at an elec - tion. It is also well settled that it is contrary to public policy. "Since the county officers are not making offers in the course of an election campaign to accept reduced salaries for the succeding term, the determination of whether there has been a violation of the statute depends upon whether the reduction is eccepted with the intent of influencing voters at -a subsequent election." Upon the questions you- present, our own legal conclusions coincide generally with those expressed by the Ohio and Minnesota attorneys general. In our opinion, a county officer cannot agree to accept less .than his legal salary. But after he has received his salary, he may, in good faith and without intent to influence voters at a subsequent election, donate his salary, or any part of it, or any of his other pro - perty to the county. Whether such donation on the part of a county officer running for reelection and either openly or tacitly using his don - ation as an argument in behalf of his candidacy, will constitute a vio - lation of the corrupt practices law (Sec, 32-2001, Coup. St., 1929) de - pends upon the mixed question of law and fact as to whether the donation was made for the purpose of influencing voters at the then forthcoming election. This question, in so far as it is a legal question, cannot be answered in advance of regular trial of the issues of fact in any prosecution for violating the corrupt practices law. But your question as. to whether such a donation from an officer running for re-election, involves anything which could cause a contest in case such officer should be re-elected, certainly requires an affirmative answer. The corrupt practices law provides that any person convicted of viola - ting it may be ousted from office (Sec. 32-2013, Comp. St., 1929). Hence, the officer making- such a donation and seeking re-election invites the possibility not only of sinister reflections on his candidacy but also a lawsuit involving his title- to office in case of his re-election.

'.". ~' . ."■ Dear Sir: We are pleased to answer the questions contained in your kind letter of February 11, 1932,. as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p437">OPINIONS 1. Q. "Can the village use money from the general fund for street work?" A. Without a vote of the village electors the village trustees may expend for street work in the. village one.-fifth of eight and three - fourths mills of the peneral fund (Slc Sic. l'-C, Conip. St. 1929). 2. Q. "Can the villace use any money from the general fund to retire .bonds and if so can the bonds be carried as cash until such fund is reimbursed?" A. Laws 1931, Ch. 33, Sec. 1, Page 125 provides that "when the treasurer of any ... village holds funds of- ... such . . . village in excess of the amount required for maintenance or set aside for better - ments and improvement ... the -board rf tiustees may ly resolution direct and authorize said treasurer to invest said surplus fund in the oustanding bonds or registered warrants of said . . . village." We are therefore of the opinion that in the manner and to the extent authorized by the above quoted language of said law, the village may use money from the general fund to retire bonds. But we find no authority for carryin R the bonds as cash until the general fund is reimbursed. 3. Q. "Is it necessary for the village council to require a bond or other collateral for the money deposited in the banks? If the banks would not care to put up bonds could they put up other collateral." A. It is necessary for the village buard to require of depository banks "a bond in such penal sum as may be the maximum amount on deposit at any one time' (See Laws 1931. Ch. 33, Sec. 1, Page 125). The law does not authorize the acceptance from such depositories of other collateral as a substitute for the required bond. Sincerely yours, C. A.

Morgan, County Clerk. Court House, ■ Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: State Tax Commissioner Smith has referred to this department for reply your kind letter of February 18. 1932. You request an opinion as to whether the county treasurer and other taxing authorities may cancel and remove from their books unpaid delinquent taxes, accrued - lien taxes and assessed taxes on lands acquired by tax-exempt owners, public and private. In answering this question, two features of the revenue law seem important. One is that propery does not become exempt from taxa - tion until it becomes the property of the tax-exempt owner (Sec. 77-202, Comp. St., 1929). The other is that real properly is deemed assessed for taxation for each year on April 1 of that year (Sees. 77-1601 to 77-1616, Comp. St., 1929). With these considerations foremost, we find in Nebraska Supreme Court decisions the following pertinent matter: "The court expressly holds that one who owns property, subject to taxation at the time when it is leurnable for assess - ment and taxation cannot escape liability for the .tax by sub - sequently changing the chaiacter of his property by investing it in other property which would render-it not subject to taxa - tion. Suppose defendant, on J.ily 1st, had sold its property which had been assessed, and with the money obtained from the sale had purchased United States Bonds: Could it have escaped the payment of the taxes? Clearly not. . The fact that the assess - ment and the tax subsequently levied thereon had not become - a lien upon the property so as to make a purchaser thereof liable for the tax is entirely immaterial. The city, of course, took the property free from any lien of the tax; but this did not re - lieve the defendent of its liability therefore." Wood v. McCook Waterworks Co., 97 Neb. 415, 149 N. W. 417 </seg>
            <seg id="p439">OPINIONS "In Wood v. McCook Waterworks Co., 97 Neb. 215, 149 N. W. 417, the company was held liable for the tax whether it transferred its property after assessment to one who could be taxed or to one who could not be taxed. There was no dif - ference in that respect, rnd it was held that tranf erring the property to the city itself, which could not be taxed, did not relieve the company from payment, of the tax for that year. It was held to be a question of ownership and not a question of power to lax. When it is a question of ownership it is the ownership of .April 1st that controls." State v. Nickerson, 99 Neb. 517 156 N. W. 1U39 To the same effect are the following quotations of generil law: ."And even when an institution, such as a church or school, enjoys an exemption from taxes on all the property which it may acquire and hold, still it must assume the payment of taxes assessed for the. current fiscal year on any' property which it purchases or acquires otherwise." 37 Cyc. 897, Note 64 . "Whether a particular piece of property is exempt from tax - ation or not depends upon its ownership on the date as of which the taxes are assessed • * • "If after such date but before the tax is paid the property is taken by eminent domain or bought by a body politic or cor - porate the property of which is exempt from taxation the tax as originally assessed is valid and subsisting and the person who owned the property on the date as of which the tax was assessed is legally bound to pay it * • • "But it sometimes happens that the former owner is beyond the jurisdiction of the state, or fiancially unable to respond, and the question then arises in a case of a tax on real estate, whether the lien for the tax can be enforced upon the land while it is in the hands of an owner upon whom no tax could be lawfully assessed. When the property is. acquired by a private corporation which is entitled to an exemption from tax - tion only by the express provisions of the statute, it is well set - tled that the lien will not be released. When, however, real pro - perty acquired by the state or a municipal corporation for ex - clusively public purposes is, whin so ticc.uired, subject to a lien for unpaid taxes, all proceedings taken to enforce such a lien after the property is so acquired for public purposes are void, </seg>

From these authorities the required conclusions would appear to be as' follows: (1). That if lands "have been transferred to a private, tax-exempt owner, the lands themselves are still bound for the prior assessed, ac - crued-lien and delinquent taxes thereon. (2). That if the lands have been transferred to a public, tax-exempt owner such as the state or any public subdivision thereof, the lands themselves are no longer bound for the prior assessed; accrued-lien and delinquent taxes hereon. (3). That if lands have been transferred to a public, tax-exempt owner, and said lands at. tie lime i,f said transfer have prior assessed accrued-lien and delinquent taxes thereon, said lands may again become subject to sale for said taxes if -said lands are later transferred to any private owner. Thus in s meone or- something theie may he a liability for piior assessed, accrued-lien and delinquent taxes on lands thereafter trans - ferred to tax-exempt owners. It therefore seems only reasc.-niiLle that these taxes should always stand on the books both as a guide to these required to collect them and as a public memorial to the lia - bility which they represent. But whether this conclusion is tenable or not, we fail to find any statute which authorizes the county treasurer or any. other taxing authorities to cancel and strike from the tax books prior assessed, accrued-lien and delinquent taxes on lands sub - sequently transferred to tax-exempt owners. We have not, of course, overlooked the provisions for striking from the books delinquent and uncollectable personal taxes (Sec. 77-1926, Comp. St., 1929). Neither have we remained unmindful or unappreciative of the seemingly vain and annoying labor expended by the taxing officials in keeping on their books remote tax liabilities for which there are no longer any present and adequate responsibilities. But we are convinced that this is a practical problem which legislation is still required to solve.

"Who can vote at a schorl election? Is this privilege re - stricted only to those who either have taxable property or children in school? Or can both man and wife, either of whom has taxable property, vote at said election." The law authorizes the formation of municipal parties in air cities and towns. Very few of these municipal parties go under the name of Republican or Democratic. Some of the names frequently used are 'Citizens', 'Conservative', Trogressive', and 'People's'. Thirty-five citizens may form a city party. . . Each party holds a caucus to place in nomination one candidate for each office to be filled. A party should not put up more than one candidate for each office. The candidate receiving the highest vote in the caucus becomes thereby the. candidate of that party for the office. There is of course nothing to prevent the minority faction in a a caucus from bolting and organizing another municipal party to put up another set of candidates. . Each municipal party must hold its caucus at least fifteen days prior to the date of the city election.

COUNTY COMMISSIONERS-RIGHT TO MILEAGE FOR VIEWING ROADS AND BRIDGES March 23,1932. Mr. William F. Spikes, County Attorney, St. Paul, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You request our opinion as to whether county commissioners are entitled to draw mileage for distance traveled in viewing roads for the purpose of establishment or vacation, and for viewing bridges for the purpose of deciding upon necessary bridge repairs. In State ex rel Maltman v. Adams County, 119 Neb. 826, 231 N W 29, our Supreme Court reaffirmed the rule that unless there is a specific statutory provision for mileage none can be allowed. </seg>
            <seg id="p446">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL The only statutes I am able to find authoring the payment of mileage to county commissioners are Sections 81-5530, Comp. St., 1920 authorizing payment of mileage for going to and from lircs to county commissioners in counties not under township orgarizali^n who are re - quired to make a report of (ires to the state fire marshal, and Section 33-128, Comp. St., 1029, as emended by Chapter 65, 1031 Sessions Laws, re - atmg to the compensation generally of county commissioners. The latter section provides: "Members of county boards shall" each be allowed for the time they shall be necessarily employed in the duties of that of - fice the sum of five dollars per day and ten cents per mile to be ■ paid out of the general county fund," etc. The question then is: Does this provision authorize the payment of mileage in the cases you mention? From the language of the statute above quoted I believe that a county commissioner is entitled to mileage where he is required to travel in order to perform the duty imposed en him Ly statute. The sta - tutes impose on the county commissioners the duly of determining wheth - er a road should be opened vacated or altered and also the duty of maintaining bridges and keeping them in lepUr and whenever it becomes necessary, in the performance tf these duties that the com - missioner shall travel I think he is entitled to n.ileage for distance actually and necessarily traveled by him in the performance of such duties. However in counties having a county highway commissioner, as provided in Section 39-1301, Comp St., 1929, as amended by Chapter 79 Laws of 1931, the duty of actually inspecting roads and bridges appears to devolve ordinarily on that officer, and I do not believe that a county commissioner, who is not also the county highway commissioner, can perform the services which the statute puts on the highway com - missioner and receive either salary or mileage for such services. It was held in Maltman v. Adams County, 119 Neb. 826 231 N W 29, that a county commissioner is not entitled to mileage for directing road work. ... Thi ? . hM b ?» n a difficult question to answer and I am not giving this opinion with any positive assurance that it would be the view adopted by our supreme court but it is the view that I should prefer to support before that tribunal. . prcier Very truly yours, C.

Cronin, County Attorney, ' • O'Neill, Nebr. Dear Sir; You inquire: "1. Is a member of a Board of Supervisors in a County under Township organization entitled to a per diem of Five Dollars per day for inspecting bridges or for time spent in connection with the repair or investigation of the stability of bridges? "2. Is a member of a Board of Supervisors in a County under Township organization entitled to mileage for miles traveled to inspect bridges or supervise the repair thereof?" In answer to the questions you ask I will say: 1. I am of the opinion that a member of the .Board of Supervisors in a county such as Holt is entitled to a per diem of five dollers per day for the time necessarily spent in inspecting bridges over streams or in connection with repair of such bridges. "In counties under township organization the expense of build - ing, maintaining and repairing bridges en public reads over streams shall be borne exclusively by the county within which such bridges are located." (39-121,6, C. S. 1929) 2. I am of the opinion that a member of the Board of Supervisors of your county is entitled to mileage for the distance actually and necessarily traveled in inspecting bridges over -streams. Investigating bridges over streams is not strictly speaking directing road work in his district. The correct answer to the question you ask is not entirely free from doubt insofar as it relates to mileage for distance travelled in sud - ervising the repair of bridges over streams, for bridges strictly speaking are a part' of the highway, but I am of the opinion, however, that even in that case a member of the - Board of Supervisors is entitled to mileage for the distance actually and necessarily travelled in super - vising the- construction of bridges over streams inasmuch as the cost </seg>

Nickerson, County Attorney, Papillion, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You ask our opinion on the fc Hawing questions: "a. Do the county commissioners in a county of less than fifty thousand population, wiih t .ut placing the county surveyor on a salary, have the right to determine the amount that shall be pai d annually for the county surveyor's services and expense? . • • ■ ■• "b. Does Section 26-1601, in connection with a county with less than fifty thousand population, mean that the county sur - veyor shall do the work therein mentioned regardless of the desires of the county board, or only upon request of. the county board? "c. Does your answer to Question 'b' also apply to the county surveyor's duties specified by Sections 26-1611, 39-144 and 77-2218?" In answer to your question "a", I will say that I am of the opinion that if the county commissioners do not see fit to place the county !f, V ,n y °n 0 ° a Salary baSi8&gt; aS they may do under authority of Section 33-119, Comp. St., 1929, as smended by Chapter 65, Laws 1931 then the county surveyor is entitled to receive the fees as fixed by said statute. The commissioners must either put the county surveyor on an annual salary, not to exceed $1800.00, or else allow him his" statutory fees and may not evade the requirements of the statute in this respect by allowing a smaller amount in their annual estimate than that re - quired to meet the provisions of the statute. </seg>
            <seg id="p449">OPINIONS In answer to your question "b". I am of the opinion that Sec. 26-1601 contemplates that any owner of real estate in the county may call upon the county surveyor to make a survey of his land and that the surveyor is bound to comply. His duties as ccunty engineer are, in a sense, dependent en tie will cf the county board in that the building of public improvements mentioned in Section 26-1601 must be initiated by action of the county board. The board having determined, however, to build any cf such .improvements it becomes the duty of the county surveyor' to perform the duties with respect to such im - provements which are put on him by the statute, and the county board has no power to dictate otherwise. In answering your question "c" I would say that in my opinion no general rule can be laid down. Kach statute must be construed separately according to the rules of cor,sti uction usually adopted by the courts. The duties prescribed in Section 26-1611 seem to me to be required of the county surveyor regardless cf the wishes of the county board or of anyone else. Tl.e san.e is true, 1 believe, of the provisions ■if Section 39-144. As to Section 77-2218, the only provision I find is: "All contracts for permanent improvemenls shtll be let by the county board, by com - petitive bids after the plans nnd specifications therefor drawn by the county surveyor or engineer have been filed with the county clerk of each respective county." . This seems to me to refer to the duties of the surveyor as county engineer which are defined in Section 26-1601, and my answer to your question would be the same as to question "b". When the board has determined upon the construction of some improvement the plans and specifications must be drawn by the county surveyor, but the decision as to whether such improvements shall be made rests with the board.

Taylor, State Superintendent, Lincoln, Nebraska. . . Dear Sir: The question is asked: "If I lost the Adams County Institute Fund at the time of the failure of the First National Bank on October 6, 1931, can the county board of supervisors hold that against me as a per - sonal account? In other words should they expect me to pay it?" In answer to the question I will say that in my opinion a county superintendent is liable for county institute funds deposited by her in a bank and lost because of the bank's failure, although I know of no case where that precise question has been passed upon by the Supreme Court. In the case of B:sh v. Johnson County, 48 Neb. 1, the Supreme Court held that: "The duty imposed on a county treasurer by law, and as - sumed by him, of safely keeping, accrunting for and turning over the public funds which come into his hands by virtue of his office, is an absolute one; and where his bond is conditioned for the faithful performance of the duties of the office by him, the sureties on the bond are bound and liable in like manner and their responsibility is the same as that of their piincipi.l and it will be no defense of either of the parties, in an action on the bond to recover public funds, predicated on an alleged failure of the treasurer to account for or pay them over, thrt the funds have been lost or stolen without the fault or neg - ligence of the treasurer." This case arose before there was any law authorizing a county treasurer to deposit public funds in his hands in a bank under certain conditions. I know of no law at the present time which authorizes a county superintendent to deposit money in his or her hands in a bank; It is said in 46 C. J. at page 1040 thereof that </seg>

Mr. Clyde R. Worral, County Attorney, Wahoo, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You say: "The question has arisen in Saunders County as to the right of the county attorney to be reimbursed for necessary traveling and other expenses incidental to making criminal and civil in - vestigations where the State of Nebraska and the county of Saunders is a party in interest .... Sec. 33-111, C. S. among other things, while dealing with the county attorney's salary, says; 'and traveling and other expenses shall be paid to him upon his presentation of his bill for same, accompanied by proper vouchers, to the county board of his county', ... . The statute provides that the county attorney as such is also ex - officio county coroner and I ask for your opinion as to whether or not is is proper for the county commissioners to reimburse the county coroner for his necessary and actual expenses in - curred while performing the duties of coroner." In answer to .your question I will say that 33-111 refers in my opinion more particularly to cases in which the county attorney is engaged in the courts of another county in any suit, application or motion in which the state or county is any interested party. In all such cases the statute provides that he shall receive his reasonable and necessary traveling and hotel expenses while so engaged. The language of the statute is mandatory in such cases. </seg>
            <seg id="p452">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Where the business in which tre county attorney is engaged is altogether within the county the expenses incurred in looking after il are not expressly provided for by 33-111, but in' the case of Ferryman v. Schalander, 85 Neb. 281 the Supreme C:.-urt held that "The matter of allowing a sum to the county attorney to cover actual necessary expenses incurred while investigating and prosecuting criminal cases and defending cases brought against the county is within the scund discretion of said board, and said board may, in the exercise of such discretion, lawfully allow and reimburse the county attorney for such expenditures." I am therefore of the opinion that the county board,- if it sees fit to do so may lawfully reimburse the county attorney for expenses actually and necessarily incurred by him in traveling about the county and away from the county seat although such business may be trans - acted wholly within the county. As has been heretofore pointed out if the state or county business in which he is engaged is necessarily transacted outside the county the statute is mandatory that he shall be allowed his reasonable and necessary traveling expenses in addition to his salary.

Rice, Palmer, Nebraska. Dear Sir: We have your letter of March 30th in which you ask our opinion and advice regarding the clearing of your mail route from snow as provided in Section 39-1314, Comp. St., 1929. From your letter it seems that you are a rural mail carrier; your road became blocked with snow, your patrons requested the local road overseer to open the road as provided in Section 39-1314, and he directed them to do the necessary work on the road. \V hen the work was done </seg>
            <seg id="p453">OPINIONS it* was found that there were no funds in the township or road dis - trict to pay for this work and the ccunty commissioner refused to pay it from the county fund giving as the reason that the route is not designated as an auto route and that you were supposed to be traveling over it with a team of horses. You inquire if the people who cleaned this road have a just claim and if it should be paid from the county fund. Section 39-1314 provides that the county highway commissioner, when notified that a mail route is blockaded with snow, shall proceed to open it for the passage of the mails and may, by himself or through the district road overseeis demand the services of able-bodied men with teams, and tools to clear such roads and that such persons shall be allowed 30 cents per hour per man and 30 cents per hour per team for such services, "which expense shall be paid out of the district or township road fund upon the certificate of the said road commissioner or any of the district road overseers certifying to the time of such persons and teams." Your letter does not indicate whether the road overseer was authorized by the county highway commissioner to have the road open - ed or merely ordered it done on his own responsibility. If the latter is true, there would be serious doubt, I believe, as to the validity of the claims. Even if the work was done by order of the county highway commissioner I do not believe that these claims would be proper claims against the county but they would be valid against the township or road district. In such case they could be allowed and paid when there are funds on hand for that purpose. Very truly yours, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General, By HOMER L. KYLE, Assistant Attorney General. POOR RELIEF— DUTY OF COUNTY TO FURNISH MEDICAL AID April 9, 1932. Mr. Henry Pavlat, County Clerk, , • Sidney, Nebraska, Dear Sir: In answer to the question suggested by your letter of the 6th in - stant, I will say that 68-105 provides among other things that: </seg>
            <seg id="p454">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL : . "It shall be the duty of the county board in each county, to provide for all such persons as are unable to earn a livelihood in consequence of any bodily infirmity, idiocy or other una - voidable cause, the necessaries of life." I am of the opinion that medical attendance and dental work may both be classed as necessaries of life under certain circum - stances and that when the need for such care arises it should be furnished to resident paupers by th.e county unless the pauper has relatives who are of sufficient financial ability to support him. (Sec 68-101). The Statute provides that: "The county board shall issue their warrants or drafts on the treasurer for the payment of the expense necessarily incurred by them in the support of such poor person." It is true that a county board is not authorized to issue warrants for any amount exceeding eighty-five per cent of the levy unless there is mdney in the treasury with which to pay them and that the same inhibition obtains as to the making of contracts but in the case of Austin Mnf. Co. v. Brown County, 65 Neb. 60, it was held that: "It is not unlawful for a county board, after estimate made and prior to its meeting as a board of equalization, to anticipate the levy for the current year, and contract an in - debtedness upon a particular fund within the estimate although there is at the time no money in the treasury to the credit of such fund for the payment of the indebtedness, if in contracting such indebtedness the board remained within the limits pre - scribed by the constitution and the statutes." This case is cited with approval in the case of Roberts v Thompson and the more recent case of Central Bridge and Construction Company v. Saunders County, 106 Neb. 484. In the case of Austin Manf. Co. v. Brown County, supra, it is said in the body of the opinion that: . "The first step in the levy of the taxes, that is, making the estimate, has been taken; and there is no doubt of the authority of the board to anticipate the levy for the current year, remaining within the constitutional and statutory limits, and enter into such contracts as the welfare of the county may require.

This was not the purpose of the legislature, and is not the law." I think the court would make a like ruling in the instant case and that if the county board of your county did at their first meeting in January of this year make an estimate of the amount that would be necessary for the support of the poor of the county during the current year they would have a legal right to order warrants drawn for such purpose up to eighty-five per cent of the estimate, provided the estimate does not exceed the amount they are permitted by statute to levy.

Dear Madam: This is in answer to your kind letter of April 9, 1932. Names written on the ballot by the voter should be counted whether marked with an X or other mark after them or not. The judges of election constitute the canvassing board but in case the judges cannot agree on the legality of a vote, the clerks can pass on the legality of such vote (Sec. 32-903, Comp. St., 1929).

If you, as an election judge, have sent to the village clerk the ballots and a tally book and a pell book in which you have certified the count as made by the judges of election, ycur authority ends and the re - count should be made by the village board (Sec. 39-915, Comp.

In answer to the questions you ask I will say that the law evi - dently contemplates that there shall o, ly be a general re-valuation of real estate once in every fcuryesis. 77-1601, Comp. St., 1929, reads in part as follows: "All real property in this state subject to taxation shall be assessed on the first day of April, 1926, and every fourth year thereafter, which assessment shall be used as a basis of valua - tion for taxation until the next re R ular assessment except as hereinafter provided." 77-1702 provides, however, that the .county board of equalization may at its meeting in even numbered years "equalize the valuation of real property of the county by raising the valuation of such tracts and lots as are assessed too low, and lowering the valuation of such tracts and lots • as are assessed too high." I am therefore of the opinion that a county board of equalization may change the assessed value of real estate this year when they are convinced that such real estate is assessed above its actual value at the present time and much .greater than its proportionate value as compared with the assessed value of other classes of tangible property in the county. I take it the petition is sufficient in form to authorize the county board of equalization to act if it finds upon investigation the facts therein stated are true. In fact in the case of Welch v.

In answer to your question I will say that in my opinion the members of the county board are not personally li lLle for the support of the. poor of your county under the circumstances outlined by you. It may be that it is possible for your county to still care for the indigent poor who are residents of tl-e" county and whose circumstnnces are such that the county is charged with the duty of maintaining them. I presume your county board made an estimate at its first meeting in January of the amount that would be necessary to- pay the expenses of the county during the ensuing year. (Sec. 26-108). If it did I am of the opinion that it can. still care for its poor unless it has already entered into contracts which will absorb eighty-five per cent of that estimate.

Ben H. Buriitt, County Attorney, .. . Ainsworth, Nebraska. Dear Sir: This is in answer to yi ur kind letter of Mny 5, 1932. You request an opinion as to whether there may be appointed a deputy sheriff whose sole duty shall be the collection of delinquent personal taxes and whose only compensaticn for his services in this behalf shall be a commission on or percentage of the delinquent personal taxes so col - lected. The sheriff is required by law to pay over to the county treasurer all fees earned by him including those earned on the levy and service of distress warrants (Sees. 33-120 and 77-1917, Comp. St.,. 1929). For the performance of any of his duties including the collection of delin - quent personal taxes on distress warrants, the county board may pro - vide the sheriff with such deputies ns they shall deem necessary and shall fix the compensation of such deputies who shrll be paid by war - rant drawn on the general fund (Sec. 32-122, Comp. St., 1929). It thus appears that- the county board may appoint a deputy sheriff who may be assigned to personal-tax-collection duty only. But his pay will not come- directly out. of the distress-warrant fees of the sheriff's office as a percentage thereof, but will come nut of the county general fund directly.

In conclusion permit us to say that you are correct in your under - standing that the statutes require the sheriff to collect delinquent personal taxes by distress warrants issued to him by the county trea - surer for that purpose (Sees. 77-1916 to 77-1920, Comp. St., 1929). Sincerely yours, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General, By CLIFFORD L. REIN, Assistant Attorney General SCHOOL DISTRICTS— REAL ESTATE OF— RIGHT TO ACQUIRE TITLE BY ADVERSE POSSESSION May 11, 1932. Hon. Charles W. Taylor, State Superintendent, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You make a statement of fact and ask questions thereon as follows: "About forty years ago a school house was built on a man's farm is District 122. Lancaster County, apparently without any deed to the site or without any contract for the deed to the site as far as can be found in the records at the present time. In other words, the school district is a sort of squatter on this man's farm. "We would .like to know the respective rights of the district and the owner in this case. Can the owner collect a reasonable price for the amount of land so occupied or has the owner lost legal right to any remuneration for. the site by virtue of abverse possession over this period of years. "The owner of the land has been paying taxes, of course, on this school house site for forty years. We are informed that the taxes and interest at six per cent over the forty year period amount to two hundred and thirty-six dollars. "The question then arises that if the owner is enitled to </seg>
            <seg id="p463">OPINIONS a remuneration for the land itself is he entitled to the remun - eration for the original land plus the interest on the original amount for forty years or would he be entitled to settlement on the basis of the present value of the land without any interest? • "If the owner is entitled to remuneration for the value of the site, is he further entitled to a refund for the taxes which he has paid on this site all these years?" In answer, to the question you ask, I will say that in my opinion if the school district has been holding this land under claim of owner - ship for the past ten years or more it has become the owner thereof by virtue of adverse possession. - If its occupancy of the land has not been under claim of ownership for at least ten years but its occupancy has been admittedly by sufferance upon the part of the real owner, it acquires no title by virtue of adverse possession alone. I doubt, however, whether even in that case the owner can dispossess the district at this lime or compel it to pay for the ground although if the school house was removed to another location the owner cculd doubtless take possesson of the ground on which it now stands. If the owner is entitled to compensation it will be for the value of the land at the time it is taken and not for its value forty years ago together with interest thereon for the past forty years.

Assessed valua - tion $6000.00 tax for the year 1931—70.44. Lands are of equal character and lie adjacent thereto." and you inquire: "Does the recent ruling of the State Supreme Court mean that as a Board of Equalization that we shall consider the school tax in district No. 19 a deciding factor in making the value of Mr. A's farm less." In answer to your question I will say that in my opinion the ruling of the Supreme Court is to the effect that the amount of tax assessed against land may be considered in determining the actual value of land but that it is not necessarily a deciding factor. If because of the very hifih tax levied against it, it is of less value than other tracts in the neighborhood, I am of the opinion that it should be assessed at a less value for taxation purposes, but if re - gardless of the fact that higher taxes are levied against it than are levied against other tracts in the neighborhood, it will sell for as much as they will, I know of no reason why it should be valued at less than they for assessment purposes. It may be that it has other advantages which compensate for the increased tax levied against it. Sincerely yours, C. A. SORENSE.N, Attorney General, By GEORGE W. AYRES, Assistant Attorney General. i, ' . ..■■■■ HEALING ARTS— RIGHT OF CORPORATION TO PRACTICE . May 27, 1932. Dr. K. D. Davis, Columbus, Nebraska. • • Dear Sir: In your letter of the 16th relative to the right of a corporation to practice a profession you inquire if you are right in assuming that a corporation formed for the purpose of practicing a profession must be made up entirely of duly licensed practitioners of the profession, and that ordinary laymen or men not licensed to practice this profes - sion would not be permitted to incorporate for such purpose. </seg>
            <seg id="p465">OPINIONS There are two propositions which I wish to state emphatically at the outset: First, no corporation, whether composed of laymen or professional men, can lawfully practice any licensed profession as a corporation; Second, any group of men, regardless of whether they are licensed to practice a profession or not, may lawfully incorporate for any lawful purpose. While it is unlawful for a corporation to practice optometry, for example it is not unlawful for a group of people, whether licensed optometrists or not, to form a corporation for the purpose of hiring licensed optometrists to furnish professional services to the public under certain conditions. Perhaps I can best make myself clear by illustration. A corporation has no right to teach school. Or.ly an individual duly licensed as a teacher can do that. But there is no legal reason why a group of people may not incorporate as a teachers' agency for the purpose of furnishing duly licensed teachers to schools. A group of laymen may incorporate to erect and operate a hospital. They may employ a staff of licensed physicians nnd nurses and furnish the public with all kinds of medical and surgical services, make charges therefore, and divide the profits or share the losses, as the case may be, among the stockholders or incorporators, but the corporation is not regarded as practicing medicine. It furnishes medical service to the public but does not itself practice medicine. That is done by its li - censed employees. • There is a clear legal distinction between furnishing a service and" performing a service. Anyone whether a licensee, a layman or a corporation, may furnish a service, but if it is a service which can only be legally performed by a licensed member of a profession then no corporation can perform it and no unlicensed individual working for the corporation can perform it.

            <seg id="p466">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL GASOLINE BOOTLEGGERS— DUTY OF LOCAL OFFICERS TO APFREHEND May 31, 1932. Honorable Carl E. Peterson, County Attorney, Hayes Center, Nebraska. • . Dear Mr. Peterson: In answer to your letter let us say that under the statutes it is the duty of the state sheriff, the county sheriffs, chiefs of police and village marshals, to apprehend and arrest all persons who bring gas - oline into the state illegally. It is just as important to arrest and prosecute gasoline bootleggers as bootleggers of intoxicating liquor. Under the provisions of Section 66-401, G. S. for 1929, " any per - son, firm, co-partnership, .company agency, association, corporation, state, county, municipality or subdivision of either thereof, who imports or causes to be imported into the State of Nebraska" any .motor vehicle fuel any part of which is "for use, distribution, sale or delivery in the State of Nebraska" is a "dealer." The Supreme Court of Nebraska in the recent case of Burke vs. Bass, No. 28213, decided May 20, 1932, said: "The gasoline tax is imposed by Sections 66-401 to 66-415, Comp. St., 1929. Dealers are required to pay the tax. Under the statute, the term 'dealers' includes any person who brings into or produces in the state motor vehicle fuel, which is for use, distribution or delivery in the state." {Gasoline bootleggers can be prosecuted on several different grounds: 1. Section 66-402, C. S. for .1929, provides that every dealer in motor vehicle fuels must file a certificate with the State Treasurer on forms prepared and furnished by the State Treasurer. Failure to file such certificate is a violation of the law. 2. Section 66-403, as amended by Chapter 114, 1931 Session Laws, requires every dealer in motor vehicle' fuels before engaging in busi - ness to procure a license from the State Treasurer. Failure to pro - cure a license is a violation of the law. 3. Section 66-404, C. S. for 1929, requires all dealers to keep a record of all motor vehicle fuels purchased or imported. Failure to keep such; a record is a violation of the law. </seg>
            <seg id="p467">OPINIONS 4. Section 66-4C5, C. S: for 1929, rs amended by Chapter 113, 1931 Sessions Laws, requires all dealers as defined by statute, to file a month - ly report with the Stele Treasurer. Failure to file such a report is a violation of the law. 5. Section 66-405, C. S. for 1929, as amended by Chapter 113, 1931 Session Laws, also requires dealers to pay a tax of four cents per gal - lon. Failure to pay such a tax is a viclation of the law. 6. Section 66-308, C. S. for 1929, makes it illegal for any person to sell, or attempt to sell In i ebrpsl a in to,- vehicle fuels wlich have not been inspected in the meni-er provdeH by law. For violation of this particular section the pcnilty is n fire of not less than $10.00 nor more than $100.00, or impiisonmeft ii the county jail not exceeding three months. - Section C6-310 C. S. for 11)29. 7. Under the provisions of Chapter 130, 1931 Session Laws, per - sons using motor vehicle fuels as to which a tax of four cents per gal - lon has not been paid under the provisions of Section 66-405, c. s. for 1929, as amended, become pers nally liaLle for the payment of said tax of four cents per gallon. Fail re (f tiie user c.f the motor vehicle fuel to pay the tax is a violation of the law. Under the provisions of Sec - tion 4 of said Chapter 130, nny person fi Hint? or refusing to pay said tax when it has not been paid by the person bunging the motor vehicle fuel into the state, is guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction "shall be punished by a fine of not less than $25.00 nor more than $500.00, or by imprisonment in the. county jail for not less than thirty days nor more than ninety days for each offense." Section 66-410, c. s. for 1929, provides the penalties for failure to file certificate, to secure a license, keep a record, file a report, and pay the tax. Said section reads as follows: "Any dealer, person, firm, co-partnersl ip, company agency, association or corporation who shall violate any provisions of this Act, or who shall ff.il or refuse to pay such tax when due, &lt; or who shall knowingly mnke any false statement in any state - ment or report required by this Act, or any person, firm, co- • partnership, company, agency, association "or corporation making any false statement in connection with an application for the refund of any money or tax as provided in this Act, or collecting or causing to-be repaid to him or to any person, any tax without being entitled to same under the provisions of this Act, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not less than twenty-five dollars nor more than five hundred dollars, or by imprisonment in county jail for not less than thirty days nor more than ninety . days for each offense." - ■ </seg>
            <seg id="p468">RLFORT OF ATTORNEY GENKRAL I call your special attention to the fact that the statute defines a "dealer" as not oily one who imports motor vehicle fuels, but also one who "causes to be imported into the State of i\ebrcska" motor-ve - hicle fuels. Any person, nssociation, or coi poration, therefore, who em - ploys or causes some other person to bring into the stale motor vehicle fuels, is within the -meaning of the statute a "dealer" and must comply with all the laws governing dealers. If such a "dealer" fails to file the certificate, secure a license, keep a record, or pay the tax, on any gas - oline which comes into his possession and control, he' is subject to prosecution in the county in which he transacts business. He is equally guilty with the person who actui 11 y hauls in the motor vehicle fuels. Thousands of gallons of bootlegged gasoline are being brought into the state. I solicit your earnest cooperation in the enforcement of the gasoline tax law. ■ . ■ " ■■"'-■ Sincerely yours, C. A.

Mr. Carroll Thompson, County Attorney, Fullerton, Nebraska. i Dear Sir: You say: "A resident of Nance County died leaving property in Nance, Keith and Nuckclls County, Nebraska. From size of the estate it appeared there might be an estate tax, taxable against said estate. A tax appraiser was appointed in Nance County and gave due notice to the county attorneys of the other counties. "Upon the hearing it appeared that the said estate was not taxable. The county judge issued a decree and taxed the costs to the three counties in proportion to the value of the property they held. "Section 77-2211, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, recites 'the appraisers shall be paid by the county treasurer out of any funds he may have in his hands on account of such tax </seg>
            <seg id="p470">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL on the certificate of the county Judge a reasonable fee to foe fixed by the county judge together with legal mileage ... all costs made or incurred under this article shall be paid by the county treasurer out of any funds he may have in his hands on account of such tax on the ceitificate of the county judge.' "Nuckolls and Keith counties have refused to pay their share of this appraisment. What would be your interpretation of the law r.s to the liability ■ f these counties to pay their share?" . This office has heretofore expressed an opinion • that the costs of a proceeding to determine whether an inheritance tax is due from any estate and the amcunt of such tax, if there is any tax due, may lawfully be paid out of any inheiilance tax money he may have in his hands and that he is not necessarily limited in making such payment to the inheritance tax money deiived from the particular estate in which the work is done. To that opinion we adhere. The law provides for the appointment of an appraiser who by leave of the county judge may issue subpoenas and compel the attendance of witnesses before him. The law not only provides that such an appraiser shall be paid a reasonable fee as well as legal mileage, but it also provides that the witnesses and the officer who serves the subpoenas upon them shall be paid. If these varicus parties can only look to the estate in which the work is done it occurs to us that it would often happen they could not be paid although the law says they shall be paid (See 77-2211). It sometimes happens, of course, as it did in this case that no inheri - tance tax is due from an estate but frequently this cannot be known until after the appraisal. It sometimes happens also that the amount of the inheritance tax levied against an estate is so small that it will not pay the reasonable charges of appraisers,, officers, and witnesses. It occurs to us, therefore, that justice requires that such expenses be paid out of the aggregate of the inheritance tax fund in the hands of the county treasurer, rather than that appraisers, officers and wit - nesses should receive no compensation in cases where contrary to expectation when inheritance tax proceedings are instituted it turn out that no such tax is due from an estate. The question of the apportionment of costs to the several counties in which the deceased owned real estate when it is finally determined that no inheritance tax is due is another matter. An apportionment of costs seems to be equitable where inheritance tax proceedings are </seg>
            <seg id="p471">OPINIONS instituted in good faith but in the absence of any statute providing for an apportionment of costs among the counties in such cases I doubt whether contribution can be compelled from the counties other than 'that in which the admiristration cf the estate is pending.

CONSOLIDATED SCHOOL DISTRICT— LIABILITY ARISING FROM TRANSPORTATION OF CHILDREN TO AND FROM SCHOOL June 3, 1932. Mr. Wm. Samuelson, Trumbull, Nebraska. Dear Sir: " This is in answer to ycur kind letter of May 27, 1932 asking several questions regarding legal liabilities aiising out of the employ - ment of drivers with trucks to transport children to and from school in consolidated school districts. The pertinent statute is Section 79-2408, Comp. St., 1929, reading as follows: "The board of education of every such district shall pro - vide for the transportation over established public highways of rural pupils. The board of education may make arrange - ments with the parents to transport their own children of school age. When transportation is furnished by the board of ed - ucation, the public conveyance transporting said pupils shall y be routed so that it passes on regular schedules at points on es - tablished public highways near the homes of pupils to be transported. When said board shall moke arrangements with parents to transport their cwn children, they are hereby au - thorized to compensate the parents for such service in such reasonable amount as the board may fix. When the board of - . education employs a driver to transport the pupils from their homes to the school and return by means of a public convey - ance, said driver sb employed shall be employed as and shall be an independent contractor for said purpose of transporta - • tion and shall assume all liability arising from, out of or be - cause of his negligence in performance of said contract for transportation, to the exclusion of said school district and the </seg>
            <seg id="p472">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL school board or any member thereof and he shall give a surety bond not exceeding five thousand dollars, the premium on which shall be paid out of the school district treasury, con - ditioned for the. payment by such driver, or his substitute, of any and all damages that may accrue to any person or persons by reason of any negligence or carelessness in transporting said pupils from their homes to said school and return. Said board of education is authorized to establish such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this act." You first inquire as to who must buy the motor vehicle and driver's licenses and what kind of licenses ' must be obtained. If, as you say, your district' employs drivers with their own trucks, as owners of the trucks they must, of course, obtain their own motor vehicle licenses. We fail to find any law requiring such drivers to have any other than the regular motor vehicle and driver's licenses. Your next statement, viz.. "that the district can get the license without any charge if it is taken out in the name of the school district", is correct. (Sec. 60-314, Comp. St., 1929). You next inquire whether when the school district is the owner or licensee of the vehicle driven by an employed driver in the trans - portation of school pupils, and the driver sustains an accident due to his carelessness while driving the vehicle for other than school transportation purposes, the school district is liable for persons and property injured in such accident. You are informed that no governmental agency, school district included, is ever under any circumstances, liable for the torts in - cluding the negligent acts of any of its agents or servants. This is the common law rule and it is also .expressed in the above quoted statute by the words "to the exclusion of the school district", etc. Therefore, there is no chance whatever of the school district ever in - curring a liability under the circumstances described in your letter. The driver, of course, is liable, but the school district will not be in - terested in this liability. You next inquire as to whether the school districts liability in - surance policy on its school vehicles covers accidents with the vehicles while being used for purposes other than the transportation of school children. What the liability policy covers is shown by the policy itself. Since we do not have the policy before us, we cannot answer this question. You should submit the policy to a private, local attorney for the school district and have him tell you what the policy covers. You last inquire whether the school law requires the driver of </seg>
            <seg id="p473">OPINIONS a school bus to give a bond and if so how much. As you will see from the above quoted statute, whether the vehicle is school-owned or school-licensed or not the employed driver is an independent con - tractor and must give the bond and its amount is not to exceed $5000.00 as may be determined by the school board.

The pertinent, specific sections are Sections 27-520 and 28-724, reading as follows: "It shall be the duty of each justice of the peace,, munici- ; cipal judge and each county judge to . appoint one constable. Said constable shall be appointed by' the justice or court im - mediately after taking office.

It shall be the duty of the court, when the judge - ment shall extend to removal from office, to cause immediate notice of such removal to be given to the proper department in order that the vacancy thus occasioned may be filled." 28-724 . </seg>
            <seg id="p475">OPINIONS From Section . 28-724, ycu will observe thai removal for mis - conduct malo animo is by judgement of a .court of competent juris - diction following conviction therein of violating said section.

Removal of constables for any cause or no cause except mis - conduct malo animo is by the court which appointed the constable (Sec. 27-520, Comp. St., 1929).

            <seg id="p478">REI'ORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL • "Second. At its meeting in 1912 and every second year thereafter equalize the valuation of real property of the county by raising the vsluation of such tracts and lots as are assessed too low, and lowering the valuation' of such tracts and lots as are assessed too high; but in cases of evident error of assessment, or. of apparent pross injustice in over- valuation " or undervaluation of real property, the county board of equalization may at its annual meetings consider and correct the same by raising, after due no- ice has been given to the interested party or parties, pr by lowering the assessed valuation of such real property. Tn cases where farm lands or ical property consisting of city, town, or village blocks or lots have been assessed as entities and after time of such assessment part or parts of such entities have been transferred by the owner or owners thereof to another party or to other parties by sale or other - wise, then the county board may at such annual meeting as board of equalization apportion the just and equitable propor - tion of the assessed valuation of such entities to the various parcels of lands into which such entilies have by transfer of . title been divided, . upon notice given to the parties of such transfer." In equalizing the County Board of Equalization can not deal with individual assessments nor take ir.to consideration inequalities as between individual taxpayers, but deals only with the valuation of the taxable property of a precinct or taxation district as a whole. The County Board cannot under the guise cf equalization lower valuations merely for the purpose of making such decrease. However, when a decrease results incidentally in the equalization of property, so that all property may bear its equitable proportion of the burden of taxation, such re - sulting incidental decrease is within the legitimate exercise of the power to equalize. - Hacker vs. Howe, 72 Neb. 385, 101 N. W. 255. In order to effect an equalization it is the duty of the board to' ascertain whether the valuation in each district bears a just relation to that in all the other districts, and if it does not, the board is to increase or diminish the aggregate valuation -in any district by adding or deducting such a percentage as will in its opinion be necessary to produce Such relation. For this purpose the board may take as a stand - ard the particular district assessment roll which in its judgment most nearly represents a true and just valuation and make the others conform to it. - 37 Cyc. 1075. Under the existing laws on the subject the authority of the County Board of Equalization in the matter of .equalizing between precincts and taxing districts is similar to the authority of the State Board cf Equalization and Assessment to equalize between counties. In the case </seg>
            <seg id="p479">OPINIONS of Hacker vs. Howe, supra, is set out the extent and limitations of the authority of the State Board of Equalization in equalizing between counties. We quote from that opinion, as applicable to the authority of a county board of equalization, the following: - "Concerning the contention that the state board in respect of the action taken did not equalize but reassessed the pro - perty of the several counties raisng.the aggregate valuations thereof according to the percentage applied to each county, it may be said that, manifestly, the board has no power to increase valuations merely for the purpose of making such increase. The limitations of law relative to tax levies, the fixing of valuations and the - equalization thereof, cannot he nullified and rendered impotent by an attempt to increase the aggregate of the grand assessment rolls under the guise of equalization. Poe v. Howell, 67 Pac. (New Mex.) 62; State v. State Board of Equalization, 18 Mont. 473, 46 Pac. 266; 1 Desty, taxation, 605. Eut, in the case at bar, we think it clear that the increase re - sulting from the action of the state board was purely incidental to a proper equalization of the assessment of the different counties as returned to that body. From the action taken, it is fairly inferable, that, in 66 of the SO counties of the state, property was found to be essesscd uniformly and at its actual cash value, while, in 24 counties the valuations placed upon property generally were reatively too low and required, in order that the rule of uriformily might be observed and equality at - tained, a raise of the aggregate valuation of these increased . from two per cent, in one instance to ten per cent, in others. Surely it may not be said that, it having been ascertained that so nearly all of the prrperty of the different counties had been assessed at its true vclue, in c rder to properly adjust and equalize there must be a reduction of a certain percentage - in this larger number of counties and a corresponding increase and less than was ordered in the smaller number, so that the grand total of the assessment roll should not be disturbed. While a plan or method of raising the value of some of the counties and lowering others may be generally resorted to in order to bring about equality, yet it would, in the present in - stance, be in a measure a perversion of the law to reduce below its actual value by far the larger proportion of the property in the state- subject to taxation for the purpose of avoiding an actual increase in the total valuation of all property. The statute does not limit the state board in the matter of equaliza - tion to the aggregate value as shown by the returns of all different counties. Its provisions are that the board may in - crease or decrease by per centum to be added to or deducted from the aggregate value of the different counties to make </seg>
            <seg id="p480">468 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL them conform to law. Of course they have ai thnity to equalize: and to equalize is to adjust differences in values so as to bring nil to a common standard, and to the end that all property asssessed shs-ll bear its just proportion of the burdens of taxation. Where equalization is the main object and the in crease resulting therefrom- is incidental, we think the action is undoubtedly a legitimate exercise rf the powers conferred upon the board. If the object appears to be to raise the aggregate of the total assessed valuation, such action would in our judgment, have to be condemned as an. unwarranted exercise of the authority to equalize. • The subject has re - ceived some consideration from' the court in Suyilam v. Merrick County, 19 Neb. 155, under a statute which prohibited the raising or lowering of the total valuation of the assessment roll of the county. It is there said: '"It is the duty of the board to find this medium - that is, the mean between the lower and the higher values - adopt it as the true standard, and raise the one extreme and lower the other to it and thus leave the general result or common aggregate of vrluation of the property of the whole ccunty neither raised nor lowered, "except in such an amount as may be actually necessary and incidental to a proper and just equa - lization.'" See also Bardiick v. Lillon, 7 Okla. 535, where it is held that a county board of equalization may adopt as the basis for equalization the assessment of a township which, in their judgment, most nearly represents the true. cash val - uation, and add to or deduct from other ■ townships such per cent, as will cause them to conform in valuation to the one adopted as a basis, and this notwithstanding such action may either increase or decrease the aggregate valuation as shown by ell the township returns. The rule as thus announc - ed in the opinion cited is probably stated too broadly. The opinion apparently overlooks the fact that the valuation of property assessed for taxation is primarily for assessing of - ficers, and that boards of equalization except as conferred, by statutes are not authorized to change the result, and then only in order to effectuate an adjustment of values so as to bring about uniformity. Our statute, we think, contemplates that the state board of equalization may equalize valuations as . between the different counties in the sense the word is usually and ordinarily understood. That is, the state board is empower - ed to correct and adjust inequalities in valuation to the end that all property shall relatively be valued on the same basis for purposes of taxation, as near as the same is practicable. In either view of the subject, however, the action taken by the state board was within the scope of its powers, and the increase </seg>

If neither one of these things happens I know of no way by which he can be transferred to another district, except by a petition from each district affected and the affirmative action cf the ccunty superintendent.

Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of inquiry of the 11th instant, I will say that this office adheres to the opinion heretofore expressed that where two candidates are nominated at the primary election for the office of County Judge or County Superintendent and one of them dies or resigns or removes from the county, so there is but one can - didate remaining on the ballot for that office, there is no vacancy so far as a candidate for that office is concerned and hence no one is entitled under such circumstances to be nominated for that office by petition. You will observe the law does not absolutely require that there shall be two candidates for each and every such position to-be filled, for it provides that "When at least two persons shall not file an affidavit to have their names placed on the primary ballot for the homin- • ation for each position to be filled and the name of a person is written in and voted for as a candidate for any of- such posi - tions, who did not file as aforesaid as a candidate for such nomination, such person shall not be entitled to a certificate of nomination at such primary election nor have his name placed on the general election ballot unless he shall have received at least the second highest number of votes cast for such nom - ination and unless such a number of votes received shall be at least ten per cent of the total vote cast for governor in said county at the preceding general election."

You will observe too that a nomination for one of the above mentioned non-partisan offices can only be made by petition in cases where there is a vacancy "as to a nominee for either county judge or county superintendent".

Smithson, Sheriff, Franklin, Nebraska. Dear Sir: : This is in response to your oral request for opinion as to whether, when the county attorney has the sheriff make criminal investigations, the county board must pay the sheriff his statutory mileage (Sec. 33-120, Conip. St., 1929) for each mile actually and necessarily travelled by him in doing such work. In your inquiry the principal question involved appears to be - whether, for travelling expenses in carrying on criminal and other investigations under the direction cf the county attorney, the sheriif is entitled to mileage or actual expenses as allowed by the county board. We fail to find any Nebraska . statute or Supreme Court decision which is directly responsive to your question. Hence, neither ours or any other lawyer's answer to your question can be safely regarded as entirely free from doubt. We nevertheless have an opinion on the question you present, and we are willing to express it, not as a bind - ing and authoritative determination, but solely for what it may be found to be worth. </seg>
            <seg id="p487">• . OPINIONS The rule for determining whether mileage or actual expenses are to be allowed a sheriff for disbursements made by him in rendering services, is stated in 57 C rpus Juris 1129, Notes 65 and 66 as follows: "The right to mileage is rurely statutory; for services in connection with which no mileage is allowed by statute a sheriff or constable is entitled to none." -(See also State v. Adams Co., 119 Neb. 826, 833). Applying this rule to the sheriff's particular service described by you, we fail to find any Nebraska statute allowing the sheriff mileage for travel or other expei.ses in making investigations or doing other work for the county under the direction of the county attorney. It is true that Section 33-120,- Comp. St. 1929, provides that the sheriff Shall charge and collect for "travelling expenses for each mile actually and necessarily travelled within their several counties fifteen cents"; - and for "travelling 'expenses for each mile actually and necessarily travelled outside their several counties, ten cents." But neither Section 33-120 nor any other statue provides that such mileage shall be paid the sheriff for. travel or other exienses incurred in making criminal investigations under the direction of the county attorney. In the re - cent case of Brannin v. Sweet Grass County,. 88 Mont. 412 293 P. 970, 972, the Montana Supreme Court held that a statute substantially the same as the above quoted provision f n m cur Section 33-120, "does not mean that, the sheriff shall receive ten cents per mile in the performance of every duty imposed upon him; but rather, that in the performance of duties for which by other provisions of the statute he is authorized to charge mileage it is to be fixed at ten cents per mile." The Mon - tana court further said tl.at such slatute "does not authorize the sheriff to charge mileage for other travelling than that which is expressly mentioned in other statutes; it simply fixes the rate which may be charged when mileage is authorized to be paid." These authorities make it plain that for expenses connected with the particualr services in question, the sheriff is not entitled to mileage. Hence, if the sheriff's claim for mileage in connection with such ser - vices was merely reduced by the county board seventy-five per cent as you have informed us, instead of being disallowed entirely, we are unable to perceive wherein the sheriff has legal cause for complaint. Rather does he have legal cause for rejoicing over the seventy-five - per-cent allowance which was made him. This seventy-five-per-cent allowance for the expenses in question, though not to be justified as mileage, is apparently defensible as a pament for actual expenses incurred by the sheriff in the premises. We do not doubt the authority of the county attorney with the approval of the county board, to bind the county for the reasonable, necessary </seg>
            <seg id="p488">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL and actual travelling and other expenses of himself, his agents and servants including the sheriff, if so employed, in investigating, pre - paring and prosecuting criminal actions (Sec. 26-901 Comp. St. 1929- Chnstner v. Hayes County, 79 Neb. 157, 112 N. W. 347; Berryman v. Schalander, 85 Neb. 281, 122 N. W. 990). But such an allowance made by the board to the sheriff for his expenses in investigating criminal matters under the county attorney's direction, is an allowance lo the sheriff as agent of the county attorney and not as Sheriff; for while it is the sheriff's official duty to ferret out, apprehend and. arrest law violators and, perhaps, to turn over to the county attorney any in - formation he may have concerning their violations, there is no official obligation resting on the sheriff thereafter to work with, fdr or under the county. attorney in investigating, preparing or prosecuting crim - inal actions. If the sheriff by employment cf the county attorney does assist the later in the manner described, he is working, not as sheriff, but as the county attorney's agent or servant and, as such, he is to be paid, not mileage, but the reasonable, necessary and actual expenses incurred by him in his employment rs allowed by the board in the first instance, and on appeal by the sheriff or dissatisfied tax - payer, by the district and supreme courts (Sees. 26-119, 120 Comp St 1929; Red Willow County v. McClain, 242 N. W. 423). We therefore conclude that for travelling expenses in carrying on criminal investigations under the direction of the county attorney, the sheriff is entitled, not to statutory mileage, but to reasonable necessary and actual expenses allowed by the county board or by the courts on appeal. .

Reynolds, Creighton, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of inquiry of the 27th instant, I will say that the only provision of statute providing for the deposit of school funds in a bank is that found in Chapter 141, Session Laws of 1931, and this does not require a bank -to give any security to pro - tect such deposit, but it does provide that the bank shall be approved as a depository by the school board. " .; ™ </seg>
            <seg id="p489">OPINIONS I do not understand this to mean that such a deposit may not be secured if the school beard asks for secuiity and the bank is willing to give it, but I think if secu.ity is fciven it should be in the form of a depositv ry bond if the bank In which the money is deposited is a state bank, inasmuch as there is no statute which provides that a de - posit of school money in a Lank may be secured by a pledge of bank assets, and the Supieme Court of this state has recently held in the case of Bliss v. Pathfinder Irr. Dist., 240 N. \v. 291 that a state bank is without authority to pledge assets to secure deposit of funds, except in instances specifically authorized by statute." Although the statute provides that money e'epesited by a city of the second class or a village in a. bank approved by the city or village board shall be secured by a depository bond, it does not provide that the bank may secure such a deposit by a pledge of any of its assets. I am therefore of the opinion that the safe plan to pursue is to require a state bank to secure such a depesit by the giving of a bond rather than by a pledge of a part of its -assets.

            <seg id="p490">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL county high schools. In such a county any high school which is ap - proved as a high, school even though it is only a ten-grade school and properly situated in such a district in a county which maintains a county high school is not required to pay any part of the county high school tax, in my opinion. At one' time the law was otherwise. In 1917 an act was passed (See Chapter 125, Session Laws of 1917) which in express terms provided that in counties maintaining a county high school, it was only in districts maintaining a full four-year high school of their own that property was wholly exempt from the payment ' of any high school tax and in other districts maintaining one. two, or three-year high schools, the exemption was graded in proportion to the number of years of high school the district maintained. Afterwards the law was amended and the. provisions f ■ r only a partial exemption from county high school taxes, when a district maintained a high school of less than four years, were stricken out. 79-902 is not applicable, in my opirion, to counties in which the county itself maintains a county high- school. It is only applicable. I take it. to counties which do not themselves maintain a county high school. In such counties, property in school districts which maintain a full four-year high school is exempt from any taxation for the county free high school fund. Property located in school districts of such counties which main - tain a high school but for a period of less than four-years is exempt from taxation for such fund in proportion to the number of years of high school the district maintains (79-902).

            <seg id="p491">OPINIONS My answer is no unless the propi sed. levy is in excess of eight mills. In that case 79-212, Compiled Statutes of Kebraska for 1929, provides that the proposition to make the increased levy must be submitted to the electors at their annual meeting or at a special meeting called for that purpose. . . What is now Sec. 79-211, Compiled Statutes, 1929, prior to its amend - ment in 1913 provided among other things th t tha legal voters of the dis - trict at the annual school meeting' each year shculd determine the amount of money required for the maintenance of the school during the coming year. The fact that this provision was left cut when the Statute was amended indicates, I think, that the Legislature intended the consent of the electors of a rural school should not be an essential prerequisite to the making of a levy for general school district purposes. Sec. 79-211 reads as fellows: "That trustees of each school district within the state of Nebraska shall, prior to the annual school district meeting in each year, as provided by law prepare an estimate showing the amount of money required for the maii-.teni nee of schools during the coming school year, shall determine the amount of money required fo"r school maintenance during the coming school year, and which shall be an amount sufficient to maintain a i school in the manner and fcr the time provided by law and the amount of money so required shall be levied as a tax upon all of the taxable property of the school district.' 1 . 1 assume that inasmuch as the Legislature provided the estimate should be made prior to the annual school district meeting it contem - plated that it would be presented to the meeting and discussed there. But I take it that whether the estimate is approved or not by the elec - tors the law contemplates that there shall be levied upon the property taxable in the district a tax sufficient to provide for the maintenance of schools in the district for the time required by law during the en - suing school year. As further evidence that the approval of the electors of the district to a tax for general school purposes is not required under all circum - stances, I call' attention to 79-221, Compiled Statutes, 1929, which reads in part as follows: "Where no levy is voted at the annual school district meet - ing or where the district votes to have no school, or where no action is taken by .the annual meeting to provide for school, it shall be the duty of the county superintendent of the proper county to make and deliver to the county clerk of such county </seg>

            <seg id="p493">OPINIONS I agree with Mr. Raecke that Section 79-411, Compiled Statutes, requires that a contract with a teacher "shall be in writing and shall have the consent of the moderator and the treasurer, or one of them, endorsed thereon and shall specify the wages per. week or month as agreed by the parties." I take it that these requirements are mandatory in the case of a contract made with a teacher to teach in a school district with a three - member board, that is\to say, to a district with organization of the or - dinary rural school district. It is obvious, however, that it is not entirely applicable to distiicts organized under Article VI and Article XXV of the School Law, where the teachers are elected at a meeting of the school board, as they are in districts with six-member boards. I am of the opinion that the election of a teacher at a school board meeting may be so definite and certain as to terms that- it will constitute a contract if the teacher is notified and writes" a letter accepting it, which is received by the board before it rescinds the election. I do not find where this precise question has ever been passed upon by the Supreme Court of this state but in 56 C. J., at page 389 thereof, it is said: ' "Where an application for a position as teacher is accepted, and the applicant is duly elected, the contract is complete, with - out further notice to the teacher of his election, or to the board of the teachers acceptance. Where the teacher, having been elected without his application being on file, signs a written contract for his services; or writes a letter to the board accept - ■. ing its offer, the contract is complete." Similarly, it is said on page 393 of 56 C. J. that: «• • • a statute merely requiring the contract to be in writing does not thereby require it to be in a* single instrument or require that the formal contract shall be in all respects suf - ficient to charge the school board with liability if it is supple - mented by a written record of the board's action establishing its liability; nor is it necessary that the contract should be in written form at the meeting of the district board, provided it is reduced to writing later. Where the only statutory re - quirement of a writing is a provision requiring a record of all action by the board to be kept, a contract is sufficiently evi - denced by the minutes of the board."

SCHOOL DISTRICT— OBLIGATION TO EDUCATE CHILDREN IN ORPHAN'S HOME July 9, 1932. : Honorable Charles W. Taylor, State Superintendent, . ' Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You submit to this department for answer a letter received by you from the County Superintendent of Phelps County in which she says: "The Christian Orphan's Home is located about one and one-half miles from Holdrege in the rural school District No. 24 of Phelps County. "This is a charitable institution supported by donations from all the states in the United States and receives children from any state. Two teachers are employed and a two-room school is maintained, including all eight grades. "Who is responsible for these children's education after completing the eigth grade? Is the rural district No. 24 respon - sible thereby making it possible for each child living at the Orphan's Home who has completed the eigth grade to make an application for free high school tuition amounting to one hundred eight dollars, this amount to be drawn from the Phelps County High School fund? Previous to 1927 these children did not attend high school on account of the extra expense" of tui - tion which the institution could not afford to pay, so the Phelps </seg>
            <seg id="p495">OPINIONS County Board of Supervisors made an agreement with the Hol - drege school board members to furnish fifty-four dollars per . pupil and since then they have been attending high Bchool. This being the case Holdrege has limited the number to ten pupils." I assume that the children in the Orphans Home have no other home. If this assumption is correct, I am of the opinion that District No. 24 in which the home is located is responsible for the cost of their education up to and through the eighth grade and that their high school tuition is payable out of the County High School fund. "It has been held that an orphan or child who has no other home than the institution to which he has been. committed ami whose residence in the institution is for an indefinite period is entitled to free schooling in the district where the institution is located, and to high school instruction in another district at the expense of the district in which the insUtution is located where such district is under legal obligation to furnish it and has no high school of its own." (P. 812, 56 Corpus Juris) The rule of law above laid down finds full support in the case of Crain v. Walker, 222 Ky. 828, 2 S. W.

PUBLIC UTILITIES— FRANCHISES, 2nd CLASS CITIES— VALIDITY OF, WHEN OMIT RATE PROVISION . July 19, 1932. Mr. C. M. Palmer, Lawyer, . • • • Mitchell, Nebraska. Dear Sir: This is in answer to your letter of July 6 in which you ask our opin - ion as to the legality of an electric light franchise granted by a city of the second class, which franchise fails, to fix the rates to be charged for electricity. ! ■ ; i •'•' ■ . </seg>
            <seg id="p496">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL As you state, cities of the second class are governed by Section 17-127. Comp. St., 1929, concerning granting -of the franchises. In this section it is stated that "Such franchise shall fix the amount that may be charged during such period for such gas or electricity." Although Section 17-440, Comp. St., 192U, pertaining to granlinp of franchises by both cities of the second class and villages does not contain the requirement above mentioned, Section. 17-127 ■ probably ' governs since it is later in time and deals specially with cities of the second class. The wording of said Section 17-127 would seem to in - dicate that the clause in question is mandatory, that is, that the fixing of rates is a condition to the grant and the validity thereof. There is an excellent discussion of the importance of. the rate fixing clause in franchise contracts in City of University Place v. Lincoln Gas and Electric Light Company. 109 Neb. 370. That csse shows how the granting of a franchise is a governmental power, as distinguished from contract as a proprietary power. If, therefore, the rate fixing re - quirement be held to be a necessary condition to the grant, as it ap - pears to be, the grant! of power to the city of the second class would seem to be limited by such requirement. In other words, the city hfls only the power to grant a franchise as thus restricted or limited. We are not prepared to say that the franchise ' granted without a rate fixing clause is absolutely void. In the absence of a decision flatly on the point we can only say that the case is a close one and will ■ probably have to be litigated if it is to be finally settled in this state. The question is two-edged. That is rate fixing in a franchise contract may be seriously detrimental to the city as well as to the company. It is for this reason that it is held "statutes granting to cities the right to make long-time contracts binding on the public and fixing a rate to be charged by a public service corporation are not looked upon with favor and will be strictly construed. It is only where the right is very clearly conferred that the state will be held to have relinquished its power to enact laws regulating tolls'. City of Manitowac v. Mani - towac &amp; Northern Traction Co., 129 N. W. (Wis.) 925, 929, see also. Railroad Commission v. Los Angeles R. Co., 280 U. S. 145, International Railroad Co. v. Prendergast, 52 Fed 2nd 293. This rule is based upon the principle that rate fixing powers are ° ' t governmental and appertain to sovereignty. Such sovereign powers, even for a temporary period, will not be held to have been relinq - uished by the state in the absence of very clear declaration to the' con - trary. </seg>
            <seg id="p497">OPINIONS If the present rates are exorbitant or more than would afford a reasonable return upon the company's investment the company would still be subject to suit eyen though its franchise contract were valid in any event it appears that, if you cannot adjust your difficulty with the company, suit will be required to settle the controversy. Very truly yours, C. A. SORENSEN Attorney General By L. R. NEW KIRK. Assistant Attorney General. PUBLIC UTILITIES-INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTS FOR SERVICE VALIDITY OF July 20, 1932. Mr. Stanley A. Matzke, County Attorney, Seward, Nebraska. Dear Sir: folbw'hf •" '" BnSWer to yoUr recent ™&lt;i* est f°r our opinion on the &gt;*» May a Fublic utility company enter into valid contracts with ind, v ,&lt;iual customers for lighting, heating or power service for a period of years at stipulated rates which rates may later appear discriminatory when compared with rates charged other customers using like amounts of electric current, gas, or whatever puLlic service product is involved. The rule is, of course, welL established that a public utility company, even in the absence of statute, must serve the public without discrimina - tion This means, in general that the rates must be uniform to all users of the same class or whose use is substantially of the same kind and character. Under this rule, it is lawful to group users for power, for lighting purposes, commercial users, industrial users, residential users etc. in seperate classes. • . Contracts with cutomers extending over a protracted period are not uncommon. From our investigation of the authorities, it appears that such contracts may open up a new classification for rate-making purposes. That is to .say, that there is enough distinction between the sale and service under a long time arrangement and that under a month to month arrangement to substantiate a different rate schedule It further appears that even if such contract may later seem to be "dis - criminatory as applied to rate schedules later in force, the contract </seg>
            <seg id="p498">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL as between the parlies will be binding until set aside by seme lawfully constituted rate-making' body or by other users who can show direct injury arising from such contract due to inadequate supply of service, reduced efficiency in service, or the like. In Blackwood Coal and Coke Co. v. Old Dominion Power Co., 144 S. E. (Va) 439, it was held that reasonable contracts for the sale of cur - rent may be made "subject to the sovereign power of state to prescribe and enforce reasonable rates." In Warmack v. Mayor Stave Co, 132 Ark. 173, 2 JO S. W. 799, it was held: "The principle that the company must supply all impartially and without discrimination does not prevent it from entering into reasonable arrange'ments or agreements with its customers growing out of special circumstances. Dillon on Municipal Corporations (5th Ed.) Vol. 3, Sec 1317, p. 2207." The court in that case mentions the possibility of later inability to serve other inhabitants and. therefore granted a writ of mandamus re - quiring the company to turn on the current in conformity with the con - tract rather than an order of specific performance of the contract. The Warmack case is cited and the rule therein is approved in Twin City Co. v. Harding Glass Co., 283 U. S. 353, in which the Supreme Court of the United States (Butler, J.) held: "Public utilities may enter into reasonable arrangements with their. customers when warranted by special circumstances." "It is only because of the dominant public interest that one who has had the benefit of performance by the other party will be permitted to avoid his own promise." This rule was reiterated in the very recent case of Ireland v. Craggs, (C. C. A., 8th Cir.), 56 F. (2d) 785. The sovereign rate-making power inherent in the state (delegated, if the legislature so desires, to the municipality or other political sub - division) to abrogate such contracts is especially illustrated in the rule announced in McQuillan on Municipal Corporations (2nd Ed.) Sec. 1878. Vol. 4, p. 954, as follows: "Contracts between a public service corporation and private consumers as to. rates for the supply furnished are subject to modification by the municipality without impairing the obliga - tion of contracts." </seg>
            <seg id="p499">OPINIONS The author cites as his authority Knoxville Water Co. v. Knoxville, 189 U. S. 434. (See also Market St. Ry. Co. v. Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co, 6 F. (2d) G33, €35, citing cases). It appears to us, therefore that if a given long-term contract is reasonable in its provisions, is such as is offered to other customers in the same situation, and does not violate any franchise ordinance, or statute regarding rates, such contract is and remains valid, subject to be abrogated only under the piinciples above discussed. 2nd: You ask our opinion as to whether a school board (presum - ably in a district governed by Article 25 of Chapter 79, Comp. St., 1929) is required to advertise for bids in installing a natural gas heating system in the school building at a cost exceeding $500.00 Section 79-2517 provides: ■ • "AH accounts shall be audited by the secretary, appr.-ived „• by a committee, to be styled the committee on claims, and no expenditure greater than two hundred dollars shall be voted by the board except in accordance with the provisions of a written contract; nor shall any money be appropriated out of the school fund except on a recorded affirmative vote of the majority of of all members of the board . . . ." We find no other statutory limitation on the general powers of the board (Sees. 79-2501, 79-2502, 79-2522) which would prevent them from entering into the contract contemplated, if funds are available therefor.

SCHOOL DISTRICT— TAX— LIABILITY OF FAMILY WHERE CHILD - REN TEMPORARILY TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER DISTRICT July 20, 1932. Hon. Charles W. Taylor, State Superintendent, Lincoln, Nebraska. . Dear Sir: You call attention to an opinion heretofore written by this de- </seg>
            <seg id="p500">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL parttnent relative to a temporary transfer for school purposes of pupils from the school district in York County in which the village of Gresham is situated to a rural school district in Seward County and you say "We have been confronted with a similar situation, involv - ing a transfer from a town district to a rural district, but in this situation there are no pupils of high school age. Shall we imply from your opinion of June 5th 1930, that by transferring . from the town of Gresham to a rural district in Seward County that a family could escape altogether any tax for the support of a high school?" ■ In answer to the question you ask I will say that in my opinion where children are transferred ttmporaiily for school purposes from a district in which a high school is maintained to a rural school district the property of the children's parents located in the high school district from which the transfer is made does not become liable to the county free high school tax. The fact is a temporary transfer of children for school purposes from one district to another does not have the effect of changing the residence of the children to the district to which they are transferred temporarily for school purposes. Thus it is said "It shall be the duty of the county superintendent to see that the children or wards are enumerated in the adjoining dis - trict and. not in the district of their residence." (79-2101). The transfer of' taxes and of the children for school purposes only lasts for one year unless an extension is asked for each year and in case no request is made for the extension of the time of the transfer the law provides that ... "The taxes of the parent or guardian and the real estate shall again be placed in the district of their residence." (79-2101). It follows that where children are transferred temporarily for school purposes from a high school district to a rural school district they do not cease to be residents of the high school district from which the transfer is made in. my opinion and inasmuch as no levy can be made on taxable property situated in a district in which an appoved four year high school is maintained (See 79-902) I do not know of any statutory authority, for: making a levy upon property situated in such. a district for the county free high school tuition fund even though because of a special statutory provision such property is not taxed for one year in the district to which it belongs but in an adjoining district which maintains no high school. </seg>
            <seg id="p501">OPINIONS '■ ' ■'. ■■ ■ Tl. is office was not advised at the time our former opinion was written involving a temporary transfer from the. district in which the village of Gresham is situated that the county of York had levied a tax for free high school purposes upon the property whcse taxes had been temporarily transferred to an adjoining rural school district. Of course, if such property was lawfully subject to a free high school tax, it would follow that the high school tuition of children residing thereon would be payable out of such tax. As I have already stated, however this office is of the opinion that such property is not subject to a county free high schocl tax. Sincerely yours, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General, By GEORGE W. AYRES, Assistant Attorney General. PUBLIC UTILITIES— GAS COMPANIES— DUTY TO GIVE SERVICE August 10, 1932. Mr. Harry P. Cato, Valley, Nebraska. . Dear Sir: This is in answer to your recent inquiry asking our opinion whether you can compel the Northern Gas Pipe Line Co. to serve you with gas. .You state that you live outside the city limits but are on a public highway along which the gas line runs. It appears that the company has refused you service on the ground that they do not sell gas to anyone tlong their pipe lines ''unless the company has constructed the pipe line across the premises of the applicant." We do not regard this reason as invalid, however it is a serious question whether ycu can compel a piivate connection unless you are ready to meet reasonable requirements of the company as to the expense of such connection which may be very large as the connection must be made from a high pressure main. There is 'considerable confusion in the law as to the status of these companies which appear to have acquired rights of eminent domain as common carriers. Under the provisions of Sections 75-1101 to 75-1106, Comp. St.. 1929, as common carriers they are required to furnish pipe line carriage to persons offering gas for transportation. It is a matter of common knowledge that such service is probably not demanded by anyene and could not be demanded by anyone in this state (except. </seg>

Dear Sir: This is in reply to your recent letter concerning the power of em - inent domain of a gas line company under the statutes of this state. The sections you refer to are now published as Sees. 75-1101 to 75-1107. Considerable confusion has arisen in the construction of these sec - tions by reason of their denomination of such companies v.s "common carriers'*. No doubt the legislature meant public utilities or public service corporations. At any rate such companies are exercising the right of eminent domain in this state under these sections and the sec - tions hereinafter mentioned. Section 75-1101 describes this class of corporations as "any company, corporation or association, formed or created for the purpose of transporting, transmitting, or conveying crude oil, petroleum or the products thereof, or gases, from one ppint in the state of Nebraska to another point in the state of Nebraska for a con - sideration are hereby declared to be common carriers," etc. Section 75-1 1W), Comp. St., 1929, enacted several years later than the sections above mentioned, provides for like exercise of the power of eminent domain by corporations described as "any company, cor - poration or association . formed or created for the purpose of trans - porting or conveying crude oil, petroleum or other products thereof in interstate commerce through or across the state of Nebraska". These companies are also referred to in Section 75-1110 as "common carriers herein -defined".

Allison, "The Laurel Advocate", Laurel, Nebraska. Bear Sir: In your letter of August 14, 1931, you inquire: "Supposing that the people of this town voted to sell to them (high line companies) the local plant and grant them a franchise in. which the rates were Specifically stated, would it be possible for the high line company at some later date, while the franchise was still in effect, to raise their rates by appli - cation to the railroad commission or any other body that might have jurisdiction? Would the rates stated in the franchise be compulsory on the company to whom the franchise is granted? Is the franchise a contract between the two parties or not and what would be action if the crmpany at any time did desire to raise their rates over those stated in the franchise." . The questions asked are so bound together as to the subject matter involved that we will attempt to answer them without reference to their order. Assuming that Laurel is a village as distinguished from a city of the second class, the pertinent statutory law is found in Section 17-427 and 17-440, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929, as follows: "In addition to the powers hereinbefore granted cities and villages under the provisions of this chapter each city and village may enact ordinances for the following purposes: (1879 • p. 210; 1881 p. 172; 1883 p. 117; 1885 p. 162; 1887 p. 291; Ann. 8912; Comp. 1788; R. S. 1313, 5105; C. S. 1922, 4278.)" </seg>

These sections are practically identical to those formerly relating to l.ke powers of second-class cities in this state. Therefore, the decision of our Supreme Court in the case of City of University Place v Lincoln Gas and Electric Light Co., 109 Neb. 370, 191 N. W. 432 (1922) may be regarded as authority on part of the questions you present. That case - &gt;n an opinion, by Judge Redick, ably reviews several of the leading cases in this county and holds: ■ "=»aing "By Section 1708, Comp. St. 1909, set forth in the opinion, a city of. the second class not having power to regulate rates had power to contract for the furnishing of gas to the city and swvice " * 8nd flX therei " a maximum for such ''■' "An ordinance reciting 'that, in consideration of the rights and privileges granted .herein, the grantees shall have a right to charge not in excess of $1.50 per 1,000 cubic feet of gas • etc which is accepted by the company, constitutes a contract the • obligation of which may not be impaired by either party." The court, however, left undecided the specific question you raise as bv so 6 P ° Wer w^ t ta } e tO "^ in ' thr ° Ugh direct le^laUve action or by some regulatory body, and abrogate the franchise contract in so far as it attempts to fix rates. The court said in this connection: "Whether or not the state, by the exercise of its paramount authority to regulate rates which may be charged by public utility corporations, may intervene upon a showing that the decided^ by thC C ° ntraCt " unreasona ble or confiscatory, not onpn i W^- e deci8i0 "' "Ending alone, seems to leave the question open m this state, we have other decisions by our Supreme Court that are more definite on this point. For example, in the caHe of l££ qujs v. Polk County Telephone Co., 100 Neb. 140, 158 N. W. 927, itwas </seg>
            <seg id="p505">OPINIONS "Unless expressly authorized and empoweied by the legis - lature so to do, a municipal corporation has no power by con - tract to deprive the state of the right of regulation of rates of a public service corporation." "A contract or agreement made in a franchise ordinance by which the maximum rates to be charged by a telephone company for the use of telephones by the inhabitants of the city are determined is made subject to the right of regulation." "Since the adoption of the constitutional amendment creat - ing the state rrilway crmmission and the passage of the law spe - cify ing the duties of the commissi m, that body has power to regulate the rates charged for the use of telephones in cities of the second class." The. federal courts, for the most part, follow the decisions of the state courts in construing state constitutional and statutory provisions as applied to the questions raised. Therefore the decisions of our own Supreme Court will, in all likelihood govern in any suit in the federal courts involving these questions. We would say' that the weight of opinion in this country and, we believe, the view of our own courts may be summed, up in four rules, as follows: 1st: That if the power to contract as to rates has been granted by the legislature to the municipality, a contract entered into between the municipality and a public utility company will be valid and bind - ing as between the parties, whether or not the rates later prove ex - cessive or inadequate. 2nd: That it is legally possible for the state to thus limit or sus - pend its sovereingty in the exercise of its police power if the term involved is not unreasonable in point of time. 3rd: That suspension of such police power will be j&gt;iven strict con - struction in favor of the state. 4th: Whether the state may abrogate or terminate such contractual provisions -by later legislation or regulation through public utility commissions will be determined by the particular constitutional and statutory provisions in each state, as construed by the highest courts thereof; and; in the absence of such construction, the federal courts will make their own construction, resolving every doubt in favor of the inherent or reserved power of the state. . </seg>

That is to say, if in your franchise contract you make the very existence and life cf the grant depend upon the rate or maximum rate you fix in the grant, the courts will have difficulty in sus'sining a continuance of such life or term in the face of an increased rate from whatever source such in - e'reased rate may be authorized. As held in the university case and by the federal court of this circuit in the case of Nebraska Gas &amp; Elec - tric Co. V. Stromsburg, 2 F (2d) 520, the contract as between the parties will be binding. Therefore, if the continued existence of the maximum rate is necessary to the continued existence of the life of the grant, there would seem to be no good reason why the courts, after an increase over such maximum rate should force the village to continue on a bargain expressly repudiated in the grant itself. Since, a village in this state has now no power to regulate rates of public utilities and *rince there is now no pu! Lie regul-tory body in' charge of this matter, it would seem that the fixing of maximum rales in any proposed franchise to a private utility company is alto - gether advisrble for the protection of the people's rights. Whether, therefore, it is possible for the state to abrogate those rates is at pres - ent an academic question. At least temporary protection is afforded and, as above suggested, it is altogether possible that conditioning the life of the grant on the continued existence of such maximum rates may, for all practical purposes, prove to be an absolute protection to the village against excessive rates. Legally, of course, in case rates are not fixed in the franchise any excessive rate is subject to attack in the courts, but since the courts do not fix rates, their power is limited to simply annulling' such excessive rates. Practically, therefore, especially in the case of a village with limited funds and experience in such matters, it will find its chief protection in the express terms of the franchise it grants. We would suggest that your village engage the services of some reputable lawyer experienced in matters of this kind. Very truly yours, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General, By L. R. NEW KIRK, Assistant Attorney General. </seg>

Woolever, Secretary, York Mutual Building and Loan Ass'n., York. Nebraska. :• Dear Sir: I This is answer to your letter of August 25, regarding the Fed - eral Home Loan Bank system as it will affect the -Building and Loan associations in this state. We do not believe that under our present laws it is legally pos - sible for a Nebraska Building and Loan association to subscribe for and hold stock in the bank. The associations will have to deal with the bank as non-member institutions until the Legislature can pass a law at the coming session authorizing stock purchases. As to the pledging of loans to the bank, the fact that they are non-negotiable under our statute does not mean that they are not assignable for collateral purposes. However, the authorities of the bank may seriously object to the non-negotiable character of the pa - per. That is a matter that will have to be worked out and oh which we are not yet advised.

Dear Sir: This is in answer to your recent letter requesting our opinion on the legal liability or duty of the village of Bancroft to refund taxes paid by local banks for the years 1926, 1926 and 1927, which taxes were later held void by the Supreme Court. You slate that the taxes were paid without protest and no claim for refund was filed with the </seg>
            <seg id="p509">OPINIONS village authorities before the ccurt decision hclding the tcxes void. We take it that the decision referred to was the case of State ex rel Spillman v. Ord State Bank (Valley County, claimant), 117 Neb. 189, June 13 1928, wherein the Supteme Court held the intangible tax law of 1925 (Laws 1925, Ch. 165) unconstitutional. We agree with you that morally, at least, the village has thus ob - tnined taxes it was not entitled to, but we are constrained to advise that legally the village is not liable to refund the taxes. The refunding of taxes is a matter now governed strictly by the provisions of Section 77-1923, Comp. St.. 1929. That statute is too long to set out in full in this letter. It covers two main kinds of cases, first, those in which taxes are levied against property not subject to oe taxed and those in which taxes have been twice assessed against the same property; and second, taxes invalid because assessed for an illegal or unauthorized purpose or invalid for any other reason than those above set out. As to the first class of refunds, it is necessary that the tax be paid under protest, and written claim for refund be filed with the county board within thirty days thereafter. As to the second class, in which the case you present seems to fall, protest at time of payment is not required, but written claim for refund must be filed by the taxpayer with the treasurer of the county, city, village, school district, within 30 day thereafter; and if the tax is not refunded within 90 dt&gt;ys, the taxpayer may bring suit for the recovery thereof. As above stated, this section has repeatedly been- held to afford the only remedy for the recovery of taxes paid with or without pro - test. Darr V. Dawson County, 93 Neb. 93. 139 N.

City National Bank of Lincoln v. School District of the City of Lincoln, 121 Neb. 213, 236 N. W. 616, decided in May, 1931, was a case in which the question you present was at issue. The plaintiff bank in that case had paid the intangible tax for the years 1925 and 1926. The bank made written demand upon the county treasurer within the time lequired by Section 77-1923, supra. The court held: "Such notice is not the notice to the treasurer of the dis - trict as contemplated by the statute." The court further said: "It is argued that at common law an unlawful tax could be </seg>
            <seg id="p510">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL recovered unless it was voluntarily paid. The evidence in this case is that the taxes in question were voluntarily pcid . . . Con - sequently, plaintiff is not entitled to recover under the com - mon law rule." The case illustrates the strength of the rules above oiscusscd. There the claim was denied, even though the demand for refund had been made within the statutory time on the ground that it. had not been made upon the school district treasurer, and though the county treasurer in Lancaster County is er officio collector of taxes for the school district. Your letter suggests that our supreme court has laid down a new rule in the case of Haarmann Vinegar &amp; Pickle Co. v. Douglas County, 241 N. W. (Neb.) 117, decided February 25, 1932. It is true that the court did say, "If a tax has been levied that is absolutely void, and has been paid, though voluntarily, the amount thereof may be re - covered with interest in an action for that purpose." We believe, however, that the facts in that case distinguish it from the usual case of refunding of illegal taxes. In that case, the plaintiff had purchased the property in question under an agreement whereby she was' required to pay the taxes for certain specified years. Her vendor held out the amount of these taxes, paid them directly to the holder of the tax sale certificate who surrendered it to the county treasurer, for cancellation. The tax thus paid was illegal in part. The court cities as its authority for the above holding the case of Wilson v. Butler County, 26 Neb. 676, 42 N. W. 891, which case was decided under authority of what is now Section 77-2030, which makes the county, the county treasurer and his bondsman liable to a pur - chaser at a tax sale where, "by mistake or wrongful act of the trea - surer or other officer, land has been sold on which no tax was due" or "sold in consequence of error in ' describing such land in the tax receipt." Although the court in the Haarman case does not mention Section 77-2030, we take it that the court had in mind the equitable doctrine of subrogation, to wit, that the owner of the land could step into the shoes of the purchaser of the tax title to the extent of that part of the tax which was void. At any rate, we are not prepared to say that </seg>

Taylor, State Superintendent, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of inquiry of the. 2nd instant, I will say that in my opinion you are right in assuming that from the decision in Brownlee v. School District of Lincoln, reported in 119 Neb. at page 868 thereof that a school distiict Would not be liable for injuries to a pupil, while the pupil was being transported to or from school in a bus owned by the district and operated by a driver hired by the district for that purpose. This conforms to the general rule- of law upon the subject. Thus it is said: "Inasmuch as school districts and other local school organ - izations are agencies or instrumentalities of the state, and, con - - sidered as corporations, are public or quasi-municipal in char - acter, it is the generally accepted rule, although there is some authority to the contrary, th&amp;t such a district, or ils directing board, as 'such, like other municipalities and the state itself, is not liable to persons injured by its nonf easance, nor is it lia - ble for injuries or loss resulting from its negligence, as for failure properly to construct a school building or to keep it in repair, or to maintain the school premises or equipment in a proper and safe condition, or to furnish safe and suitable means of conveyance for the transportation of pupils to and from school, or safely operate such conveyance." 66 C.

Inasmuch as the school district incurs no liability because of injury to the children even though such injury may be caused by the fault or negligence of the driver of the conveyance, this part of the policy rcaUy amcunts to nothing so far as affording protection to the child - ren is concerned. It may be that this form of policy insures the district against damage to the automobiles owned by it but this is not the kind of insurance which the law requires. Sincerely yours, C. A.

SUPP. 70-601 to 70-609). ■■.'.■ : September 3, 1932. Mr. Win. H. Wright, City Attorney, Scottsbluff, Nebraska. Dear Sir: This is in answer to your letter of recent date asking for our opin - ion on the following two matters: First: Are debentures issued by a municipality under initiative law- No. 324 (C. S. Supp., 1931, Sees. 70-601 to 70-609) general obligations of the city issuing the same? Answer: Debentures issued under Section 70-601 are not general obligations but are payable solely out of revenues from the plant or system. Under Section 70-603, the liability of the municipality on the debentures may, in our opinion, be limited strictly to the net revenues derived from the operation of the plant. Second: When a privately owned light and power plant has been appropriated under the condemnation proceedings provided in Article 7 of Chapter 19 Comp. St., 1929, can the city pay the amount of the appraisal by issuing debentures under the provisions of Section 70-603 C 5. Supp., 1931 (Initiative Law No. 324) instead of issuing bonds as set out in Section 19-705 of said condemnation statute? </seg>
            <seg id="p513">OPINIONS Answer: In our opinion the first few lines of Section 70-603 con - tain a full and complete answer to this question, to wit, "In lieu of the issuance of bonds or the levy of taxes as otherwise by law provided, and in lieu of any other lawful methods or means of providing for the payment of indebted - ness, any city . . . shall have the power and authority ... to provide for or to secure the payment of the cost," etc. The clear intent and purpose of this section is to furnish a com - plete and independent means of paying for "real or personal property necessary or. useful in its operation of any electric light and power plant," etc. Therefore the provisions of Section 19-705 that the "duly constituted authorities of any such city shall have the power and it shall be their duty to issue and sell bonds of any such city to pay the amount of such value and judgment" are not now the exclusive requirements in financing such condemnation.

OSTEOPATHS— CHIROPRACTORS— RIGHT TO TREAT BY HEAT, LIGHT AND ELECTRICAL THERAPEUTICS October 8, 1932. Mr. James W. Johnson, Box 153, Neligh, Nebr. J Dear Sir: In your letter of September 27th you inquire as follows: "Will you please quote me the laws and amendments which - particularly refer to or restrict the use of mechanical devices of heat therapeutics or electrical heat or light therapeutics which may or may not be used upon patients by healing artists, or doctors of Chiropractic or Osteopathy. "And in your opinion who would be restricted from using such instruments for healing or elimination of diseases, or al - lowed to use them. </seg>
            <seg id="p514">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "Color lights are being used in some cases, but I would like to know is there any restrictions by law against their being used by anyone besides an M. D. for the benefit of humanity." The right of practitioners of the several branches of the healing arts to use mechanical devices or heat, electrical and light therapeutics is determined, not by direct statutes on the subject, but by the lim - itations within which the law confines the practice of each branch of the healing arts. Physicians, of course, are given practically unlimited scope as to the methods they may employ in treating diseases. Osteo - paths are supposed to follow generally their system of treatment which places the chief emphasis on the structural integrity of the body mech - anism as being the most important factor for maintaining health. How - ever, Section 71-1705, Compiled Statutes, 1929, provides that every li - censed osteopath shall have the right to practice osteopathy in all its branches "as taught in the osteopathic colleges recognized by the American Osteopathic Association." Inasmuch as these colleges now teach practically everything that is taught in regular schools of med - icine, there is little practical difference between Osteopaths and regular physicians as to what they can practice or the methods they can employ. Chiropractors, however, aTe on a somewhat different footing. Section 71-1101, Compiled Statutes, 1929, defines Chiropractors to be people "who treat human ailments by the adjustment by hand of any articulation of the spine." This seems to limit Chiropractors to that particular method of treating diseases so that use. of heat, light, or electric therapy, x-rays, etc. for treatment of disease by Chiropractors is unlawful. Of course persons not licensed to practice any branch of the healing arts have no right to treat diseases by this manner or any other, except that Section 71-1402, Compiled Statutes, 1929 provides as follows: "The proceeding section shall not. be construed to include the following classes of persons; 1. Persons rendering gratuit - ous services in the case trf an emergency. 2. The administration of ordinary household remedies. 3.- The members of any church practicing their religious tenets, provided they do not prescribe or administer drugs or medicine nor perform surgical or physical operations nor assume the title of or hold themselves out to be a physician or surgeon and provided further they shall not be exempt from the quarantine of this state. 4. Students of med - icine and surgery who have completed at least two years' study in an accredited school and who, while in school, gratuitously prescribe for and treat disease under the supervision of a licen- - sed physician who is a member of the faculty of their school. 5.

Board of Supervisors to fill the vacancy in this office, caused by the resignation of the Clerk at that time. Naturally I am a candidate for the office to fill the unexpired term.

There seems to be considerable difference of opinion . on this question, and I would be pleased to have your view in the matter." . ■ . . In answer to the question you ask, I will say that in my opinion the person elected Clerk of the District Court of your county can take the office as soon as he. qualifies after the election. " I base this opinion up - on the fact that the election is to fill a vacancy and not for a full term and that the unexpired term exceeds one year. If the unexpired term had not exceeded one year at the time the vacancy occurred then your appointment would have been for the bal - ance of the term and the party elected would not be entitled to take the office until the first Thursday after the First Monday in January 1933, but in that case he would have been elected for a regular term instead of to fill a vacancy.- As it is the election will be to fill a vacancy and not for the regular term. • - </seg>

It was necessary, of course, when the vacancy occurred in your county that some one should be appointed to fill the vacancy until it could be filled at the general election, -which was to be held six months thereafter and the county board very properly made an appointment to fill the vacancy until that time and the term of such an appointee is governed by the provisions of 32-1706, Compiled Statutes which reads in part as follows: "Appointments under the provisions of this chapter shall be in writing and continue until the next election at which the • vacancy can be filled, and until a successor is elected and qual - ified, and be filed with the secretary of state ♦ * • Very truly yours, C.

Sherwood, Attorney -at-Law, Orleans, Nebraska. ■ Dear Mr. Sherwood: This is in answer to your kind letter of October 31, 1932, in which you state and inquire: "We will vote in this county at the general election for or against the present township organization. It has been a. mat - ter of much discussion as to how a change from the present to a commissioner form of government will' affect the standing township levies. For instance, we now have a standing town - ship levy for the support of library, band and cemetery and -I . would certainly appreciate your advises as to how these levies can be continued under the commissioner form of government. </seg>
            <seg id="p517">OPINIONS 1 will thank you to advise me concerning this matter, if pos - sible during this week." The pertinent statute appears to be Section 26-279, Comp. St 1929 reading as follows: "When township organization shall be discontinued in any county, it shall be the duty of the town clerk in each town in said county, as soon as the board of county commissioners are appointed and qualified, to deposit with the county clerk of the county all town records papers and documents pertaining to the affairs of such town, and to certify to him the amount of indebtedness of such town outstanding at the time of such dis - continuance, and the board shall have full and complete power to settle all the unfinished business of the towns as fully as . might have been done by the town itself, and dispose of any - and all property belonging to such towns, the proceeds of which, after paying all indebtedness, shall be disposed of by the county board for the benefit of the taxable inhabitants thereof by their crediting all Unexpended balances of said towns to such fund or funds as they in their discretion shall deem for the best in - terests of such county, and it shall be their duty, at such time as shall be provided by law, to levy, a tax upon the taxable property of such towns to pay any unliquidated indebtedness it may have outstanding. Since this statute in terms authorizes the county board succeeding township organization to do for the inhabitants of the discontinued township any unfinished business pertinent to said township that the said township could have done while still in existence, we are of the opinion that the county board succeeding township organization can ad - minister and continue standing township levies in the old township territory for a library, band and cemetery that are going township enterprises at the time of discontinuance of township organization.

            <seg id="p518">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ELECTIONS-BALLOT-USE OF PRINTED STICKER ON November 3, 1932. Hon. George A. Munn, ,County Attorney, Ord. Nebraska. I .. .. . . : • / Dear Sir: At the request of Bert N. Hardenbrook of your city, we are here - by expressing to you our views on various questions connected with the use of stickers for voting purposes at the forthcoming election. We inclose herewith a copy of our previcus cpini-n thrt a voter may vote for a person by attaching to the ballot a sticker containing the name of the person voted for and the office which the voter is voting for said person to fill. The source from which the voters de - rive the stickers which they thus use, whether from the persons thus voted for or from other sources, is regarded by us as immaterial to the validity of such sticker votes and the validity of the ballot to which such stickers are attached. The election law contemplates that there should be on the official ballot separate, distinct and independent lines and spaces for the writing in or alternative sticking on of names by voters (Sec. 32-504 Schedule A, 1931 Supp.)/The law also thereby contemplates that the voter will perform his writing in or sticking on of names in the ap - propriate space and on the appropriate lines so that no other name or Hem of printed matter on the ballot will be covered, concealed, cancelled or obliterated. Still, if the voter covers and conceals with his sticker the printed name or names of another candidate or other cadidates on the ballot for the same office, we see no legal reason why the election officers should reject as invalid either the sticker vote or the whole ballot to which the sticker vote is thus defectively at - tached. It seems clear that the persons whose names on the ballot were thus covered np would not be prejudiced by this irregularity because they would not have received the particular votes indicated by such stickers in any event. It may be that such a defect is a defacement or spoliation of the ballot; but where the voter's intention can be gathered from the ballot, the question of spoliation is for the voter and not for the judges (Sees. 32-716 and 32-911, Comp. St., 1929). We are also of the belief that *ny variance between. the sticker description and the ballot description of the office for which the voter is making a sticker vote, would not of itself invalidate the sticker vote or the ballot to which such vote is attached, unless the person </seg>
            <seg id="p519">OPINIONS and office for which the sticker vote was cast could not be ascertained in counting with reasonaLle certainty. The same wculd, in our opinion, be tiue as to any surplusage on the sticker which did not conceal or confuse the voter's intent as disclosed by the sticker. We are also of the opinion that a person's defeat as a candidate for an office at the primary does not prevent electors from effectively voting for such person at the general election by writing or sticking his name on the general election ballot as a candidate for such office (State v. Penrod, 102 Neb. 734). In conclusion it seems to us that these conclusions are required by the long line of Nebraska Supreme Court decisions holding that elec - tion laws are liberally construed in favor of the voter and that no vote or ballot from which the voter's intention can be derived with reason - able certainty, should be rejected as invalid (Bingham v. Broadwell, 73 Neb. 605; Griffith v. Bonawitz, 73 Neb. 622; Gauvreau v. Van Patten 83 Neb. 64; State v. Russell, 34 Neb. 116; White v. Slama, 89 Neb. 65- State v. Sheets, 119 Neb. 145; State v. Marsh, 120 Neb. 287). To the same effect is section 32-911, providing in part that "when a ballot is sufficiently plain to gather therefrom a part of the voter's intention, it shall be the duty of the judges of election to count such part."

Dear Sir: This is in answer to your request for an opinion on the obligation of the State Auditor under the provisions of Section 39-232. This sec - tion provides for filing in the office of the county clerk of each county and in your office of monthly certificates of the State Board of Irri - gation, Highways and Drainage, now the Department of Public Works, showing the total amount of money that each county is to receive from the Federal Aid Road Act of July .11, 1916, as amended by H. R. 13308, 1919, together with a like amount of money from the State Aid Road </seg>
            <seg id="p520">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL f U r n fqi7^Q P ™ ed f ° 1 \ bySeCUOn 5&gt; Chapter 185 ' LawS of Nebraska for 1917 (39-1/05) and the provisions of this act; such certificate (after setting aside five per centum for engineering and administration) shall also show the total amount of money available in each projected dis - trict for the biennium ending March 31, 1920, as provided by Section 6 Chapter 186, Laws of Nebraska for 1917 (39-1706)" etc. It appears that no such certificate has been filed for many years last past, and that the department contends that the section is ob - solete being superceded by subsequent legislation. In our opinion, we do not think the certificates mentioned in this section are now required and believe the entire section now to be ob - solete and unenforceable. Our reasons are as follows: First: This section was passed as Section 2 of Chapter 255 Laws "L 1919 ;..&gt; T B at cbapter was essentially an appropriation act for the State Aid Road Fund".. Chapter 185, Laws of 1917 had created that fund and had made appropriations therefore for the years 1917 and 1918. Careful reading of said Chapter 255, Laws of 19l'j, discloses that that act was complete in itself and deals with current appropriations of the state and federal governmente. This interpretation is borne out by the fact that, so far as we have been able to find, the "State Aid Road Fund" seems to have disappeared, so far as that particular designation was concerned. That fund was derived from general taxes. We fail to find any section in our present statutes which carry forward Section 1 of said Chapter 255, Laws of 1919, in any form. Second: The gasoline tax law (Sec. 66-411, C. S. 1929), first pas - sed in 1925 (Laws of 1925. Ch. 172), was an enactment complete in itself which created the Gasoline Highway Fund, since divided into several funds. The act contains no reference to the old "State Aid Road Fund ' and requires no such certificates as are called for in the above mentioned "State Aid Road Fund" law. Only a part of the Gasoline Highway Fund, that part contained in subsection (c) of Sec - tion 66-411, C. S. 1929, may be allocated to the counties. Third: Practical construction by officers and departments charged with the administration and disbursement of the several divisions of the Gasoline Highway Fund over a period of years, to the effect that that fund is created, disbursed and accounted for in a manner entirely disassociated from the bid State Aid Road Fund and the certificates in - cident thereto, is entitled to great weight and we are unable to say that construction is wrong, as a matter of law. </seg>
            <seg id="p521">OPINIONS Fourth: Legislative appropriations of funds from the gasoline tax and federal aid, while they may not be taken to be absolute legislative ratification of executive construction of the laws concerning the Gas - oline Highway Fund, are, at least, persuasive in determining what the correct answer to your inquiry is. Fifth: The Federal Highway Act and miscellaneous federal laws incident thereto which amend and supercede the act of July 11, 1916, practically eliminate the counties from any supervision and control in the administration and distribution of federal aid funds to the states for highway purposes. See Chaps 1 and 2, U. S. C. A. Title 23, and amend - ments thereto. As to 5% engineering expenses concerning which you also ask our. opinion, the situation is somewhat the same as that of the cer - tificates to your office above discussed. Section 39-1704, C. S. 1929, a part of Chapter 185, Laws of 1917, above mentioned limits engineer - ing expenses to 5% of the construction cost of the work. This section refers to appropriations to the state aid road fund and funds appor - tioned to Nebraska under the federal act of July 11, 1916. We find no statutes making mention of engineering expense so far as the Gasoline Highway Fund is concerned, except' the appropriations act of 1931, Laws 1931, p. 11, which contains an item "Salaries and Wages (from gas tax) 1.6% of total construction, estimated .... $260,000". . . We understand this, item, as heretofore construed by the Depart - ment of Public Works and your office, covers salaries and wages of the office force of the department, and all preliminary engineering ex - pense down to the time of actual starting of construction work on the various projects; and that engineering expense on the project is charged to the project and becomes a part of the cost of the same, in which the state, as to state and federal highways, receives the fed - eral aid allocated to that project. - We do not see that you have any other or different responsibility concerning engineering expenses on these projects than you have as to any other item of expense incident thereto.

            <seg id="p522">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL CITIES -AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE FOR RELIEF OF POOR November 8, 1932. Mr. R. P. Kepler, City Attorney, Sidney, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Kepler: ; ' This is in answer to your letter of November 5, 1932, You ask seyerrl questions relative to your city's authority to provide for the relief of the poor of the city from the public funds of the city. Upon this subject we are pleased to inform you as follows: It appears that in 1930 Sidney had 3,306 people. In the absence of any authentic information to the contrary, we presume that your city has no more than 3,306 people at this time. If so, it is a city of the second class. As to such cities, we regret to say that we fail to find any statute authorizing their governing bodies to contribute directly from their public funds to the relief of the poor of such cities. Instead the pertinent and express provision of the law is that the county board is vested with the entire and exclusive superintendence of the county's poor as such (Sec. 68-104, Comp. St., 1929). In relieving the poor by providing for their employment upon pub - lic improvements made by the city, the city can, of course, go no farther than the express limitations on its power to incur indebtedness borrow money, levy taxes and issue warrants for such purposes, will enable it to go. Since you ask no questions as to what these limitations are, we assume either that you are as familiar with them as we are or that they are as acessible to you as they are to us. Before advising the council as to how far they can go in providing for public im - provements to be made by the city, it is. of course, always necessary in each case to consult the statute for the law's express limitations on the power to b&amp;rrow money, incur indebtedness, levy taxes and issue warrants for each proposed improvement. It seems that legislation is required not only to empower second - class cities and villages to relieve their own poor from the public funds of such cities and villages, but also to provide as far as possible for the readjustment and balancing of municipal budgets to the depression scale of values. . Sincerely yours. C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General By CLIFFORD L. REIN, Assistant Attorney General. </seg>

Dear Mr. Clark: I have your letter of the 3rd with reference to an opinion given by me under date of November 12, 1931, on the question of sheriff's fees and mileage, and note your question as follows: "The question now comes up whether he is entitled to mileage or only actual expense for transporting children to the reform school, that is the Industrial School at Kearney and Geneva. Strictly speaking, these are educational institu- - tions rather than penal institutions." As pointed out in my former letter, the rule is fundamental that the sheriff must be able to point to some statutory provision authorizing mileage to be entitled to mileage in a given case.- Section 33-120, Comp. St., 1929, authorizes the payment of mileage to the sheriff for each mile actually and necessarily travelled but this applies, in my opinion, only to travel necessary to the performance of his. official duties. If it could be said that it is the official duty of the sheriff to take children to the industrial schools at Kearney and Geneva I would say that he is entitled to mileage for such services, but it appears from an examination of Section 83-1107 that the court may designate an officer other than the sheriff to perform this service. I find no pro - vision that such officer shall receive mileage but Section 83-1107 pro - vides that the expense of conveying any boy so committed to the state industrial school shall be at the expense of the county. The same is true as to girls committed to the industrial school at Geneva (Sec 83 - 1204, Comp. St., 1929). . I am of the opinion, therefore, that when the sheriff transports children to the industrial schools at Kearney or Geneva he is not acting in his official capacity as sheriff but simply as an officer of the court for the execution of it orders, and that he is entitled to be reimbursed for his actual expenses, but is not entitled to mileage. Very truly . yours, . G. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General, By HOMER L. KYLE, Assistant Attorney General. </seg>

Dear Sir: - . You submit to this department for answer a letter received by you from Mr. Allan F. Black of the Broken Bow bar who makes a statement of fact and asks questions thereon as follows: "On April 22, 1929, the municipality, city of Broken Bow, Nebraska, purchased from the Fairbanks Morse &amp; Company cer - tain machines and electric light improvements of the value of $54,160.00 under and by virtue of the terms of a certain contract of sale between the parties under that date. The terms of the contract make it a conditional sale contract on a deferred pay- - ment plan. The contract expressly and specifically states that the title and ownership of the machinery or material herein specified shall remain in the Fairbanks Morse &amp; Company until final payment therefore has been made in full as above pro - vided, and until final payment has been made of any other sums that may be due the company by the municipality . . . . • "The city has paid approximately one-third the amount due on the contract.

Are the machines and equipment covered by this con - tract assessable and taxable to the Fairbanks Morse &amp; Company at their actual value regardless of the amount paid on the con - tract. "2. Does Fairbanks Morse &amp; Company have any taxable interest whatever in the property and if so to what extent?" In answer to Mr. Black's questions I will say that in my opinion Fairbanks Morse &amp; Company are not now subject to a tax as the owner of the machines and equipment above mentioned. I take it although the said company may have retained by contract to said pro - perty, the city of Broken Bow is the equitable owner of same. It oc - curs to me that the interest of the company in said property is very similar to the interest of a mortgagee in chattels mortgaged to him to secure payment of a debt. I take it. that the company is probably subject to taxation some - where uppn the unpaid balance of the purchase price which the city of Broken Bow still owes it but that balance is not taxable in Broken Bow nor anywhere else in Custer County if I understand the facts right. I will add that even if said macl.ines and equipment were taxable to Fairbanks Morse &amp; Company I do not understand that they would be taxable to it in Custer County for I presume the company has no office in Custer County and I do not understand that the facts in this case constitute an exception to the general rule that personal property is usually taxable to its owner at the place of 1 is residence.

Mr. A. W. Storms, - City Attorney, Holdrege, Nebraska. Dear Sir: . . We have your letter of the 26th' in which you request our opinion </seg>
            <seg id="p528">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL as to whether it is proper to charge against a convicted defendant, as a part of the costs in a liquor prosecution, the expense of sending an officer to the capitol with a sample of the liquor to be analyzed by the state chemist. ' ' I have made a pretty thorough investigation of this question but have been unable to get much light from the authorities and published reports. I seriously doubt, however, if an item of expense such as this may properly be taxed as ccsts against one convicted of violation of the liquor laws. It is fundamental that no costs can be taxed except where author - ized by statute (15 C. J. 317, Sec. 788). Section 29-2208, Comp. St., 1929, makes it the duty of the court in every case of conviction of any person for a felony or misdemeanor to render judgement for the costs of prosecution against the person convicted. However, I do not understand the law to be that every item of ex - pense which the state may have incurred in prosecuting the defendant is a legitimate item of costs to be taxed against him. It has been held that no item of costs other than those provided by statute are allowable (15 C. J. 330 Sec. 823). Our Supreme Court held in the case of Biester v. State. 65 Neb. 276, 91 N. W. 416, that the court is vested with a large discretion in taxing costs against the defendant in a criminal case but that it can tax only such items as there was an actual, ap - parent or probable necessity for incurring. Under this holding a plausable argument could be made for. the allowance of costs covering the expense of having the liquor analyzed by the state chemist, but I doubt if the court intended to go that far. • My opinion is that only those items of expense for which a fee is provided by statute such, for example, as filing fees, witness fees, mileage, etc. are proper items to be included in the costs which may be taxed against the defendant. This appears to be the limit which the courts have set oh the items of cost which could properly be taxed against the defendant. The provisions of Section 53-135, Comp. St., 1929, seem to me to support this view, particularly the provision that "it shall be the duty of the county board of each county to pay all bills incurred or approved by the county attorney in said county for the detection and punishment of all violations of this act, and for all inquiries and proceedings of every nature for the purpose of disclosing evidence, making raids, searches and seizures under this act. And the county board shall make sufficient appropriations to cover all such bills and expenses so in - curred." Evidently the legislature did not regard the expense of se - securing evidence in a liquor case to be a legitimate item of costs and </seg>
            <seg id="p529">OPINIONS hence made provision for the payment of such expense by special appropriation by the county board.

Dear Mr. Felton: You refer to this department for opinion the question raised by Mr. Herbert W. Patterson, deputy county attorney of Scotts Bluft County as to whether a man who has been delivering uninspected oil to dealers in that county for furnace fuel can be successfully prosecu - ted under the provisions of Sections 66-302 and 60-308, Comp. St, 1929. Section 66-302, provides in part "The department cf agriculture shall inspect and test all gasoline, kerosene or other products of petrcleum manufactured, sold or. offered for sale in this state for illuminating, heating or power purposes; provided, however, this article shall not be construed to require the inspection of crude petroleum, or any product of petroleum used exclusively for fuel or lubrica - ting purposes." Section 66-308, provides: "No person whether vendor, manufacturer or dealer, shall sell or attempt to sell or deliver to any person in this state any of the oils mentioned in this article before having the same inspected as herein provided." ■ ■ .. It is true, as Mr. tatterson points out, that there is a seeming con - tradiction in the provisions of Section 66-302, in that it first provides that all gasoline, kerosene or other products of petroleum manufac - tured or sold for heating purposes shall be inspected and immediately afterwards provides that crude petroleum or any products of petroleum used exclusively for fuel shall not be required to be inspected. In construing statutes containing apparently conflicting provisions the courts^ill so construe them as to harmonize Iheir several provisions if it is possible and I believe that such a construction can reasonably be placed on the language used in Section 66-302. While the .language employed in Section 66-302 is rather awkward, it seems to me that its meaning, and the intention of the legislature </seg>
            <seg id="p532">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL which it attempts to express, is perfectly clear, namely, that all gas - oline, kerosene or ether petroleum products which may be used for illuminating, heatinic or power purposes must be inspected, except crude petroleum and petroleum products which can not be used for any purpose except fuel or a lubricant. If it were intended by the legislature that any. petroleum product that could be used for fuel need not be inspected, it would nullify the entire act, as it is possible to use any such product for fuel purposes. It seems clear to me that the legislature intended to exclude from the necessity of inspection crude petroleum or any petroleum that can only be used for fuel or lubricating purposes, but that all other products must be inspected. If, in the case under consideration, the oil sold or delivered is of. such quality that it may be used for illuminating or power purposes as well as fuel, I believe it should be inspected, and that its sale and delivery is an offense under Section 66-308, even though it is sold for use as a fuel. It is the quality or character of the oil and not the use to which it may be put by the purchaser which determines whether it must be inspected or not. . Very truly yours, C. A.

"The general fund of the school district is a continuing fund upon which warrants may be issued, and if not paid for want of funds they may be registered under the provisions of the warrant act and paid in the order of their registration. upon the accumulation of money in the fund upon which they are drawn. "Mandamus will not compel school district officers to ap - propriate and set apart the entire revenue of the district for general purposes to the payment of registered warrants, if the effect will be to closs the schools and deprive the children of the district of a common school education, but will require such officers to set apart so much of said fund as is necessary to maintain a common school for the shortest time provided by law and at the least possible expense, and use the remainder of the fund in payment of such warrants in the order of their registration." • Sincerely yours, C.

The language of the law is not very clear as to just what con - stitutes the practice of cosmetology in the sense that it can only </seg>
            <seg id="p534">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL be practiced by a registered cosmetologist. Section 71-2101, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929, says: "After January 1, 1930, no person shall practice or attempt to practice cosmetology, hair dressing or beauty culture without a certificate of registration as a registered cosmetologist" etc. Section 71-2102 says: "The practice and teaching of cosmetology is denned to be and includes any or all work generally and usually included in the term 'hair-dressing* and 'beauty-culture,' and performed in so-called hair-dressing and beauty shops patronized by women and children." I am of the opinion, however, that the courts would never con - strue this law to prohibit the occasional giving of a finger wave. or performing a similar service, . without compensation of any kind, for a friend or member of the family. A strict construction of the statutes quoted above would mean that a person could not legally brush his own hair or clean his finger nails, as both of these acts are. included in the term beauty culture and are commonly performed in beauty shops. Such an interpretation of the law would, of course, be ridiculous. It would also be ridiculous' to hold that a mother could not lawfuly trim the hair of her two - year-old baby merely because she was not a licensed barber or cos - metologist. . The aim of the cosmetology and barber laws is to protect the public from incompetent and unsanitary practitioners, and any law which attempts to go beyond this is unconstitutional and void. It seems to me that it is no concern of the. public if a person occasionally dresses the hair of a member of her family or a friend if no charge is made for the service. "Very truly yours, C. A.

Honorable Rudolph Tesar, 1408 South 13th Street, Omaha, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Tesar: Your letter of November 29th at hand in which you say: "You are no doubt aware that the next session of the Legis - lature will in all probability attempt to pass some measures toward the legalization of the srle af beer, that is, however, upon the assumption that our present Congress shall modify the Volstead Act at their short session next month. "Upon looking into rur State Constitution and into our State Laws, the question is presented to my mind as to what action this present Legislature can take along these lines. There is no doubt that the Lepislature can repeal Chapter 53 of our 1929 Statutes, dealing with the liquor situation and can raise the alcoholic percentage from one-half of 1%, to meet the Congressional change if one is at made. The question - then would fevert back to our State Constitution, towit Ar - ticle 15, Section 10, which deols with the manufacture, sale, keeping for sale or barter, the sale or barter under any pretext, of malt, splritous, vim us, or other intoxicating liquors, except for medicinal scientific, mecharical or sacramental purposes. "Now, then, wruVd we be able, if we modify Section 53-101 ' of the Compiled Statutes, to conform with the Congressional modification of the Volstead Act, to permit the sale of beer in the State of Nebraska under this Constitutional provision? The question is being debated pro and con at the present time and personally I am of the opinion that it could be done, inasmuch as Section 53-101 explains and tells us what is intox - icating liquor as meant in Article 15, Section 10. What is your opinion upon this question? "Further, the question has also been raised as to whether •or not the State Legislature could propose a referendum to re - peal Article 15, Section 10 of the State Constitution. No doubt if that proposal was made it would have to come under Article 16, Section 1, which deals with the proposing .of amendments." </seg>
            <seg id="p536">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL The Legislature cf course h::s power to repeal the state prohi - bition enforcement laws. But the prohibition amendment to our State Constitution would still remain. It (Section 10 of Article XV) reads as follows: ."On and after May 1 1917, the manufacture, the sale, the keeping for sale cr barter the sale or baiter, under any pretext, of malt, sphitous, vinous or other intoxicating, liquors, are for - ever prohibited in this state, except for medicinal, scientific or mechanical, or sacramental purposes." The state constitutional provision would not be affected by the re - peal of the State Prohibition Enforcement Act, the Volstead Act and the Eighteenth Amendment. The state has authority to make its own laws for the regulation of liquor tralFic without regard to federal laws. In our opinion the state prohibition amendment makes illegal the manufacture and sale, in Nebraska of any beer capable of producing intoxication when taken into the stomach in such quantities as it is practically possible for a man to drink. In Kerkow vs. Bauer, 15 Neb. 150, the Supreme Court of Nebraska said: "The word 'beer', without restriction or qualifiication, de - notes an intoxicating malt liquor, and is within the meaning of the words 'intoxicating liquors' as used throughout the statute." In Peterson vs. State, 63 Neb. 251, the Supreme Court of Nebraska said: : ; "Courts will take judicial notice that whiskey and beer are intoxicating." In Feddern vs. State, 79 Neb. 651, the Supreme Court of Nebraska held that it was "not error for the court to instruct the jury, as a mat - ter of law that beer is an intoxicating malt liquor, and is within the meaning of the words 'intoxicating liquors', as used in the statute." It follows, in our opinion, that the manufacture or sale of any malt liquor whether called "beer" or some other name, intended for use as a beverage, or capable of being so used, which contains al - cohol in such proportion that it will produce intoxication when taken in such quantities as may be practically drunk is prohibited by Section 10 of Article XV of the Constitution of Nebraska. The State Constitution prohibits the manufacture and sale of "malt. </seg>
            <seg id="p537">:- OPINIONS spiritous, vinous, or other intoxicating liquors." While the question is not free from doubt, we are of the opini-jn that the electors of the state in adopting said amendment to the Constitution did not mean to. prohibit the manufacture and sale of liquors which can not be used as a beverage in such quantity 'as to produce intoxication. The qual - ifying words "other intoxicating'' can not it seems to us be rejected. It must be assumed that they would not have been inserted without in - tending that they should be given due force and effect. If the words "other intoxicating" are not to be Riven force and meaning as relating to arid defining the words "malt spiiitous, vinous", the use of this phraseology was superfluous. As a matter of ordinary construction, where several words are followed by a. general expression as here, which is as much applicable to the first and other words as to the last, that- expression is not limited to the last, but applies to all. The Sup - reme Court of the United States so held in the case of the United States vs. United Verde Copper Company, 19G U. S- 207, '25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 222. ■ The intention was, it seems to us, to prohibit the production only of such malt liquors as can in fact prccuce intoxication. The prohibition does not therefore in our opinion extend to "malt liquors" such as near beer, which do not contain alcohol. The manufacture and sale of beer, containing sufficient alcohol to produce intoxication, will be illegal in Nebraska as long as said Section 10 of Article XV is a part cf our . State Constitution, even though the Volstead Act and the Eighteenth Amendment be repealed. Said Section 10 of Article XV can not be repealed by the Legislature; it. can only be taken out of the Constitution by a vote of the people of the state at a general election. The question of the repeal of said Section 10 of Article XV of the State Constitution can be submitted by the Legislature to a vote of the people under the provisions of Section 1 of Article XVI of the Nebraska Constitution reading as follows: "Either branch of the Legislature may propose amendments to this constitution, and if the same be agreed to by three-fifths of the members elected to each house, such proposed amend - ments shall be entered on the journals, with the yeas and nays, and published once each week for four weeks, in at least one newspaper in each county, where a newspaper is published, im - mediately preceeding the next election of members of the Legis - lature. At such election said amendments shall be submitted to the electors for approval or rejection upon a ballot separate from that upon which the names of candidates appear. If a majority of the electors voting on any such amendment adopt the same, it shall become a part of this constitution, provided the votes cast in favor of such amendment shall not be less than thirty-five per. cent 1 of the total votes cast at such election. When two or more amendments are submitted at the same elec- </seg>

This power may be invoked by petition wherein the proposed mea - sure shall be set forth at length. If the petition be for the en - actment of a law, it shall be signed by seven percent of the electors of the state and if the petition be for an amendment of the Constitution, the petition therefore shall be signed by ten. per cent of such electors. In all cases the electors signing such petition shall be so distributed as to include five per cent of the electors of each of two-fifths of the counties of the state and ' when thus signed the petition shall be filed with the Secretary of State, who shall submit the measure thus proposed to the electors of the state at the first general election held not less than four months after such petition shall have been filed. The same measure, either in form or in essential substance, shall not be submitted to the people by initiative petition, either affirmatively or negatively, oftener than once in three years. If conflicting measures submitted to the people at. the same elec - tion be approved, the one receiving the highest number of affirmative votes shall thereby become law as to all conflic - ting provisions. The constitutional limitations as to the scope and subject matter of statutes enacted by the Legislature shall apply to those enacted by the initiative." Yours yery truly, C. A.

Deputy State Superintendent, Lincoln, Nebraska. . - - Dear Mr. Austin: You say you have received a letter from a Nebraska consolidated </seg>
            <seg id="p539">OPINIONS school district in which it is stated that the district is about to receive a refund of the federal tax paid on gasoline purchased by the district, and the question is asked whether it is possible to get a refund of the state tax paid by the district on gasoline purchased by it. My answer is no. The refund of federal tax paid en gasoline purchased and. used by the district, is made because the federal government does not attempt to collect a tax from the state or any of its subdivisions or instrumen - talities of government. The state on the other hand levies a tax on all dealers and provides that "The term 'Dealers' is hereby defined and includes any per - son, firm, co-partnership, company, agency, association, corpora - tion, state, county, municipality or subdivision of either thereof, who imports or causes to be imported into the State of Neb - raska, and also any person, firm, co-partnership, company, agen - cy, association, corporation, state county, or municipality, or subdivision of either thereof, who produces, refines, manufact - ures or compounds such motor vehicle fuel as herein defined, any part of which is for use distribution, sale or delivery in the State of Nebraska." (66-401). All dealers as above defined in motor vehicle fuels are required to pay the tax. The Legislature can exempt, if it sees fit to do so, school districts and other. governmental subdivisions and instrumentalities of the state from the payment of any state tax on gasoline, but until tnis is done, school districts in common with counties, cities and villages, and the state itself will be liable for the payment of this tax. Respectfully submitted, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General, By GEORGE W. AYRES, Assistant Attorney General. MARRIAGE LICENSE— VALID HOW LONG December 19, 1932. Mr: Frank Fischer, Valentine, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Fischer: This is in answer to your letter of December 15, 1932. It appears </seg>
            <seg id="p540">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ". . ■ ./ that ycu are about to be called upon as justice of the peace to solemnize a marriage between parlies who obtained their marriage license sev - eral years ago. You request opinion as to whether the license is still flood, or in other words how long after a marriage license is .issued do the marriage rights thereby confered endure. It is now settled that a marriage, to be valid, must be preceded by the obtainment of a vr.lid marriage license and must be solemnized by a person authorized by law to sclemnize marriages (Sec. 42-404, Comp. St., 1929; CcUins v. Hoag &amp; Rollins, Inc., 241 N. W. 766). Since duly authorized persons including justices who solemnize marriages must make return of their proceedings on the license (Sees. 42-108 and 42-113. Comp. St., 1929), the person performing the marriage must have the license when he performs it and should assume some responsibility in knowing that the license is at least formally valid. Is a marriage license issued several years before marriage there - under, formally valid? We doubt it. It is true that there is no stat - ute specifying how long cfter a license is issued the parties shall marry. Yet the statutes make it clear that the marriage should occur before the facts required to be stated in the license change. A license is required to state among other things the surnames of the parties' mothers, the surnames of the parties, their residences and ages (Sec. 42-106, Comp. St., 1929). "The solemnizer is eIso required to certify at the request of the parties, among other things, the names, ages and places of residence of the parties (Sec. 42-108, 110, Comp. St., 1929). If there were several years difference between the issuance of the li - cense and the performance, return and certification of the marriage, some of these facts essentially ingredient to a valid license and marriage might change; and any variance between the return or certificate and the license as to these material facts, might reflect on the validity of the license and thus invalidate the marriage. Construing the whole marriage law (Sees. 42-101 to 42-120, Comp. St., 1929) together,, as we must, we are of the opinion that the law contemplates that the parties should marry pursuant to the license as soon after the issuance of the license as they conveniently and reasonably can; and in any event, that they must marry before any of the facts essential to the validity of the license and marriage have changed. We are therefore of the opinion that before solemnizing- the mar - riage referred to in your letter, you should require the parties to take out a new license for said marriage. Sincerely yours, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General, By CLIFFORD L. REIN, Assistant Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p541">OPINIONS CITIES— LOANS TO FROM RECONSTRUCTION FINANCE CORPOR - ATION—CITY HALL AND AUDITORIUM, REVENUE BONDS December 22, 1932. Mr. F. A. Lyman, Mayor, Superior, Nebraska. ■ Dear Sir: I have your letter cf November 30, 1932, in which you say: "Under the RFC plan we were figuring about building a city hall and auditorium c-mbined. Now can the council vote $40,000 of revenue bonds to pay the R F C back as the re - venue comes in or does this have to be voted by the people as a whole?" The general authoiity of the city of Superior to construct buildings for municipal purposes is found in Section 17-129, Compiled Statutes for 1929, which reads as follows: "To provide for. the erection and government of any use - ful or necessary building for the use of the city." There is a special law governing the building of a city auditorium. Section 17-159, Compiled Statutes for 1929, reads as follows: "Cities of the second class are hereby authorized and em - • powered to accept by gift or devise or to purchase an auditor - ium or community house for social and recreation purposes, to purchase real estate and erect building or buildings thereon for auditorium and social and recreation purposes, and main - tain, manage and operate the same for the benefit of the in - habitants of said cities. Provided, however, before any such purchase can be made or building erected, the question shall be submitted to the electors of such city at ah election duly called for that purpose and be adopted by three-fifths of the electors voting on such question." The first query is whether you must look to the first section quoted (17-129), or to the special act (Sees. 17-159, 160, 161), for your author - ity to construct the proposed building. If it is strictly an auditorium that you propose, to build, then apparently you must submit the ques - tion of building the auditorium to- a vote of the people even if it is proposed to pay for the building by revenue bonds only. Section 17-159 states that "provided, however, before any such purchase can </seg>
            <seg id="p542">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL be made or building erected, the question shall be submitted to the electors of such city at an election duly called for that purpose and be adopted by three-fifths of the electors voting on such question." On the other hand, if the proposed building is to be the city hall with an auditorium as an adjunct and it is not intended that con - struction thereof shall be financed by a general bond issue of the city, then the matter need not be submitted to a vote of the people. The second query is whether in either case the statutes provide an exclusive method for finanncing the ccst of the proposed building. We find none. Your city may defray the cost by means cf a tax levy or general bond issue. But other methods are not excluded- the legislative right to use one method does not thereby constitute a denial of the right to proceed some other way not prohibited by statute. It is our opinion, therefore, that your city may finance the con - struction of the proposed building by issuing revenue bonds, or war - rants, or debentures, payable solely out of rents and fees for the use of the building and not by taxation. The construction of many bridges and electric light and power plants have been financed by the issuance of such bonds. Even prior to the adoption by the people of Nebraska in 1930 of Initiative mea - sure No. 324 which specifically provided for the issuance of such bonds, a number of cities and viUages in Nebraska issued such form of rev - enue and non-tax bonds in payment of electric light and power plant construction charges. ... . The question of the authority c f a municipality to issue such bonds when not specifically authorized by statute came first to the Supreme Court of Nebraska for decision in the case of Carr v. Fenstermacher 119 Neb. 172. Said the court: • . ' "This is a suit in equity to decree the invalidity of an ordinance authorizing .the city of Sargent to buy a Diesel engine and other equipment for the improvement of an electric light and power plant already in operation and to enjoin the municipal officers and the seller of the equipment from per - forming a contract of purchase into which they entered. Plain - tiffs are Stanley V. Carr and Edward Williams, who plead that they are resident taxpayers and users of electricity furnished by means of the plant; that the city was without power to enact the ordinance or enter into the contract of purchase; that the municipal officers did not follow the statutory methods of pro - cedure; and that the ordinance and contract of purchase are void. In the petition the ordinance, the contract, and other </seg>
            <seg id="p543">531 OPINIONS fuels upon which the plaintiffs rely for an injunction are plead - ed at great length. Regularity of the municipal proceedings, validity of the contract of purchase and other grounds of de - fense are fully pleaded in the answer of defendants. Upon a trial of the issues the district court dismissed the suit and plaintiffs appealed. .. "The validity of the contract is vigorously assailed on the ground that the only legal way to purchase the equipment was to raise the necessary funds by taxation or by means of a bond issue authorized by a vote of the people, neither step having been taken. Those methods are authorized by the city charter and it is argued that they are exclusive. Comp. St. 1929, sees. 18-101 tii 18-104. The city was operating an electric light, and power plant at the time the Diesel engine was purchased. The new equipment was procured in the following manner: The council enacted and the mayor approved an ordinance declar - ing the old equipment to be inadequate, authorizing the pur - chase, directing notice for bids, and providing for payment of the purchase price out of the net receipts from the operation of the plant and not out of any funds raised by taxation, no - tice to bidders so specifying. The ordinance provided further that the unpaid indebtedness incurred should be evidenced by conditional warrants payable out of the net receipts from the operation of the plant and that the warrants should not be gen - eral obligations of the city nor payable by taxation. The no - tice to bidders described the Diesel engine and the other nec - cessary equipment desired- and recited that the city engineer's estimate of the cost would be approximately $16,500. Fair - banks, Morse &amp; Company, defendant, made the only bid — $15,435. It was accepted. From funds on hand the city paid $3,000 and for the remainder, or $12,435, issued conditional war - rants pay'ble only from net earnings of the plant. The contract of purchase and the conditional warrants conformed generally to the terms of the ordinance. The sellers of the new equip - ment reserved the right to retain title thereto pending non - payment of any part of the purchase price. The decree deny - ing an injunction was not superseded. The new equipment was installed and the" city continued to operate the plant as im - proved. ; "Plaintiffs argued that the statutory methods of raising funds by means of taxation or by a bond issue excluded every other method, and that consequently the ordinance, the contract of purchase and the conditional 'warrants were void. The char - ter of Sargent shows that the two methods indicated were au - thorized by statute. Comp. St. 1929, sees. 18-102 to 18-104. </seg>
            <seg id="p544">532 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL The statutory procedure must of course be followed where the specific methods of raising money are adopted. It is shown by the record that no attempt to raise funds by taxation or a bond issue was contemplated or made. Both methods were specific - ally rejected by ordinance, contract and conditional warrant. It does not necessarily follow, however, that power to' raise money to pay for the utility or the improvement thereof by other means was excljded by the legislative grant. The leg - islation does not contain exclusive terms. The grant of power to a city may imply a means of exercising it in addition to specific statutory methods without restriction as to others.' In direct language cities of the class to which Sargent belongs are specifically empowered in a single section of the charter 'to pur - chase, construct, maintain and improve' a lighting system. Comp. St. 1929, sec. 18-101. The section next following pro - vides that the cost of such a utility 'may' be defrayed by means of a tax levy and, if insufficient for the purpose, by a bond is - sue. The word 'may,' in -the' sense used, does not necessarily mean 'shall.' If the city has on hand sufficient availble money for that, purpose resort to a tax levy or a bond issue is unnecessary. Christensen v. City of Fremont, 45 Neb. 160. On precedent the power to raise funds for a lighting plant by the methods mentioned in the statute is not exclusive.- Contracts beyond the power of a municipality are such as it cannot law - fully enter into for any purpose. Stickle Lumber Co. v. City of Kearney, 103 Neb. 636. In the present instance the city of Sargent had $3,000 available for the initial payment. Under the contract payment of the remainder of the purchase price, $12,435, cannot be enforced by means of a bond issue or a tax levy. The seller of the new equipment and the holders of con - ditional warrants are limited to collection of deferred payments out of net earnings of the plant. By the very, terms of the contract of sale individual property owned by residents of Sargent cannot be taxed to pay any part of the purchase price. The evidence shows that the new equipment was need - ed to make the plant efficient. There is nothing in the record to show extravagance, fraud or official corruption in the muni - cipal proceedings. Performance of the contract according to its terms will not result in the taxation of any property owned by plaintiffs. The city had the power in some form to make the purchase. The method adopted was not specifically prohi - bited by law and does not seem to be illegal. The power to pay for or improve a lighting utility with available money on hand or with net earnings of the plant is implied by the general grant. A general liability of the city was not created. Under the cir-. cumstances, therefore, want of power and alleged illegality in </seg>
            <seg id="p545">OPINIONS the respect indicated are not sufficient grounds for granting an injunction." It follows from the logic of this case that since the Legislature has granted to all cities of your size the power to construct a building such as you have in mind and has not prescribed any exclusive method of exercising that power, you may choose whether to finance the pro - position by a general bond issue payable out of taxes on property or by the issuance of sc-called revenue bonds which are only a lien on the income of the building. In other words, the general grant of power by the Legislature to construct the proposed building carries with it the implied authority' to raise the necessary funds by pledging the net earnings of the building instead of by taxation, there being no prohibition of such method in the statutes. ■ When there is no provision in the statutes to the contrary a grant - ed municipal power is exercised by the mayor and council. There being no statutory provision for submitting the question of the issu - ance of revenue bonds to a vote of the people, it need not be done. The responsibility for such action rests with the mayor and council. In order to secure financial aid from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation the project must, as you know, be self-liquidating in character. The term "self-liquidating" is denned as follows: "For the purpose of this subsection a project shall be deem - ed self-liquidating if such project will be made self supporting and financially solvent and if the construction cost thereof will be returned within a reasonable period by means of tolls, fees, rents; or other charges, or by such other means (other than by taxation) as may be prescribed by the statutes which provide for the project." If I can be of any further assistance, write me. When I was in Washington before the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, I was informed that they were very anxious to make small loans for self - liquidating projects that were economically sound. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation is anxious to get its money scattered as widely as possible over the country in order to bring about employment. Sincerely yours, C. A. SORENSEN, Attorney General, </seg>
