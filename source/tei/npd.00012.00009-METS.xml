To His Excellency, John H. Mickey, Governor of N'ehraska : 

Kear Sir — I have the honor of submitting to you herewith 
Eighth Biennial Keport of this Hospital for the p&lt; 
¦g November 30, 1904. 

MOVEMENT OF POl'l LATION. 

Sou will observe from the annexed tables that an unpre¦nted 
number of patients have been cared for during the 
uial period. 

The per cent of restorations compares very favorably with 
former jears and is remarkably good when the character of 
cases admitted is considered. At the beginning of the 1 
nial period there were present nine hundred eighteen ('¦ 
patients, of whom six hundred fourteen (614) were males, 
and three hundred four (304) were females. There have been 
admitted during the biennium three hundred twelve (3\2 &gt; 
patients, two hundred forty-one (241) males, seventy-one 
(71) females. During the biennium, twenty-one (21) have 
been discharged as cured, nine (9) discharged improved, 
twenty-nine (29) paroled, one hundred eighty-four UMi 
died, and there remains at the present time six hundred 
sixty-seven (667) males, three hundred twenty (320) females, 
total, nine hundred eighty-seven (987). 

EMPLOYMENT. 

A large number of inmates are employed in various departments. 
During the year just closed we have been able 
t&lt;&gt; employ a much larger number of male patients than during 
any previous year. The increased size of the institution 
demands a larger garden, and the one hundred forty (14(1) 
I in our garden this year naturally required a great deal 
of work, and we have been able to use an increased amount </seg>

            <seg id="p004">
164 

LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT 

of inmate help in that department. It is admitted by :ill 
institution people that a reasonable amount of light employment 
is helpful in many ways to the insane. 

The sewing room has been increased in size, and employs 
from twelve to fifteen female patients. In this department 
is manufactured, under the direction of a competent seain&lt;s, 
all dresses, shirts, bedding, towels, and about all of 
the patients' underwear, and in addition to this a large 
amount of other MCOMUry work and repairing is done. The 
institution laundry, which has been materially increased in 
size and capacity, employs regularly thirty or thirty-five inmates. 
The laundry operated here is one of the largest in 
tli is part of the West, handling at present about forty-two 
thousand (42,000) pieces per week. It has grown to the 
size where it requires seventeen hundred (1,700) pounds of 
soap per week, and this is manufactured at the institution. 
The large amount of repair work which has been carried on 
during the biennial period has made it possible to employ 
an unusually large number of male patients at outside work. 

BEPATBS AND IMPBOVEMENTS. 

I very large number of improvements and important rei 
have been made during the biennium. A new dynamo, 
a capacity of fifteen hundred (1,500) lights, has been 
d. A new two hundred fifty (250) horse-power marine 
r, a large amount of new plumbing has been installed, 
icing the old and unsanitary plumbing which was fory 
in use throughout the hospital. A large part of the 
i building has been reroofed, and several large porches 
d, and the entire exterior of all the buildings has been 
inted and are, as result of this, in very good condition 
ed, and very much improved in appearance. 

fa appropriation was made by the last legislature for the 
:hase of an additional one-half section of land, two hunforty 
acres (240) of which have been bought adjoining 
institution farm, and will prove a vast help. A large 
unt of new brick and cinder walks have been added and </seg>

K fences built. Four thousand (4,000) shade, ornamental, 
fruit I ices have been set out during the p;ist two years. 
Me all doing well. Our dairy herd has been increased 
amber, and several thoroughbred milch cows added. 

A verv important improvement is a new sewer which has 
utly been installed to take the place of the old one, 
which was not only entirely too small, but which emptitil 
very near the rear of the main building. The present new 
HffOf is a fifteen-inch main, and empties a quarter of a mile 
south of the institution. 

In addition, forty by eighty (40 x 80) feet, has been 
Hi to the engine room and is being used as a general store 
a for that department. An appropriation was mad&lt; 
last session for the building of a new barn for the instisn, 
which is now being erected half a mile southwest of 
institution, upon the completion of which the slaughter 
se, the entire dairy herd, hogs, and all stock except the 
ing horses will be transferred to that point, thus relievthe 
institution and the institution grounds of a very dis«able 
and unpleasant condition, originating from the 
e proximity of these yards to the main buildings. 

Two Kirker-Bender fire escapes have been installed during 
the present biennium, which greatly facilitates the means of 
emptying the building, and has rendered a large part of the 
institution very much safer. An additional air lift well is 
now being installed, also an additional air compressor and 
direct pressure pumps have been added, which will mate 
rially increase the supply of water, and lend increased protection 
against fire. 

A small laboratory, but. of sufficient size for the institution, 
has been installed, and while the work is only fairly 
started, yet a considerable amount of pathological work is 
being done in that department. On our male sick ward lias 
been fitted up a very convenient operating room. The con 
gregate system of dining rooms formerly in use here has 
been abandoned and small dining rooms installed on a! 
every ward, which is not only a great convenience, but in </seg>

            <seg id="p006">
166 

LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT. 

this way our patients receive very much improved dining 
room service and better and warmer meals. This change 
has brought about no lessening of the capacity of the insti 
tution in any way, and in addition to the service being very 
much better, the expense of operating these small dining 
rooms is found rather less expensive than the original plan. 

A number of desirable volumes have been added to our 
library, and for the past year and a half, the first in the his 
tory of the institution, the wards have been abundantly supplied 
with newspapers and magazines, a large list being received 
on subscription, for the payment of which a small 
appropriation was made by the last legislature. 

PER CAPITA COST. 

The per capita cost for the biennial period is as follows: 

Daily average cost per capita for the biennial period. .36 4 / 6 c 

GENERAL HEALTH AND SANITARY CONDITION. 

The general health of the institution for the two years has 
been exceptionally good. There have been no epidemics of 
any kind. The general sanitary condition of the institution 
is certainly very much better than ever before, and this to a 
certain extent may account for the diminished amount of 
sickness among the inmates. The percentage of death has 
been no larger than during former bienniums, and is certainly 
as low as could reasonably be expected when the class 
of patients admitted is carefully considered. 

APPROPRIATIONS FOR MAINTENANCE. 

Request for appropriations for general maintenance is 
made on the basis of thirty-five cents (35c) per day per 
capita for eleven hundred (1100) patients. The following 

First semiannual period $ 71 47 

Second semiannual period 67 35

N KC ESSA II Y I .\I I'K&lt; ) V KM KXTS. 

The office apartments in the administration building being 

entirely inadequate, in order to provide for additional office 

room, it is proposed to build a detached cottage as a resid&lt; 

to be occupied by the superintendent and his family, thus 

enabling us to use the second floor of the administration 

building, now occupied as ¦ resident apartment, for offices. 
An additional marine boiler is required since the old bat- 

tery of boilers now in use has grown unsafe from yeai 

service. In addition to this we find them very much more 

expensive to operate than our new marine boiler, installed 

a year ago. The institution is practically without a gi 

house, and it is desired that one or two be added. It i;- 

the desire of the management of the institution to add a I. 

number of shade, ornamental, and fruit trees, and further 

improve the grounds about the hospital. A large amount 

of stone curbing should l&gt;e put in. Two additional tire 

l&gt;es are very much needed, and an addition to our i 

ent kitchen building is desired for the purpose of removing 

one. of our kitchens from its present unsafe location under 

the administration building, and with these improvements </seg>

LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT. 

in view the appropriation for repairs and improvements is 

(lie institution is without a ckapel, and a special bill will 
ntrodueed asking for an appropriation of twenty -five 
isand dollars ($25,000) for the purpose of erectiag and 
pping a chapel and amusement hall large enough to meet 
present demands. 

CONCLUSION. 

In conclusion I desire to extend my sincere thanks to the 
officers and employes of the institution for their uniform 
kindness and courtesy and their efficient and faithful service 
and assistance. 

Pyour excellency, the Governor, and the Board of Public 
i and Buildings, I wish to express my thanks for your
