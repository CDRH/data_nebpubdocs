The books are audited by the State Auditor's office and a report .of same filed with the governor and com - mission. It is interesting to note that during 1936 the total sale of permits amounted to $159,323.75. All of this was collected ex - cept the following: 1936 •L. M. Cole, County Clerk, Arthur County, adjustment on non - resident fee j $ 4.00 •F. C. Magnuson, Sutherland, adjustment on non-resident fee 10.00 •Fred W.

This account is one where an error in making the proper charge was made and where the dealer could not subsequently make collection for the balance due. L Permits During the two years covered by this report, revenue col - lected for permits issued was as follows: Amount Received Kind 1936 1937 Resident Hunt and Fish $140,268.00 $136,098.34 Non-Resident Hunt 4,183.50 6,064.10 Non-Resident Fish 2,798.50 2,227.75 Resident Trap 1 8,780.00 7,928.00 Alien Fish 10.00 20.00 Game Bird Breeding 251.00 136.00 Fur Bearing Animals .'. 181.00 183.00 Fur Buying 1,820.00 2,530.00 Game Fancier 64.00 32.00 Missouri River Commercial Tishing 593.75 677.75 Fish Vendor's Permit 220.00 400.00 Private Fish Hatcheries 150.00 130.00 Dog Training 4.00 6.00 S159.323.75 S156.432.94 CCC and WPA Activities During 1936 and 1937 the Commission cooperated with both the CCC and WPA, sponsoring projects in a number of parks and recreation grounds. Improvements were made of a permanent nature and of lasting benefit to the people of Nebraska. It may be surprising to know that during both 1936 and 1937 federal funds expended in the development of recreational facilities in Nebraska exceeded all state fees and appropriations for such work. The following are the more important projects carried on in cooperation with the Unir.ed States Government: Ponca State Park During the summer of 1936 Ponca State Park was officially opened to the public. This park was developed almost entirely </seg>
            <seg id="p011">STATE OF NEBRASKA from federal funds— through the CCC, under the direction of the National Park Service, working in cooperation with the Nebraska Game Commission. The park contains 200 acres and is located in the bluffs of Dixon County, overlooking the Missouri River. Roads, shelters, lookouts, fountains, stoves, tables, toilets, trails and numerous other conveniences were constructed. This gives the upper Missouri River country a state park comparable to the best in the prairie country. Chadron State Park Nebraska's largest park— Chadron State Park— was further developed during 1936 and 1937. This was done by the National Park Service, in cooperation with the Nebraska Game Commis - sion, using a transient camp. Work carried on was the building of roads, cabins, parking areas, and numerous other improve - ments. Chadron State Park is now one of which Nebraskans can well be proud and when brought to final development under the five years master plan, will rank high among the nation's places for recreation. Development work was carried on in the Wild Cat Hills Game Refuge and Recreation grounds located in Scotts Bluff County. This work was also under the direction of the National Park Service. Shelters, roads, scenic trails, wells, a small lake and other improvements were developed. This adds another im - portant link in Nebraska's recreational system. Guide Rock Recreation Grounds In the spring of 1935 the Guide Rock State Recreation Grounds was destroyed by the devastating Republican River flood. A WPA crew, sponsored by the Nebraska Game Commis - sion began reconstruction work in the summer of 1936. The lake was rebuilt, the ground cleared and a fine shelter constructed. The area was completely restored and in 1937 opened to the public. Hastings Recreation Grounds In 1936 the Nebraska Game Commission added another unit to the statewide system of lakes and recreation grounds. This </seg>
            <seg id="p012">GAME, FORESTATION AND PARKS COMMISSION was the Hastings Recreation Grounds, located near Ayr in Adams County. The WPA, in cooperation with the Commission, began work in 1937 and a fine place for recreation will soon be available to the public. A thirty-acro lake for fishing, shelters, picnic facil - ities and other improvements were made. Fremont Recreation Grounds The Sand Pits at Fremont in Dodge County, damaged by an ice gorge in the Platte River, were repaired through WPA as - sistance. Roads and bridges were rebuilt, debris cleared away and a large shelter constructed. Duke Alexis Recreation Grounds Improvements of sundry nature were made by the WPA at these grounds. Some of the old CCC buildings were worked over and made use of, as were improvements of the lake . Gretna State Fisheries During 1937 a WPA project carried on improvement work at the Gretna State Fisheries Three new entrances to the grounds. a retaining wall, laying a pipe line, and the removal of dead trees were among the activities carried on. Publications In 1937 the Commission published a pictorial map entitled "Outdoors in Nebraska". The initial printing was 50,000 copies, many of which were distributed throughout other states. The demand from tourist agencies, travel bureaus, commercial clubs, etc., was very great, and it is believed the map brought con - siderable attention to Nebraska, as well as attracting many visitors. The quarterly publication, known as "Outdoor Nebraska" was continued and eight editions of 10,000 copies each were gotten out during the two years. This magazine is now used extensively in clubs and schools throughout the state as well as being read by thousands of sportsmen. </seg>
            <seg id="p013">STATE OF NEBRASKA Other publications were as follows: 50,000 copies of "Game, Fish and Park Laws." 50,000 copies of "Synopsis of Game and Fish Laws." 20,000 folders "Nebraska Hunting Regulations." 5,000 folders "Open Season on Muskrats." 200,000 folders "Facts." 5,000 bulletins "The Relation of Land to Wildlife." 5,000 bulletins "Insects of Nebraska." Badges A new system of identifying those purchasing hunting and fishing permits was introduced in 1936. This was a badge or holder containing the permit. The holder or badge must be worn on the coat or hat. It proved popular with sportsmen and fisher - men generally, and has been of great aid in the sale of permits and law enforcement. The badges are made by the Nebraska Prison Industries. </seg>

Uniforms Each Officer is required to wear a uniform while checking permits and when coming in contact with the public generally. Transportation All Officers are furnished automobiles purchased by the State and are not allowed to collect mileage. Experience has shown that it is better for the state to own the vehicles than to pay mileage on privately-owned cars, owing to the fact that it is </seg>
            <seg id="p018">GAME, FORESTATION AND PARKS COMMISSION difficult to check the mileage of men working on rivers or in the field, where they have no regular itineraries. Small cars are used and traded in frequently, thus reducing the cost per mile to a very reasonable amount. Reports * The Commission requires each officer to make a full and complete report of all his .activities. Each carries a "field diary," in which is noted the work for each day of the month. A weekly and a monthly report is also prepared, the latter going to each member of the Commission for study. Examinations In accordance with the state law, all candidates for Conser - vation Officers are required to pass both a written and oral ex - amination, and their names placed on an eligible list. Men hired are taken from this list. Complaints Hundreds of complaints are handled each year from all parts of the state. These reports which come into the office are referred immediately to the District Deputy Conservation Officer of the respective district who mikes a personal investigation, reporting back to the office what action was taken, if any. All special permits such as those issued for scientific pur - poses, damage caused by pheasants, muskrats and beaver, are likewise investigated by 1he Deputy Conservation Officers.

            <seg id="p020">GAME, FORESTATION AND PARKS COMMISSION GAME RESERVES AND SANCTUARIES In cooperation with the federal authorities, the Nebraska Game Commission has established and maintains a number of Game Reserves and Sanctuaries throughout the state. Over 450,000 acres are set aside within the state as inviolate breeding and resting grounds for both migratory waterfowl and upland game birds. There are three types of sanctuaries — (a) those established and maintained by the federal government, (b) those established by the state legislature, (c) those established by regulation of the State Game Commission.

            <seg id="p025">STATE OF NEBRASKA EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES 1936 During the year of 1936 several new films were added to our Conservation library of silent pictures and the demand for Con - servation programs in our schools and among educational groups increased. The second annual 4-H Club Conservation Camp was held at Seward during August. This camp was well attended by 4-H Club boys and girls from all parts of the state and extended over a period of four days. The major part of the expense of this annual encampment is paid from private sources and the balance is made up by the Game, Forestation and Parks Commission and the 4-H Club. Several thousand Conservation bulletins were printed and distributed among schools and 4-H Club members. Among the bulletins distributed were the following: More Trees and Shrubs for Nebraska Insects of Nebraska Wild Animals of Nebraska The Fishes of Nebraska Facts about Nebraska 1937 Conservation programs in schools, P. T. A. meetings and Sportsmens Clubs increased from 29 in 1936 to 73 in 1937, with an increase in attendance from 5,000 in 1936 to 30,000 in 1937. New sound movie equipment was purchased in February and a new Nebraska film entitled "The Tree Planters State" was produced. This film was originated by and produced under the direction of Secretary Frank B. O'Connell and has proved very popular with schools and educational groups. Other sound films including several class room films were added to our library of sound films including the following: Plant Growth Pond Insects Trees </seg>

Nearly forty state reservations, ranging in size from ten acres to 1500 acres, are distributed throughout the state. It is the policy of the Commission to secure areas in all parts of the state where they will be accessible to all citizens. In many of the parts and areas shelters, camp grounds, picnic facilities and other accommodations have been constructed. Sev - eral of the parks have cabins available by the day and week, and one of the recreational areas has a lodge fully equipped. During 1936 and 1937, the two years covered by this report, many of these areas have been further developed by the use of federal funds provided through the CCC, WPA and other agen - cies. Elsewhere in this report will be found a list of such de - velopment work.

            <seg id="p032">GAME, FORESTATION AND PARKS COMMISSION STATE GAME FARM In 1937 the Nebraska Game Commission established a game farm. It was located on leased property in Madison County, it being deemed inadvisable to purchase a permanent site until more experience had been gained as to the type of soil that was requisite. During the first year of operation, 75 breeding pens, 7 double brooder houses, 14 brooder runs, 13 show pens, 4 large range pens, 15 small shelters, and 25 shipping crates were constructed. A total of 2700 birds were raised. These consisted of pheasants, chukar partridges and quail. Approximately 700 pheasants, and 150 partridges were held over for brood stock. The other birds were released as follows: Garden County 16 Pheasants Saunders County 90 Pheasants Cuming County ...: 127 Pheasants Pierce County 150 Pheasants Howard County 141 Pheasants Sherman County 150 Pheasants Antelope County 140 Pheasants Stanton County 108 Pheasants Boone County 108 Pheasants Wayne County 108 Pheasants Madison County 128 Pheasants FISH HATCHERIES AND DISTRIBUTION The Nebraska Game Commission operates live fish hatch - eries and several nurseries throughout the state. Trout, large and small mouth bass, crappie, bluegills, rock bass, pike, bullheads and catfish are raised. During 1936 and 1937 three of the major hatcheries— Gretna, Valentine and Rock Creek— were enlarged and new hatching facilities provided. The Gretna Hatchery was enlarged in order to hatch a larger number of catfish. Roads, landscaping, pond repair, entrances, walks, etc., were among the improvements and repairs carried on. </seg>
            <seg id="p033">STATE OF NEBRASKA At Rock Creek light circular trout-rearing races were con - structed There many trout can now be held and grown out in size so that they are nearly ready for the angler at the time of planting. General improvement and repairs to enable the hatching of greater numbers of pan fish were undertaken at the Valentine plant. FISH DISTRIBUTION The following report covers the distribution of fish durin- the pas, two years. These were raised at hatcheries, propagation lakes and by purchase from private hatcheries.
