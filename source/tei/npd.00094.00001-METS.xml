         <seg id="p009">To the Honorable Dwight Griswold, Governor of the State of Nebraska, and the State Legislature. Dear Governor Griswold: We hereby submit the Fourteenth Biennial Report of the State Board of Control, covering the period ending June 30, 1941, in com - pliance with the provisions of the compiled statutes of Nebraska, year 1929, chapter 83, paragraph 128.

         <seg id="p012">8 STATE BOARD OF CONTROL CREATION AND ORGANIZATION The Board of Control came into being with that title in 1913, when the legislative session on April 21 of that year passed and had approved a bill which changed the name" from Board of Commission - ers of State Institutions to that of Board of Control. This statute defined the duties and responsibilities of the newly named Board of Control, and it continued under this original mandate until the adop - tion of a new State Constitution on September 21, 1920, at which time the Board of Control was included as one of the constitutional offices of the State of Nebraska. This is provided for in Article 4, section 19 of the Constitution of the State of Nebraska. This section pro - vides there shall be a Board of Control of state institutions consisting of three members who shall be appointed by the Governor by and with the consent of two-thirds of the members of the Senate. </seg>

         <seg id="p015">CHANGES IN INSTITUTIONAL HEADS DURING THE BENNIUM Mr. John Gettman, Superintendent of the State Industrial School at Kearney, died in January, 1940 and he was succeeded by Mr. Fred Dickson who had been Assistant Superintendent for over fifteen years. .• ¦; ¦'¦'.¦•.'¦'¦' .'..-¦¦ ;.' ¦ ¦/.:',:¦; .' '¦'..' Dr. L. T. Sidwell, who had been Superintendent of the Hospital for Tuberculous since July' 1, 1927, resigned because of ill health and Mr. Bernard P. Daxon, head of the Board of Control Engineering Department, was named as Superintendent effective June 1, 1940. Miss M. Evelyn Meyer, who had been Superintendent of the Nebraska Industrial Home since April 1, 1920, resigned and her place was taken by Mrs. Myra M. Martin, Social Worker at the Girl's Training School, Geneva. ' Mrs. Martin ' assumed her new duties December 1, 1939. 11 </seg>
         <seg id="p016">THE DIVISION OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING A great deal of the new building construction, carried to com - pletion during the last biennium, was the result of planning started as much as six years ago. At that time P. W, A. funds were available and some of the buildings completed during the biennium of 1939 to. 1941 were started previous to that time. Some of the new buildings included under this designation are a new, three hundred'and thirty bed, ward building and an employees building at the Lincoln State Hospital. At the Penitentiary a new entrance building, a warehouse and a high steel fence ware included in this group. At the Hospital for the Tuberculous in Kearney a new adminis - tration building was built, a heating plant was erected and a men's building was constructed. At Beatrice one building was completely remodeled to become, when finished, the general kitchen for the entire institution. This building also houses the new refrigeration space and food preparation rooms. At Norfolk a new emp'oyee's and a farm ward building were constructed. As was said before all this construction work was done with P. W. A. money which had been allotted to the Board of Control during the previous years and which funds are accounted for in the last Biennial report. They are included here because the actual consummation of the work took place during this biennium. Since the plans, made as early as 1935, called for a progressive program for maintenance of the buildings and physical plants it was necessary that the buildings first be brought to a state of good gen - eral physical condition before the new maintenance could adequately function. With this idea in mind, W. P. A. funds to the amount of §832,467.38, were matched with $356,857.91, of state funds which made a total expenditure of $'1,189,325.29. These figures represent the total contribution including labor and equipment by both the Federal Government and the State. The break down of these funds is found in the table at the end of this article. These funds have been allotted to many of the state institutions and in fact all of them with the exception of Genoa State Farm have benefited by this program. 12 </seg>
         <seg id="p017">¦'.'.• At the State Industrial School in Kearney the boy's kitchen and dining room were completely remodeled. Completely new water mains were installed and these were connected to the Hospital for the Tuberculous to insure an adequate water supply. A great deal of other reconditioning was done about the plant. At the Hospital for the Tuberculous a new kitchen was constructed by means of a remodeling process; new tunnels were built, and a great deal of landscaping, drive and walk work was carried out. At the Hastings State Hospital building remodeling was exten - sive; elevators were installed; a concrete water reservoir was con - structed and in addition concrete paving was laid. There was a great deal of curb and gutter work and landscaping was carried out on an extensive scale. . At the Grand Island. Soldier's and Sailor's Home considerable building, remodeling and renovating were carried but. In some cases this was so extensive as to make almost completely a new building on the inside. An addition was made to the sewer system and an exten - sion was added to the water line system. Drives and landscaping, came in for their share of attention and made a big improvement. At the Girl's Training School in Geneva a completely new sewer system was constructed; landscaping activities were carried on and building remodeling and renovating was carried out.. In the Nebraska Institution for the Feeble Minded at Beatrice a new storm sewer and.tunnels were built. Several buildings were so completely remodeled and renovated that the interior was practically new, and a new steam engine and electrical generator were installed. This latter installation will enable the institution to generate its own electricity and use the waste steam in heating the buildings. At the Nebraska School for the Blind in Nebraska City the en - tire west wing and center portion of the building were remodeled and renovated on the inside and the entire outside of the building was painted. According to the superintendent, the building is now in the best shape that it has been for thirty years. ' ' At the School for the Deaf in Omaha a large program of redecor - ating and Tenovatinp was carried out. Very little was done, however, in the way of changing existing facilities. .¦¦'¦¦ At the Norfolk State Hospital a new storm sewer and tunnels were constructed; an extensive building remodeling and renovating program was in operation; landscaping, drive and walk construction were also included. A new steam engine and electrical generator were installed. 13 </seg>
         <seg id="p018">At the Lincoln State Hospital for the Mentally 111 a. new storm sewer and tunnels were constructed. These were made necessary by the new buildings which were erected there. An extension was added to the existing water system and sewer system. A very extensive program of drives, walks, curbs, gutters and landscaping was carried out Many buildings were also completely remodeled and renovated. At the Penitentiary in Lincoln a new horse barn was completed; a new spray pond and tunnels were built; a new storm sewer was constructed and new roofs put on the cell blocks. .¦•'¦¦¦ In addition some concrete paving, sidewalks and landscaping were part of the project. At the Beformatory for Men in Lincoln the buildings were re - modeled and renovated throughout. This includes the kitchen, laun - dry, some cell blocks, hall ways and new roofs on the top of the cell blocks. At the South Farm, which is operated in conjunction with the Beformatory, new roofs were put on all of the buildings and many new "A" type hog houses, feeders and brick poultry houses were built Many of the smaller hog houses and feeders were built there and then transported to other institutions. At the Orthopedic Hospital the work consisted essentially of completely remodeling and renovating the Nurses Home. At the Home for Dependent Children in Lincoln a gas installa - tion was made for cooking and heating purposes. Landscaping was carried out and new drives, walks and Toofs were constructed. At the farm, which is operated in conjunction with the Home, a vertical pit silo was constructed and buildings were renovated throughout. In addition to these institutions, six months of remodeling work was done at the new Milford Trade School. This work was started in April and was terminated in October when the Vocational Educa - tion Department wrote up the project to carry on the work. The sponsor's funds for this particular project, however, were from the Vocational Education Division as will be seen in the table. At the Women's Reformatory in York the water lines were extended; considerable renovating and remodeling was done and down town in the city of York a sewer tile making project was in operation for the construction of concrete sewer tile which was used in many of the institutions under the Board of Control's jurisdiction. It is a fair estimate to assume that the 14,000 man months which were utilized by the Board of Control in this W. P. A. program is 14 </seg>
         <seg id="p019">equivalent to the full time employment of 1,000 men over a two yen period and represents approximately 5% of the total state load for the period covered. In this report mere words would not prove ade - quate to describe the improvement of conditions in the institutions resulting from these changes. Changes were made only after care - ful planning and with an attempt to look into the future to determine needs. £11 of the institutions are,. without doubt, in much better physical shape than they have been for many years and this improve - ment is due to the judgment and foresight of the Board of Control in establishing a carefully worked out program for institution im - provement and maintenance.

         <seg id="p021">THE AGRICULTURAL DIVISION The agricultural enterprises at the State institutions are under the general direction of the farm supervisor who works out of the Board of Control office and is directly accountable to the Board of Control. The relation of the farm supervisor to the institutions is' co-operative and advisory, rather than authoritative. The main objectives of the farm supervisor are to effect th» most efficient operation of the agricultural enterprises and to or - ganize the production program to meet the needs of the institutions so far as possible. To most effectively carry out these objectives his efforts axe devoted to the following activities. ; . 1. Make frequent visits to the institutions to observe the progress being made and to discuss plans and problems with the farm managers, dairymen, poultry men, and gardeners. 2. To procure any technical or practical information reeded and impart it to these men. \ / . 3. To promote further practice of plans or methods that have proven successful at other of the institutions. 4. To give those'persons responsible for the agricultun 1 work the recognition due them and to encourage the keeni at interest and best efforts in their work. _':¦ • ':.... - 6. To give the officials of each institution impartial ai A accurate reports and recommendations on the operation of (he agricul - tural work at their institution. 6. To keep the Board of Control members informed wrh the least -':.¦ expenditure of their time, of the activities and prog ress of the agricultural work at the state institutions. 7. To co-ordinate the agricultural work with the tr lining and rehabilitation of the charges entrusted to the state. - FIELD CROPS "'¦.'¦ The main use of the 4900 acres of land in field crops at the state institutions is to provide most of the feed possible for the livestock. Since it is not possible to provide all the feed needed most of the land is used to produce pasture and forage crops rather than grain crops. 17 </seg>
         <seg id="p022">Since the pasture may be regarded as a necessity and forage crops are costly to transport, it is more economical to provide these first. However, some corn, oats, barley and grain sorghum is produced. About 625 acres of the field crops are under irrigation. During the drouth years it was necessary to purchase a 'large part of the alfalfa hay used. During the past 3 years over 300 acres of new alfalfa meadow has been established and every effort will be made to enlarge and maintain the alfalfa acreage. A very encouraging increase in pasture productivity has been accomplished in the past 3 or 4 years by working out definite pasture rotation plans at each institution, using annual pasture crops. Considerable effort in the rehabilitation of old permanent pas - tures and in the establishment of new ones so far has not been too successful, but further work will be continued with hopes for a more abundant and better distribution of rainfall. The use of certified seeds and of better adapted varieties of farm crops has resulted in an increased production. GARDEN About 750 acres of land is devoted to garden crops. Of this acreage 550 acres are irrigated. About 40 different garden crops are being grown successfully at the institutions. The most of these crops are used fresh during the growing season, but all available facilities are used to also store these crops for -winter use. When more and better storage space can be provided for the garden crops the production of these crops can be increased. The rapid development in the breeding of garden plants in re - cent years has produced a number of new varieties particularly well adapted to this region. Notable among these are the Piresteel and Victor tomatoes, the Marcross and Goldcross sweet corn, the potato baby lima bean, the Mincu cucumber, and the New York 515 and Imperial 44 head lettuce. The land devoted to gardening means far more in terms of dol - lars and cents to the institutions on a per-acre basis than any of the land used for other agricultural purposes. If the soil and climate here were not so favorable to gardening the food costs at the institu - tions would be markedly higher and the menu would not be so com - plete. Considerable care is used in the purchase of garden seeds, in order to obtain seeds of high purity and germination. The purity of 18 </seg>
         <seg id="p023">breeding is especially important. All seeds delivered are tested for germination by the State Seed Laboratory before payment is made to the shipper. . The past history ol the eastern end of this state would indicate that the soil and climate are quite favorable to the production of fruit. However, the adverse weather condition of more recent years, has all but eliminated the fruit orchards. The more serious conse - quence has been the discouragement of growing fruit for home use. It would seem that the institutions might well establish new orchards for their future needs. Many new developments in varieties and orchard planning and management could well be expected to bring about more success with fruit trees in the future. Fruit can' hardly be omitted from the diet and the institution menus could be mate - rially improved by an ample supply of fresh home-grown fruits. DAIRY HERDS ' i The institutions normally carry an inventory of over 1000 Hol - stein cattle with about 500 of these being producing cows. By fol - lowing a scientific breeding program and improving the management of the herds the Nebraska institutions have, in the past 10 years, raised from a mediocre level to a near-top position among.the institu - tion herds of the other states. In 1940 the Nebraska institution cows produced an average 12,075 lbs. milk and 417 lbs. butterfat per cow, or a total of almost six and one-half million pounds for all the 536 cows. From all information available it is doubtful whether very many states exceeded this average and these by but a very narrow margin. ' ,;: ..' .-. '.:. ' .; . ¦¦ . . '¦ ¦ Very few females have been purchased for the state institution herds in the past ten years and none in this biennium. All the re - placements are bred and raised by the institutions. A great many of the herd sires used are also bred and raised by the institutions. Practically all the milk produced is consumed at the institutions as fluid milk but a small amount of butter and cheese has also been manufactured. The production has quite amply met the institutions' needs of fluid milk with perhaps the exception of the Institution for Feeble-Minded. . Each year a show herd is assembled from the various institutions' herds and shown at the state fair. In the past ten years over 250 ribbons were won by these cattle including 10 grand champion awards. Cattle have been shown at the Waterloo Dairy Cattle Congress three of these years and won 5 awards there. '.'¦¦;¦ 19 </seg>
         <seg id="p024">POULTRY The 11 institutions that maintain poultry flocks have a normal total of about 9000 producing hens, all of them being: White Leg - horns. Some of the institutions are producing their basic dietary needs of eggs, but as a whole, the egg production is less than 75 per cent of total basic needs with the shortage being centered mostly at 2 or 3 institutions. The shortage of housing for the producing birds is the present limiting factor of the egg production. For the past 3 years the institutions have been hatching all the chicks needed for pullet replacements. One breeding flock is main - tained at the Hastings State Hospital and one at the Reformatory for Men. Each of these institutions also has an automatic electric In - cubator of 8800 eggs capacity each. These two incubators hatch over 30,000 chicks each year, all of which are distributed to the in - stitutions. The breeding hens are selected each year from the best birds in these flocks and are mated with cocks from high-producing dams. All birds in the breeding flocks are tested for pullorum disease prior to the hatching season each year and all reactors are immediately slaughtered. This program has already resulted in lowering the chick mortality, in developing larger and better type birds and in raising the annual average egg production to 179 eggs per hen in 1940, which is a very pronounced increase over previous years. A total of about 1500 turkeys are raised annually to provide fresh-dressed birds for the institutions during the holiday season. All the poults are hatched at the Hastings State Hospital where a breed - ing flock is maintained. The foundation of this flock was established by purchasing hatching eggs from one of the West Coast breeders of the superior strain of Bronze turkeys, generally termed as the "full - breasted", "meat-type" turkey. These birds have proven to be far superior to the native strains. SWINE All of the pork needed for the institutions is being produced on the farms, which comprises a total of over 3000 butcher hogs an - nually. All of the pork to be used as fresh pork is butchered at the respective institutions. All the pork to be processed is taken to the packing plant at the Genoa State Farm, later to be distributed to the institutions. All of the swine breeding herds are Hampshires but some cross - breeding is also done where the pigs are all to be butchered. By a 20 </seg>
         <seg id="p025">more rigid selection of the breeding stock and the addition of a num - ber of higher quality boara, the general quality of pigs being pro - duced has been improved. '•.;;¦ So far as the limited equipment permits the young pigs are raised on "new" ground every year using all portable equipment. This has proven to be far more satisfactory than centralized methods as it has reduced the losses caused by filth-borne diseases and para - sites. Several of the institutions have been quite consistently meet - ing the standard of "8 pigs weaned per litter" and "200 lbs. weigh! at 6 months of age". . . , •'¦'¦ HORSES AND MULES In the: past most of the horses and mules needed for the institu - tions have been purchased. However, in recent years it has become more difficult to buy well-bred animals. Since horses and mules will continue to be indispensable to the operation of the institution farms and gardens more of them are being bred and raised at the institu - tions. A. number of very good purebred Percheron and Belgian mares have been purchased to add to the number of outstanding brood mares at the institutions and all of them are mated to purebred stal - lions. The institutions can boast of a large number of very fine colts: It is hoped that in the future there will be enough high quality colts to make all necessary replacements. SHELTERBELTS Over 700,000 young trees were planted in shelterbelts on the state institution lands in 1940. Most of these trees were furnished by the U. S. Forestry Service and the U. S. Soil Conservation Service. Several thousand were purchased from nurseries. ¦ • The survival of these treeß has been quite satisfactory and the growth some of them have already made is remarkable. All those that perished through 1940 were replaced in 1941. It is already evident that the benefit to the land by these trees will not be long in coming. Each ensuing year they will become more and!more effective in preventing wind erosion, crop damage by hot winds| excessive moisture evaporation and will trap drifting snow. Many of the belts have been bo placed and arranged to prevent the blocking of roqds and drives by drifted snow. The Board of Control expresses its appreciation to the several departments of the College of-Agriculture for its most helpful assistance in carrying out the agriculture work at the institutions, to 21 </seg>
         <seg id="p026">the State Seed Laboratory for their part in procuring better crop seeds, to the State Bureau of Animal Industry for the help in disease control in the state-owned livestock, to the U. S. Forestry Service and the U. S. Soil Conservation Service for the materials supplied us and the help given us in our shelterbelt work. To Mr. M. B. Jenkins, Sr., forestry research director of the Soil Survey Division of the Uni - versity of Nebraska, we express our most sincere thanks for his in - exhaustible enthusiasm and continuous effort in developing the for - estry work at the state institutions from an embryonic idea to a com - pleted project. 22 </seg>

         <seg id="p039">DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE The purpose and functions of the Finance Department is to establish a uniform system of accounts and to direct the accounting work of the Board of Control and its institutions in order that an efficient and sound plan of financing may be carried on. Such a plan necessitates a thorough study of reliable cost records furnished the Board of Control by each institution before a well rounded pro - gram of budgeting can be placed in operation. Budgetary accounting records are maintained in the office of the Board of Control and each institution is notified monthly of the status of. its budget' Each in - stitution is asked to keep a similar set of encumbrance records which are to be reconciled with the encumbrance records maintained by the Board of Control and are requested to call to the attention of the Board of-. Control any unreconciled differences found in encumbering contracts, requisitions and orders. By having each institution keep a duplicate set of encumbrance records the institution will at all times know the condition of its budget and can better plan the spend - ing of its program in keeping costs within its budget. .-.¦¦. Aside from these records a double entry system of accounts was installed some four years ago in each institution. Prior to that time no records of any value were kept in the institutions and it was therefore necessary for the Board of Control to gather facts from records which were available but which were misleading. With such incomplete facts it was impossible to tell actually what it was costing to maintain each institution. It was with this problem in mind that the Board of Control authorized the installation of a system of ac - counts in each institution which would fulfill these requirements at a moderate cost.' Each institution is required to furnish quarterly, a financial statement which indicates fund balances, inventory valua - tions, accounts payable, the operating costs of the institution, cost of production of the departments, total costs incurred and the resulting per capita costs for the biennium. V : In keeping with such a program the Board's Auditor has made frequent visits to each one of the institutions to take up numerous accounting problems which arose and in most cases found the work progressing satisfactorily. During the biennium several audits were made at institutions by the Board's Auditor as well as by the State Auditor's accounting staff and audit reports indicated that funds are intact and properly accounted for and that the records maintained in each institution are substantially correct and systematically, oper - ated. / ¦¦¦ "v ¦ ¦ .¦; :,'.:-•..-'¦¦.¦ ¦ ¦'•'"¦""••'/•" '¦¦-- ¦¦ '• ¦¦ '¦¦; 35 </seg>
         <seg id="p040">The accounting work in many of the larger institutions is heavy and a great deal of the time spent in keeping records could be greatly reduced if a machine accounting system was installed. Such a system would involve considerable original cost and it is for this reason that a system of this nature has not been installed. It would not, how - ever, be practical to adopt machine accounting in all institutions since many of the institutions are small in size. It is more likely that some consideration in the near future will be given to a machine accounting system in the larger institutions. It has been the earnest desire of the department to improve the accounting program now in effect and to furnish the Board of Control with reports and records which can be relied upon and which will lead to a better program of management. 36 </seg>

Ninety-two per cent.of the girls in the institution were in school. Twenty-Bix girls graduated from Geneva North High in 1940 and twenty-three in 1941. Most of these girls are now in wage homes in domestic service; A few of the more fortunate have stenographic jodb; four - teen have continued their schooling in colleges and schools of cos - metology. Unfortunately, a few girls were returned to relatively poor situations simply because no other resources were available. We have worked with the Child Welfare Division in a most happy rela - tionship in the placement of these girls. Commercial and Cosmetology courses have justified their establishment since the girls having these courses have secured the better placements. We plan adding a new course, specializing in training for domestic service. The (iris who have been given their education have definitely become the self - supporting ones. During the biennium we have added a calculator, Ediphone, and twelve new typewriters for the commercial depart - ment. The equipment for the Cosmetology has also been purchased 47 </seg>
         <seg id="p052">this bionnium. The cosmetic services are available in the institution beauty shop. ¦ During this biennium our health facilities have been under the direction of a stalf physician who resides in Geneva and who comes regularly each week and at any other time needed. He has been as - sisted by a registered nurse who spends part of each day in the in - stitution. Any major medical correction needed is taken to the Orthopedic Hospital in Lincoln. All necessary corrections have been made very satisfactorily. No epidemics have occurred and general good health has prevailed. A dental chair has been provided and we expect to have a dentist on a part-time basis. Our Sunday School is really enjoyed by all. The orchestra and glee club provide special numbers for both Sunday School and Chapel. Each Cottage in turn gives an inspirational program on Sunday. This program is an opening service for Sunday School. The ministers from town give the sermon for the Chapel Service. Even though we have carried a full schedule for the school, the girls have maintained the same standards for their housekeeping and farm program. The gardens have provided all of our vegetables. We have canned thousands of quarts. Since we did not use all of this, we were glad to sell our surplus to other institutions. Our well, with a fine irriga - tion system, has made a good garden possible. The chickens and turkeys have shown a profit and furnished the institution with eggs and Sunday and holiday meats. The new range shelters added this year should help. The dairy herd has improved in their rating with other state herds. Our feed costs are high since this location requires us to ship in feeds by truck. We do feel it is necessary for everyone to learn to work. How - ever, we do not neglect our recreation. Our moving-picture machine proves more helpful each year. Along with our feature picture once a month, we have educational films each Sunday evening. Visual' education is for all. During the summer months we have outdoor recreation. Regularly scheduled recreational activities for the week include roller skating, volley ball, croquet, and kitten ball. A tour - nament during the summer has been enjoyed by both the girls and the staff. The Junior-Senior activities this year were much enjoyed. The banquet was our high spot and the class of '42 is looking forward to their graduation. The girls enjoy planning for parties and show sur - prising ability. 48 </seg>
         <seg id="p053">We are very happy with our new library books. They were badly needed and are leisure-time favorites. Crocheting land fine needle - work are also very popular in leisure hours. However, music ranks first with some, who spend their leisure- time practicing or-listening to the radio. , •'.. For more than a year, a project under WPA has been operating. Much has been done to improve the .buildings, both the interior and the exterior. The project has definitely been a help to the institution. Work which was much needed has been done. The buildings are in much better condition because of this project. The landscaping plan will be completed during this summer. 'The trees and lawns have beliefitted from the well, since we have had an abundance of water. The project has also completed a new sewer line running directly to the city disposal plant; thus eliminating the conditions which had be - come a menace to sanitation.

Hancock Chief of Medical Staff Mrs. Leona Golden Head Nurse Lawrence Scheurman Institution Case Worker Mrs. Nina Picking Bookkeeper Mrs. Alice Burdick Receptionist A school presenting the work of eight grades is maintained at the Home. This follows and embraces all the subjects as prescribed in the Course of Study for Schools in Nebraska. The school tries at all times to meet the needs of the children rather than establishing a fixed program and compelling the child to fit into that program. Much individual instruction is given. . Five teachers were employed for the school year. They hold Nebraska State Certificates. They were well qualified by their special abilities and experiences to work with homeless children. These teachers were most patient and understanding of the needs of the individual child and of his problems. , The teachers were not under pressure to promote from grade to grade in order to establish their own records. The children were not passed with poor foundations nor drilled to pass examinations. Chil - dren coming to the Home, having lost home and parents, are emotion - ally disturbed. In the school room they are not competing with chil - dren secure in their own homes, nor with standards maintained to meet the needs of such security. Because of this, neither teachers nor pupils were under pressure. This prevented tension and the most favorable results have followed. A nine year old child who could recognize less than twenty-five words, coming from an over-crowded school room with an over-taxed teacher, made the progress necessary to complete the second grade during a one year period in the Home school. She is now a happy child, much better adjusted socially, as well as academically. 60 </seg>
         <seg id="p065">The school rooms are very inadequate. Three of them are in basements. Two are in a small revamped frame building, one being reached by a steep wooden stairway. ¦ . . Each teacher carried two grades except the primary teacher who had kindergarten, first and second grades. The teacher of the sev - enth and eighth grades was the principal of the school. The Director of Education under the Board of Control super - vised the school and advised on questions pertaining to school, brought before him. .'. : . The eighth grade, pupils take the State Eighth Grade Examina - tions and in the past two years they have passed one hundred percent Fourteen boys and girls have passed into high school. The past year, in other grades, achievement tests with a study of the work done in the school room based on the child's ability, were used rather than semester examinations. This was considered more reliable and much more fair to,the individual child. : .-¦¦-"' . The High School pupils have attended one of the five schools, Bethany, Jackson, Havelock, Lincoln or the Teacher's College High School of the University of Nebraska. Twenty-four students have graduated from High School in the past two years. Two have taken college work each year. As these young people must earn the money for their higher education, it is of necessity a slow progress. Children were given psychological tests quite soon after en - trance. It has been most interesting and encouraging to follow these. As the children have had the benefits of good food, rest, medical care and security, the trend of these tests results in almost every case has been upward. In many cases this upward trend has been very remarkable. From a study of the results obtained on psychological tests, better planning for the children has been possible. ...'.' The psychological work has been done under the supervision of Mr. H. 6. Salter, the Director of Education of the Board of Control. Some of the testing has been done by the Department of Educational Psychology of the University of Nebraska. /' Health is one of the major points stressed in the program of the Home.';.

A dentist is included on the medical staff. Each child is given dental care upon admission and every six months thereafter. or as needed. : The general good health of our children is reflected in the fact that we have had no epidemics and very few major illnesses in the past biennium. The children attended Church services and Sabbath School at the denomination of their choice. Nine churches and their workers have contributed to the religious life of the children. Religious obser - vances are practiced in the Home but no church services are held. The plan of attending the several churches as well as attendance at the several high schools has broken the group into smaller units. This has done much to prevent the labeling of the children as "The Home Kids." Children in the Home have had their good times much as children in normal home life. They have enjoyed many types of outdoor sports and games. Because of the large group of near age and size they were not lacking for playmates. Boys and girls play together very normally. They had parties in their houses, inviting another house group, the neighborhood club, their class or their friends from the groups which they contacted. Candy making and popcorn have been stand bys. They licked the cake crock and quarreled over the frosting bowl and ice cream dashers. Hikes and picnics have always been very popular. Attendance at a circus each summer, through the courtesy of interested friends, has been a real thrill. Picture shows, as a courtesy extended by the theatres, have been enjoyed a number of times. A camp at South Bend has been maintained each summer to allow each child a three or four day camping experience. These days were high sports of the summer, with swimming, fishing and roaming over the sands as the major activities. Voice training and piano lessons were made possible through the services of an outstanding teacher. The children did nice work 62 </seg>
         <seg id="p069">in their music. They particularly enjoyed the privilege of singing for community events and in their churches. A band director was employed much of the time during the biennium. Music has done much to provide a feeling of well being, which has been denied' to them in their local communities. A program, outstanding in the minds of all, closed the summer's work in school and music in 1940. Some two hundred friends of the Home enjoyed this with the children. Two neighborhood clubs for boys have been maintained for the past two years. Swimming has been enjoyed one night each week as well as other community activities. . Two 4-H Clubs for girls have been organized each year. They have been enjoyed by all members and proved most worthwhile. The children are assigned duties in keeping with their ability and strength. Because of the large number of small children, not too much of the real labor needed to maintain the institution has been done by the children. However, each child has been taught the re - sponsibility and dignity of work. ¦.•. ..•"¦' :,' .;. The girls are taught to cook, sew, iron, clean and can. Regular sewing classes were conducted during the summers. Boys work in the garden, work on lawns and work with the men on various projects about the "Home." ; ¦ Each boy has had a shop period when he might work out any idea he had of his own. Because of the younger age in boys it has been a "Hobby project" rather than a vocational project. \ ¦ ¦ .-..-.... ¦ ¦ .¦'¦'' . - '.- *"'.' ¦¦¦•¦..' The older boys living at the "Home" farm have had a. near normal home life. They have assisted with the upkeep of the house and cooking. From this training, several have secured jobs along such lines, which have helped them finance further training in chosen vocations. They, do the dairy work connected with the farm. They raise chickens on a large scale. For two years the boys have owned the "pig project" They bought the pigs and the feed. This has been a profit to them financially but a greater profit in responsibility de - velopment. Because of the small acreage, no intensive farming program can be given but truck gardening and small plot work has been well carried out. ¦-.-? '-/.:;'¦' '¦¦{'¦.': ;; The idea in the establishment of "The Home" was to give refuge until a home could be found for children who had lost their own homes. It has been found they need much help many times before they can accept another home. This preparation must be given in "The Home." Here the children are given good food, medical care, harmonious surroundings and freedom from the stress that marked 63 </seg>
         <seg id="p070">the environment of their own homes. This has brought many out - standing results. The boy who trifled with the truth, stole, was cruel to animals and humans, in a year's time has become a helpful, thought - ful boy, eager for praise and appreciative of understanding. The work of finding homes for the children and supervising them after placement in homes, has been done by the Foster Home De - partment of the State Child Welfare Division under the Board of Control. These workers maintain their offices at the institution. A close relationship exists between Poster Home Workers and the in - stitution staff. Two Foster Home workers have been oh duty through the past two years with the third person active part of the biennium. As there are now 288 children in foster homes requiring supervision, with people making inquiries for children and new homes opening for study al) the time, this department is greatly in need of a fourth full time worker. The corps of workers has been chosen as far as possible because of their experience, training and ability to work with children. To have been successful they must have had patience, understanding and above all a sense of fairness. The work of all employees is on a par. All are guiding and teaching youth. The work of the individual employee does not cease with his nominal task. Each is expected to help in the developing of character in the children and directing them toward good citizenship. 64 </seg>

Bookkeeper and Steward HEADS OF DEPARTMENTS Marguerite Macbeth— Head Nurse Mac Maxiner _ Supervisor of Sewing Bessie Patrick Supervisor of Kitchen Irtna Treu Supervisor of Laundry Lee A. Yates. Engineer Willis Megehey Poultryman and Gardener During: the biennium there has been a complete change of staff members with the exception of the engineer. The resignation of the former Superintendent, Miss Evelyn Meyer, took effect on December 1, 1939, and that of the Steward a week later. Dr. Sandusky, who had served the Home for many years, died in April, 1940. Other changes were brought about chiefly because of ill health or of op - portunities for better positions elsewhere. Twenty-one girls and 10 babiea were in the Home at the begin - ning of the biennium. Since that time 119 girls have been admitted and 99 babies were born in the Home. One baby was delivered by Saesanan section at the Lincoln General Hospital and was returned with its mother to the Home. There have been no still births. One adult, who was taken to the Lincoln General Hospital for surgery necessitated by a premature separation of the placenta, died there Two babies have died; one at the age of six hours because of cerebral birth injury and the other at the age of seven weeks due to congenital malformation of the heart vessels. ".-...¦ The increase in admissions of girls and of births over the pre - vious biennium was 32 girls and 19 babies. These figures are espec - ially interesting since the whole expense of the Institution for the past two years was ?19,700.18 less than during the previouß biennium. 72 </seg>
         <seg id="p079">Some changes in the policies of the Home have been made in accordance with present trends in working with unmarried mothers. Through cooperation with the Child Welfare Division and the various County Assistance Directors, a closer working relationship has been built up with the county of legal residence of each girl. Thus more satisfactory plans can be made for the mother and child when they leave the Home. The local County Directors have been cooperative in furnishing information helpful in understanding the girl and her needs. They are prepared to take any necessary responsibility in planning for the girl and her child when discharged. This tends to give a girl a feeling of security when she returns to her.home com - munity and makes her realize that the County Director will help her during her period of rehabilitation. The period of remaining in the Home has been shortened to a minimum of three months. Some girls stay longer than this period on their own volition. In cases where secrecy is desired an early ad - mission is usually sought. In some other cases it has been practical to remain until satisfactory plans could be made in the home com - munity or until a position could be secured. In some cases girls have asked to stay until arrangements could be made for them to marry the father of their child. The method of admission during the past two years has been almost wholly by voluntary application made by the girl herself or through the County Assistance Director, the County Attorney or the girl's physician. There have been but two admissions by court com - mitment and but one by Court Order. Four girls have been received by transfer from other institutions. The greater number of the girls are discharged upon the advice of the Staff Physician when their babies are six weeks old. Those remaining longer do so voluntarily or need to remain until satisfactory plans can be completed. ¦ ; :, ;/ The final decision as to the plans for the babies is made by the mother, unless mentally incompetent, and her family. The various possibilities for the future of the child are discussed and each girl is urged to make her own decision and one that she will not later regret. Emphasis is placed upon the fact that the institution is a mater - nity home and not a penal institution. An effort is made to give each girl a feeling of security and an opportunity for learning of a more socially acceptable manner of living. •¦'..: ¦¦-.. - ¦•¦. In so far as possible each girl is aided in developing'along ths lines in which she has some ability and interest. An effort' is made to fit her to return to the normal activity of her home and community 73 </seg>
         <seg id="p080">unless there is reason for thinking that she would do betUr else - where. For the most part girls respond well to the training offered them. Emphasis is placed upon learning to do household tasks well. Thus each girl will be better fitted to be a homemaker or possibly to support herself as a domestic. Instruction is given in food prepara - tion and serving. Needle work and plain sewing is taught Upon admission but few girls have knowledge of sewing but most of them express satisfaction upon learning to do sewing for themselves and their babies. Each girl who plans to take her baby with her is given training in feeding and child care. An attempt is made to build up a better attitude toward sex matters. It has been found that very few have had teaching along this line. In giving such instruction, the "Social Hygiene Manual," issued by the Nebraska Department of Health has been a valuable aid. The religious training given tends to strengthen each girl's own belief. Sunday School is held on Sunday morning and a Chapel Ser - vice is conducted in the afternoon by a minister from Milford. At - tendance at these services is not compulsory but it is seldom that anyone k absent who is physically able to attend. The recreational program, although limited, is adapted to the needs of the girls. Radios, pianos, and comfortable, well furnished recreation rooms are provided in each building. A good sized library is freely used. Each evening a recreation hour is supervised by some staff member. This time is spent playing games, popping corn, group singing, taking walks in the country or in having a party which may have been planned by a committee of girls. Each girl's birthday is recognized in some pleasant manner. Suitable programs are given on holidays. Although it would be difficult to carry out a tegular school pro - gram it is to be regretted, in the cases of the younger girls, that schooling must be interrupted during the period spent in the Home. By means of University Extension work, under the supervision of the Educational Director for Institutions, it was made possible for one girl to receive her high school diploma and another her eighth grade certificate. Psychometric examinations given by the Educational Director have been of value in working with the girls in the Home and in helping to make plans toward their rehabilitation. The general health of the population has been excellent. Two syphilitic cases and four who had gonorrhea were admitted. The babies of both syphilitic mothers are apparently free from the disease, 74 </seg>
         <seg id="p081">prob»bly due to the fact that the mothers received adequate treat - ment before the birth of the child. The cases of gonorrhea have responded well to treatment. A daily clinic is held by the nurse and a bi-weekly clinic is held by the staff physicians. Upon admission each girl, and before dismissal each girl and baby, is given a complete physical examination including Wasserman, smear and Mantoux tests. Where indicated a chest X-Ray is taken at the Orthopedic Hospital. Refractions and any necessary surgery is also done at the Orthopedic. Dental care has been lacking excepting in cases of extreme need. A plan is now being worked out with a local dentist whereby necessary work can be obtained at as low a cost as is justified for good work. Wherever possible the work ot the Home is done by the girls but owing to the fact that their period of residence has been shortened, averaging about four months instead of a year, they are not in physi - cal condition to do heavy work. It has been found practical to hire an assistant to the laundry supervisor and a helper for the kitchen supervisor. The employment of two nurses instead of one has re - sulted in a much more satisfactory situation in the hospital as the duty was so heavy that no registered nurse would consider staying for any length of time. . Some improvement has been made in the appearance of the campus. Unsightly sheds and fencing was removed from the rear part of the grounds and a new lawn started. The lawn benches were repainted and a large picnic table and fire place were built. Out door suppers in this sheltered park are enjoyed greatly by the girls and officers. The shelter belt planted last year on three sides of the farm has made an excellent growth. The location of the garden ' was changed with good results. An effort is being made to seed all of the farm land to alfalfa or permanent pasture. Fuel costs were greatly lessened by lowering the size and in - sulating the steam. pipes in the tunnel and by installing a valve to cut off the office building when heat was needed at night only in the hospital building. The closing of the fourth floor of the main build - ing reduced not only heating costs but also lessened fire hazards. Repairs were made in the roof of the main building and on the gutters and down spouts of both buildings. The ceiling of the laundry was replastered with water-proof plastering. The pipes under the water tower were replaced and better insulated against freezing. An electric refrigerator has been installed in the hospital making it possible to have a diet kitchen for the patients and safer refrigeration for the babies'formulas. .!' 75 </seg>
         <seg id="p082">76 We recemmend that consideration be given to the installation of gas in the boiler room, laundry, and kitchen. We believe that over a period of time the cost of fuel would be lessened and we know the comfort would be greater to the girls if the heat of the coal range could be taken out of the kitchen. We have been advised that the cost of repairs on the smoke stack, which has been defective for some tim«, would be much lessened if gas were used. It would be advisable to do considerable painting during the next two years. The rooms in the hospital should be painted with colored washable paint not only for sanitary reasons but for a more cheerful appearance. The large porches on the two older buildings are also in need of paint. We wish to express our appreciation to the members of the staff for their fine spirit of cooperation and loyalty. </seg>

Nielsen.—.————————Science In this report.we are endeavoring to give you a few of the high points covering the biennium beginning with July 1, 1939, and closing with June 30, 1941. Each school year has covered exactly thirty-six school weeks, Monday through Friday, which is the standard for public schools in the larger communtiies of Nebraska. It is the intention that we conform as closely as possible to the general school plans as worked out for the common schools. This system leaves approximately three months for a summer vacation and two -weeks for the Christmas recess. We are trying more and more to get away from the hospital or. asylum conception that was obtained in the earlier years of so - ciety's interest in the sightless. We are stressing more and more that this institution is purely, one for education and that custodial care is only incidental to the true objective sought. '¦¦'¦.. '.'¦¦. ¦¦ 85 </seg>
         <seg id="p092">Occasionally out school has to be in session slightly longer than the period planned. This occurs whenever we suffer from an epidemic and in the first year of this biennium one girl, suffering from Scarlet Fever, was detained until the middle of June, when our quarantine •was lifted. -i ENROLLMENT During this biennium the enrollment has been approximately the same as during the one before. But the ages of the pupils has been decidedly lower. As we enrolled twenty-four new pupils during this biennium (tables at the close of this narrative will indicate the classi - fications) and thirteen during the biennium before, it merely proves that the number leaving school as well as those entering is larger than in the previous biennium. For many years both in our state and in the nation at large boys were predominant in the attendance of residential schools This condition has changed for some reasons which no one appears to be able to account for so that the sexes are now almost equally divided For several years the girts had the majority and now there is almost an equality. In our school there are slightly more girls than boys for the last period. In our report of a year ago comment was made as to our efforts to secure more young pupils, and this effort through the Child Wel - fare D,v,s&gt;on has brought the results which we have already com - mented on.

         <seg id="p093">CHANGES IN PERSONNEL The only change in our personnel during the last year of this biennium was that of Miss Evelyn Burgess who was succeeded by Miss Helen Goodman. ¦ ' OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS There have been two outstanding achievements, of different natures during this biennium. They are the W. P. A. project, of re - modeling and renovating the buildings on our premises and the in - troduction of weaving on &amp; large scale. : ".,'¦' RENOVATION AND IMPROVEMENTS Beginning in the middle of the month of December, 1D39, the Works Progress Administration, of the Federal Government, working in cooperation with the State Board of Control, started the moat exten - sive remodeling and repair program that this school has ever known in its sixty-five years of existence. The original plans are approximately two-thirds finished (summer, 1940) and the rest were completed after school began. Many thousands of dollars were spent and the federal government contributed about three-fourths of the cost. The wages of the employees and a small part of the material has been a federal charge, the remainder has fallen to Nebraska. It was a hard matter to switch pupils and teachers, inside'and outside employees so that the workmen could carry on. It was very difficult to go on with such repairs as plastering, roof-repair and strengthening, while the mercury was-low,-snow falling and wind blowing.' But we assure you, that this was done with the least friction and the least antagon - ism imaginable. All worked harmoniously toward the end sought. A listing of some of the major accomplishments is here given: Roof Repaired and Strengthened: The north-west wing done over from basement to roof. This work comprised plastering, built in closets, placing of showers and remodel - ing of washrooms. •;¦;¦¦'.;&gt;¦ ;:¦¦¦¦"¦¦¦¦:0'-• ¦¦'¦'¦¦'¦¦.'¦••¦¦'¦¦¦¦¦¦ •¦.'¦¦ ::.'¦¦¦'_: ¦,;.-¦¦-; Airways Strengthened and repaired:. .: \,'¦; :::.

Happy Hollow, above Chapel, plastered and painted: Central part basement, south-rooms, two kitchens plastered and painted: .. 87 </seg>
         <seg id="p094">Wainscoting from central and west wing, wherever found has been removed and cement plastering placed instead: Gymnasium floor treated and walls painted: Shop painted and varnished, the foundations strengthened: Every window in the building has been calked inside and out, fitted carefully and weather-stripped. The concrete steps to the building repaired and in some instances wholly rebuilt: The brick building has been painted up most carefully, several thousand crumblinß old brick removed and replaced with new: The building has received almost wholly a priming coat (Sum - mer, 1940) and the second coat was applied the following Fall. During this last year of the biennium about the only remodeling that has been done is that of making storage place in our garage for our new bus. STOKERS INSTALLED Outside of these WPA activities, the Board of Control has in- Btalled stokers for our furnaces. The figures on the saving are not yet available but we feel that it is considerable. This has taken much work off of the engineers and firemen and we have been able to purchase a lower-priced coal. WEAVING AND TUNING The industries taught in the school for many years had begun to seem out of place in this progressive world. There has been little demand for brooms manufactured slowly and by hand in the shop The shop was remodeled and weaving and other manual work intro - duced. The seven table looms and two floor looms have aroused en - thusiasm among our boys. Not only the girls took .to weaving but also many of the boys. EQUIPMENT We have been fortunate in securing the following equipment during the last year of this biennium: Thirty-six passenger school bus (International) ; • Pick-Up Truck (Chevrolet) ; : ¦ Whirlwind Power Lawn Mower Stage Curtain for Chapel 88 </seg>
         <seg id="p095">NEBRASKA ZEPHYR During: the first year of this biennium the students, under the guidance of Miss Hyma McClure and Miss Charlotte McGowen, pub - lished a tabloid magazine every six weeks. This work has been con - tinued during- the second year of the biennium and has been improved upon greatly. A mimeograph was purchased and Miss McGowen and her students have very ably learned its use. ¦ All of the Braille copies of the magazine have been published by the American Printing House for the Blind, Louisville, Kentucky. :"".':' BOYS QUARTET During the first year of this biennium our boys quartet made such a success that we had hopes they might secure a regular radio contract for once a week. Though the singing of the young men was very good we failed to find employment for them. Three of these boys graduated and left school with the closing of school, 1940. How - ever, during the last half of the school year, 1940-41, Miss Matson started another quartet and after they had sung together awhile were as good as the quartet of the previous year. . .; : ATSTATEFAIR The School for the Blind has had an exhibit at the State Fair each year of this biennium. The display was very similar to those in the past except that some of the weaving, was displayed. THE CINEMA Though Mr. and Mrs. Wesley Booth have sold their movie the - ators, their recommendation has Been sufficient for the present man - agement to continue the courtesy of free admission once a week to our boys and girls. During the past year we have been required to pay the tax. V OUR FRIENDS, THE CORYELLS • Mr. and Mrs. L. L. Coryell, Sr. and Mr. and Mrs. L. L. Coryell, Jr. and their daughter, Miss Loraine Leland Coryell, have maintained their keen interest in our welfare. They have made frequent visits, contributed a weekly allowance to boys and girls, remembered all at Christmas and contributed liberally to the development of our play - ground. .-.'.,• '¦/.¦¦::¦:;'" .¦;..-..¦¦ '..-:- - ; .;'; :.;-. 89 </seg>

Parry .Nightwatch GENERAL INFORMATION The school was started in 1869, in Omaha, and had an attend - ance of twelve pupils in its first year. The attendance during the past year reached the total of 200, of which number 193 were in school on the closing day, June 6, 1941. The approximate ratio of the deaf to the hearing in the state, country, and world population, is one deaf in every two thousand persons, and the ratio necessarily prevails among children of school age. In the history of the school, covering a period of 72 years, 1502 pupils have received its benefits. Of this number, 332 have grad - uated, 193 are still on the school roll, and 977 have left school after taking limited courses. PURPOSE The Nebraska School for the Deaf was established according to Chapter 199 of the 1937 Statutes of Nebraska, "For the purpose of the physical, moral and intellectual cultural and vocational training 98 </seg>
         <seg id="p105">of the respective classes for whose benefit each institution was created, to the end that the pupils in each may be returned to society capable of becoming self-sustaining and useful citizens." 83-302. Same. Names Designated. In order to be better known and more fully recognized as strictly educational institutions, the name of the State school known as the "Nebraska Institute for the Deaf and Dumb" shall be changed to "Nebraska School for the Deaf" and the name of the Institution for the Blind shall be changed to "Nebraska School for the Blind." NEBRASKA SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF The school for the Deaf is strictly and solely an institution of learning. It is a very complex educational institution. Being a residential school, it is a community in itself; it is a center of culture, co-operation and service. It is a place where a deaf child usually spends nine months of each year, from thirteen to fifteen of his most impressionable years, in condensed living and meeting the problems of life under competent direction. It is a place where he competes with those with similar handicaps; developing his' abilities; forming proper tastes, attitudes, prejudices and habits; becoming acquainted with the best that has been thought, said or done through the'ages; gaining an understanding of life and the natural laws that influence it; growing in self-respect; finding his possibilities and limitations; dis - criminating between culture and coarseness; enjoying the beautiful in natural phenomena and human endeavors; exercising driving power in attacking worth while problems; experiencing the joy in striving and the pleasure that comes from good work; building into his per - sonality, ideals, aims, and purposes to lead him on to the best ex - pression of himself and the greatest worth to his fellow man. ADMISSION Chapter 83, section 304, says, "All deaf residents of this state, and those deaf to such an extent that they cannot acquire an educa - tion in the common schools of the state, of suitable age and capacity and of good moral character, shall be entitled to an education in the School for the Deaf without charge." The Statute in its intent, was to set up a School in the State of Nebraska for those handicapped with deafness, so that they might receive an education when it was . not feasible to receive it in a public school. There is nothing in the Statute which in any way indicates that the School is open only to indigents. There has been some impression throughout the state that to have a child attend the School for the Deaf at Omaha was an »drai»aion of a degree of poverty or delin- 99 </seg>
         <seg id="p106">quency. This is not the case, and in fact the School constitutes a privilege for aiding those who need it badly. Some states do not hswe schools for che deaf and are justified in sending their children to ad - joininu states in order that they may receive the benefits of an edu - cation. During this biennium we have had four enrolled from the &gt;&gt;tatc of Wyoming. ; Children may enter the School at the age of five or six, depend - ing upon their physiological and psychological developments. In other words the chronological age in itself is not the sole criterian of the child's readiness to carry school work. It is found more expedient and more economical to gather all the deaf children of the state into one place, than to establish separate schools for them throughout the state, and for that reason, no charge is made for board and tuition. The parent or guardian of a pupil admitted to the school shall furnish suitable clothing, pay transportation expenses to and from school, and pay for any special hospitalization or dental work which wight be necessary. The best time to enter a child is at the beginning of the school, the micfdle of September. The school term is nine months, and usually begins the second week in September and closes the second week in June with two weeks vacation in December. It is illegal for any parent or guardian to keep a healthy deaf child out of school when the state has made such liberal provisions fur his or her education. No child of weak intelligence, having vicious or bad habits or suffering from an incurable disease will be admitted to the school. The Superintendent has power to dismiss a pupil from the school for inability to receive an education, failure to make satisfactory progress, persistent violation of the rules of the school, improper conduct in school or elsewhere, where his retention would prove a detriment to others, and for frequent and continued absence. Any person sending the address of a deaf child, not in school, of legal school age, will be doing a real service to a class whose lives need to a peculiar degree, the blessing and light of an education. EDUCATIONAL Tbe course of study embrases the branches usually taught in the elementary and grammar schools, with a number of high school studies, subject to change as the peculiar wants of the deaf child require. The school strives to keep abreast of the progressive spirit 100 </seg>
         <seg id="p107">of the age and nothing is left out of the course of study that will be of benefit to the pupil. ¦ ¦; ¦: &#132; ¦ . l.« ¦ .-.;:¦.-•• . A Unit requirement for graduation that will apply to all who graduate hereafter, has been set up. Under this present plan the student will be allowed to specialize his last year in school. Business relations, business arithmetic, home maikng for the girls, and other elective project subjects will be given. We hope to include a course in automobile driving for our Seniors—First Aid was started this biennium. Every deaf child is given an opportunity, as far as possible, to learn speech and lip-reading. Every possible effort is made to en - courage and promote speech. Those who qualify and desire a higher education are prepared for admission to Gallaudet College, Washing - ton, D. C. "Special students" may take school subjects in advance of our "Graduation Level." We have a 1940 Graduate attending Omaha University and making satisfactory progress. We have an - other Graduate, entering Gallaudet College this Fall. Vocational training of the child is carefully considered at an early age. The child is given an opportunity to express his likes and dislikes of the basic vocational art subjects, and his back ground and abilities are studied to determine what occupation or trade he or she might best take up as a life work. . ¦ Realizing it is impossible for a school to provide special training for every line of work in which the deaf person may eventually find employment, we are therefore confining this phase of our school work to imparting general skills in the basic vocational arts subjects, placing emphasis on shop language, theory of the subject, quality and quan - tity of work in all departments. Art and drawing are given our intermediate children. Other subjects that give general training, that have been added, with part time instructors are: Bartering, Beauty - culture, Photography, Typing, Costume designing, and Carpentry. In addition to the vocational work given at the school, a boy or girl, in his or her last year in school, may be given ah opportunity to specialize in a desired trade not offered in our school through the "work study plan." The student spends one-half day in the class room, and one-half day in a chosen shop or factory in the city. The State Vocational Rehabilitation Department has. given us splendid cooperation in this work by providing necessary personal equipment and training fees, if necessary. '."¦¦':¦¦ Hearing Aids—All children are given an Audometric test periodi - cally and group hearing aids are used to assist in speech correction in addition to the development of hearing understanding. .¦ .•'¦¦' 101 </seg>
         <seg id="p108">Two new group hearing aids have been installed thia biennimn in addition to the one in the Primary department which was pur - chased previously. One was placed in each of the dormitory sitting rooms. They are used during the day by the "Hard of hearing." Classes rotate in the use of each for speech correction and language work. In the evenings and week ends they are used in conjunction with radios, for entertainment. Considerable work has been done the past two years setting up a personnel record of each child in school. This includes the records pertaining to General health, dental, optical, audometric, psycho - metric, speech, speech reading, vocational as well as academic achiever ment tests. Graphs have been made of the results and individual case histories recorded. EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES An extra-curricular program for the children is carefully planned and sponsored by competent persons. Some of the most popular acti - vities are: the Social Clubs, Literary Club, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Aero Club, Young People's Meetings, the Student Council and regu - lar School Parties. The religious activities consist of Sunday School every Sunday morning, Young People's Services in the School Chapel, and Church services, for those who care to attend are held outside of the In - stitution proper. In addition, traveling Ministers come into the In - stitution to conduct non-sectarian religious services. HEALTH AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION The health of the child is carefully guarded at all times. A regularly employed doctor and a registered nurse take care of the usual child ailments. Each child is given a physical and dental ex - amination at least once each year, usually as soon after entering school as possible. Every child participates in an intramural or athletic program, if he is physically able, under the guidance of com - petent teachers. The physical development goes hand in hand with the mental development. Our school is a member of the Nebraska State High School Athletic Association and our boys compete with hearing boys in competitive sports, such as football, basketball, track, etc. SCHOOL SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT During the past two years additional supplies and equipment have been added for school room work. Our new 16 MM Sound Moving Picture Projector has been supplemented by a Detineascope 102 </seg>
         <seg id="p109">which will he used by almost every department of the school in visual education. Twelve new desks have replaced old worn out desks in the class rooms. Some new tools have been provided for the Voca - tional Arts departments to keep them up-to-date. New Text Books, Dictionaries, and Magazines were also purchased. A beginning was made toward the improvement of our Library. Several old, obsolete, worn out books were discarded. Four hundred and twelve books were rebound and three hundred thirty-one new books were added. We hope to continue adding new books from year to year until we have a library that will meet our needs, Two new Group Hearing Aid sets were purchased and we will probably have use for one more set in the near future. V . . We are very happy to report that our new stage curtain, window drapes, and 200 steel folding chairs, add to the beauty and service of our Auditorium. ; . We have added a new, latest type, electric flat ironer and washer and a 74 gallon automatic hot water heater to our laundry. This enables us to shut down our heating plant during the summer months. The home size washer and flat ironer will also be used in our home making course for the older girls.. We have replaced our old refrigerator, in the pantry, with a new gas refrigerator. Also, we.have purchased!a 23 cv. ft. Electric re - frigerator for the pupils dining room and a 7 cv. ft. refrigerator for the Hospital. This enables us to shut down our large ice machine for the summer. ¦ '' A new electric stove was recently installed in the hospital so that meals may be kept warm for the invalids. A new electric slicing . machine was added to the kitchen equipment. A new nine passenger Chevrolet "station wagon" will solve a transportation problem. We are very grateful for,this new equipment. REPAIRS AND REPLACEMENTS During the last two years considerable improvements to our Buildings,,have been made by workers furnished by the WPA. This organization furnished the labor while the State furnished the ma - terials used. The Girl's Hall has been completely redecorated. All wooden floors on the first and second floors have been sanded to a smooth and even surface and refinished with silver seal and wax. All lockers have been enameled. Two.coats of white lead and oil have been applied to air outside windows, after they had been caulked for the first time: The kalsomine finish on all walls and ceilings was removed and a good flat wall paint has been applied. . 103 </seg>
         <seg id="p110">The administration Building has been redecorated. The outside of the School Building has been given a coat of paint, and some re - touching of standing trim has been done on the inside. The inside of the Laundry and the Boy's Hall were completely decorated. The old Infirmary was painted inside and out, also all windows were caulked. The garage was put in good repair by point - ing up brick work, plaster patching, caulking and exterior painting. All of the plaster was removed from the pupils; officers' and teach - ers' dining rooms, and the kitchen. The ceiling of the 'pupils' dining room was replaced with insulite. A new "Mulehide" roll roofing was put on the west wing of the Main building. This last WPA project completed, will put all the buildings in excellent condition. The usual upkeep will be necessary only to keep them in good repair. Our old Main building which includes the primary school, primary boy's dormitory, pupil's dining room and kitchen, the administrative offices, and teacher's and officer's dormitory quarters, should be re - placed in the near future by completing the school unit, building a new primary dormitory and the construction of a small infirmary. 104 </seg>

Supt. of Nurses Anna Walker Matron TEACHERS Kindergarten and Grades 1, 2 Gouldene Mordock Grades 3, 4, 5 Elsie Lindquist Grades 6, 7, 8 Kathleen Harris Practical Arts Leona Burke ORTHOPEDIC HOSPITAL During the period from July 1, 1939, to June 30, 1941, 686 new patients and 1098 previously dismissed patients have entered the hospital for treatment. There were 1048 surgical operations, 4460 house-patients observed, 1217 casts applied, 725 braces ordered and fitted, 3110 x-rays taken and 4163 out-patients seen in clinic. The laboratory work has also been markedly increased, and a total of 8093 different laboratory tests and examinations were made during this period. A glance at the above figures will reveal that the past biennium has been full of increased activity. Some changes occurred in the hospital staff, but, on the whole, there was less shifting of employees. Doctor Miles J. Breuer was dropped as the pathologist, and no one, as yet, has been appointed to fill the vacancy. Late in the biennium Dr. Fred Webster was ap - pointed dental consultant surgeon to the Orthopedic Hospital and Services for Crippled Children. Miss Iva Robbins, anaesthetist, re - signed and was replaced by Mrs. Laura Nehring. Among the graduate nurses, who act as supervisors, Mrs. Opal Farnsworth resigned and was replaced by Miss Alma Binder, who remained less than a year. Mm. Alfrieda Van Divier took Miss Binder's place, and within a few months Mrs. -Grace Mazart replaced Mrs. Van Divier, who resigned. Mrs. Annabel Peterson quit her position and was replaced by Mrs. 116 </seg>
         <seg id="p123">Marjorie Adams, who soon resigned when her husband secured social service work in Omaha. By means of a special federal grant for extension of services, two additional graduate nurses, Hiss Mildred Manske and Mrs. Hermace Soldani, were employed to care for the infantile paralysis cases that required treatment in the mechanical respirator and other special attention. Later in May, 1941, Mrs. Grace Mazart resigned and Mrs. Hermace Soldani was assigned to her position. Mr. Burton John, laboratory and X-ray technician, was ordered to duty with the United States. Navy so Mr. John Starlin took over the laboratory and X-ray work. The medical record li - brarian, Mrs. Nina Saunders, resigned and was replaced by Mrs. Carolyn Helgeson, who had formerly worked for the Crippled Chil - dren's Services at the Orthopedic Hospital. Among the teaching staff, Miss Josephine Millard discontinued her work to become a bride in Illinois, and Mrs. Elsie Lindquist took up her duties of teaching the third, fourth, and fifth grades. Mrs. Leona Burke took the place of Miss Thelma Brewer, who also became, a bride *nd ceased teaching school children. Mrs. Myrtle Holeman was promoted to first assistant in the physiotherapy department to replace Miss Mildred Callahan, who left to take the nurses' course. Every year, about half of the fourteen nurse aides employed, leave for better or different work or to take the nurses' course, and others take their place. Very few changes occurred in the domestic employees. In the medical social department, Miss Regina Mendel took over the duties of Mrs. Caroline Elledge, who entered the University of Chicago to study on her master's degree, and Miss Eileen Young replaced Miss Alma Knipp - rath. Later in May, 1941, Miss Young resigned, and her place was \ left unfilled. Toward the middle of the biennium, Miss Kay Braver - man took up the duties of public health nurse in behalf of the crippled children of the state. . "" . Through the efforts of the county assistance directors, of the doctors of the state, of the medical social workers, of interested par - ents and various sympathetic individuals throughout the state, the Orthopedic Hospital was filled almost to capacity most of the two years, and as fast as patients were dismissed others entered. The Crippled Children's Division has had to pay for many braces and shoes, as most of the parents were unable to do so. The medical social department helps to keep the parents informed about the chil - dren's progress and is the contact agency between patients and rela - tives. '¦¦."¦ ¦¦ •'¦¦¦.¦'..¦¦ ,¦¦ "..- :: ¦..-.: "'-¦"'. ' ¦¦.' ¦' During the first year very little repairing and redecorating were . done, vWe were able to have the floor and the partitions in tte medical social department finished and the superintendent's office painted. The room formerly used for the laboratory was redecorated 117 </seg>
         <seg id="p124">and equipped with a new examining table, a Warner bracket light, two stools and a new linoleum on the floor. This made a fine exam - ining room and relieved the congestion caused by so many doctors ÜBing the same examining room. The large south basement room in the nurses' home was partitioned so as to make three suitable room 9 for employees. These rooms, as well as others, including the matron's quarters in the nurses' home, were remodeled, redecorated and fur - nished partly with old and partly with new furniture and rugs. Be - ginning in July, 1940, some badly needed repairs and replacements were started by W. P. A. employees at the Orthopedic Hospital. The tile roof on the administration building was repaired and new cement front steps constructed at the nurses' home. New roofing was placed on the nurses' home, work shop, boiler house and south section of garages. The large west store room on the third floor of the ad - ministration building was remodeled for the practical arts room, and the old basement art room and employees dining room were revised and equipped for a brace shop, shoe store room, and fitting room for braces. All are very happy over the remodeling, redecorating, rearrang - ing, the new equipment, and above all the new reception room rug at the nurses' home. For all this we express our deep appreciation. New rugs and Venetian blinds were placed in the offices of the superintendent, head nurse, and matron. The installation of Vene - tian blinds to the windows of the second and third floor halls con - necting the administration and annex buildings made a marked im - provement. A fine new combination of gas stoves was installed in the kitchen, and the gas bake oven was moved beside the ranges so as to have all the cooking in one part of the kitchen. In addition to a few minor articles, a few cassette holders and a used Wappler chest cassette changer were purchased for the X-ray department. No epidemic has existed in the hospital during the past two years, but during June, 1941, a few cases of chicken pox and whoop - ing cough occurred. Constant care and safeguards are maintained to prevent the entrance of contagion among the patients. Only a few deaths have occurred, and most of these were the end result of hope - less conditions and afflictions which cannot be cured. Various clubs, societies, business firms, lodges, and private in - dividuals have contributed to the amusement »nd comfort of the patients, and we wish to express our appreciation for all that has been done. Our gratitude is also extended to our co-workers for the interest they have shown in caring for the children committed to our care. 118 </seg>

         <seg id="p144">STATE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL KEARNEY, NEBRASKA The purpose of this j school is to rehabilitate those young men who have become delinquent in their communities. Our plan is to handle each case individually, because we have found through this procedure best results are obtained. It is our belief that the boys who come to us are not entirely responsible for their delinquency, since in a great majority of the cases the parents and the community are contributing factors. We try to impress upon each boy that he is sent to us for train - ing, and at every opportunity an effort is made to build tip con - fidence in the boy and to teach him how to accomplish things the right way. We endeavor to build and cement finer relations between the boy and the social agencies in his community. No forms of military discipline are employed. No corporal punish - ment is used. No rooms for solitary confinement exist. We have discarded uniforms for Sunday dress, issuing to each boy a new civilian suit when he arrives. We want our boys to live like an ordin - ary boy should. • It is our purpose to achieve character building through every member of our staff, teaching it constantly by example and instruc - tion. We cannot build confidence in our boys unless we have confi - dence in them. Every boy leaving this school will fall into either of two groups; a desirable and useful citizen, or an undesirable and costly citizen. Our goal is to make every boy a desirable and useful citizen. When a boy comes to us we meet this challenge. The results will be history. PROGRESS REPORTS. In order to evaluate the progress a boy is making in the school, a system of progress!reports is used. These reports are divided into three classifications 1: (1) Counsellor's Re - port. This report deals with the boy's home life, social habits, and Physical fitness; (2) Vocational Report. This report deals with the boy's achievements in the field of vocational training; (3) School Re - port. These reports deal with the boy's ability as a student in the field of education. All reports are made monthly in triplicate: one copy is filed in the Superintendent's files to be used when interview - ing: boys; one copy remains with the supervisor in his department, school, or cottage, and should the boy be transferred to another de - partment, school or cottage, the reports go along with him, the third 138 </seg>
         <seg id="p145">copy goes to the Director of Education and Vocational Training for his evaluation of the boy's progress. We find this report system very effective and a great improvement over the old Merit System. BOND OF HONOR. We believe considerable success has been achieved by. our, Bond of Honor system. The Bond of Honor is a certificate awarded by the Superintendent to boys whose progress re - ports are satisfactory. These certificates entitle boys to special privileges, such as: Being trusted about the institution; permitting them to leave the institution to spend the day with their parents; re - ceiving special recreation trips; going home on Christmas vacation. Bond of Honor boys wear Woe overalls. Boys of the non-Bond of Honor group wear brown overalls. This .Bond of Honor is the first goal a new boy works towards and it is a very coveted prize. PAROLE. Each month the Rehabilitation Committee, consisting of the Superintendent, Assistant Superintendent, Director of Educa - tion, Recreation Supervisor and Counsellors, meet to consider the progress of those.boys who are eligible for parole and make recom - mendations to the Case Committee for his parole. All boys' cases are discussed by the Rehabilitation Committee at the end of eight months and this committee either recommends a boy and sets a date for his case to be heard by the Case Committee,, or does not recommend him because of poor adjustment, or other reasons. If a boy fails to be recommended to the Case Committee at the time of consideration by the Rehabilitation Committee, the reason for such' failure is explained to him." ' '..- ; .¦ ' . '-'.;.'. '¦' ¦' ;;. .-'..:. ¦' ..¦ • . .. ./ ¦ . In reviewing the cases, the Rehabilitation Committee takes into consideration the hoy's conduct and behavior, progress in school and vocation, his problem before coming to the school, his family situation, school placement while on parole, and all other problems in the case. After a boy has been recommended to the Case Committee by the Rehabilitation Committee, the parole recommendation is sent by the Division of Child Welfare to the County Assistance Director of the county in which the boy resides, so that the worker may immediately begin formulating plans for his parole and placement. The Case Committee consists of a member of the Board of Con - trol, Representative of the Child Welfare Division, and the Superin - tendent of this school, and is the final committee that considers the boy's case. The representative of the Child Welfare Division pre - sents the. parole plans that have been made by the.County Assistance Director, and the Superintendent reports the progress and adjustment of the boy while at the institution. This committee either passes or rejects those considered for parole. In some instances, when it is deemed advisable, the cases are held over for another month until a 139 </seg>
         <seg id="p146">more suitable parole plan can be made. The purpose of this committee is to secure for a boy the very best parole arrangements possible. The approximate time between the recommendation of the Rehabilita - tion Committee and consideration by the Case Committee is three months. This period is needed in order to give the workers in the counties sufficient time to make thorough investigation and complete parole arrangements. The average boy is considered for parole after he has been at the school from eleven to twelve months. When the boy is paroled, he is under the supervision of the Division of Child Welfare, which delegates workers in the county in which the boy resides to act as his parole sponsor. All parole re - ports are made to the Child Welfare Division, copies of which are sent to this institution for its records. Philosophy of Education. In a broad sense, education in this institution is considered the process of achieving rehabilitation of the boys. The guiding principle in the educational plan is equipping the boys for effective living. Since life today is closely tied up with a person's vocation or life-calling, we can best equip boys to live ef - fectively by utilizing the basic factor in life today—vocations. We plan that each boy shall be given a program of education which, on the basis of available data, tests, and case studies, seems most likely to further the process of socialization and rehabilitation. . This educa - tional program includes vocational, academic, and, in the case of younger boys, pre-vocational training. The curriculum is developed with reference to the special needs of the boys of this institution. Plan of Organization. The maintenance work, construction work, the trades, and the educational programs are organized so that it will be possible for each boy to secure the maximum practical and re - habilitative training, in the limited time of his enrollment in the school and in such a way that the necessary maintenance and produc - tion activities of the institution are not neglected. All boys on the secondary level attend school one-half day in order to receive related. social and academic instruction; the remainder of the day being de - voted to trade training and maintenance work under direction, with definite educational purpose back of that direction. The schedule is so arranged that each boy is assigned to a program of study and work which will conform to his individual needs. In other words, the pro - gram is organized on an individualized basis, with adequate guidance and counseling preceding all training. Our aim is to have a well - balanced program of academic and vocational work with close correla - tion between the two types of training. Testing Program. In order to carry on a program of individual - ized education and training, the information for diagnosis and treat- 140 </seg>
         <seg id="p147">ment secured from tests is necessary. We use all means available to learn as much about the individual boy as possible. Through Mr. H. G. Salter, Director of Education for the Board of Control, all boys in the school are given intelligence tests. At least two I. Q.'b are obtained for each boy. In some cases, it has been found advisable to give a third test. At present, the Revised Stanford Achievement tests are being given to all boys entering the institution. For an adequate vocational program, we must have aptitude ratings along with intelli - gence and achievement ratings. Aptitude tests arid interest blanks are used as the occasion warrants in planning a program of treatment for the boy. Guidance. After having determined, through tests and inter - views, the boy's capacities, abilities, and interests, a program is worked out for the individual boy through which these can be developed. The guidance committee utilizes records, observation, and interview data. The boy is made to feel that he is instrumental in outlining his program so that he will see the necessity of doing various things, and see their relation to his work and his future. Clarification. The most effective training can result only when there is proper selection of boys for training. Through the classifica - tion committee the institutional program of education is based upon scientific findings rather than mere guess work. At the close of the classification period we try to have: (1) Case history completed; (2) Physical, mental, emotional appraisement made; (3) Remedial program outlined. Elementary Education. Our elementary program is comprehen - sive and individualized enough to meet the wide variety of individual differences found in such a school. The work is patterned to meet the requirements of the public school system. However, methods of instruction are more individualized. Public schools are concentrating more and more upon the needs of the individual pupil. It is doubly important that we teach upon the basis of individual needs. Since ninety per cent of the children admitted to. correctional institutions are retarded,from one to seven years, it behooves us to develop a method of instruction which is an improvement upon the methods of the schools that failed to meet their needs. It is the problem of this school to use a method of instruction which will permit each boy to progress at a rate suited to Ms particular intellectual endowment, also to offer subject matter in each grade suited to the age and experience of the boy v even though the age range in a grade be from eleven to eighteen. It is our aim to have eventually all elementary work or - ganized on the unit plan of instruction. This plan has been proven to be well adapted to the needs of an'institutional population. It pro- 141 </seg>
         <seg id="p148">vides for a high degree of individualization anu is also distinctly ef - fective in such a school because of the irregular entrance and' exit from classes at all times of the year. Each teacher in the elementary school has developed teaching materials for her grades which meet the needs of the individual pupils in these grades. In the preparing of these units for individual work, the results of achievement tests are utilized so that the material pre - sented to the individual boy will be within his capacity and interest. A program for the training of teachers toward a better understanding of our educational philosophy and techniques has been instituted. Teacher committees have been organized and assistance given the teachers in the development of their courses. The following teacher training devices have been employed: Personal conferences and dis - cussions relative to the best procedures; group meetings of instructors; sample instructional units furnished the teachers; text books and sample materials furnished; supervision of classes. A teachers' man - ual which contains suggestions and directions for achieving desired results is being prepared. Secondary Education. Very definite accomplishments have been made in the reorganization of the high school curriculum during the past few years. The school has also been steadily advancing in the expansion of the physical plant and equipment. As the budget will allow, the program for the coming year is being further enriched, additional equipment added, and the reference library expanded. An old building has been remodeled to serve as an agricultural shop; new courses have been added, and, in some cases, substituted for others. Courses included in the curriculum are practical and also of great value in establishing desirable social attitudes. The course of study includes subjects of marked benefit for boys who plan to continue schooling as well as for those boys who plan to immediately enter a vocation. Consumers Science was instituted last year. This course is constructed from the point of view of the consumers' needs. Agri - culture Shop is a practical course which includes forge work, welding, tractor repair, and general farm implement maintenance. Personal Hygiene and Safety teaches boys to adopt better habits of dress and bodily care. A portion of the course is devoted to First Aid. Highway safety and the intelligent driving of an automobile or truck is also taught. This course is supplemented by lectures by members oi the Nebraska Highway Safety Patrol. Drafting and Lettering includes units in show card lettering, drafting for air conditioning, drafting for printers, and drafting for the different vocational branches. Each student is taught the type of drafting to fit his individual require - ments and vocational needs. 4-H Club Work. Through the coopera - tion of the County Agricultural Agent, a number of boys, taking the agricultural course, can further participate in farm and dairy activities 142 </seg>
         <seg id="p149">Dy having, a special project and doing club work. Sociology. This course for juniors and seniors is a splendid medium for developing wholesome social attitudes. English courses have been modified in that more grammar, spelling, composition and oral English is substi - tuted for sections of American and English literature. Related Eng - lish for printers is also taught. Applied Mathematics has been modi - fied to include related mathematics for printers, shoe repair, baking, laundry practice and mathematics needed in other trades. The student selects academic courses related to his trade training program, interests and capacities. Vocational Training. All vocational shops such as printing, laundry, shoe shop, bakery, and the like are organized on an instruc - tional basis. Each boy entering a shop for training, receives a com - plete outline of the course of instruction in the trade. It is our de - sire and intent to make all the industrial shops genuine training cen - ters. We do not attempt to produce, during the boy's relatively short stay in the school, a skilled tradesman. He will, however, be a well - qualified apprentice in his trade. All maintenance work, including dormitory, dining room, kitchen, and plumbing is utilized for its vocational training values. Trade analysis and instruction sheets have, been, or are being prepared for all training activities. . The school educational director works with the tradesmen, matrons, and supervisors in the development of occu - pational analysis, progress records, and instruction sheets. Through the re-organization of all trades and maintenance jobs on a trade training basis, we have established a keener desire and interest in developing superior skills at all occupational levels for which the boys have capacities. Through close correlation with the selected academic subjects and special related Information Booklets, a broader concept of the trade and allied fields has been established. . The first step in the preparation of teaching materials for the various. trades was the making of an Analysis of the Trade. Each tradesman filled out an analysis sheet for his trade. From these trade analyses, teaching unite for each trade are prepared. These teaching materials include: (1) Operation Sheets; (2) Job Sheets; (3) Re - lated Information Booklets; (4) Charts and other visual aids. In the printing trade, for instance, there are prepared some twenty opera - tion sheets which describe the various operations in the shop. They start with simple: type setting .and continue up to the operations of the. Intertype and the Automatic Press. Related Information Book - lets tend to round out the tradesman's general knowledge. These booklets supply the needed English, mathematics, drafting, science and safety practices. In printing, as an example, some of the sub- 143 </seg>
         <seg id="p150">jects included are: A Study of Inks; A Study of Paper; Art and Design in Printing; Value of Proper Spacing; Color Harmony; Bal - ance and Proportion in Display; and, a study in itself, The Printers' Mathematics. Progress records are kept in each trade. It is of the Utmost importance that the teacher maintain a record of pupil progress throughout the training period. Such a chart enables an instructor to "fill in" the missing experience of individual students. Without such a checking device, it would be very easy for students to "com - plete" a course minus some fundamental experience. The progress record is also a source of information necessary to effective place - ment in a trade. ¦ ' RECREATION The recreation program arranged by our physical education director provides year-around activities through seasonal sports. Our high school is a member of the Nebraska High School Athletic As - sociation and our teams play regularly scheduled games with other accredited high schools throughout Central Nebraska. The equipment of our teams can be compared with that of any other high school in our vicinity. Approximately thirty boys comprise the football squads. Games are scheduled generally on two-year contracts, played naif on the home football field and half in neighboring towns. Our basketball teams play full schedule games with other high schools in this vicinity, with usually about eighteen boys making up the squads. During the past two years, our boxing teams have competed with other high schools on numerous occasions. Twice they won team trophies, and many individual trophies and awards. Besides our high school athletic programs we have intramural basketball games throughout the winter months. These create much interest and rivalry among the boys. During the summer the baseball teams play approximately two games a week with teams from other towns, their opponents in most cases being American Legion Baseball teams. A number of our boys each year enter the Golden Gloves Boxing Tournament, several having won the District Championship, and one winning the State Lightweight Championship. This boy was awarded a trip with the Nebraska Boxing Team to the Golden Gloves Midwest Finals held in Chicago and he also accompanied the Nebraska' Team to the National A. A. U. Tournament held in Boston, Massachusetts 144 </seg>
         <seg id="p151">Our plan is to create in every boy an interest in some form of athletic activity. In order to achieve this aim, we also sponsor soft ball, hone shoes, soccer, volley ball, swimming, ice skating:, track and tennis. The progress made in our athletic program has been gratify - ing and we are confident that on numerous occasions it has been the turning-point in a boy'a adjustment at this institution. In addition to our regular athletic program under our physical education director, we offer, during the evenings of the winter months, classes in archery, crafts, shuffle board and darts carried on under the supervision of capable W. P. A. instructors. • Amateur programs, consisting ot instrumental and vocal selec - tions, impersonations, skits, plays, tap dancing, Hill Billy Bands and Professor Quit programs, are encouraged and are held semi-monthly in our gymnasium. These are arranged and conducted entirely by the boys. Movies are shown each Wednesday evening during the winter months. Through our recreational activities the boys often come in contact with the public, when making trips locally and to other towns. Groups of the privileged boys are taken to shows in Kearney each week. RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES Religious training and Bible study are encouraged at this school. Chapel services are held every Sunday afternoon with clergymen from the Kearney churches in charge. The clergymen rotate, each taking his turn for the Sunday exercises. Catholic services are held twice each month with the local priest in charge. Sunday School is held each Sunday morning in the respective cottages. A number of the local ministers meet monthly with boys who are members of their particular church and give them further religious instruction. This is encouraged. ; ; .'. :: .•;,. ¦¦¦¦¦' ', '¦: :' MUSIC ;" ; /;' . Our music department is a part of our educational program. Our musical instructor works full-time throughout the year with musical 'units/:.: ';'" '¦.'¦-. ¦ ' '¦ '' ¦ ¦ .','. ¦ ¦ ' .'¦ ".;"'. '¦• -..; ¦¦¦'. '¦ :.., '. .;¦ ..'-. A Senior band of approximately thirty members, for whom new uniforms have been made, gives weekly concerts during the summer on our institution campus and makes many trips locally and to neigh - boring towns for band engagements. Another unit is our Junior band, which serves as a feeder or - ganization for our Senior band. The purpose of the Junior band is to give every boy who is interested in music, a trial If he is inter- 145 </seg>
         <seg id="p152">ested and talented he soon moves up into the Senior band The number of boys in this unit at most times exceeds the number in the Senior band. Very few boys who come to the institution have ever had any musical training. The Drum Corps, consisting of twenty boys, is another unit. During the past two years, they were equipped with new uniforms and bugles and the drums were repaired and painted. This probably is the most colorful of our musical units. th. »Tl% thl VT tW° yearS&gt; a "eW unit was inst*uted, known as the Hill Billy Band, composed of fifteen members. These boys have attained harmony that was hard to surpass. They are, without doubt the most popular organization of our school and receive more re - quests for appearances than can be filled. They appear in radio programs over the local radio station. n ,r The MCh°ol° f approximately thirty members provided music for our weekly Chapel Services and has been invited to sing in many churches and rehgious gatherings. They also furnished music for the outdoor community services held in our local park. A majority of the boys at the institution take part in one or more of our musical units. We feel that music should not be taught w" much from the vocational standpoint as from the standpoint of music appreciation and avocational interest. HEALTH A local physician is a member of our staff and has regular office hours at the ?nstitution every Sunday, Monday, Wednesday and Fri - day, as well as being on call at any time. A registered nurse is in charge of our hospital, assists the physician and takes care of minor cases that do not require the doctor's attention. Upon admission to the school each boy is given a thorough physi - cal examination by our school physician. A complete physical record is made and kept during his stay at the school. Each boy is weighed monthly and the doctor's attention called to any unusual loss of weight. Upon entrance the fol!owin&lt;? tests are given: Wasserman, repeated in six weeks; Diphtheria Toxoid; Small Pox Vaccination; Mantoux Skin Test, and Unnalysis. AH boys showing a positive Mantoux are X-rayed. No active cases of tuberculosis were found during the past two years. At any sign of communicable disease the boy is isolated and properly treated. 146 </seg>
         <seg id="p153">Particular attention is paid to all disfigurements or physica; handicaps which may be retarding a boy's progress in developing into a normal individual. If surgical treatment is recommended by the physician, this is done. Operations of a minor nature are performed . - in the school hospital; all emergency major operations are transferred to the Good Samaritan Hospital in Kearney; and all chronic or ortho - pedic surgery is transferred to the State Orthopedic Hospital at Lincoln. ¦¦¦. ' ''; .¦¦"¦¦ ¦ \-'¦'¦.'¦'":: '¦•/.}¦- ¦: Our aim is that all boys leaving the institution be in as good physical condition as modern medical science can make them. ;;... A local dentist is also a member of our regular staff and con - ducts regular office hours one full day each week at the schools. He is also subject to call at any time for an emergency. ; Upon admittance every boy is given a thorough dental examina - tion by our school dentist, a complete index card with teeth chart is made and all necessary dental work is done immediately. All boys are examined at six-month intervals and their teeth cleaned. How - ever, examination and treatment is given more often, if necessary. If teeth have been lost or are removed for any cause, all necessary bridge work is done. ¦ V ; Individual instruction as to the proper care of teeth and gums is given each boy by the dentist. Tooth brushes and tooth paste are furnished so that proper mouth hygiene.can be carried out. AGRICULTURE The school owns a total of 602 acres of land which approximately 260 acres are under irrigation, 22 horses and 2 tractors being used in its cultivation. The remainder of the land is used for pasture and campus. Inasmuch as Nebraska is an agricultural state we feel that agri - culture should be our dominant vocation. Whjle our land is produc - tive and much in the way of revenue is secured from the tilling of our soil, we believe that the greatest gain is the experience and in - struction which the boys receive in the use of tractora, horses and general farm machinery. The crops which we raise are those which are to be found on any farm in this locality. ; -..'..;: ' . Different methods of irrigation are. carried out and each is explained to the boys by competent instructors. Farming is a very popular vocation during the summer months. ..' :• ¦¦¦•['. .•¦¦',. '¦ [ '.;'". We also maintain a garden and orchard where, all vegetables and; fruits acclimated to this locality are produced. The care of the 147 </seg>
         <seg id="p154">garden crop is explained in detail, also the handling of trees, pruning, spraying and handling of fruits. Usually much more garden truck ta produced than can be consumed by this institution and much of our surplus goes to other institutions. Our dairy herd of one hundred thirteen head, from which milk and cream is furnished to this institution and to the Hospital for Tuberculosis, ranks as one of the best in the state. The experience and instruction -which the boys receive in handling of cattle is of great value. They are taught to keep records of cattle; how to keep milk charts; proper kinds and amounts of feed to be fed to dairy cattle; handling of young calves; judging of different types of dairy cattle; and caring for the health of cattle. Each year this institution raises a large number of hogs, having three hundred forty-seven head at the present time. The boys are taught how to select good brood sows; the care of hogs while farrow - ing; proper measurements of feed; proper feeding; and the proper time for market. A modern poultry plant is maintained in which there are two thousand one hundred and nine chickens and one hundred seventy - five turkeys at the present time. The proper care of fowls from the time they are received as baby chicks; how to feed the broilers; time for disposing; proper mixture of mash and grain that should be fed; sanitation that is necessary for the health of the fowls; proper brood - ing of baby chicks and turkey poults; all are stressed in this depart - ment, and the boys have a thorough knowledge of all phases of poultry raising by an experienced poultryman. In all of our agricultural vocations it is emphasized that these departments are vocational training departments and during the school year the instructor in vocational agriculture instructs the boys from text books as to the fundamentals of Agriculture. The agri - culture units are laboratories in which the practical side of the in - struction can be carried out. TRADE VOCATIONS BAKERY. This department furnished the institution and the Hospital for Tuberculosis with all bakery supplies, including bread, cookies, sweet rolls, pies and cakes. '¦":¦'. For those who are interested in learning the baking trade, this department affords an excellent opportunity. Under the direction of an experienced baker the boys are taught in complete detail the different steps necessary in obtaining high quality products. 148 </seg>
         <seg id="p155">BARBER SHOP. A wen-equipped barber shop is maintained and sixteen boys are being taught the fundamentals of barbering by a licensed barber, who gives them four hours instruction each week. The boys enjoy the classes in barbering and a number of them become excellent barbers. , . ENGINEERING. This is the most popular department in this school. We find many boys are very anxious to learn to be mechan - ics. We endeavor to teach them stationary engineering and some of them become expert in the firing of boilers, which are equipped with natural gas. Sometimes there is much rivalry between the dif - ferent shifts in seeing who can fire the most economically. This department also cares for the electric wiring, conduit and plumbing, the pumps and pumping of water for institution use, and the use of acetylene welding. Boys are taught the practical knowledge of these trades, also the operation of cold storage plants and ice machines. ¦ ."'.. : CARPENTERING. This,work, for the most part, is done by the Industrial Arts department and includes taking care of general repair of the institution, thus giving the boys the necessary practical ex - perience. Repairing of chairs, tables, and other furniture; making of new furniture;, repairing of doors and windows, and many other types of repair work and carpentry are included in this department. . LAUNDRY. The boys in this department are taught to wash, mangle, and finish all types of clothing, under the supervision of a capable instructor. They are taught the proper amount of soap, sodas and alkalis to use, correct temperature of water and all the training that any apprentice in a commercial laundry would receive. The boys take pride in the quality of work which they turn out. PRINT SHOP. Those interested in printing can receive train - ing that will equip them to go into any print shop and work as an experienced apprentice. They are taught to operate an intertype machine; cylinder press; job press; how to set up forms; how to edit a small magazine; bow to cut paper economically and all the different steps in printing are taught them by a competent printing instructor.'. :y..- '[; V '¦" ';. . '."¦ ¦/.. '.;¦.¦¦¦ '¦;¦.¦¦¦ .- ¦ '¦• '¦, ¦ This department prints all formß for this institution, also many forms for other institutions and the Board of Control. SHOE SHOP. This department makes and repairs shoes for the institution. Air of the phases of shoe cobbling are taught by a capable instructor and boys leaving the school are fitted for employment in almost any commercial shoe repair shop. 149 </seg>
         <seg id="p156">TAILOR SHOP. Those interested in the tailoring trade have an opportunity to learn the art of tailoring from a capable instructor who teaches them how to make civilian suits and all the steps neces - sary to the tailor trade. In addition to making civilian suits, this de - partment also makes many articles used by the institution and does all of the institution repair work. FOOD. The institution maintains a dining room and kitchen where the food for the boys is prepared and served, and a dining room and kitchen where the food for the staff is prepared and served. The boys in the kitchens are taught by competent instructors, how to prepare food in quantities; how to season food; how to cook all kinds of meats, vegetables, and cereals. They are also taught the cost of meals and of what a balanced meal consists. Instruction which they received in these departments qualifies them to work in res - tuarants and cafes. The boys in the dining rooms are taught how to set tables swiftly and courteously, and how the food should be placed on the tables. Also, the caring for dishes and silverware, and many of the different: details that would be required of them if they were employed as a waiter in a hotel or restaurant are taught.

R Nash, was called in November, 1940, and is now in active duty ,n the Phillipine Islands. Dr. Robert A. Coen was called in April and is now in the Psychiatric Service at Fort Crook, Nebraska. Dr. Geshell, who completed his two years of residence July 1 is re - placing Dr. Nash as Assistant Superintendent. The vacancy created by Dr. Schubert Knittel is now filled by Dr. Oscar A. Kanner, who is also Pathologist for the Mary Lanning Hospital. Dr. David Witter * replaced by Dr. E. A. Thomas as Dental Surgeon. WVhave ™- cancies in four Psychiatric Residencies. Many of our nurses are now in the Army. Three of them en - tered directly from our service. Only one attendant has gone to the Army and four have joined the Navy during this period. 168 </seg>
         <seg id="p175">DEPARTMENT OP NURSING The affiliate school of 4 months and the graduate school of 1 year in Psychiatric Nursing are approved and accredited by the Com - mittee on Nursing of the American Psychiatric Association. Daring the Biennium, the following schools have sent students for 4 months affiliation in Psychiatry at this hospital: Bryan Memorial Hospital, Lincoln, Nebraska. Lincoln General Hospital, Lincoln, Nebraska. * St. Elizabeth's Hospital, Lincoln, Nebraska. Immanuel Deaconess Hospital, Omaha, Nebraska. . Nebraska Methodist Hospital, Omaha, Nebraska. ;¦'•" Mary Lanning Memorial Hospital, Hastings, Nebraska. St. Joseph's Hospital, Alliance, Nebraska. West Nebraska Methodist Hospital, Scottsbluff, Nebraska. ' The Nursing School and the Schools of Psychiatric Nursing be - ing under one department, labor jointly tor. the progressive and adequate nursing care of all patients in this hospital, and for the education and training of student nurses and attendants so they will be properly equipped to give such care to psychiatric patients as they may be called upon to do. During the biennium, 192 certificates have been given for the successful completion of 4 months affiliation. Seventeen diplomas have been issued for the successful completion of one year post grad - uate, -work in Psychiatric Nursing. The classes for attendants or 'Psychiatric Aides have been organized. All new attendants have been instructed by formal demonstrations, lectures and discussions. This course is still undergoing development. We wish to express appreciation and recognition for the loyal and competent service of Miss Lillian V. Salsman without whose en - ergetic and intelligent leadership this department could not have functioned so successfully. POPULATION &gt; Because of lack of construction at the other hospitals, it was necessary for us to receive the over-flow of patients from the entire state. Our population has therefore increased during this biennium from 1656 to 1764: We have therefore been unable to evacuate the main building which has been. considered unsafe for the housing of patients for several years. Because of certain parts of this building 169 </seg>
         <seg id="p176">being extremely unsafe, it was thought wise to discontinue the use of the top f'.oor on the south side where the vibration of the building and the leaky roof has continually endangered the lives of patients from falling plaster. The general health of our population during the biennium has been good in that we have had no epidemics. As will be seen from Table 1, we have admitted and readmitted 792 cases and we have discharged 373, or 46%. During the same time the number still oh parole away from the institution increased from 259 to 329. Of the patients discharged, their condition at the time of their parole is listed in Table 14. The length of time in the hospital of the patients! discharged is as follows: LENGTH OF TIME IN HOSPITAL FOR PATIENTS DISCHARGED JULY 1, 1939 to JUNE 30, 19*1 '. -. ruder 3 mo.

All new admissions to the hospital are tuberculin tested. Positive reactions receive additional diagnostic aids in the form of Roentgenogram, blood studies, sputum analysis and careful physical examinations. When it has been proven that tubercular activity is present, these patients receive physiological rest in our tubercular wards. In addition, since March, 1940, a selected number have re - ceived artificial pneumothorax treatments. A total of 10 patients have received 334 treatments. During the past two years 37 patients have been admitted to the tuberculosis service. Up to the present time 10 of this number have expired, 43 are considered arrested and 34 active. DENTAL DEPARTMENT The Dental Department, of which Dr. E. A. Thomas is now in charge, has done very useful work. The department consists of the Dentist, an assistant at the chair, and an assistant in the Laboratory. Tabulation of work during the biennium is as follows: 170 </seg>

Duringr the bienniura there were 421 patients admitted, of which 261 were men and 160 were women. There were 94 patients discharged outright, 117 discharged while on parole, and 110 removed by death. At the end of the period 1,375 patients re - mained in the hospital, 104 were on parole, and 9 were on escape. The high rate of admission was due to the opening of the new ward building in July, 1940. Many of the cases had been committed for some time and were being cared for in county and private hos - pitals until there was room available in the state hospital. The bien - nium was started with an overcrowded condition. Patients were sleeping on mattresses on the floor and two in a bed, and many day halls had beds in them. This condition was corrected in July, 1940, with the opening of the new 330-bed ward building. Approximately 150 patients were transferred from the rest of the institution in order to relieve the overcrowded condition before taking in new patients. There have been a number of changes in the personnel. Dr. R. H. Spradling resigned as assistant superintendent and Dr. Franklin L. Spradling was appointed to the position of assistant superintendent September 23, 1939/ Dr. Richard W. Gray, a graduate of the Uni - versity of Nebraska, was appointed as a resident physician on J«ly 15, 1939. Dr. George W. Russell, who had been associated with the 191 </seg>
         <seg id="p198">medical staff since February, 1938, resigned July 31, 1940, to enter private practice in Washington, D. C. Dr. Edward R. Miller, who had been a physician on the staff since July, 1938, resigned October 1, 1940, to enter the Federal service. Dr. Henry Wermer of Howard, Rhode Island, was appointed assistant physician October 1, 1940. Dr. Janet Forbes of Lincoln, Nebraska, was appointed assistant physi - cian June 1, 1941. Because of the national emergency and the low salaries, it is becoming more and more difficult to maintain adequate medical staffs. In January, 1940, the nursing service was reorganized, and Hiss Ruth E. Thomas, R. N., was appointed director of the nursing ser - vice. By bringing the entire nursing service—both men and women —under the direction of a phychiatric nurse, the nursing care given to patients has been greatly improved. The surgical unit has been remodeled and new sterilizers and equipment installed. All major surgery is done by a staff consisting of a general surgeon, orthopedic surgeon, gynecologist, and ophthal - mologist. During the biennium the following surgery was performed: Internal fixation of fracture of neck of femur by Smith-Peterson nail 8 Removal of neck tumor j Removal of breast tumor "I""I ~~i Removal of Smith-Peterson pin "IHII-III" "l Removal of cord and testicle -__~111~ "~\ Reduction of hernia j Appendectomies " ~~~g Herniotomies ~ ~ ~» Anterior and posterior colporrhaphy _ i Excision of right fifth toe IIIIIIIII" ' "i Cholecystectomies 11— """3 Enucleation of eye ~" "« Biopsy of gland of left axilla I-IIIIIIIII™ 1 Mastoidectomy _ .""""»' Since new equipment was installed just before the close of the last biennium and the service reorganized, there have been no par - ticular changes made in the X-ray department. We continue to have the full-time services of a registered technician and the service of a radiologist, who interprets the films, twice a week.

Insulin shock treatment is still the choice,of treatment for: selected cases of schizophrenia. Metrazol shock therapy is largely limited to cases of involutibnal Melancholia and depressions. In spite of the fact that the results of metrazol therapy have been good from a psychiatric standpoint, the treatment had. somewhat fallen into disrepute because of a rather, high percentage of frac - tures. To eliminate this risk, a drug—Curare-r.was introduced to modify the metrazol convulsion/ The Lincoln State Hospital was one of the first hospitals to introduce the'-'treatment, and much of the early research work was carried' on By our physicians. A paper, "Curare—lts Use in Modifying Metrazol Therapy," was published in the Psychiatric Quarterly in January, 1941. The use of Curare as a modifying agent for metrazol therapy has gained wide use in the past year. About six months ago another form of shock treatment known as electroshock was made available for our patients. It ap - pears that electroshpck may quite largely replace the use of metrazol. Although the results are encouraging, it is too early to evaluate properly its position as a therapeutic agent. Curare is used with this form 'of shock, treatment the-same as with metrazoj. -' During the bierinium the hydrotherapy departments were com - pletely rebuilt and new equipment installed. We now have adequate facilities for both tonic and sedative purposes. The use of hydro - therapy has reduced the use of restrain^ and sedatives materially. The occupational therapy departmentr-nas been moved into new quarters in the new ward building. Up: to that time there were facilities for women patients only. The new quarters provide a de - partment for men and one for women, and both are quite well equipped- Occupational therapy has always been an' important'method of treatment, not only in part of the treatment" program for acute cases but also a material, aid in preventing further' deterioration in cases requiring continued Aospitalizationi uThesTeereatiotf department has conducted weekly dances;:Vw.eeJOy'picture'shows, and picnics dur- 195 </seg>

The occupational and recreational therapy depart - ments are under the direction of a graduate therapist. The cosmetologist reports the following work done in the beauty shop during the past two years: Shampoos 6,655 Waves 7,547 Manicures 1,459 Facials 135 Scalp Treatments 296 Haircuts 512 Neck Clips 706 Permanents 492 The fever therapy department was opened during the biennium, and we have the services of a trained nurse-technician. All favorable cases of neurosyphilis are treated by combined artificial fever and chemotherapy. During the biennium a 330-bed ward building was constructed and opened in July, 1940. An employees' building accommodating a hundred employees was completed just before the close of-the bien - nium. In addition, there were many other improvements accomplished, largely through an extensive W. P. A. program. The R. H., C, H, L, X and Chapel buildings were redecorated. All the roofs, with the exception of the Center building, were repaired. Windows were weatherstripped throughout the institution, and the brick walls of C, H, and B buildings were repainted. The heating Bystem was im - proved. Sidewalks and curbs were built and considerable grading and landscaping was done. A request was made to rebuild the Center building, which houses the administration offices, living quarters for a number of employees, and eight wards, which accommodate 330 patients. This building, which is now seventy years old, is not only in a very poor state of repair, but is a fire hazard. The B building, the second oldest building, accommodating 150 women, is in need ot repair. Although some work has been done on it by W. P. A., there are not sufficient funds to complete the work. The laundry building is not only too small, but beyond repair. In recent months it has become necessary to run the laundry seven days a week in order to take care of all the necessary laundry. Likewise, the power house is a very old building as well as being in a poor state of repair, and it should be replaced. The old reservoir at the pumping station is not only in a poor state of repair but is definitely unsanitary and should be replaced at an early data : 196 </seg>

It is a very com - prehensive report and we wish to acknowledge our appreciation for the manner in which Dr. Brinegar is carrying on the work of the Clinical Director. 214 </seg>
         <seg id="p221">For the first time in the last twenty-five years of this Institu - tion, we have had a complete change in our Staff within a period of two months—from December, 1940 to February, 1941. Three of our Doctors went into Army service, one Doctor resigned to accept a better paying position in another State Institution, and one of tmr Doctors became ill, and is still away on leave of absence due to his illness. The matter of replacing these staff members has been no easy task. Doctors, at this particular time, due to Army mobilization, are very scarce, and, because of our low salaries for medical men, the Nebraska institutions are not attractive to men who might be inter - ested in this line of work. Since our last,report, our new Farm Ward Cottage has been finished and occupied. This is a very fine type of building, the building is especially well constructed, and it renders a long needed service, a« well as relieves our much over-crowded condition on the . male wards. .;¦' --:" ;: :'. ¦ .'.' :' : ' .; ¦ ;' ¦¦ ¦ ¦ . ' Our new Employees Building, another very fine building, was also completed and occupied during this period. It provides very comfortable quarters for forty-eight employees. , The over-crowded condition of our female wards continues, with about forty female patients on the waiting list. However, relief is in sight, with the Legislature appropriating funds for a new ward build - ing for our institution during the coming biennium. ¦ From funds appropriated by the Legislature for the 1941-1943 biennium, the Board of Control has purchased the remaining eighty acres of land of the section which the State now owns. ;¦• Through the efforts of the Board of Control, we have had some very important WPA projects. Among them are general repair of the main Kitchen and Employees Dining Room building, a new reser - voir, sidewalks and curbing, besides general repair and painting of wards.' ; : . •¦, •.\ ¦- ' &#132;¦: ¦".! .;¦¦ ¦ ;' . '¦¦'.'.'¦¦ ¦¦''•:.¦." ,;./ . . '-.'¦¦'¦¦' During this biennium new generators, engines, and equipment were purchased and installed in our Power House, which has enabled us to change from the'use of direct current to alternating current. This is a change we have been contemplating for a number of yean. We still feel, as we have mentioned in previous reports, that more psychiatric research work should be done. A central factor in the burdensome problem of state hospital maintenance is Dementia Praecox—a formidable foe to mankind. Because its victims usually remain hospitalized for many years, and because there have been so few recoveries in the past, half the beds of all state hospitals are 215 </seg>
         <seg id="p222">occupied by patients suffering from this one mental ailment. The promising results of the newer forma of treatment, such as Insulin, Metrazol and Electric Shock therapy, offer a hope of increasing re - covery rate from this disease, though it remains to be seen how complete and lasting the cures are as compared with those obtained by the more conventional methods of treatment. Valuable as these therapeutic measures are in opening up new avenues of study and experiment, they have so far thrown little light on the real nature and causes of Dementia Praecox, and more light is badly needed. Eminent psychiatrists recognize the necessity for a more fundamental and thoroughgoing approach to the study of this problem. . We desire to express our grateful appreciation of the support and cooperation given us by the officers and employees of the Hos - pital. The following is a clinical report covering the Biennium begin - ning July 1, 1939 and ending June 30, 1941. An acknowledgment of indebtedness for much of the information contained in this report is made to Dr. G. L. Sandritter, former Clinical Director, for records left by him. During the past biennium there has been a complete turnover of our Medical Staff, due mainly to the mobilization of the Army, and to the fact that most of the members of our Medical Staff had Re - serve Commissions in the Armed Forces. Dr. Paul L. Barnes joined our Medical Staff July 1, 1939. We regret that it was necessary to give him an extended leave of absence because of illness, effective November 5, 1940. Dr. Barnes is a very capable Psychiatric Physi - cian and was well lilted here. It is our hope that he will soon be able to rejoin us. Dr. E. E. Pate left the service of this Hospital on December 18, 1940, to accept a position at the Florida State Hospital at Chattahoochee, Florida. Dr. Charles G. Ingham was called to active duty with the Army, effective December 20, 1940. Because of temporary shortage of physicians, through the kindness of Dr. J. C. Nielsen, Superintendent of the Hastings State Hospital at Ingle - side, Dr. Johann Marx of Dr. Nielsen's staff, served with us from January 6th to February 28th, 1941, at which time he returned to Ingleside. On January 9, 1941 Dr. G. L. Sandritter, our Clinical Director and Assistant Superintendent, was called to active service with the Army. Dr. A. E. Coletti resigned January 25, 1941, in** order to accept a position with the Veterans Administration, and since that time he, too, has been called to active duty in the Army. Dr. Elbert Baker, a graduate of the St. Louis School of Medicine, who had been in general practice, joined our Staff on January 15, 1941, and left our service on May 31, 1941. Dr. O. R. Holloway, a 216 </seg>
         <seg id="p223">graduate of the University of Arkansas, College of Medicine, who has had previous psychiatric training in the Arkansas State. Hospital, and the Colorado State Hospital, reported for duty on November 15, 1940. Dr. H. S. Sager, a graduate of the University of Toronto, Col - lege of Medicine, assumed his duties as Resident in Psychiatry lor one year, starting December 30, 1940. Dr. E. J. Delehanty, a grad - uate of the University of Colorado, College of Medicine, who has had psychiatric training in the Colorado State Hospital, and has been in private practice in Psychiatry; joined our staff on February 20, 1941. Dr. W. C. Brinegar, graduate of the University of Nebraska, College of Medicine, who has had psychiatric training in the Massachusetts State Hospital system, reported for duty February 28, 1941, filling the position of Clinical Director and Assistant Superintendent left vacant by Dr. Sandritter's call to active service in the Army. Dr. George Frankl, a graduate of the University of Vienna, College of Medicine, who has had psychiatric training in various European Hos - pitals and at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, joined our Staff on June 7, 1941. ;¦; During the summer of 194* three Senior Medical Students from the University of Nebraska, served here as Jrnior Interns, and during the summer of 1941, four Senior Medical students from the same school are serving here in a similar capacity. We feel that the train - ing of medical students, as Interns, in Psychiatry, is a very important function of a mental hospital, and we only regret that it is not pos - sible for all medical students to have a similar service. Many of the interns whom we have had here in years past, have shown continued interest in Psychiatry, and have later joined the staff of this Hospital, or other mental hospitals. We are certain that even those who do not follow Psychiatry as a specialty, are much better equipped for general practice, or even for other specialties, than those who have not had this training. We also believe that the responsibility of teaching these Interns during the Summer is an excellent stimulant to our regular Staff. , \ Our Pathology Department has been greatly improved by the addition to our Staff, In December of 1939, of Dr. Charles P. Baker, on a part-time basis. Dr. Baker is a certified Pathologist who is head of the Department of Pathology in the Methodist Hospital in Omaha, and an instructor in Pathology at the University of Nebraska, College of Medicine. He was formerly a Fellow in Pathology of the Mayo Foundation. He does the majority of our autopsy work, and has been very conscientious in responding to calls to come here from Omaha at any hour of the day or night that is necessary, in order to carry on this work. In addition to the autopsy work and work of surgical specimens, he holds a Clinical Pathological Conference each month. 217 </seg>
         <seg id="p224">These meetings are usually held here at this hospital and aIV of the Physicians in the surrounding territory are invited. These meetings have been well attended and give an excellent opportunity to our Staff as well as the other Physicians in this part of the State, to further their knowledge of pathology and consequently, to increase their judgment in diagnosis and treatment. Some of these meeting!) have been held in conjunction with the staff meetings of the Lutheran Hospital of Norfolk, and we believe these have been of special benefit both to our Staff and to the Staff of the Lutheran Hospital. Several of the latter have expressed the opinion that they got more out of these meetings than any other medical meeting which they attend. In addition, we believe that these meetings furnish a wholesome contact between our staff Physician and the other Physicians of this and surrounding counties, which helps us to get our patients earlier so we can do more for them, and in other ways coordinate our work with that of the outside Physicians. This Hospital has also been fortunate in securing the services of a full-time dentist, Dr. W. H. Eaton, who assumed his duties Septem - ber 1, 1939. We believe that the^adequate dental care, which our patients are now receiving, has improved their general health aa well as the condition of their teeth. Many of our patients have been pro - vided with artificial dentures, which were badly needed, and therefore their general health and nutrition has been greatly improved. It has also been our fortune to be able to secure autopsy per - mission on a very large percentage of the patients who have died during the last two years. We believe this has been due to the efforts of the members of our Medical Staff, and to the fact that we have a competent Pathologist to make our post-mortem examinations. Oc - casionally it is impossible for our Pathologist to come out from Omaha for autopsies, due to the fact that relatives wish to claim the body so soon that there is not sufficient time for Dr. Baker to make the trip from Omaha. In these cases the autopsy is performed by members of our Medical Staff, but the specimens are sent to Dr. Baker for microscopic examination. The general health of our hospital population has been good during this past biennium. During the widespread epidemic of mild Influenza, which involved most of North America, during the winter of 1940-1941, we had many cases at the Hospital, but we are happy to be able to report that all of these made a complete recovery. Our Laboratory Department has been considerably expanded and the amount of work done there greatly increased. This has been made possible by the employment of an additional assistant during the summer months, and by the fact that our Pharmacist, Mr. Ried - esel, has been spending some of his time working in thiß Department. 218 </seg>
         <seg id="p225">The addition of a farm cottage during this biennium, to our group of buildings, has greatly improved our ability to care for male patients. At the present •writing we still have a few vacancies, and are able to accept male patients immediately upon their commitment This, of course, is a great advantage since the earlier in the course of the disease that treatment is instituted, the more likely these pa - tients are to make a complete recovery. This also results in a shorter average duration of hospitsUzation for these patients. Unfortunately, we are not so well situated for the care of the female patients. We have no vacancies on the women's service, and many of our patients have to remain on the waiting list for some time before they can be accommodated. ' : During the last biennium our Medical Staff has been very ac - tive in giving intensive treatments to those patients whom we feel might be benefited by such forms of therapy. We are continuing the use of both Insulin and Metrazol Shock Therapy, and in addition, we have recently purchased an Electro-shock machine, which is being used quite intensively. Because the medical literature reports occa - sional injuries due to these forms of therapy, we have been using several drugs, including Curare, to decrease the chances of injury in convulsive therapy. \ •; . :'. ¦";'". - Reports of most of the Departments of the Hospital will be found oh other pages. In addition to these we would like to comment briefly on the Departments of Music and Cosmetology. Our Music Depart - ment continues to furnish instruction in voice and instrumental music to those patients whom the Medical Staff believes may be benefited by Buch instruction. This department, we believe, is important in keeping up the morale of our patients. It has also continued to present radio broadcasts, with patient talent, over the local radio station, and even those patients who do not take part in the broadcasts themselves, show a great interest in this activity and look forward to listening to these radio programs over the radios which are installed on all of the wards. / m feel the Beauty Parlor has a definite place in an institution of this kind, in improving the morale and consequently, the general physical and mental health of our women patients. We believe this department has fulfilled its mission in a very satisfactory manner. In December of 1940, a completely equipped Barber Shop was opened, which is performing a function for our male patients some - what analogous to that performed for our female patients by the Beauty Parlor. 219 </seg>
         <seg id="p226">Another new department, which we believe has an excellent effect on the morale of our patients, publishes a weekly newspaper, which is composed mainly of articles and poems written by patients, and in addition, gives news concerning the hospital and its personnel. Our patients have shown a surprising amount of interest, both in reading this paper, and in contributing 1 to it. We wish to express our appreciation for the excellent support we have received from, and for the fine medical and psychiatric work which has been done by members of our Medical Staff, and for the excellent cooperation we have received from all of the employees. We believe that we are very fortunate in having a large group of efficient nurses and attendants who really have the interest of their patients at heart. ¦ :.- NORFOLK STATE HOSPITAL NORFOLK, NEBRASKA SURGICAL REPORT For the Biennium Ending June 30, 1941.

Clement Riedesel NORFOLK STATE HOSPITAL NORFOLK, NEBRASKA REPORT OF THE PHARMACY For the Period Ending June 30, 1941. Dr. G. E. Charlton, Superintendent, Norfolk State Hospital, Norfolk, Nebraska. Dear Doctor Charlton: Submitted herewith is a record of the drugs and items manu - factured in the Pharmacy for the period June 30, 1939 to July 1, 1941, and an approximate record of the drugs purchased during the same length of time. By approximate I mean that the greater por - tion of items are included, but that some smaller items purchased locally, and an occasional emergency purchase are not included. Some of the smaller and less important items are not included for the period between June 30, 1939 to July 1, 1940, but in all other respects the record is accurate. , ¦ .¦. The following improvements have been made in the Pharmacy during the past biennium: An Ice box, an item that was sorely need - ed, was built into the north wall, in the form of a cave. In it are stored all biological products and other items of a perishable nature. A new set of shelves, reaching from the floor to the ceiling, was also installed in the north room, to accommodate many of the items, es - pecially gallon bottles, which were previously stored on the floor. This has made it much simpler to check supplies, and has given a neater appearance to the Pharmacy in general. The entire floor of the Pharmacy has been painted a tile red, edged with a six inch Strip of black. In the making is a system of perpetual inventory for every item in the Pharmacy. This system, when finished, will include the description, location, price and other items of interest concerning everything in the Pharmacy. 226 </seg>
         <seg id="p233">It is recommended that a telephone be installed in the Pharmacy to provide a closer correlation between the various wards, the Staff Physicians, and the Pharmacy. A new cabinet is needed in the south room for the purpose of storing the cotton material. At pres - ent the absorbent cotton and gauze are stored on boxes, coming in contact with the damp wall of the basement. During the past year, an increased amount of material was purchased on the quarterly requisition. Thus, at the start ot each quarter there is a lack of storage space in the Pharmacy for such items as soap and disinfectant barrels, etc. It is therefore recommended that part of the room adjacent to the Pharmacy be made into a storage room for such items requiring a great deal of space.

         <seg id="p269">NEBRASKA INSTITUTION FOR THE FEEBLE-MINDED At the beginning of the biennium there were present in the In - stitution, seven hundred twelve males, and six hundred thirty-one females, making a total of thirteen hundred and forty-three patients in the Institution. Seventy-five males and fifty-six females were on temporary leave of absence from the Institution. Ten males and twenty-two females were sterilized during the biennium. The statistical tables which accompany this report will give the number received, the number discharged and the total population on June 30, 1941. The present biennium has been one oi unusual activity. A great deal has been accomplished in improving the physical plant. With P. W. A. grants and W. P. A. labor, more improvements have been made than during any previous biennium. A number of needed changes have been made. ¦ In all these changes and additions to the plant, everything has been done to plan not only for this period, but so far as possible for the future needs of the Institution, with the primary aim of improving and preserving the physical plant and increasing the Institution's efficiency. At the power plant, two steam generating plants have been in - stalled, and we are at the present time making our own electricity. A three hundred K. V. A. steam engine and generator has recently been purchased and is in process of installation. All this will amount to a considerable saving, in view of the fact that we had previously been paying from six to seven hundred dollars a month for current. The exhaust steam from these steam generators is used for heat ing the buildings about the Institution, so that during the season when we are heating the buildings, our electricity costs us very little. Tile floors have been laid throughout the entire boiler house. The walls and ceiling have been painted, as well as the boiler fronts and boiler walls. The refrigeration plant which was located in the boiler house has been moved to our new kitchen. The space that was occupied by the brine tank has been converted into a machine shop. ¦'". We are looking forward to the time when we may have walls of the old portion of the boiler house built up to the height of the new boiler house and a new roof placed on it. With W. P. A. labor the farm cottage has been completely re - newed and repainted. A great deal of repairing and painting has been placed on some of the cottages. 262 </seg>
         <seg id="p270">: During this biennium we have completed a new ward building for girls. This building will accommodate more than three hundred girls. On the first floor we have dining room space for four hundred patients and an employees dining room, with service kitchens for both. Some time in the future when it becomes necessary, we can duplicate the dining room service for, girls in the north end of the new building, on the first floor, which at the present time is not occupied. . ! ' This large addition to our population has made it necessary to provide more and better facilities for the preparation of food, so the old kitchen and dining room building has been remodeled, and the entire lower floor and basement have been converted into kitchen and storage space. On the second floor is a dining room for four hundred boys. Adequate kitchen equipment has been installed, and we now have one of the most efficient and convenient kitchens among all our State Institutions. A- new fourteen ton compressor has been installed in the base - ment, and sufficient storage space has been provided to take care of our needs for many years. Our present plans provide for only three outside dining rooms, where patients are quartered who are unable to leave the building. Food is conveyed from the kitchen to the new building and to the other dining rooms about the Institution. This makes it possible to get the food to the patients while it is hot and palatable. We believe that food cooked in large quantities can be made as palatable as if cooked in small quantities. Our new and up-to-date kitchen equipment, makes it possible to make good the above assertion. An eight foot by eight foot tunnel has been built from our new building, connecting with the kitchen and on to the boiler house, in this tunnel are steam and water pipes, and electric lines. Plans have been made to extend this tunnel south to the custodial building, a distance of approximately four hundred feet, and south from the old administration building on Center Street, to the administration build - ing, and from there to the custodial building, to complete the circuit. A storm sewer has been laid connecting with all the buildings on the west side, and it is planned to connect the other buildings with a storm sewer on the east side. This has not yet been accomplished. ¦•': A number of improvements have been made and more are planned at our laundry. The water softener and hot water storage tanks have been moved from the boiler house to a building adjoining the laundry, and some new machinery has been installed. 263 </seg>
         <seg id="p271">At the school house, old type windows, which did not exclude cold in winteT or permit proper ventilation, have been replaced. The tile roof has been relaid. The school rooms have been refinished and plastered. During the coming summer we plan to repaint the entire interior of this building, and relay the auditorium floor. The cottage which housed wards seven and nine was an old build - ing. The old number one cottage which housed wards one, three, and five was a very old building 1. Both of these buildings have been com - pletely renewed. The walls have been painted and new roofs and gutters have been added. The floors have been taken up and relaid, or replaced by new ones. Tile floors have been placed in the bath rooms. Many of the rooms have been plastered, and all have been repainted. These buildings have been rewired and new plumbing in - stalled. We think these buildings are better now than when they were new. ¦¦'¦"..: Regarding our school, we believe we can not do better than to repeat something of what we said in the last annual report, because this is a biennial report and intended for publication. "Our school is the center around which our Institution is built, and unless our school is the principal business of the Institution, we fail to carry out the purpose for which the Institution was established. We must concede that the mentally defective child is entitled to school privileges and to have whatever mentality he has, trained and de - veloped, as well as the normal child. This can only be done in special schools for the mentally handicapped, or in special classes in the public schools, and since these special classes are only possible in the larger cities, it is obvious that we must provide- for most of these children in our Institution school. The children in our school, if capable of being taught, are not handicapped as far as school privileges are concerned, for not only are the subjects of kindergarten, primary and intermediate grades taught, but supplementary courses in physical culture, games, music, domestic science, hand and sense training, kitchen and laundry work, carpentry, horticulture, farming and dairying are taught. We know that we cannot change the intellectual capacity of a defective in - dividual, but we know too that some defectives have very definite possibilities. The industrial activities are all carried on as a part of the school work or training." Early in the second year of the biennium, Mrs. Ruth Ward, our principal who had had charge of our school for many years, found it necessary to resign because of the failing health of her mother. . We were fortunate in being able to secure Miss Phern Lownes, a teacher 264 </seg>
         <seg id="p272">of wide experience and thorough training to take this position. Miss Lownes is an excellent violinist and pianist. She plays' the violin in pur orchestra and trains the girl's chorus, as well as having general supervision of the entire school. • Our teachers have all been, re-elected for the coming year, and have signified their desire to return, with the exception of Mrs. Mc- Kissick, who had taught industrial art and sewing for many years. Mrs. McKissick resigned near the end of the school year, but we have already made arrangements for a teacher to fill this place. We are finding it increasingly difficult to hire men, owing to the demand for men in the defense industry, and to the call for young men for military training, so we will probably be obliged to raise salaries in order to get good help. For years, the question of providing water for this Institution has been a difficult one. New wells have been made and exploratory borings have been made over the entire farm. It has finally developed that the only place where water can be obtained in sufficient quanti - ties to provide any appreciable amount of water for our needs is at a point directly west of the Institution buildings and about a quarter of a mile from the Institution. Since our population has grown, we have found that these wells will not provide sufficient water. We have also found that they tend to pump down, but if allowed to rest for a sufficient time they may again be pumuped profitably. So we have made arrangements with the City of Beatrice to supply what water we need in addition to what our wells will provide. •¦"¦•'¦.•'. ; _ During the last year our water bill has been increased, so that the Board has contracted with the Dempster Company to make another well at the Institution. This will probably be completed at the end of this biennium. This should reduce our monthly water bill con - siderably. If abundant rains come, as now seems likely, we may find that the ground water level will rise, so that we may again pump most of our water from our own wells. In my last annual report I advised the necessity of making some arrangement for disposing of our sewage other than allowing it to run into Bear Creek. Our population has increased so much the amount of sewage deposited into Bear Creek has become a real nuis - ance. ¦¦'...•¦.'-. .¦ '"..: ¦ ¦.'.-¦;¦ . ¦ ¦¦-;. ..•¦ -:.¦¦.¦: ¦ . The Department of Public Health and a land owner below the Institution have insisted that we provide a sewage disposal plant, The 265 </seg>
         <seg id="p273">Board of Control, as well as myself, have realized the necessity of doing this, and it is my understanding that sufficient funds have been appropriated by the last legislature to take care of this matter. No doubt plans are being made fox this disposal plant. . During the first year of this biennium, a large sanitary sewer was laid to connect with several of our buildings, and placed so that future buildings might be taken care of by this sewer. This sewer and our older sewers all empty into Bear Creek, but all converge toward a point that will probably be selected for the location of the sewage disposal plant. '•' For fifteen years or more we have looked longingly toward the piece of land known as the Ideus farm, which is surrounded on three sides by the land already owned by the Institution. This is an ex - cellent piece of farm land and will fit in so nicely with our present holdings that the Board of Control secured an option on this farm early in this biennium. We have been informed that the out-going legislature has appropriated the necessary funds so that we ¦will be able to exercise our option on this farm. This, with the land already owned, will amount to six hundred and fifty acres. A large part of this is in pasture and alfalfa. We now have one hundred acres of alfalfa on our own land and forty acres on the Busboom farm of two hundred and twenty acres which we rent. Most of this was seeded last year and is a good stand. With one hundred thirty head of Holsteins we need as much hay as we can produce. We milk an average of sixty cows. These are all disease free, and their production is high. Our population will consume as much milk as we can produce. The statistical tables which accompany this report will indicate that our farm operations have been profitable and our hog production successful. We are mentioning some of the needs of the Institution for the coming biennium, although no special appropriation has been made for these. The matter of providing living quarters for our employees has been a difficult one for months. Plans have been considered for con - verting a part of one or another of our present buildings into em - ployees quarters. Nothing definite has been decided. In fact, no very feasible arrangement has been suggested, but we may be able to makesuch temporary arrangement. 266 </seg>
         <seg id="p274">Some time in the near future it will be necessary to have an em - ployee's building 1. Because of the necessity of keeping appropriations as low as possible considering the tax paying ability of our citizens, no request was made for an appropriation for this purpose, so we will be compelled to wait at least until the next session of the legislature for an employee's building. :. It is reasonable to expect that the Institution will double in population within a few years. At any rate, the population is bound to increase as rapidly as buildings can be provided, so that we should plan an employee's building or buildings to accommodate from fifty to one hundred employees. ¦ ¦:.' : We should have a dairy house in order to make sanitary arrange - ments for cooling and caring for the milk. ¦ We should have a new slaughter house, because we kill practically all of our pork and a considerable number of beeves. We will need twenty new A type houses for our sows and pigs. We need three large laying houses for our poultry flock. Plans have been made for these.. Our flock has been very profitable during the past year, and during most of the year has led the State Flock Testing Association in production. . '¦'¦¦. Arrangements should be made for dredging Bear Creek from our pumping intake to the dam; a distance of about three hundred feet. This is filled up with silt so that it obstructs the flow of water to the large reservoir from which we pump to irrigate our garden in dry weather. We must also depend to a large extent on this source of water supply for protection in case of fire. For this purpose we have a complete set of water mains and fire hydrants independent of our regular water system. "¦;¦'.. ¦'.': /"¦¦¦ Our. employees have been faithful and conscientious. Our chil - dren have been well cared for. The health of our population has been uniformly good. An epidemic of measles early in the biennium, and a recent outbreak of scarlet fever have taxed our facilities for isolation. At the present time there are no cases of communicable disease in the Institution. ...-.,¦' There have been but few changes in the administrative personnel. On October 4, 1939, Mr. 0. G. Lawrence passed away after a short illness, from an attack of pneumonia. Mr. Lawrence had served faithfully for eighteen years as boy's supervisor. ¦'¦ Miss Lucy Ellen McCurley, our dietitian, resigned May sth, 1941, to enter government service. .. .; ; 267 </seg>
         <seg id="p275">On April Ist, 1941, Dr. H. W. Heinz was employed as full time dentist. In conclusion, we wish to thank our officers and heads of de - partments for their faithful performance of duty and cheerful co - operation in conducting the affairs of this Institution. We wish too, to say a word in appreciation of our inmate help, without whose as - sistance it would have been impossible to carry on. 268 </seg>

         <seg id="p293">GENOA STATE FARM During this biennium the following improvements were made: The old Hospital Building was torn down, and all lumber saved and used in erecting a Mess Hall at the West Farm, large enough to seat forty (40) men. This lumber was also used in the building of Hog Houses, Chicken Shelters and many other needed improvements around the institution. The porches on the rear of two of the huild - ings were removed as a safety precaution. ; All residences of the employees were painted inside and out, (where needed) and these houses are now in the best of condition.. The Barns, Machine Sheds, Slaughter House and other buildings have been painted and repaired, and are now in fair condition. : The Barracks where the inmates are housed have been completely renovated, painted inside and out, floor refinished and are now in first class condition. . ; Some new and used machinery has been added to the Cannery in order that we might get the full benefit of the labor and also en - abling us to increase our output. For the year ending Jane 80,-1941, 29,480 No. 10 cans of goods, not needed at this institution, were sold to the various other State Institutions. . At the present time conditions indicate that we will have a much larger crop during the coming year in both our garden and farm. . Only inmate labor is used on all of our projects. Inmates are under the charge of 10 supervisors, and each supervisor has charge of his department. Their duties are to teach the inmates, as near as possible, their line of work, such as Farming, Poultry Baising, Dairy - ing, Hog Raising, Canning, Carpentry, Fainting, Boiler Room, Plumb - ing, Blacksmithing, Welding, Kitchen and Dining room work, Green - house, and the growing of plants for the gardens. The packing and storage plant is operated by the Prison Indus - tries, and furnishes employment for approximately 15 inmates at all times. All meats so processed are sold to the other State Institutions. During the current biennium $44,765.05 has been turned into the State Treasurer to be credited to the Institution Cash Fund. This money comes from cash sales to other State Institutions for products raised at Genoa State Farm. 286 </seg>
         <seg id="p294">,;. .'Over 1,700 Red Cedar Trees were taken from our Nursery and tracked to various other State Institutions. Complete Shelter Belts were planted around the entire farms. Approximately 75 acres are now planted in these Shelter Belts. The conduct of the inmates as a whole has been very good, and only in a few cases has it been necessary to return men to the Pen - itentiary for violation of the rules. Escapes have been very few dur - ing the past biennium as only 7 men have escaped. Two of these are now serving sentences in Oklahoma, and one has been apprehended and returned to Lincoln. All farm work and the raising of livestock, cattle, hogß, etc., is under the direct supervision of Mr. E. V. Widle, the Assistant Super - intendent, and all employees are held accountable to : him for the supervision of their departments. In closing this report, we wish to thank the members and per - sonnel of the institution for their cooperation and loyalty in assisting in the management of the institution. . &lt; '¦: OFFICERS W. D.

         <seg id="p304">STATE PENITENTIARY LINCOLN, NEBRASKA A beautiful new two story Main Entrance Building has been completed and was occupied December 1, 1940. This fireproof build - ing houses the front turnkey, the electrically controlled gates, the telephone switchboard, the mail inspector, canteen, and rooms for checking in and out of both prisoners and visitors. The business and accounting offices are quartered on the second floor of this building. The east wall gate has been removed and the wall sealed. Anew west gate and warehouse 56' by 76' with full basement has been erected of steel and concrete and they are now in use. The street directly in front of the main building was dosed to traffic, and a new all steel high fence with; electric lights installed at intervals on top surrounds the entire prison. A new paved street was opener at the north of the institution. The old guard tower and store building have been removed, and a new wide cement walk con - necting the new entrance building with the old has been laid. - We have completely rebuilt our sewer system inside the wall and have built a new storm sewer. New steam line tunnels were built of concrete/These connect the power house to the industries buildings, and also to the outside warehouse. Cement drives and walks within the wall were relaid and rebuilt. ¦ '.. ' v • Large electric transformers were removed from yard inside the wall to a specially constructed vault The entire lighting system was rebuilt, replacing the old open type wiring conduits. Flood lights were installed at many points on the wall, and three high power search lights were also erected, one over the main entrance, one over the west gate and one on the east wall. We have purchased 600 .feet of the new heavy duty fire hose. The fire pump has been removed from the inside yard to the power house, and our fire protection lines have been enlarged. A new spray pond was built at the power house which doubles our cooling capacity. We have completely revamped the power plant by tiling floors and painting the interior. A new motor driven boiler feed pump was installed at the power house. The old horse barn 4 has been torn down and a new horse barn 97' by W constructed of hollow tile, brick and wood on a new loca- 297 </seg>
         <seg id="p305">tion on the side hill south of the institution, and directly to the north of the cow barn. Some new hog houses were also added. . . Considerable grading was done in straightening the old creek bed, and most of the dirt from the hill was used to fill in the grounds, and in landscaping the front of the institution. Some trees were, transplanted and many new shrubs and trees added. Several miles of Shelter Belt trees were planted around the farm land. Our intercommunicating system was rebuilt to a forty station system, connecting practically all points within the institution, in - cluding the power house and front entrance building, as well as, the Warden's and Deputy Warden's residence. The telephone system ¦was rebuilt with a PBX switchboard installed and all wires put in under-, ground tamper proof cables. In the hospital, painting and floor finishing has been done. A dental X-ray machine, dental chair and equipment purchased. Tables in the main dining room were rebuilt and refinished. Several new desks and chairs for the new entrance building were made for us by our Industries shops. . . A gas burner was installed in the heating plant at the Warden's residence, and some redecorating was also done. A large new coffee making kettle was purchased and three large aluminum cooker kettles were installed at the big kitchen. Extensive parking grounds and drives with cement curbing are under construction to take care of visitors' cars as well as employes', and a new paved drive has been built directly north of the new en - trance building, connecting it with the street to the north. This drive is illuminated at night by new ornamental lighting posts. Much of this new construction was made possible through as - sistance received from the W. P. A. as well as help by prisoners here Rt the institution. 298 </seg>

         <seg id="p326">reformatory for men Lincoln; Nebraska The population at the beginning of this biennium was 289 and closed with 162. We received 325 men during that period of time. . The decrease in population is due to various factors. Four years ago when the C. C. C. Camps came into operation many of these boys were taken into that service. Later the N. Y. A. placed many boys in employment and through their guidance kept them out of trouble. Here of late the Selective Service Draft has taken boys of this age.into the Army. Too, since the Defense Program is under way, more employment is available and this also has resulted in de - creasing our population. We have been fortunate to have many of our young men re - leased sooner due to the fact that there are possibilities for them in the C. C. C. Camps or the; Army. Therefore^ the period of time they are incarcerated is not as long as has been heretofore. '.. The general health of the inmates is good. A physical examina - tion is given every inmate upon his arrival at the institution by our Physician, Dr. B. A. Finkle. Correctional treatments are given to those in need of it insofar as we are able to do so. All venereal cases are: segregated and must undergo treatments. X-rays and special treatments are furnished by the Orthopedic Hospital of Lincoln. Our health schedule has also added the services of Dr. D. D. Sanderson, Eye, Ear, Nose &amp; Throat Physician who shares his time with us and the State Penitentiary and is available for any emergency. He, too, makes a complete check of every inmate received. : ' Every inmate that is received is examined carefully by our Den - tist, Dr. A. 0. Mumma. Dr. Mumma shares his time with this Institu - tion and the State Penitentiary giving us two. days per week and is available for any emergency that.may arise. Dr. Mumma has taken the place of Dr. F.'.T. Butz, who was transferred to the Lincoln State Hospital for full time duty. , ;:.- . . v Our "W. P. A. Work Program" was started in April of 1940. Repairing roofs on all buildings, tiling and repairing floors in the Administration Building and painting and remodeling' have helped the conditions and appearance of the Administration Building and the Cell House. The project was not. completed in this biennium as we have, more painting and repairing to do on the third floor of the 319 </seg>
         <seg id="p327">Administration Building, storage rooms, and cottage at our South Farm, but we hope to continue this program and to have this done in the very near future. Our South Farm, located two (2) miles south of the institution, where we have fifteen (15) honor inmates stationed, is headquarters for our Hog and Poultry Industries. Two (2) new brick poultry houses, which will house one thousand (1,000) chickens each have been constructed, other poultry houses have been renovated and re - modeled, eighteen (18) rain shelters, fifty (60) individual hog houses and ten (10) feeders were completed wnich has added muca to our equipment of raising hogs and poultry in a good measure. We axe in need of two (2) more poultry houses and also some shelter houses for our stock at the farm. We do not have adequate water supply at the farm and are in need of a new water main to connect with our main line to the in - stitution or dig somo new wells and have pressure tanks installed as there is no fire protection on the farm whatsoever. We also have stock cattle stationed there and water has to be hauled in tanks for the cattle and horses in the pasture and also for the poultry. We took over the State Hospital dairy herd on the Ist of October, IMS) on a temporary basis, and on the 30th of June, 1940 thiß was transferred to us permanently. Various tests have been made and the diseased cattle have been segregated and disposed of and we now have this herd up to an accredited standard. All milk produced is Bold to the Prison Industries, then pasteurized and bottled to be dis - tributed to other institutions by the Prison Industries. We also have a surplus at milk as the pasture has been good. This surplus is being Bold to Roberts Dairy at pool prices. Due to the decrease in popula - tion we found it necessary to purchase milking machines to carry on with this industry. Inmates employed in the dairy department are paid a small wage. As the dairy barn we are now using is small for the number of cows we have and the cows must be brought in at three different milkings, our idea is to have our horse bam converted into a dairy barn by installing floors and stanchions? The present dairy barn then may be used for maternity and hospital needs. We are also in need of more calf barn room as the buildings we have are inadequate to take care of our needs. We are also in need of open sheds for shelter for our stock cattle that are being added to our herd. Our shelter belt now consists of one hundred (100) acres. Ap - proximately thirty thousand (30,000) trees were planted in the spring of 1940. We have done considerable replanting in the spring of 1941. 320 </seg>
         <seg id="p328">Out nursery was enlarged in the spring, of 1940 with approximate - ly eleven thousand (11,000) trees. These trees are growing nicely and can be used for replanting at any time. Our plans are to plant a few trees each year in the nursery so that we will always have some trees available for planting. The severe cold we had on Armistice Day of 1940 killed many of our Chinese Elms that had been progressing and making considerable shade around the institution. We could not determine the immediate loss this spring so will replant plentifully again in the spring of 1942. Our farm and garden program has been discouraging this bien - nium due to the drouth and hot winds. Because of the disappoint - ment our canning factory was not opened in the spring of 1940. We have disposed of our canning equipment and plans are being made to vacate the building and use it to some advantage on the farm. The Shoe Factory that had been in operation daily the first half of the biennium was dispensed with in April, 1941. The License Plate and Road Marker Plant continues to be our outstanding industry. It gives trade training to those employed and they, too, aye given a small amount of money for their work. We have been manufacturing the license plates and road markers for both Nebraska and Wyoming, but this year, 1941, Wyoming has found some other way to secure their license plates.' We also manu - facture the license badges for the Nebraska Fish and Game Com - mission and the bicycle license plates. Our recreational program is a very important part of our daily schedule. Baseball and Softball games are most popular. Almost every evening our entire population is at the bleachers. Visiting teams from the City come out. Tournaments are also played between the different departments of the institution. Football is played in season. All men have playground privileges at any time they are off duty, with the exception of the Chapel.. hour on Sunday afternoons. All inmates, that are physically able, take part in our work and rec - reational programs. During the winter months we are handicapped in our recreational program as we have no gymnasium. Outdoor basketball is played when the weather permits. Our Sound Projector Movie Machine has given much pleasure to our inmate population. Orchestra, glee club, harmonica bands and boxing are the supervised activities. We are continuing our grade school work during the winter months, and all who have not completed the eighth grade must attend. Evening classes were held last winter and this was found to be quite ¦':'¦ ¦' : v ¦¦¦¦'-; ¦¦ .. ''. v-- ;¦.¦' \ ¦¦¦'. ¦¦-¦ 321 </seg>
         <seg id="p329">satisfactory. Several boys who had completed their grade school work, were taking extension work from the University of Nebraska. Chapel services are held every Sunday afternoon. We secure the best speakers available, selected from the many prominent pastors of the different churches of our City. We have found this plan most satisfactory. From time to time we secure as speakers business men who have made a success in life and this offers the inmates something tangible in the way of right living. Women speakers oc - casionally fill our pulpit and bring very fine messages to our boys. Catholic Mass is held every Sunday morning with Father Lisko in charge. The First Church of Christ holds morning services here each Sunday. Rev. H. Erck, University Pastor of the Lutheran Church, continues to hold Bible Classes each Monday evening during the school year. Four years ago we set up our work program on the basis of three hundred twenty (320) men and since the decrease, as mentioned, it has been necessary for us to release some of the activities that we were taking part in such as the Shoe Factory, Canning Factory, and releasing much of the farm land that was rented at the expiration of leases. We have been able to supply the local institution with eggs and onr surplus has been sold on the open market. We have a hatchery in connection with the flock of poultry at the farm and have been hatching chicks from our own eggs for our own and other State in - stitutions, which has also added an industry and activity. We desire to express our appreciation for the loyalty and co - operation displayed by all the officers and employees of the Institu - tion. 322 </seg>

         <seg id="p349">REFORMATORY FOR WOMEN YORK. NEBRASKA OFFICERS Hattio B. Bowley Superintendent Emma Kehtneier - Secretary J. Stewart Bell Physician Hulda Matzko Nurse STATE REFORMATORY FOR WOMEN There has been a steady decline in population this biennium, from 48 to a present count of 32. Investigation leads us to believe (t la partially due to the cities and larger towns giving free treatment to those with venereal disease. At one time there were more com' mitments (or vagrancy and venereal disease than fox crime. Usually one committed for vagrancy has a venereal disease also. The following repairs and improvements were made under a WPA project: The entire interior of the West Hall was repainted and varnished, the oak floors refinished, the ceilings in the basement ball, dining room and kitchen plastered, and new cupboards built in the kitchen. The cement floors are bad in comparison to the rest 61 the building and should be refinished. The interior of the Barracks building was painted and varnished, floors Banded and varnished, the upstairs finished for living quarters for the outdoor matron, and this now gives us ample room for the entire staff. The building was resided and given two coats of paint. Windows in the West Hall and Barracks building cottage were weather stripped, which should reduce the heating cost, and keep out much dust Damaged parts of the walk between the East and West Halls was replaced with new cement. Two water hydrants were placed near the barns, giving us better fire protection for them, and the water mains extended to them. A badly needed cement floor was put in the cattle shed. A brick Incinerator was built. This eliminated the danger of fire from burn- Ing waste in an older, poorly devised burner. 342 </seg>
         <seg id="p350">Due to some of the WPA workmen securing other employment it was necessary to close the project, with the above mentioned work, without painting the interior of the East Hall. This, with other needed improvements we hope to have done under a new WPA project this fall. Disposal of two teams of horses and purchase of a tractor, and plow, lister, cultivator, mower and duckfoot plow to use with it, has enabled us to accomplish more and better farm work in less time. Other new farm implements are a horse-drawn rake and manure spreader. With the duck-foot plow we hope to eliminate the bind weed on the farm. A new motor driven lawn mo.wer has enabled us to keep the lawn looking much better. It was also necessary to have a now truck. '. ' ¦ ' ¦ - ..:':¦, ¦ .':'¦ . ¦" .: !','-. '¦ ':.' We now have 65 acres in alfalfa. From part of the acreage we threshed 261 bushels of seed over the two year period. It has been necessary to put a new waterproof coating on the roof of the East Hall as the heavy rains of spring indicated many leaks in it The water tower was repainted. • : In the sewing room six of the old sewing machines have been replaced with new electric Singer machines. A new electric, ice box was necessary to replace the old one in the East Hall kitchen. Eight old rugs were replaced with new ones. -One additional rug was purchased for the upstairs of the Barracks building. A great deal of trouble has been eliminated in the ironing rooms . by replacing old irons, from time to time, with the new type iron— the cord being permanently fastened to the side of the iron handle. The six new fire extinguishers and the 300 feet oi new fire hose distributed throughout the buildings do minimize fire hazards. :•' We have installed a dental chair, donated by the Hospital for the Tuberculous. A dentist comes from York a half day, four times a month. .&lt; This free dental service to the inmates is a great help to them, being an improvement from a standpoint of health, and in some instances personal appearance. ¦ Inmates have been taken to the York local hospital for three major operations; a compound fracture of the ankle and delivery of "two babies. In every instance they have been brought back to the institution by ambulance the second or third day and cared for by our resident nurse. ¦ [¦¦'¦: .'.-¦_.¦ .¦/-.:¦ • ; , v The old typewriter in the superintendent's office was traded in on a new one.

We have need for two more typewriters for typing practice. The assistant superintendent who conducted typing and short - hand classes one evening a week, was relieved by a WPA adult edu - cation Instructor who comes twice a week and spends three hours in the afternoons teaching typing, shorthand, English and spelling. Day classes and mow time makes It more interesting for the students and greater progress Is made by them. The same Instructor comes out and Instructs in current events one evening a week at each" Hail. A feature movie is shown once each month.

We give full credit to the splendid cooperation and loyalty of the entire staff for the minimum amount of discipline problems, and the fact that our work .program keeps them busy. It was necessary to transfer one inmate, committed for vagrancy and who was syphilitic to the Hastings State Hospital Five acres of garden under irrigation gave us a surplus of vegetables. Our surplus of canned vegetables, pickles, jellies and jams, amounting to 3,054 quarts, were sold to the Hospital for Tuber - culous. .: .' . _;¦¦¦ y. - y-: &#132;¦/. ;..'.•'.¦¦¦ .¦';¦';¦¦ Practically all the berry bushes, and some of the fruit trees, set out in the Spring of 1940, had to be replaced this Spring, due to the early freeze last FaSL The registered herd of cattle was sold, and our herd now con - sists of cows culled from other institution herds. When their pro - duction drops to ten pounds of milk they are either sold on the local market, or butchered here, and replaced with cows from some of the other institutions. Records show that veterinary service is greater than with the registered herd, the feed cost approximately the same per cow, but milk production less per cow. The advance in prices on purchases in general is noticeable dur - ing the past few months. This will raise our per capita maintenance COgt. &#132; .

The Lincoln building was re-roofed, all old plaster removed and replastered and, to some extent, rebuilt. It was then redecorated and a fresh coat of paint was given the outside. The building is now in very fine shape. The Washington building was re-roofed, remodeled and re - plastered, and redecorated in the inside, as well as the outside being repainted. This building is now in excellent condition and houses about a third of our employees. The Roosevelt building was almost completely rebuilt and re - decorated, inside and outside. The building now contains two 10-bed wards for veterans, the new recreation hall and lounging room. The recreation hall is equipped with pool and card tables. The McKinley building was re-roofed and redecorated inside and outside. Other buildings having new toofs are the Power Plant, Laundry, Bakery, Post office and the root cellar. These buildings were also repainted. The Garfield building is now undergoing its re-roofing and re - novation—all the old plaster is removed and replastering is under way. It will be repainted on the outside and redecorated in the in - side. The Administration building and the third floor of the hospital have been redecorated on the inside and all wood work on the outside 356 </seg>

         <seg id="p365">has been repainted. In the Hospital the diet kitchen was enlarged and an electric food conveyor was added to that equipment. In the general dining room a new elecrtie refrigerator was installed and the kitchen was equipped with a new range. The dining room in the Lincoln building is about to be completed and should be as attractive as the large dining room in the hospital. Some badly needed equipment was added to the hospital, such as heat lamps, examination table, instrument cases, adjustable beds, etc., and a portion of the building has been set aside strictly for pa - tients needing hospital care. The other part of the building is for those who are aged and feeble, but not ill. A new poultry house, modern in every detail, has been completed this spring, size 25' x 110. The many old poultry buildings that stood east of the chapel have been rased or moved away. On this site we expect to have our outdoor recreation center built —horseshoe court, croquet, roquet and outdoor grills for the members' use are planned. We expect to have these laid out and built this summer. New lawns have been started around all of the buildings, as well as that part of the front yard up to the highway. We are very grate-, ful for the fine Tains this spring that helped to get these well started. The institution is hopeful of getting a new dairy barn in the near future as the one we now have ib in bad condition. To the staff was added Mrs. Ivy B. Horton as matron effective November 1, 1939 and, effective June 1, 1941, Dr. Carl W. Sherfey resigned his position as resident physician. He has been replaced by Dr. Earle G. Johnson and his associate, Dr. K. P. McDermott of Grand Island. Nebraska, who calls at the institution twice each day, and oftener if necessary.

Daxon us Su - perintendent to have charge of the business administration and Dr. L. C. Albertson as Medical Director to have charge of patients' care. This arrangement has been very satisfactory and we believe has proven its merits. . The occupation of the new building 1 has necessitated the addition cf several employees, some of which are, six diet kitchen maids, six janitors, one wash man, one. pharmacist, one store keeper, as well as, nursing help. During the past biehnium many changes have taken place in the physical plant which we -wish to briefly outline here. The contract for the Men's and Administration Building was let in December,, 1938 and construction started immediately. The build - ing was completed early in 1940, equipment installed, and the build - ings were opened for public inspection July 28, and put into use soon .after- .:.'•.' '¦:'¦.'.: - :¦&gt;¦' '.' ¦ ¦:¦ ¦ ¦¦ :&gt;'¦ " ¦•¦.'.¦. -.;.. \" 365 </seg>
         <seg id="p374">This Men's Building, a two-story structure, provided seventy-four' beds, as well as all necessary services, such as, service kitchens and dining rooms, utility and toilet rooms, a doctor's office, sun lamp room, occupational therapy room, two recreation rooms and supply closets. The Administration Building, a five-story structure, has all the administrative offices on the first floor. The second and third floors ore the admittance wards and have 16 and 18 beds respectively. The second floor is used for women and the third floor is for the men. In addition to the bed rooms these floors also have the necessary service rooms, as well as, a doctor's office on the second floor. Most of the rooms on these two floors are single rooms as they are used for the patients who are the most ill. On the fourth floor is the operating suite which contains the central supply room, nurses' workroom, sterilizing room, major oper - ating room, and doctor's locker, lounge and scrubup room. This section is separated from the remainder of the floor, and no equip - ment is taken in or out of this section without the doctors' permis - sion. This eliminates all possibility of infection being carried from the other departments into the operating room. The dentist's office, general laboratory, X-ray and two minor operating rooms are also on this floor. Each of these rooms are supplied with adequate but not elaborate equipment. The fifth floor is built into the roof and provides three very nice bed rooms for internes with a large living room and a bath. The two buildings are connected together and to the East Sun (or Women's building) by ambulatories. This arrangement makes the Administration Building a center or hub with the two wings radiating out from it. The future expansion of the hospital was given careful consid - eration in designing the administration building and it is constructed so that a multi-story wing may extend'to the north connected by an ambulatory similar to the present one. The services of the fourth floor are adequate to care for this increased number of patients. The service tunnel which enters the Administration Building from the north is designed so that a build - ing may be built over it without interrupting any of these services. Through this tunnel all the heat and power lines run, as well as, the food delivery services. 366 </seg>
         <seg id="p375">The East Sun Building has been completely reconditioned and redecorated, the roof braced, plaster replaced where cracked or loose and repainted, floors sanded and varnished, the dark stain on the woodwork has been replaced with silver gray stain trimmed in April green, all to match the decorative scheme in the new buildings. New reinforced waterproof concrete basement walls have been constructed in this building with a two-fold purpose. First, to make the basements more useable as the floor may be lowered and the basement will be dry. Second, to provide support for the Spandrel beams above so that the open porches may be enclosed and with the addition of dividing partitions the rooms will be large enough for two beds instead of one, thereby nearly doubling the capacity of the building at a very small cost. ; Tunnels have been constructed from the Heating Plant to the Administration Building passing under the new kitchen in the old Men's Building. Another tunnel connects the laundry to the main tunnel. New service lines, steam, hot water and power, have been installed to all buildings. A basement has been constructed under the old Men's Building to operate in conjunction with the kitchen being constructed above. This kitchen plans to furnish food for a total of 500 beds, the an - ticipated maximumjsize of this hospital.- ': The contract for the Heating Plant was let early in March, 1939 and put in operation in the fall of 1940 after the completion of the tunnels and the service lines. The plant is complete with two, 200 H. P. boilers, two boiler, feed pumps, hot water heater and all neces - sary instruments and auxiliary equipment. -¦'.;-¦"¦ Plans have been prepared for landscaping the entire hospital campus and more than half of the area has been graded and seeded, trees planted and driveways and sidewalks constructed. We wish to suggest some additional items of construction that should be considered for the next biennium while the WPA Project is operating. ; ¦ ¦¦• • : ; : The hew tunnels and their services and basements of the new buildings and East Sun should have walls and ceilings painted, pipes covered and coded. * • The concrete floor in East Sun basement should be removed, new sewer lines installed, columns, footing lowered, floor lowered nuking this space available for store rooms, occupational therapy and work shops.- ;¦ . ' ¦ '.: '. ;'¦ ¦. ¦¦ ¦v' "V ' . ¦'. 367 </seg>
         <seg id="p376">The heating systems in both the Nurses' Home and the Stone Building should be revamped replacing defective valves and traps and making a complete two pipe system. An automatic, thennostatic con - trolled valve assembly should be installed in each building, this would result in much improved heating of these buildings and make a very great saving in the steam used. The old boiler house should be revamped into a wash room for the laundry, using the upper floor for a finishing room. The equip - ment should be rearranged, an elevator installed and some additional equipment purchased. Consideration should be given to the future use of the old Men's Building so that plans may be prepared and the necessary work done on the heating and plumbing so that the first floor where the store room and dining room are to be can be completed. Much has been accomplished in the dietary department. At present the food is prepared in two kitchens, one in the East Sun Building and the other in the old Men's Building. This food is trans - ported to the serving kitchens in electric-heated food conveyors, from there by electric-heated tray conveyors it is served to the patients. A complete but varied menu has been maintained at a raw food cost of about B%c per meal. In submitting the biennial report no attempt is made to review the medical work prior to June I,', 1940. Shortly after this period it was possible to occupy the new buildings, namely the Administration Building and Men's Building whicji had been provided and completed by the Board of Control. Along i with the new buildings there was also provided very adequate new equipment such as is appropriate for complete operating room, laboratory and X-ray facilities. This new equipment, while it does not represent the most expensive equip - ment, is very substantial and during the past year has proven entirely adequate and satisfactory for our needs here. In effecting a re-organization of the medical department, several additions to the staff were made. Dr. K. L. Holmes, a Dentist in Kearney, was placed on a salary by the Hospital to spend two half days a week. AIJ patients are examined by him on admission He takes care of all extractions, fillings, cleaning and makes the impres - sions for dentures when they are required. Each patient is then re - examined every six months during their stay. Dr. John P. Allen, of Omaha, has again been employed in the capacity of Medical Consultant and spends three days a month at the institution. 368 </seg>
         <seg id="p377">Dr. C. H. Fox waa retained in the capacity of Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat specialist. He spends a half day each week and examines each patient on admission as well as subsequent examination and treatments when indicated. It has now been possible to employ a Registered Pharmacist, Mr. E. W. Robinson. Since occupying: the new building-, all patients are admitted to the Administration Building:—the women on the second floor and the men on the third floor. These patients are then retained in the ad - ministration Building until examination is completed and any special treatment is started. With newly admitted patients in the Adminis - tration Building-, it gives an opportunity for them to receive instruc - tion in regard to the management of their disease end any help they may need in the matter of adjusting themselves to sanatorium regime. The women are then later moved to the east building and the men to the west building. Any patients requiring major surgery are moved to the Administration Building where facilities are provided for such Care.- ¦:¦¦ ' .¦;. :. ; ':"' ."' '¦.•¦'¦ '¦ . - :• .': ¦; /¦ •. Four other items of particular significance we feel have been accomplished. •¦•¦:.-• ¦.-.. . Beginning July first, all of the children in the children's Pavilion were submitted to thorough examination, including physical, dental, nose and throat and x-ray examinations. In this group of children there was found one with a reinfection tuberculosis. At the time of the examination this patient's disease could be classified as an Arrested disease. It was discovered that two of the children were in need of tonsillectbmy. With permission from the parents the work was done by Dr. C. H. Fox. Severer were in need of dental work and this was accomplished by Dr. Holmes. In as much as these children were not in need of care because of tuberculosis problems, it was deemed wise for them to be dismissed Witt the aid of the Child Welfare Department, arrangements were made for all of these children and they were dismissed, thus making it possible to discontinue the children's Pavilion, September 10, 1940. . Since that time, when applications for children were received tw T re ; dmltt! d, to the Administration Building. If it was found Oiat they had reinfection tuberculosis, they were cared for in the buildings for the adult patients. If tuberculosis did not exist the J?dS2 Mm 8o adWsed ¦.-* 'r**** mdc im -The second item of significance was that there waa an apparent need for a revision of the system of medical records for Si. 369 </seg>
         <seg id="p378">This was accomplished by writing to several similar institutions which were recognized by the American Medical Association as being ap - proved for the training of residents and securing a complete set of their medical record blanks. After these blanks were received, a complete revision of our blanks was made and approval obtained by the Board for the same to be printed. The third item of significance was the effort to develop the problem of chest surgery for the patients at this institution.- In as much as we had adequate operating room facilities it was deemed wise for us to plan for the chest surgery for the institution to be done here at the institution rather than to make arrangements for the surgery to be done elsewhere as is true in some sanatoria. Arrangements were made with Dr. Joseph Weinberg to do the surgery. Dr. B. H. Harms, of Omaha, a member of the International Society of Anesthetists, was employed to give the cyclopropane an - esthesia for these operations. With the help of these two additional men we were able to start thoracoplasty work in December,' 1940. To date we have done eleven single stage thoracoplasties on four patients, with what we feel are very satisfactory results. The next item of significance is that of nursing organization. For the first time it has been possible to employ a registered nurse to serve in the capacity of Night Supervisor. It has been possible to add other graduate nurses to the staff such that we are able to main - tain eight graduates at the present time. For the most part graduates serve largely in the capacity of ward supervisors, leaving the major part of the detail beside care to nurses attendants who work under the direction of these graduate nurses. Due to the increasing number of available beds since the new buildings were occupied, the adult patient population has increased from an average of one hundred twenty-two for the month of Jnne. 1940, to one hundred fifty-two for the month of May, 1941. This increase in the adult population accounts for a corresponding increase in work accomplished in the laboratory and in the operating room. The increased number of adu't patients has therefore made it neces - sary to increase the personnel in the laboratory, also the number of nurses and nurse attendants required to take care of the patients adequately. 370 </seg>
