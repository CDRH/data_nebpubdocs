            <seg id="p003">SUMMARY Poultry records for one year, April 1, 1929, to March 31, 1930, were secured from 159 women. Forty per cent of these records came from* owners, 13.5 per cent from part-owners, and 45.9 per cent from tenants. Farms of 160 acres were most numerous. Poultry inventory values increased during the year of record keep - ing. Average value of poultry and poultry equipment in 1929 was $183.37 and in 1930, $189.64. The average number of laying hens at the beginning of the year was 101, at the end of the year 123. The largest portion of the money income from poultry products came from the sale of eggs. During March and April almost every member of the group sold eggs; in November only 40 per cent placed eggs on the market; 49 per cent marketed poultry in July. In January and. April only 27 per cent sold poultry. The eggs sold per month fluctuated widely in both number and value. Eggs for home consumption varied much less in number than did those sold. The percentage of the total number of eggs produced which were placed on the market varied from 82 per cent in March to 65- per cent in October. The average gross income from the sale of poultry products for the year was $261.34; the average value of all poultry products for home consumption during the year was $69.21. Egg prices fluctuated from 22 cents per dozen in March to 41 cents in November, while values placed upon eggs for home use varied from 20 cents in March to 40 cents in November. Eggs for home use were valued slightly below eggs sold. . . The total average gross income for the year from both sale and use of poultry products was $330.55 when increase in inventory values was not included. When the average increase of $6.27 in inventory values' during the year was added the total gross income was $330.82. Expenses for feed, fuel, and additions to flock and to equipment amounted to an average of $180.11. This left an average net income of $156.71. Interest at 5 per cent on' net working capital amounted to an average of $9.17, leaving an average labor income of $147.54. The responsibility for the care of poultry and poultry products rested largely upon farm homemakers, especially from April to Sep - tember. In May. 35 per cent of the women had no help in the care of poultry, while in February and March 11 per cent received no help. In May the average time spent by homemakers on poultry was 40 hours and 33 minutes. For every month of the year the average time spent by the farm woman amounted to 19 hours and 24 minutes, while other persons spent an average time of 8 hours and 20 minutes per month.. . ■ Over S per cent of the group lost money on poultry during the year, and 8.1 per cent had an hourly income of less than 10 cents per hour, while ah additional 20.2 per cent had an income of from 10 to 29 cents per hour. Thirty-seven per cent of the records show either a loss on poultry or an income of less than 30 cents per hour for all time expended. Slightly over 1 1 per. cent of the group, however, had an hourly income of $1.00 or more for time spent on poultry. The average hourly income was 44.5 cents; the median hourly income 42 cents. Dairy records were kept by 154 women. The average number of milk cows, was the same in 1929 and in 1930. Inventory values were </seg>
            <seg id="p004">lower in 1930, however, than in 1929. The average value of dairy stock and equipment in 1929 was $851.77, while in 1930 it was $000.20&gt; _Whole milk, sweet cream, and butter were sold by small percentages of the group. Dairy products were sold primarily in the form of butterfat. The gross return from all dairy products sold, including dairy stock sold, amounted to an average of $523.55. Prices for milk were lowest in January, Aprils and December, and highest in August. The smallest quantity of milk was sold in October. Butterfat prices ranged from 29 cents per pound in January to 46 cents per pound in April. Butter varied in price from 38 cents' per pound m December to 48 cents per pound in May. Dairy products, used either as feed on the farm or for home con - sumption, amounted in value to an average of $226.49. Milk for home use was valued at from G to 8 cents per quart, cream from :!(&gt; to 10 cents per quart, and butter from 34 to 42 cents per pound. e-T=s.! ;Ota i? veraße value of &lt;lairy P rO(lucts sold and used at home was !&gt;/55.04. The total average expense was $355.73. There was a de - crease of $21.57 in inventory values, which left an average net income from the sale and use of dairy, products of $377.74 for the year. Interest at 5 per cent on the original investment amounted to an average of $42.58. This left an average labor income of 5_3:;5.1f,. The average time spent by women on dairy products was 2 1 hours and 22 minutes per month. This amounted to 35 per cent of the total average time spent on dairy products throughput the year Out of the entire group, 7.8 per cent lost money on dairy products 6.i) per cent reported an hourly income of SI. OO or more, and 37 per cent had an hourly income of less than 30 cents. The average hourly income was 40.3 cents and the median income 37.0 cents. _ From both poultry and dairy products the women represented in this study were responsible' for an average addition to the family in - come of $220.58. This income was cither in money, in products used or in increased inventory values. Both average and median hourly returns from poultry products were slightly higher than from dairy products. The initial investment was much greater in dairy stock than in poultry. There were, however lewer losses on dairy products than on poultry products, but also there we «s fewer lnstan ces where a high hourly return was reporteil Dairy activities seemed to offer greater security than did poultry activities </seg>
            <seg id="p005">The Contribution of Nebraska Farm Women to Family Income through Poultry and Dairy Products BY M. RUTH CLARK This investigation was made in 1929-1930 for the purpose of studying the activities of Nebraska farm women in the raising of poultry and in the care of dairy products, to dis - cover whether or not such activities resulted in a contribution to the family income. With this in view, a group of women were asked to keep records for one year (from April 1, 1929, to March 31, 1930) of the value and amount of dairy and poultry products sold or used, of all expenses incurred in production, and of the time spent, both by the homemaker herself and by all other members of the household, in the pro - duction and sale of dairy and poultry products. When this study was outlined it was intended to cover only actual cash addition to the family income. This, however, did not prove to be feasible, as a considerable portion of the contribution to the family income was in the form of dairy and poultry products used at home. They were indirectly a contribution to the family cash income, since such products, . had they not been produced at home, would presumably have been purchased. It would give an unfair picture of the in - come from dairy and poultry products if the products for home consumption were not included. There would also be raised, in such a case, the question of what part of the ex - penses of producing such dairy and poultry products should be charged against the products sold and what portions of such expenses were due to the production of dairy and poultry supplies for home consumption. This study, thei'efore, as finally completed, covers more than the cash contribution made by the homemaker to the family income. The women who were asked to keep records co-operated splendidly. Complete yearly records were secured from 159 women living in various parts of the state. In choosing the portions of Nebraska to be included in the study, an effort was made to have various producing and marketing condi - tions represented as fully as possible. Records were secured from the following counties: Dawson, Custer, Nance, Adams, Brown, Thurston, Jefferson, Saunders, and Kimball. In each district a local woman acted as leader. The record - keepers met from time to time to discuss the work, and every effort was made to secure careful and accurate monthly re- </seg>
            <seg id="p006">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 258 ports. Each yearly record was totaled separately and a com - plete summary of her year's work was sent back to each woman who co-operated in the study. The farms from which records were secured varied con - siderably in type of tenure and in size. • Of the entire group, 40 per cent were owners, 13.5 per cent were part-owners, and 45.9 per cent were tenants. One record came from the home of a hired man. Tenure and size of the farms in acres are shown in Table 1. Farms of 160 acres or less predominated, while those of from 161 to 320 acres constituted the second largest division.

After the year of record keeping was completed, a second inventory of the same kind was taken, and' it was therefore possible to compare the amount and value of poultry, dairy stock, and poultry and dairy equipment in 1929 and in 1930! The number of laying hens in the flocks increased somewhat during the year in which records were kept. This is shown in Table 2. When the records were started 19.5 per cent of the flocks consisted of 50 or fewer laying hens. Only 7.6 per cent reported flocks of from 151 to 200 hens and only. .5 per TABLE 2.— Size of flocks of hens at beginning and at end of . year's records — -y-- -, = 1929 ■ . | 1930 Sizes of flocks in laying hens NumbeH Percent' Number Percent 1- 50 | 3i i 19.5 ■ ! 23 14.5 51-100 | .fi2 39.0 50 31 4 101-150 I 46 | 28.9 ! 46 -&gt;8 9 1 51 -2O° I 12 ■ !' 7.6 21 \Z.2 Over 200 ■ I 8 ' 5.0 19 ! 12.0 </seg>
            <seg id="p007">Contribution of Farm Women to Family Income cent had more than 200 laying hens. In 1930, however, at the close of the year's record keeping, a decided change had occurred in the numbers reporting various sized flocks. The number of small flocks had decreased, while the number of larger flocks had increased. Only -14.5 per cent i*eported 50 hens or less. On' the other hand, the percentage of flocks of from 151 to 200 hens had gone up from 7.6 per cent to 13.2 per cent, while flocks of over 200 had increased from 5 per cent to 12 per cent. The increase is also shown by the average of the number of laying hens entered in the two inventories. When the year's record keeping commenced, the average num - ber of laying hens was 101, while it had increased at the end of the year to 123. There are various explanations for this increase. The one give"n by a number of the women who kept the records is that, through the record work itself, they became more consciously interested in their poultry and made an attempt to build up larger flocks. Prices, however, had something to do with this increase in size of flocks on hand in 1930. Poultry prices fell .during the .year, and it was not so advantageous to sell poultry as it would have been had prices been better. Many women preferred to hold their poultry rather than to sell at the prices they could have received. .The change in values of poultry at the two different times was not so marked as that in size of flocks, as poultry prices were lower in 1930 than they were in 1929. There was a slight increase in total inventory value, however; the average value of the flock was $126.15 in 1929 and $129.58 in 1930 — an average increase of $3.43. The value of equipment also increased. The average in - ventory value of poultry equipment at the beginning of the year was $57.22, while at the end it was $60.06 — an increase of $2.84 per family. The income from poultry is, of course, obtained almost entirely from the sale or use of eggs and poultry. Most of the women in this group sold either eggs or poultry at some time during the year, but many did so irregularly. The percent - ages of the group selling eggs and poultry at various times of the year are shown in Table 3. During the spring months, March, April, and May, almost every woman in the group re - ported egg sales. This is in distinct contrast to November, when only 40 per cent mai'keted eggs. Poultry was not at any time sold by a large percentage of the group. The season when sale of eggs was reported by the largest number was the season when the sale of poultry was repoi-ted by only a few. From January to and including April, the sale of poultry was not reported at any time by more than </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 258 30 per cent of the women. In July almost half (49 per cent) marketed poultry, while 47 per cent reported poultry sales in September. In these months young chickens were placed on . the market and flocks were culled. During this year poultry prices experienced a considerable drop. In many cases this Table 3. — Percentages of group tliat produced eggs and poultry for sale • Month Eggs j Poultry !

This price situation may have had a very decided effect upon the number of persons reporting, the sale of poultry during the various months. How great this influence was it is impossible to say without comparison with poultry sales in other years. . The sale of eggs was a much better distributed source of income than was that of poultry (Table 3). There was, how - ever, great fluctuation in the number of dozens of eggs sold throughout the different months. In March an average of 123 dozen eggs was sold, while only 10 dozens were sold in November. Beginning with December and ending in March, there was a steadily and rapidly increasing sale of eggs, while from April to November the number of eggs sold decreased. The decrease, however, was much more gradual than the in - crease. The number of eggs reported for home consumption varied much less than did the number placed on the market. The greatest home consumption of eggs was in April, the least in November. Eggs were used for hatching purposes during February, March, April, May, and June. The greatest use of eggs for this purpose was in April. The average numbers of dozens sold, used at home, and used for hatching, each month </seg>

The average gross income from the sale of all poultry products is shown in Table 5. Eggs sold exceeded consider - ably in value the poultry sold. The gross income from eggs sold varied greatly in the different seasons. The average gross income from the sale of eggs was greatest in March, when it amounted to $26.76.

In late summer and autumn the highest gross income from sale of poultry was received. From July to- November more than $10.00 was received each month. The total gross in - come for the year was $106.73, as compared to $153.18 from the sale of eggs. The income shown in the miscellaneous column of Table 5 was derived from custom hatching, prizes taken at poultry shows, and sale of poultry equipment. The total gross income from all poultry products sold was $261.34, Figure 2 shows the fluctuations in the amounts received for eggs sold during the year and in the value of the eggs used at, home. From a comparison of Figures 1 and .2 it is obvious that the number of dozens of eggs sold at various times throughout the year and the amounts received from such sales fluctuated together, as the highest point in both cases occurred in Mai-ch and the lowest .in November. The fluctuation in number of eggs sold, however, was considerably greater than the fluctuation in the market value of the eggs. In March, for example, 123 dozens of eggs were sold at a value of $26.76, while in January an average of only 33 dozens were placed on the market at a value of $10.20.

The average number of eggs and poultry used each month, together with average unit values, is shown in Table 8. In April the eggs used averaged 18 dozens per family, while in November an average of only 4 dozens were used. The prices at which eggs for home use were valued are slightly below, in most cases, the prices at which eggs were sold. This is be - cause the larger and cleaner eggs Were usually selected for market and also because a number of the records showed eggs sold for hatching during certain months at higher than cur - rent market prices.

These figures are shown in Table 11 and are the income and expense figures when the poultry in - ventories at the beginning and the end of the year are not included. With the inventory values included, the average net income was somewhat larger, as there was an increase in in - ventory value during the year.

This would mean that an average of $12.30 was added to the family income from products sold or used at home each month: A record of the time spent by homemakers and other per - sons in the care of poultry was kept and a comparison of the time spent by the homemakers and by all other persons was possible. On the basis of these records, it can be said that poultry raising is at the present time wholly or in large part in the hands of the farm homemaker.

From April to September the percentage of homemakers who took entire care of the poultry and poultry products was much greater than at any other time. In April, 30 per cent of the Socks were cared for by the women without help, while in May this increased to 35 per cent. In February and March, however, only 11 per cent of the women of the group took entire care of the poultry. During the spring and summer season when a larger per - centage of the flocks were cared for by women without help than at any other time, there were also fewer flocks cared for by other persons alone. At this time farm work is always heaviest and care of poultry falls largely upon the farm woman. In the spring and summer there are baby and young chickens to be cared for, and this is almost traditionally the responsibility of the homemaker. In June only one per cent of the flocks were' given no time by the homemakers of the group, but in December, January, and February over 20 per cent of the flocks were entirely cared for by persons other than the farm homemaker. Table 13 .shows the numbers and percentages of persons either taking entire care of poultry during the year, or helping in such care. The amount of time spent in the care of poultry fluctuated greatly throughout the year. In February the least time was </seg>

(See Table 14.) In March baby chicks were listed by a few of the women ; the baby-chick season, however, did not begin for most of the record keepers until April. In that month the average amount of time spent by the homemakers increased greatly, while in May there was a further increase in time spent. An average of 40 hours and 33 minutes was reported for the month, or about one hour and 20 minutes per day. This was the largest average amount of time spent by the hdmemaker during any month of the year, and constituted 84 per cent of the total time given to care of poultry in this month. The time devoted to care of poultry decreased rapidly in June and continued to decrease during the following months. The least time was spent during November, December, January, arid February. There was' no time in the year when persons other than the homemakers did not help in the care of poultry and poultry products, but at no time did others spend as much time as did the homemakers. In March an average of 12 hours was spent by persons other than the farm homemakers in the care of poultry. This was the greatest number of hours reported in any month by such persons. It did not, however, constitute as great a percentage of the total time spent in, the care of poultry as did the time spent in some other months of the year by other persons. In December, January, and February for example, over 40 per cent of the time reported in care of poultry was spent by persons other than the homemakers, but during these months the time spent was small During the year the homemakers were responsible for 70 per cent of the total average time expended in the care of </seg>

Thirty-seven per cent of the records, therefore, show either a loss or an hourly return of less than 30 cents. The average net return per hour for all the group was 44.5 cents ; the median return per hour was 42 cents. At one end of the scale of hourly return were the 14 women who reported losses, while at the other end were 18 women whose income was $1.00 or more per hour. That there was some relation between size of flock and return for time spent is indicated by Table 16. The 14 cases in which losses were incurred were from flocks of less than 150 hens, with 92.9 per cent of the losses occurring from flocks of 100 or fewer hens. Of the 18 women who had an hourly return of $1.00 or more, only 16.7 per cent had flocks of less than 100 hens. The difference between the two extremes seems to lie largely, how - ever, in the methods and equipment used. In a few cases some of the losses and the extremely low returns were caused by factors entirely outside the power of the women to control; for example, a tornado caused the almost total destruction of two or three flocks. </seg>

I Upon the assumption that any activity which nets less than 30 cents per hour for all time expended cannot be considered profitable, it is clear from Table 15 that 37 per cent of the women who kept records fall in this low-income group. For them poultry keeping during the year for which. records are available cannot be considered profitable unless such poultry keeping can be justified on some basis other than an economic one. The homemakers who showed a return of 30 cents or more per hour from their labors may, on the other hand, con - sider that their efforts were justified economically. Whether they were justified in other ways for the time they spent on poultry is a question which every woman must answer for herself. Could she spend the time more profitably in the care of her home or her children? Would her time be worth more to her if she spent it in some form of recreation? That her labors with poultry during the year for which these records were kept did result in a substantial addition to the family income is undeniable. The income from poultry and poultry products is, of course, conditioned by the prices which prevail at any time. For the farm homemaker poultry raising forms a part-time employment which may help to give her a feeling of economic importance in the family life, and at the same time it may serve to give her an outside interest which is of value. The farm homemaker may find in her poultry activities the same satisfaction which a constantly increasing number of town and city women find in the pai't-time job. If the farm homemaker discovers that her labors result in an actual cash return, she may the more readily avail herself of labor-saving devices and of outside service agencies. Her feeling that her labors result in little tangible income has. </seg>
            <seg id="p021">Contribution of Farm Women to Family Income been a factor in preventing her ready acceptance of new equipment. Of the group of 159 women who kept poultry records, there were five who did not keep dairy records, either because no cows were milked or because they had no part in the work. There were, however, 154 completed dairy reports. As in the case of poultry, the first step in the record keeping was to take an inventory of dairy stock and equipment. A closing inventory was taken at the end of the year. The average number of cows reported at the beginning and at the end of the year was six. Although the number of cows did not change, the value of the herd in 1930 was lower than in 1929. This is explained by the fact that cattle values fell during the year. The aver - age value of the dairy stock in 1929 was $801.64, while in 1930 it was $780.48 — a decrease of $21.16. The value of equipment showed a very slight decrease also.

This number was never as high as the number given in the inventories of dairy cows, since the in - ventories included all the dairy cows in the herd, whether they were being milked at the time or not. During every month there were, of course, some which were not milked. A steady decline in the number took place from July to November with the smallest number of cows, 4.1, reported during the 'latter month. Beginning in December the number increased just as steadily until June, when the average was 5.7 cows. Some members of the group did not sell dairy products at any time throughout the year. There were others, and this was a larger percentage, who sold only occasionally while still others sold milk, cream, or butterfat regularly Durinir October, November, December, and January, dairy products were sold by the smallest percentages of the group In No vember and December 20 per cent of the group reported no sale of dairy products.

(See Table 19.) Whole milk was sold by a relatively small portion of the group. In July the largest number, amounting to 12 per cent, reported the sale of whole milk, while in no month did less than 8 per cent report such sales. In almost every case where whole milk was marketed, the farms were located near towns in which there were dairies. Sweet cream was sold by a relatively small percentage also, although the percentage of the group reporting the sale of sweet cream exceeded, every month of. the year, those report - ing the sale of whole milk. In May the highest percentage re - ported the sale of sweet cream, when 25 per cent of the group made such sales.

Butter was not sold by many; at no time did more than 10 per cent report such sales. The making of butter was a task which fell almost entirely upon the homemaker and added considerably to the time which she spent in the care of dairy products. Selling whole milk generally required less time on the part of the homemaker than selling either cream or butter - fat, as the care of the separator was one of the tasks in con - nection with the production and sale of dairy products which usually devolved upon the woman. The value of dairy products sold is shown in Table 20. An average income of .$216.82 was received from the sale of butterfat alone, while whole milk and sweet cream sold amounted to $55.68 and $65.09 respectively. Very little butter was sold — $6.62 for the year being the average income from this, product. In all, $344.21 was the average gross income received from sales of dairy products. When stock sales are included, the average gross income for the year from dairy sales amounted to $528.55, since dairy stock sales averaged S 184.34 for the year.

Butter - fat prices shown in Table 21 are lower than . the average prices which prevailed in Nebraska during the various months of the year. One reason for this is that handling charges have been deducted. The sharp break in butterfat prices be - tween March and April is explained by the fact that the records from which this information is obtained were kept from April 1, 1929, to March 31, 1930.

The average monthly values of all dairy products used at home are shown in Table 22. The greatest single home use of dairy products, from the point of view of money value, was that of milk as a feed on the farm. Separated milk was valued at either 2 cents or 3 cents per gallon. When whole milk was fed, however, it was valued in accord - ance with the selling price of whole milk in the district and at the time the milk was used. The average value of milk fed during the year was $83.01, with the largest amounts being used for such feeding purposes in June and July. These figures included milk fed to calves as well as to other animals. The milk fed to calves was counted both as income and ex - pense against the dairy record when calves were entered in the inventories as part of the dairy herd. The milk for home consumption during the entire year had an average value of $59.48. There was considerable fluctua - tion in the average value of the milk used in different months of the year. Higher total monthly valuations occurred in August and December than in the other months. For ex - ample, in August the milk used by each family was valued at an average of $5.58, while in the next month an average of only $4.48 was reported for home use of milk. The amount and value of milk used for household purposes depend very largely upon the number of persons and the consumption habits of the household. Cream was not valued separately where whole milk was used and the cream simply skimmed off the milk. It was however, valued separately when cream, which might other - wise have been sold either as sweet cream or as butterfat was used. In many cases separated milk was used in place </seg>
            <seg id="p026">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 258 of whole milk and this was usually accompanied by a generous use of cream. There was about the same fluctuation in the average monthly valuation of the cream used as there was in the value of the milk used. The month of highest cream valuation was May and the iowest February. Butter for home use amounted in value to $32.33 for the year. The average value of the butter used each month, how - ever, fluctuated very little. Like cream, it was lowest in February. The total average value of all dairy products' used on the farm, either for feeding farm animals or for home consumption, was $226.49.

Milk for home use was valued at from 6 to 8 cents per quart and cream from 36 to 40 cents per quai-t. while the value of butter ranged from 34 cents per pound in January to 42 cents in April, August, and September. The greatest expense charged against the dairy herd was for feed. In the monthly records kept, purchased' and home - grown feeds were listed separately and average monthly charges for both are shown in Table 24. These figures show that at no time during the year was any considerable portion of the dairy feed purchased. The average value of purchased feed was greatest in April, when $6.15 was spent. This con - stituted 17 per cent of the total value of feed for the month. Home-grown feed was also valued most highly during the same month, when an average of $30.45 was reported, making the total average spent for dairy feed during April S36 60 </seg>

This was the period when pasture was most plentiful. Beginning in November, however, there was a noticeable increase in the amount charged against the dairy herd for feed. Just why the purchased feed charge should have been so much higher in April than it was at any other time during the year is difficult to explain. That expenses for feed from November to May should be high was to be expected, as there is no pasture at that time of year. Qther charges against the dairy herd were principally for additions to the dairy herd or to the dairy equipment. The miscellaneous items shown in Table 25 include such charges as those for veterinary service, trucking, etc. Purchases of . stock accounted for the greater part of the expense other than feed. Two months, January and October, were considerably higher than any of the other months of the year in average cost of additions to the dairy herd. The average cost of such stock purchased during the entire year was $53.59; equip - ment purchased averaged $10.00 for the year, and miscel - laneous expenses $1.36. The average gross income from the sale and use of dairy products was $755.04, while the average expense was $355.73, making an average net income of $399.31. (See Table 26.)

Throughout the year 35 per cent of the total time required in the care of dairy products was spent by the farm homemakers. April was the only month when an average time of an hour a day was- spent thus by each homemaker. I he smallest percentage of the total time spent by the home - maker was in January, when her time amounted to only 30 per cent of the total time spent in dairy work. Table 28 corroborates the evidence shown in Figure 5 as to the place which the homemaker had in the care of dairy pro - ducts. She was, in most cases, a helper in such work rather than the person who carried the responsibility for it. In every month of the year other persons spent considerablv more time than did the homemaker. She did, nevertheless, have a sub - stantial part in the work.

Thirty-seven per cent of the records showed either a loss or a labor income of less than 30 cents per hour The average hourly income for the entire group was 40 3 cents, while the median income was 37.3 cents per hour. Some relationship was found between the number of cows milked and the return per hour for all time spent in dairy activities. Five of the 12 losses were reported . on either one or two milk cows. That the number of cows milked was only one of the determining factors, however, was illus - trated by the fact that in some instances where an average of two cows were milked, an hourly return of more than $1.00 was reported, while much larger herds on other farms re - sulted in low incomes. Many factors affected the return received from dairy activ - ities, of which management was certainly the most important. Equipment used in the care of milk and cream could be largely ignored, as much the same equipment was reported by 92 per cent of the group. The management side of the problem would include such items as the breed of cows milked, the kind and amount of feed used, the care given the dairy herd, and the way in which dairy products were marketed. A com - parison showed no appreciable difference in the incomes re - ceived in various portions of the state. Both the average and the median hourly incomes from the time spent in the care of dairy products are lower than those for the time spent in the care of poultry, although the differ - ence is slight. The hourly net returns reported by numbers and percentages of the group are shown in Table 29. Assum - ing again that an average hourly return of less than 30 cents </seg>
            <seg id="p031">Contribution of Farm Women to Family Income for time spent upon dairy products cannot be considered economically profitable, it can be seen from Table 29 that in addition to the 7.8 per cent of the group who sustained an actual loss on their dairy products during the year, 29.2 per cent of the group fall under that classification. For the families in this low-return group, dairy activities might, of course, be justified on grounds of necessity or of convenience. Since the homemakers spent 70 per cent of the total time required by poultry activities and 35 per cent of that re- Table 29. — Number and percentage of group reporting various hourly incomes from dairy and dairy products Hourly return Number | Per cent _ . | 51.00 and over 6 3.9 90-99 cents 3 2.0 80-89 cents 5 3.2 70-79 cents 10 6.5 60-69 cents 14 9.1 50-59 cents 15 9.7 40-49 cents '. ..........| 20 13.0 30-39 cents | 24 15.6 20-29 cents 24 15.6 10-19 cents 11 7.1 • 1- 9 cents 10 6.5 Loss ■ 12 7.8 quired in the care of dairy products, it is permissible to assume that they were directly responsible for corresponding proportions of the total net incomes which resulted from the sale and use of poultry and of dairy products. Since the average net return from poultry products amounted to $147.54, this would mean that the 159 homemakers who kept poultry records were responsible by their labor for an addi - tion to the family income of 70 per cent of this amount, or $103.28. The 154 women who, in addition to poultry records, kept dairy records also, were responsible for an income of $117.30 each, as a return for the time they spent on dairy products. From both poultry and dairy products, the women in this group who kept both records were directly responsible for the average sum of $220.58 added to the family income in money, in dairy or poultry products, or in increase in inven - tory values. They spent on both poultry and dairy products an average of 43 hours and 44 minutes per month. This is, of course, added to the time demanded by the care of house and family as well as by other work outside the home in which the farm woman may have some part.

The decrease in the dairy inventory value has been subtracted. ■ poultry, the hourly return was smaller. There were fewer cases in which hourly returns from dairy products amounted to $1.00 or more, but the number who reported loss on dairy stock was smaller than the number reporting loss on poultry. It would seem from this that dairy activities offered more security than did poultry, but that poultry offered pos - sibilities of higher returns to successful management, with smaller initial investment. The figures given as net return include interest on investment and "charges for depreciation on equipment during the year. They can, therefore, be looked upon as labor income. For the majority of the women in this group their activ - ities m connection with both poultry and dairy products dur - ing the year in question were economically profitable. In no case did the homemaker consider the income from poultry or dairy products as being peculiarly her own. The money in - come received from the sale of such products was considered aS ? a \ \u- th * familv income and was spent largely for food and clothing for the family. This is in complete accord with the close co-operation which exists between the farm business and the farm home. The farm homemaker, from such results as this study shows, has every reason to consider her efforts as economically valuable from the point of view of actual in - come. r r-'iMi </seg>
