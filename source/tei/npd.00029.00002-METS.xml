Aldrich, Governor of the State of Nebraska: Peas Sib — The law governing this department provides that port of the business transacted and the acts performed by Chief Deputy Fire Commissioner and others constituting the department be made to yon annually, and I have the honor to herewith submit such report covering the work that we have accomplished during the past year. We have endeavored to carry out every provision of the law so far as it lay in our power. The work of this department, as we interpret it, is threefold, viz., educational, personal inspection of property and investigation of suspicious fires. Four educational work we have endeavored to call the atten - of the public to the enormous waste of property by lire have warned them against careless practices which have been the cause of a great loss of property and many live*. Along this line we have issued, published and distributed over 60,000 bulletins and publications. Ee following was was enacted by the legislature of 1911. ng it compulsory to teach fire prevention in the public, te and parochial schools of this state : "State Fire Day Law. "Section 1. That for the purpose of creating a public senti ment, and in order that the people of this state shall have called to their attention the great damage caused, both to life and property, by fire, there is hereby set apart and established the first Fridav in November which Bhall be designated and known </seg>

This day shall be observed by the public, ate and parochial schools of the state with exercises ropriate to the subject and the day. tion 2. That for the purpose of instruction in fire dan - gers, and in methods of fire prevention, it shall be the duty of the Chief Deputy Fire Commissioner and of the State Super - intendent of Public Instruction to prepare a book conveniently arranged in chapters, or lessons, such chapters or lessons to be in number sufficient to provide a different chapter or lesson for each month of the maximum school year. The expense for publishing the books of instruction, or other literature on the subject of fire dangers, shall be paid out of the special fund for maintenance of the fire commissioner's office, and said books of instruction shall be distributed by the state superintendent of public instruction, in quantities sufficient to provide a copy for each teacher. And every teacher or instructor in every public, private or parochial school shall devote not less than thirty minutes in each school month, to instruction of piipils in the subject of fire dangers, and in the methods of fire prevention. "Section 3. It shall be the duty of the members of school boards, school directors, trustees, or other body of j»ersons having control of the schools of any city, village or district, to cause a copy of this act to be printed in the manual or handbook prepared for the guidance of teachers, where f»neh manual is in imp or may hereafter come in use.'" E compliance with this law we prepared and published a ook. which has been placed in the hands of every teacher ? public, private and parochial schools in this state. You already received a copy of this hook so that it will not be »ary for us to embody it in this report. Phave forwarded a copy of this textbook to all the •rs of the last legislature, to every newspaper, and to city and village council, and every women's club in the state. We are sure that from the wide circulation that we have given this textbook that if the teachers carry out the provisions of the law and the public become interested that great benefit will be derived and that the loss of life and property </seg>
            <seg id="p009">9 We also prepared and are distributing 40,000 pledges for the protection of the home. These have been mailed to commercial clubs, women's clubs, bankers, town councils, newspapers and tateer fire chiefs and they have distributed large quantities lem in the towns in which they reside. Fe have issued and published two bulletins during the year statistics show have been of great value. In June last issued and had published in all of the newspapers of this state one warning the people against careless practices and pleading with them for a safe and sane Fourth of July. In December we issued one to the fathers and mothers, clergymen, Sunday school superintendents and teachers, which was also published in all of the newspapers, warning them against dangers from cotton and other inflammable material on and around Christmas trees, and I am pleased to inform you that there has been less property destroyed and less people injured attending these two celebrations in this state than in previous MM. Kbere is one thing certain. Governor, if there is any virtue winters' ink. and there i», we certainly ought to get results »e have spread it broadcast over the state. The public press of this state have rendered us valuable assistance in placing the facts before the people without any hope of reward other than the good results that will be attained in furthering the best interests of not only their local communities but the entire state, and we wish to express to them onr thanks for their hearty co-operation. Bof the provisions of the Fire Commission law Is that 11 make inspection of buildings and premises and where d dangerous conditions existing cause the removal of Ely believing in the old adage, "to sweep l&gt;efore mm before we do our neighbor's.'' we started inspecting in the Capitol, and after having that cleaned out we inspected e buildings of the State University.

We have made a thorough inspection of over 15&lt;t towns ami have ins|«cte«i 7&gt;:2\i\ buildings and have had bad amditi(M lied and unsafe conditions made M safe as possible. In a number of towns we have visited we have found old. dilapidated buildings that by reason of age and neglect h;ive become a menace to life and property. Whenever such buildings have been discovered, if they were worth repairing we have ordered them repaired and put in safe condition, but where they were past repairing we have ordered them torn down and removed, not, however until the owners have been given ample time and opportunity to be heard and show cause why an order should not be issued against their property. Thpre have been 125 buildings repaired in compliance with orders issued by this department and 160 buildings have been condemned as dangerous fire hazards, a menace to adjoining property and the property of the towns in which they are located, and they have been torn down and removed. There are fifty complaints against dangerous buildings now on file in This office which we have under consideration; these will be disposed of as soon as owners can be heard in the matter. IFive complaints have been filed with us against buildings at we dismissed, as we did not deem there was any cause for mplaint. Kit has been our aim not to condemn a dollar's worth of prop - ty that was worth repairing and there has not been an appeal taken from our decision in all of the cases that we have disposed of. as we have endeavored to interest the owners along lines of •afetr and the conservation of life and property. There have been 115 suspicious and incendiary fires reported </seg>
            <seg id="p011">STATE FIRE COMMISSION 11 Ps office during the past year and we have made a careful igation of over one hundred of them and have taken over pages of testimony. There have been two convictions and complaints are now pending against two, and we are still investigating several cases. Eie apprehension of persons guilty of arson is one of the est crimes to uncover that there is; the crime is one of deliberation, is usually carefully planned and executed and ies engaging in the crime usually do it in such a manner it is hard to obtain evidence to convict, notwithstanding act that there is no question of their guilt. You will notice that the number of suspicious and incendiary are about 10 per cent of all the fires that have been reported to us during the year. This might possibly lead you to inquire as to the cause. My observation makes it plain to me that in a majority of cases it is overinsurance. There ought to be I law enacted giving the Insurance Department of this state more supervision over the acts of fire insurance companies and their agents. By the overinsuring of property there is a temptation placed before the insured to either be careless and cause his property to burn or to deliberately set it on fire for the purpose of collecting an exorbitant amount from the insur - ;iii'i&gt; company that is carrying the risk. Even if the insured is not guilty of the crime of arson, the fact that the property is overinsured, in case of a flre. casts reflection on the insured. and causes an investigation to be made which would not have ■ been the case had the property not been overinsured. The people of this state are to be congratulated upon having so efficient a body of men to look after their interests as con - stitutes the various fire departments in the several towns of this state. You will notice that the value of buildings that have been on fire during the year was 18,687,414; but that the flre loss on these buildings was only $1,017,211.37, or about 11$ |x»r cent of the value of the buildings. TIip value of the content* </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 THIRII ANNUAL REPORT was $8,067,817. and the total lows to contents was only $70(1. 911.65, or only 9$ per cent of the total value. The firemen of this state have rendered valuable service in ringuishing fires and should be given credit for a large part the $14,977,107.98 that has been saved to the people, for had t not been for their efforts nearly all of this property would have been destroyed. The firemen are a valuable asset to a town, whether of volunteer or paid departments. They are erer ready to respond to the call of duty and protect the lives and property of the people of their respective towns, and the citizens should appreciate their efforts. City councils and village boards ought to be very liberal in equipping and main - taining their fire companies. The Nebraska State Fire Prevention Association have worked in conjunction with us and have rendered us valuable assistance. Rthe towns that we have visited officially the people have to appreciate our efforts and have assisted us in carrying provisions of the law and we have received several invitations to deliver addresses before town councils and com - mercial clubs on the subject of fire prevention, but the duties of our office have been such that we have not been able to respond except in two or three instances. We hope during the coming year to be able to visit a number of towns and address them along fire prevention lines. W* have endeavored to run the business of the department in an economical and businesslike manner. The success of the year's work is due to the loyal efforts of every one connected with the department. Pe fact that you retained Miss Mnldoon as secretary enabled carry on the work that had been started by my predecessor, you did a wine act when you reappointed her. Deputy John C. Trouton and Inspectors F. J. Buck and Edw Williams have rendered valuable service, have always been ready to respond to every rail of duty and are entitled to a large de - rrxT of credit for the work that has been accomplished </seg>
            <seg id="p013">STATE FIRE COMMISSION 13 During the year it has been necessary to employ extra help from time to time to carry on the work of the department and they have been loyal and faithful to the duties imposed upon them, and I desire to thank each and every one connected with this department for the assistance that they have rendered in making the record that we have made and accomplished, what I believe to be, a great amount of good, not only for the present but for future generations. E conclusion. I desire to thank you, Governor, for the dence you reposed in me and I hope that my efforts hare your expectations, and I shall endeavor to merit your con - h! confidence by faithful and honest hard work.
