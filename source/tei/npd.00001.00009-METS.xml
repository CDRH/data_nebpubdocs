SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

To (he Board of Public Lands and BvSdmg*: 

Gentlemen : — I hereby respectfully submit the following report 
of the Nebraska Hospital for the Insane, for the biennial 
period ending Nov. 30, 1882 : 

At the date of ray last report, Nov. 30, 1880, there were remaining 
in the Hospital one hundred and ninety-three (193) patients, 
one hundred and tour (104) males and eighty-nine (89) females. 


There has been received during the past two years two hundred 
and eighty-eight (288) patients. One hundred and seventy-four 
(174) males and one hundred and fourteen (114) females. There 
has been discharged during this time two hundred and eight 
(208). One hundred and twenty-nine (129) males and seventynine 
(79) females, leaving in the Hospital at the present time, 
Nov. 30, 1882, two hundred and seventy-three (273) patients : 
one hundred and forty-nine (149) males and one hundred and 

Of those discharged one hundred and nineteen (119) have been 
restored to mental health ; seventy-seven (77) males and fortytwo 
(42) females. Thirty-four (34) had become so much improved 
as to enable their frieads to care for them at their owa_ homes ; 
twelve (12) have been discharged unimproved ; one has escaped 
and forty-iwo (42) have died during the two years. 

The average number of patients during the year ending Nov. 
30, 1881, was two hundred and twelve. The whole number 
treated three hundred and seventeen (317). The percentage of 
recoveries of the whole number treated was fifteen, and the 
deaths were five and one-third per cent.

REPORT OF THE 

The average number for the year ending Nov. 30, 1882, has 
been two hundred and fifty-two (252) and the whole number 
treated three hundred and ninety-four (394). The recoveries 
during the year have been nineteen per cent, and the deaths six 
and one-third per cent, of the whole number treated. 

The last two years have been a comparatively successful period 
in the history of the Hospital. No epidemic has prevailed among 
the patients, and no accident worthy of especial notice has occured. 
We have been able to receive promptly all applicants for 
admission, and none have been returned to the counties except 
at the solicitation of friends. Our percentage of recoveries compare 
favorably with other institutions, and the death rate is cor¦ 
ndingly low. The expenses of the Hospital have aver, 
lower than at any other period since the institution ha3 been 
opened. The average per capita expense for the last two years, 
hfli been three dollars and forty-two cents ($3.42) per week For 
the five year3 I have been connected with the Hospital the aver¦g* 
has been three dollars and sixty-six cents ($3.66) per week. 
For the five years previous the average was eight dollars and 
eighty-eight cents ($8.88) per capita per week. For the last eleven 
months the average expenses have been three dollars and eight 
cents ($3.08) per week. These figures include the pay of officers, 
firm improvements and increase of stock; the increase during 
the past five years has been from four (4) to one hundred and 
twenty (190) head of cattle, and from sixty (60) to one hundred 
and fifty (150) hogs, with an addition of five horses, and a 
complete new outfit of farming implements. The farm products 
h;ive been unusually good the present year; there has been har•d 
six thousand (600Q) bushels of corn, nineteen hundred 
and fifty (1950) bushels of oats, four hundred (400) bushels of 
ibur thousand and two hundred (4200) bushels of potatoes, 
iiuii'hvl an 1 twenty (120) tons of hav — forty (40) tons of 

Elet, and an abundant supply of garden vegetables for the use 
the Hospital. Last year our crops were short, being about 
-half the usual ivenm, and to this cause .it is mostly due </seg>

that our per capita expense for that year \va3 sixty-eight (68) 

per cent, per week above the present year. In view of the un- 

certainty of our income from the farm I have thought best to 

make the basil of our requisition for the next two yean at three 

dollars and tifty cents ($3.50) per capita per week, ami the-ratio

of the increase of patients the same as for the last two year 

This will give us an average 

rage of three hundred and fifteen (315 1 

patients for the year 1883, and three hundred and sixty-five (365) 

for the year 1884. Possibly it may exceed this number, but it

been finished as far as the appropriations would permit, 
the remainder has been temporarily arranged for the accomiation 
of patients received from other States. Three-fourths 
he room now occupied by patients and also the additions now 
&gt;rocess of construction, has been paid for out of the Building 
id. Yet more than one half of the counties in the State have 

Ktributed nothing for its support. Hence the patients from 
delinquent counties are occupying rooms furnished by other 
nties. 

The per capita tax of three dollars a week charged to the 
counties for each patient, constituting the "Building Fund," is 
•collectable from the patients, or those holden for their support, 
*o that finally those who have been so unfortunate as to become 
inmates of the asylum contribute to the fund used for its erection. 
On the other hand, those counties that have paid nothing into 
this fund make no collections from patients, regardless of their 
ability to pay for their own support. 

Ehe injustice of this inequality is too manifest to require com
