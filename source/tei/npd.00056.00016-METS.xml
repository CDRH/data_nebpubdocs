            <seg id="p002">SUMMARY Ten years' results from dry farming crop rotation and cultural experi menu are summarized in this bulletin. The field upon which the worl was done was found to be somewhat lacking in soil uniformity and 01 this account the results presented are confined chiefly to comparisons o yields between plats in adjacent or near-by rotations. The most successful of the crops grown was corn. Its average yieli was 20.7 bushels or 1,159 pounds of dry shelled corn per acre in com parison with 786 pounds of winter wheat, the highest yield produced b; any small grain. Yields of the 4 small grains, winter wheat, sprinj wheat, oats, and barley, were not widely different. The choice of thes crops depends upon their relative prices per pound or the uses for whirl they are intended. The most successful forage crop was sorghum grown in cultivate) rows. Bronie grass and alfalfa frequently failed and produced but ligli average yields. No consistent advantage resulted from either spring or fall plowing Material differences in favor of each method occurred in different year but these differences were leveled down in the averages. Plowing ma be done at any time when there is sufficient moisture present to mak the operation easy. Early fall plowing frequently prevents moisiur losses from weed growth, and permits earlier seeding than when plowin is delayed until spring. Fall plowing also permits earlier seeding* i the spring, and if left rough is among the best preventives of soil blowlni Yields of spring wheat and oats were consistently am higher on corn land than after a grain crop Preparation of corn ground for a small-grain crop by do was as effective as either spring or fall plowing. Average yields per acre of all crops were higher on fallow I any system of continuous cropping. Yields of grain on fallow quently more than double those of grain after grain. Of the ci on fallow the largest gains were made by winter wheat and tt: by corn. Grain yields on corn land were less than corn crop exceeded in value the gain in grain yields from so that the corn and small-grain rotation was more profitalil fallow and small-grain rotation. The effect of plowing under peas or rye for green manure w depress yields below those from bare fallow, indicating that moisiur s\ of more importance than fertility in determining crop yields. The investigations as a whole indicate that corn may profltabl occupy a prominent place in dry-farming operations The small grains should not be grown continuously on Kill ground nor should one small-grain crop follow another In those cases where a less acreage of corn than small grain i desired, so that the corn ground does not furnish sufficient acreage fo the succeeding grain crops, fallow may be employed as a supplemental measure. It is not to be expected, however, that under average condition the grain yields from fallow will be as profitable as those of grain am corn where these crops are grown in rotation. </seg>
            <seg id="p003">Dry Farming Investigations at the Scottsbluf f Substation 1. ZCMIK This bulletin reports results from dry-land crop rotation and cultural experiments conducted at the Scottsbluff Experi - ment Substation, near Mitchell, Nebr. : While the work at this station is primarily the investigation of the problems of irrigation fanning, a part of the fanti was used for dry-farm - ing experiments from 1911 to 1921 inclusive. This area was not irrigated previous to nor during this time. This dry - farming unit was one of a group of 24 field stations on the Great Plains, at which the Office of Dry-Land Agriculture In - vestigations has established coordinated cooperative experi - ments. The land for the dry-farming experiments was broken from the native sod in the summer of 1910. The rye and winter wheat plats were seeded that fall and the remaining cropped plats the following spring. As preparation was unifonn for all plats in 1911, the yields secured in that year are not con - sidered in the discussion of results in this bulletin. The work was terminated at the close of the season of 1921. The re - sults used are therefore for the 10-year period from 1912 to 1921 inclusive. The land used is comparatively level and seemed, when selected, to be sufficiently uniform for experimental work. As &lt;t. University of Nebraska Experiment Substation. North Platte. Nehr. ; Ifice of Dry Land Aicriculture. United States Department of Agriculture. he Scottsbluff Experiment Substation is supported cooperatively by the United Department of Agriculture and the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, h«- direction of a superintendent detailed by the Office of Western Irrigation LgricuKure. The dry-land investigations were planned, outlined, and instituted by E. C. hilcott. Agriculturist in Charge of the Office of Dry Land Agriculture, and were umlei tn during their continuance. This bulletin has been pre|&gt;ared under 'ision and with the assistance of John S. Cole, Agronomist. The following have been detailed by the Office of Dry Land Agriculture in immediate charge the dry-land cooperative work during the periods indicated: Max Pfaender 1911 and 2. 1. Jacobson from 1913 to 191B. A. Osenbrug 1917. and Clarence Harris 1918 to IMS. Fritz Knoir was farm superintendent previous to 1917 and J. A. Holden has been superintendent since that date. The author has been greatly aided in the preparation and interpretation of results by the notes and records left by the men in charge of the work, by suggestions from the farm superintendents, by occasional visits to the substation during the progress of the work, by his association with similar investigations at the North Platte Experiment Substation, and by access to published and unpublished records of closely coordinated work at other stations in the Great Plains area, particularly those at Ardmore. South Dakota: Archer. Wyoming; and Akron. Colorado. Acknowledgments are made to Clar - ence Harris and W. W. Burr for assistance ami suggestions in preparing the data for publication. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 192 4 te work progressed, however, differences in results secured dicated a greater amount of soil variation than was at first apparent. It was found also that soil blowing was difficult to control under some of the cultural methods in use. These factors have influenced results somewhat, and make compari - sons between widely separated single plats of little value. In those cases where comparisons can be made between groups of several plats or between pairs of plats in adjacent rotations the results may be interpreted with a high degree of con - fidence. SOIL The soil upon which the dry-land experiments were con - ducted is light in texture, and classified as a fine sandy loam. The surface soil contains a small amount of coarse sand and gravel, and is fairly uniform to a depth of 2 or 3 feet. The proportion of coarse particles increases with depth, and gravel is encountered at depths of 5 or 6 feet on certain parts of the area. The water-holding capacity of this soil is slight at all levels. The soil to a depth of 3 feet retains moisture equiva - lent to about 13.7 per cent of the dry weight of soil. About 5.7 per cent is nonavailable to the crop. It is possible, there - fore, to store in this area for the use of the crop, water equiva - lent to only about 8 per cent of the dry weight of the soil. Translated into inches of water this amounts to a total of 3.6 inches, basing the calculation on an estimated soil weight of 78 pounds per cubic foot. On account of the higher per - centage of coarse particles, the storage capacity decreases at lower depths. For the second 3-foot section the storage of available water probably does not average much above 2.5 inches, making the total amount of available water it is possi - ble to store in the upper 6 feet only about 6 inches. On contin - uously cropped land moisture has rarely been stored below the 4-foot level. CLIMATE Climatological records kept on the Scottsbluff Experiment Substation are shown in Table 1. The 31-year monthly and annual precipitation as reported by the Weather Bureau Sta - tion at Scottsbluff is also shown. For the 10-year period covered by the dry-land investiga - tions, the chief departures from the normal precipitation were </seg>
            <seg id="p005">Dry Farming Investigations 5 deficiencies in the months of June and July. The June rainfall was consistently low for the entire 10-year period. In no case did the June rainfall reach the normal for the 31-year period, while that for July was below normal in all but 3 years. Wide fluctuations occurred in annual totals. The extreme departures from the 31-year normal were an excess of 7.72 inches in 1915 and a deficit of 5.89 inches in 1914. Six of the 10 years were below and 4 above the normal. The 10-year average precipitation is 0.92 inch below the 31-year normal. The average seasonal evaporation from April 1 to Septem - ber 30, inclusive, for the 10-year period was 3.06 times the the average precipitation. As evaporation tends to vary in - versely with precipitation, their ratios vary widely from year to year. The extremes are those of 1915 when evaporation was 1.42 times the precipitation and 1914 when it was 4.06 times the precipitation. The frost-free period has averaged 130 days, from May 15 to September 22. The longest period was 142 days from May 7 to September 26 in 1920. and the shortest period was 111 days from June 2 to September 21 in 1919. The last kill - ing frosts in the spring have varied from May 2 to June 12, and the first killing frosts in the fall from September 14 to October 7. Extremely high temperatures were of rare occurrence; 100 degrees and above were recorded on only 10 days in the 10-year period. High winds during the spring months have frequently been lestructive. CROP PRODI &lt;TIOX The field used for the dry-land experiments at Scottsbluff was divided into 158 tenth-acre plats, each 2 by 8 rods. The crops grown and the number of plats devoted to each were: Oats, 37 ; corn, 36 ; spring wheat, 27 ; winter wheat, 11 ; barley, 7 ; brome-grass, 7 ; rye and peas for green manure, 5 each ; sorghum, 3; alfalfa, 3; clover, 2; and flax, 1. In addition to the plats regularly cropped, 3 were used for special or mis - cellaneous crops, and 11 were summer tilled each year. The cropping systems included 34 rotations and 5 continuously cropped series of 6 plats each. The rotations varied in length from 2 to 6 years, with the various lengths represented as </seg>

The average yields for all plats of each crop for each year and for the 10-year period are shown in Table 2. Corn was the most successful of the crops grown. The average grain yield of corn in pounds per acre was greater than that of any other crop. In the 10-year period the corn yield was exceeded by that of winter wheat twice and by that of spring wheat, oats, and barley once each. In pounds per acre the average corn yield was 147 per cent of the winter wheat yield including spring wheat reseedings, 150 per cent of the oats yield, 159 per cent of the barley yield, and 164 per cent of the spring wheat yield. In addition to the grain, the stover yield of com is rela - tively of more value than the straw yield of small grains, as feed for -the livestock. The minimum stover yield for the 10-year period was 1,003 pounds per acre. The average for the period lacked but 144 pounds of being 1 ton per acre. Not only has corn been the highest producing and most successful of crops grown in the experiments, but. as will be shown later, it has a considerable additional value in a system of diversified farming on account of the higher yield of small grain by which it is followed in rotation. Yields of the 4 small grain crops represented were not widely different. Average yields per acre were: Oats, 771 pounds; barley, 730 pounds; spring wheat, 709 pounds; and winter wheat, 633 pounds. When winter wheat is credited with the yields of spring wheat reseeded where the stands of winter wheat were killed out, its average yield is increased to 786 pounds. In the 10-year period, winter wheat was a total loss from winterkilling once and a partial loss 4 times. The percentage of winterkilling and the unfavorable showing of winter wheat is probably greater in these experiments than is to be expected under average farm conditions in this part of the state. Several of the plats were unfavorably located and the cultural operations such that soil blowing during the win - ter and early spring months was of frequent occurrence. This was a cause of much of the winterkilling. Had this been avoided the showing of winter wheat in comparison with the other grains doubtless would have been more favorable. Sorghum as a forage crop produced very good yields in all years except 1914. In 8 of the 10 years the plantings were </seg>

This method of planting doubtless contributed to the low yield of 1914. A drought in June dried up the plants in the thick stands to such an extent that recovery from later rains was impossible. This condition was not experienced in any of the cultivated row plantings. The sod crops — brome-grass, alfalfa, and clover were very uncertain. No crops were secured in the years of seeding. In the first year after seeding, alfalfa produced crops in 7 out of 10 years, and in the second year after seeding in 8 out of 10 years. Three cuttings were made in 1915 and 1917, 2 cut - tings in 1913, and 1 cutting in each of the other years in which crops were produced. The average yields for the first and second years after seeding were about the same for the 10-year period, including the years of total failure, and amount to y&lt;&gt; ton per acre. Brome glass produced crops in 7 out of 10 years, in both first and second years after seeding. Its average yield for the 10-year period was but slightly more than half of the alfalfa yield. Only 1 cutting was made per year. Clover proved to be almost a total failure. Red clover was seeded for the first 7 years and sweet clover for the last 3 years of the 10-year period. One light crop of each was pro - duced. The investigations indicate that in a system of dry fanning in this part of the state corn should be used as a predom - inating crop. The chances of success with spring and winter wheat are about equal. Wheat may be replaced by either oats or barley in case the latter crops are preferred for feed. Sorghum grown in cultivated rows is a very dependable and high-producing forage crop.

The A, B, E, and F plats of the 5 unnumbered series at the top of the chart were those continuously cropped with the 5 crops desig - nated. The C and D plats of the same series were alternately cropped and summer tilled. In the diagram the separation of rotations is indicated by heavy lines. The work affords a number of comparisons of the effects of fall and spring plowing. Fall plowing after small grain was usually done late in August or early in September, and after corn several weeks later. Spring plowing was done shortly before spring seeding. The most accurate comparisons between fall and spring plowing were those in which pairs of plats received similar treatment except for the time of plowing. Five such com - parisons are possible where the preparation is for corn. These are plats A with B of the continuously cropped series, rota - tions 2 with 3, 114 with 45 (for 7 years), 116 with 46, and 9 with 4. The corn plat of the first rotation of each pair was prepared by spring plowing, and of the second rotation by fall plowing. All of the crops in these rotations were not the same, but the crops and treatments for each pair were the same for 2 years previous to the preparation for corn. In the case of continuous corn the higher yield was on fall plowing 6 times and on spring plowing 4 times. The average on fall plowing was 2.1 bushels per acre more than that on spring plowing. In 3 of the plat pairs corn follows oats. In one of these the comparison is but 7 years in length, so that the 3 pairs furnish but 27 comparisons in the 10 years. The higher yields were on spring plowing 17 times and on fall plowing 10 times. The average yields were 1.2 bushels per acre more on spring than on fall plowing. After wheat, corn on spring plowing in rotation 9 outyielded corn on fall plowing in rotation 4 six times, and the average on spring plowing was 0.9 bushel per acre more than on fall plowing. In the total of 47 comparisons between spring and fall plow - ing for corn the higher yield was on spring plowing 27 times and on fall plowing 20 times. The average yield on spring plowing was 20.5 bushels, and on fall plowing 20.1 bushels per acre, a gain of only 0.4 bushel per acre for the spring plowing. This difference is well within the limits of error and KALI. »M&gt; M'BIM. I'l.ilHIM. 1 lIMI-tlll l&gt; </seg>
            <seg id="p013">Dry Farming Investigations 13 it can not be said that either time of plowing has given better results than the other. For spring wheat, continuously cropped A and B plats, rotations 9 and 4, and rotations 2 and 3 furnish comparisons between spring and fall plowing. In the continuously cropped series the higher yield was on the spring plowed A plat 4 times and on the fall plowed B plat 6 times. The average yield of the B plat was 0.7 bushel more per acre than that of the A plat. Following oats, the higher yield of spring wheat was on spring plowing in rotation 9 six times, and on fall plowing in rotation 4 four times, but the average on fall plowing was 0.6 bushel more than that on spring plowing. After corn the higher yield of spring wheat was on spring plowing in rotation 2 four times and on fall plowing in rotation 3 five times, and the average yield was 1.1 bushels per acre more on fall plowing. In the 30 comparisons the higher yield of spring wheat was on spring plowing 15 times and on fall plowing 15 times. The average yield was 9.3 bushels per acre on spring plowing and 10.1 bushels per acre on fall plowing, difference of 0.8 bushel per acre in favor of fall plowing. Oats on the continuously cropped plats produced the higher yields on spring and on fall plowing 5 times each, with the average on spring plowing 1.3 bushels per acre greater than that on fall plowing. After spring wheat the oats yield on spring plowing in rotation 2 was greater than that on fall plowing in rotation 3 seven times, and the average yield on spring plowing was 5 bushels per acre more than that on fall plowing. The barley yield on the continuously cropped series was highest on spring plowing 7 times and on fall plowing 3 times, and the average on spring plowing exceeded that on fall plow - ing 2.7 bushels per acre. In the 60 comparisons between spring and fall plowing for spring wheat, oats, and barley the higher yields were on spring plowing 34 times and on fall plowing 26 times. With the possible exception of the gain of oats on spring plowing after wheat, the differences between yields on spring and fall plow - ing are small and probably within the limits of error. </seg>

CORN LAND FOR SPRING WHEAT OR OATS Rotations 1 and 3 are adjacent 3-year rotations of oats, corn, and spring: wheat, treated the same except that corn ground is prepared for spring wheat by disking: in rotation 1 and by fall plowing in rotation 3. In the 10-year period the higher yield of wheat was on disking 6 times and on fall plowing 4 times, and the average yield on disking was 0.7 bushel more per acre than on fall plowing. Rotation 2 has the same crops as 1 and 3, but the corn ground is prepared for wheat by spring plowing. Compared with rotation 1, the higher yield of spring wheat was on spring plowing 3 times, on disking 6 times, and the yields were the same in 1919. The average yield on disking was 1.8 bushels per acre more than on spring plowing. Land for oats is prepared by disking in rotation 4 and by spring plowing in rotation 7. The higher yield was on disking 6 times and on spring plowing 4 times. The average on spring plowing was 0.3 bushel per acre more than that on disking. In the 30 comparisons between disking and spring or fall plowing for spring wheat or oats the higher yield was on disking 18 times and on plowing 12 times. The differences in average yields were unimportant. In these tests as good results were secured from disking as from plowing, in preparing ground for spring grain. As disk - ing is the cheaper of the 2 operations it should under similar conditions be given the preference. CORN LAND CONPARRU WITH SHAM. GRAIN I. AM) FOR SPRING WHEAT AND OATS In rotations 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9 the crops are com. wheat, and oats. In the first 3 rotations wheat follows corn and oats follow wheat. In the last 2 rotations wheat and oats are interchanged. The 5 rotations, therefore, furnish comparisons for both spring wheat and oats grown on corn land and after a small-grain crop. In the 10-year period the higher average yield of wheat followed corn 7 times and oats 3 times. The average yields were 12.2 bushels per acre after corn and 10.7 bushels per acre after oats, an advantage of 1.5 bushels in favor of the corn land. The results with oats were similar to those with wheat, the higher yield following corn 7 times and wheat 3 times. The </seg>
            <seg id="p015">Dry Farming Investigations 15 average yields per acre were 23.4 bushels after corn and 20.5 bushels after wheat, an advantage of 2.9 bushels in favor of the corn land. The years during which corn land failed to produce higher yields than small grain land were the same for both wheat and oats. In all cases the gains on the grain land were small. The average gains for the 3 years were 1.2 bushels for wheat and 1 bushel per acre for oats. For the 7 years during which corn land produced the higher yields the average gains were 2.8 bushels for wheat and 6.8 bushels for oats. The higher yields of small grain on corn land seem to be the result of more favorable moisture conditions in that se - quence. Numerous determinations have shown that corn rarely exhausts soil moisture to as low a point as do the small grains. For the 7-year period from 1912 to 1918 inclusive moisture determinations were made on the continuous cropping series of both corn and spring wheat. Table 3 shows the per cent Table 3. — Per cent of moisture about April 10 in the upper 3 feet of soil of the continuously cropped A plats of corn and *l&gt;rin&lt;j "wheat, at Scottsbluff, Xebr., for the 7-year period from 1912 to 1918, inclusive. of moisture about April 10 in the upper 3 feet on the A plats of corn and spring wheat.

The results indicate that the chances of success with wheat or oats are considerably greater in this section on com land than where the preceding crop was grain. FALLOW I DMI'AHKI) WITH I liVMM ill « I IllllTIM. The experiments furnish a number of cases for comparing the relative effects on crop yields of fallow and cropping every {ear. Rotation 5 is fallow, spring wheat, and oats. Rotation has the same crops but with the oats on the fallow land. In the continuously cropped series the A plats are shallow spring plowed and the B plats are fall plowed for spring wheat, oats, barley, and corn. For winter wheat the B plat is early fall plowed and the A plat late fall plowed. The C and D plats are alternately cropped and summer tilled for all crops. It is thus possible to make comparisons between the average yield? of 2 fallowed plats and 3 continuously cropped plats of oats and spring wheat, and between 1 fallowed plat and the average of 2 continuously cropped plats of barley, winter wheat, and corn. The yields are shown in Table 4. The aver - age yields of all crops are greater on fallow than on land cropped every year. The percentages of increase on fallow are as follows: Corn, 36; oats, 45; barley, 80; spring wheat. 103; and winter wheat, 169. The only cases in which (w failed to produce the higher yields were for oats in 1916 1920, spring wheat in 1915, barley in 1919, winter wheat 113 and 1920, and corn in 1920. In the 50 comparisons in - ng all crops the higher yields were on fallow 43 times on land cropped every year 7 times. In order to make »r the loss of the land under a system of fallow the acre yields secured should be double those from cropping the land continuously. For small grains this has occurred at Scotts - bluff 19 times in 40 comparisons. The most favorable result Kwith winter wheat, the yields of which on fallow were than double those on continuously cropped land in 7 out of 10 comparisons. The yields of oats, barley, and spring wheat on fallow were more than double those on continuously cropped land in 4 of 10 comparisons for each crop. In no case was the corn yield on fallow double that on land continuously cropped. </seg>

            <seg id="p018">18 Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 192 The benefits of fallowing varied widely in different seasons. In years of severe drought, such as 1916 and 1919, all yields were low. In the most favorable years, such as 1915 and tgood yields were secured by all methods. The most ble results from fallowing were those secured in 1912, 1917, 1918, and 1921. The results as a whole indicate that under similar condi - tions fallowing may be expected to increase the acre yields of all crops, and, while the benefits vary widely from year to year, that the total production of grain may frequently be increased by the practice. Corn has been unprofitable on fallow at the Scottsbluff Substation and at all other stations in the Great Plains where similar experiments have been con - ducted. FALLOW &lt;lltirtlir.il WITH CORN I nil FOR SMALL &lt;.HAI&gt;» The experiments furnish several direct comparisons of fallow and corn land as preparations for the 4 grain crops, spring wheat, winter wheat, oats, and barley. Rotations 118 and 119 are 4-year rotations of fallow, winter wheat, corn, and oats. In the former the crops follow in the order named. In the latter winter wheat and oats are inter - changed. The 2 rotations, therefore, furnish direct compari - sons of fallow and corn land as preparations for both winter wheat and oats. In the same way rotations 18 and 19 furnish comparisons for spring wheat and oats. Additional direct comparisons are furnished for oats by the 3-year rotations 8 and 4, the former being fallow, oats, and spring wheat, and the latter corn, oats, and spring wheat ; and for spring wheat by rotations 5 and 3, which are the same as rotations 8 and 4 except that the positions of spring wheat and oats are inter - changed. For barley an indirect comparison is secured by using the yield on fallow from 0 and D plats of the continuously cropped series and the yield on corn land from rotation 6, in which corn, barley, and oats are grown in a 3-year rotation. Of the 7 comparisons of fallow and corn land in their effect on the yields of small grain, 3 are with oats, 2 with spring wheat, and 1 each with winter wheat and barley. The annual and average yields of each crop on fallow and on corn land, the gains from the fallow, and the yields of corn </seg>
            <seg id="p019">Dry Farming Investigations 19 from the corresponding rotations are shown in Table 5. Out of the 40 annual comparisons the higher yields were on fallow 34 times, on corn land 5 times, and both methods failed for l&gt;arley in 1913. The average percentages of gain on fallow were 22 for oats, 43 for spring wheat, 44 for winter wheat, and 78 per cent for barley. The average ratios of bushels of grain gained by fallowing to the corn yields in the corresponding rotations were, for spring wheat 1 to 4.07, for winter wheat 1 to 3.26, for oats 1 to 3.70, and for barley 1 to 1.67. In other words, each bushel of spring wheat that was gained by growing the crop on summer-tilled ground cost 4.07 bushels of corn that it would have been possible to produce had the land been used for com. Similarly, each bushel of winter wheat cost 3.26 bushels of com, each bushel of oats 3.70 bushels of corn, and each bushel of barley 1.67 bushels of corn. It is thus apparent that, in these experiments, growing small grains on corn land has been in nearly all cases more profitable than growing these crops on fallow land. While the yields after corn were less than those after fallow, the value of the corn produced was greater than the value of the additional grain produced on the fallow land. I.UKK\ »l \M Hi: COMPARED WITH Hllti: FALLOW The effect of plowing under crops for green manure, as compared with bare fallowing, upon yields of succeeding crops was tested in twelve 4-year rotations. These rotations occu - pied 8 plats on the south end of each of 6 series as shown on the field sheet (Fig. 1). The 4 rotations 18, 19, 118, and 119 in the center contained 1 bare fallow plat each, while those in the groups at either end each contained a plat of either rye or peas plowed under for green manure. In rotations 14, 16, 19, 114, 116, and 119 the fallow or green manure was fol - lowed by oats, corn followed the oats, and they in turn were followed by spring wheat in the first 3 and winter wheat in the last 3 rotations. In the remaining rotations the crops are the same, but oats and spring wheat were interchanged in rotations 15, 17, and 18, and oats and winter wheat in 115, 117, and 118. The green-manure crop is rye in rotations 14, 15, 114, and 115, and peas in 16, 17, 116, and 117. Comparisons are thus possible between 2 plats of oats on fallow and 2 plats each </seg>

Annual and average yields are shown in Table 6. In the 60 comparisons of the yields of oats, spring wheat, and winter wheat after fallow with the yields of these crops after peas or rye for green manure, the higher yields were on fallow 52 times and on one or the other of the green manures only 8 times. The higher averages were in all cases on the fallow land. The corn yields the second year after fallow or green manure in these rotations were very nearly equal in the 3 groups of plats. The average yield of corn in the 4 rotations containing fallow was 21.3 bushels per acre, in the 4 rotations containing peas 22.0 bushels, and in the 4 rota - tions containing rye 21.3 bushels. The green manures, there - fore, produced no beneficial effects which earned over to the corn crops. In these experiments fallowing and green manuring both involved the loss of the land once in 4 years. After the green - manure crops were turned under, the plats were treated as fallow for the remainder of the season. They were essentially modified fallows involving the extra expense of seed and seed- The chief object of green manuring is to increase or main - tain fertility, and the object of fallowing is to accumulate and store moisture. In these experiments the influence of mois - ture apparently greatly outweighed any differences in fertility brought about by the use of green manures. The yields fol - lowing rye were somewhat greater than those following peas. This difference is also probably due more to differences in moisture than to differences in the amount or nature of the fertility supplied by the two crops. The average dates of plowing under the green manure crops were June 5 for rye and July 8 for peas. The 33 days additional time in the length of the fallow period after rye, coming at a time of high aver - age rainfall, gave these plats a considerable advantage in the accumulation of moisture. The greatest differences between the yields on fallow and those on green manure were secured in the early years of the experiments, indicating the possibility of an accumulating benefit from the green manures.

Considering the reductions in yields and the increased costs of green manuring as compared with fallowing there seems to l&gt;e no justification for its use m general dry-farm practice in this section.
