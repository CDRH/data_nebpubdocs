To The Constitution of The United States of America Signed September 17, 1787 Ratified June 21, 1788 This Thirty-Fifth Biennial Report of the State Department of Public tostrucoon covers the period of the observance of the 150th Anniversary of the Constitution of the United States. In designating this observance, Presi - dent Franklin Delano Roosevelt declared: "In commemorating this period we shall affirm our debt to those who ordained and established the Constitution in Order to form a more per - fect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Bless - ings of Liberty to ourselvs and our Posterity. "We shall recognize that the Constitution is an enduring instrument fit for the governing of a far-flung population of more than one hundred and thirty million, engaged in diverse and varied pursuits, even as it was ht for the governing of a small agrarian nation of less than four million. It is therefore appropriate that in the period herein set apart we shall think afresh of the founding of our Government under the Constitution how it has served us in the past and how in the days to come its principles will guide the nation ever forward." Accordingly, on behalf of the schools of Nebraska, Charles W. Taylor and the members of his staff reverently dedicate this Thirty-Fifth Biennial Re - port of the State Department of Public Instruction to the Constitution of the United btates and all the laws of the state and nation subject to its provisions. </seg>

            <seg id="p009">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION GENERAL STATEMENT Presentation • ,,i ienntaI ° f *«= State Department of Public Instruction are issued in compliance with Section 79-1607 of the School Law which reads: "He (the State Superintendent) shall annually on the first day of January submit to the governor of the state a full report of the oLa- 1 1 °1 , c UT T g P? yCar&gt; Which re P° rt sha11 contain * de - ment of the school funds of the state and an account of the receipts and expenditures for the purpose of schools, a statement of the condition of the common schools and other educational institutions chartered or fos - tered by the state embracing the number of schools of the several grades, the number and the average compensation of die teachers, the names and compensations of county superintendents, the number of pupils attend - ing the several schools, the enumeration of youth by counties, the value of scnoolhouses, sites, apparatus and furniture, a statement of such plans as he may devise for the best management of the school funds and the school system, and such other statements as he may deem expedient to communicate relating to his office and popular education." In keeping with this statutory requirement contributors have made a sincere effort to sketch conditions of educational service in Nebraska at this tone. Following the rule of the Department, the procedure looks first to the needs of the people and then to the program of education for the satisfaction of these needs. Persisting demands of administrative supervisory duties restrict presentation to hurried outline form. Nevertheless, it is hoped that officials, school authorities and citizens generally may find in the materials a textbook of their school system. Review of previous reports shows that many problems persist from bienmum to biennium. It is encouraging to note, however, in these same re - ports that records of solutions keep pace with the problems as they arise. Our public schools like our homes and our churches and all the rest of our insti - tutions are of humble origin. The equipment of today is the evidence of un - remitting effort from year to year for the improvement of educational op - portunity. It is the policy of the Department to enlist cooperation in the study and formulations of legal provisions for die control of die schools. In dealing with the affairs of youth we must all proceed upon the basis of a search for the truth as it will inevitably come to pass. On this basis we can move ahead, con - fident of a better civilization which is the goal of our public schools. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">; REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT I am happy to pay tribute to the splendid service and cooperation of the members of die staff and secretarial assistants in the Department. Each one has performed his tasks in die consciousness of influence upon thousands of learners throughout the state. | Again, I commend the teachers of Nebraska for their devotion to youth and die cause of citizenship. Ready response to increasing standards of trainina and die will to Carry On under adverse circumstances in the schools supply abundant evidence of die highest professional spirit. It is in order also to recognize the heroic element in die homes of Ne - braska. Boys and girls are seeking education diese days. They are flocking to school in larger numbers dian any previous generation can show. Parents make every ; sacrifice; to help mdr children to realize the vision of larger preparation for life. In this emphasis upon abiding values is the assurance of citizenship true | to die heritage of America. r .With sincere appreciation of the continued confidence of die people of Nebraska, I renew my pledge of faithfulness to the trust reposed iTme as State Superintendent of Public Instruction. Faithfully yours, CHARLES W. TAYLOR SERVICE OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN THE NEBRASKA SYSTEM OF EDUCATION The Constitution of Nebraska, in diese words, dearly places upon die state die responsibility for public education: ■ "The Legislature shall provide for the free instruction in the common schools of this state of all persons between the ages of five and twenty-one To carry out diis requirement, the Constitution designates the State Sup - erintendent of Public Instruction an executive officer of the State government and gives to the Legislature die audiority to establish a state department of education. (Section 1, Article IV). The Legislature has largely delegated the responsibihty for public education to die counties, municipalities, and school districts of the State and made die State Department of Education the specific agency for putting its enactments into effect. Provision is made by statute that the State Superintendent of Public Instruction shall decide disputed points in school law and that his decision shall be held to have die force of law until reversed by die courts. It follows naturally from this broad legal audiority diar die duties of die State Department of Public Instruction are as varied as die needs of die </seg>

In cooperation with the Unt ZZt^ft' T P^-^ High School 'it uaL Members of his staff supervise the high school normal training courses and inspect the work. He is a member of the State Normal Board3 isT cation. The Bureau of Certification for Teachers and the Bureau of Edu - cation and Registration for Nurses are divisions of this Department. All State apportionments for the public schools are made in the business office of the Department. These are merely examples of the official responsibilities in - eluded in the State administraton of public education. Extra-legal Responsibilities In addition to these many requirements fixed by law, the State Sup - ermtendent and the members of his staff make every effort to sense the diffr culdes « the operation of the schools. With the counsel of the forces in the field and interested citizens of the State generally, adjustments are planned to meet the changing conditions of the times. Herein effort must always be directed to the future needs of citizenship in the service and development of the State. It ts always necessary to keep in mind the fact that work in the schools must find application in the world of tomorrow. Viewed Jin this larger l^ght, public education is, in fact, the chief business of the State and all its aozens-Certainly, the interests of the schools must be as far-reaching as the vision of our National mission. Cooperating Auxiliary Agencies In carrying out the commitments of his office the State Superintendent is happy to recognize the splendid cooperation of other officials of government and .many auxiliary and patriotic organizations. The citizens of Nebraska in - terested in the cause of education owe gratitude for the unfailing help ac - wded to all of the educational agencies by such organizations as die Ne - braska State Teachers J^ssodation, Parent-Teacher Associations, die Fed - eration of Women's dubs, the American Legion and the American Legion Auxliary the Federation of Labor, the Grange, the Farmer's Union, the various church organizations, and other similar groups. Especially do we acknowledge the splendid service of more than 25,000 citizens who accept trusteeship in the school districts of the State. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF EDUCATION THROUGH THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION The cost of operation in the State Department of Education appears in Table No. I, entitled "Seven Bienniums of State Appropriations for All Governmental Agencies." This Table appears on page 12. It will be noted that the total allowance for maintenance and salaries for the biennium of 1937 - 1939 was #78,160.00. The main appropriation is for the school program in. the field. Chart No. I gives a graphic presentation of the trends of these ap - propriations for education as compared to appropriations of all other state agencies. The letter accompanying the official budget requests for the Biennuim 1939-1941 follows: November 22, 1938 "Hon. W. H. Smith State Tax Commissioner State Capitol Building Lincoln, Nebraska My dear Mr. Smith: I am submitting herewith the budget requests for the State Department of Public Instruction for the biennium 1939-1941. With exception of the allowances for personnel, the requests are based strictly upon requirements of die law. Practically all increases find their ex - planation in adherence to diis procedure. It is necessary, for example, to in - crease the request for High School Normal Training by #85,000.00 to meet the guarantees of law on this subject. Similar conditions hold for the statutory provisions covering tuition of children of parents on duty with the military forces of die United States and other appropriations for aid to schools. If die amounts fixed in the statutes cannot be met, the statutes should be amended rather than to violate the terms set forth in them. We must remember that the very first obligation of school adminis - tration is the example of integrity and respect for law. Unless all of us are willing to accept this standard for the conduct of official service, it would be better to omit academic lessons of citizenship in the classrooms of the state for young people judge elders by their actions, not by dieir precepts, and these impressions from, life determine die character of the men and women of to - morrow. Let me assure you that I appreciate deeply the financial difficulties of the times confronting taxpayers of Nebraska.

It is not teaching the youth the shapes of letters and tricks of numbers and then leaving them to turn their arithmetic to roguery and their literature to lust. It is, on the contrary, training them into the perfect exercise and kindly continence of their bodies and souls. It is a painful, continual and difficult work, to be done by kindness, by watching, by warning, by precept, and by praise, but above all, by example." — Bishop Huntington. </seg>

Relief to School Districts The first appropriation for the relief of school districts was #30,000.00. It wast made in 1935 to match federal appropriations of a like amount. Since diere was no possibility of further support from the federal govern - ment for the biennium 1937-1939, the request was fixed at #50,000.00 but die amount appropriated by die Legislature for die biennium was left at #30,000.00. A list of the districts receiving help in 1937 appears in Table IV. The amount for each district ranges from #110.29 to #441.18. The levy in die schools receiving money from diis source ranged from 8 to 34 mills. At die close of die fiscal year, June 30, 1938, the warrant indebtedness of the 482 school districts having a levy of 8 mills or more was #1,034,987.75.

            <seg id="p029">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION High School Normal Training Program The normal training program was launched in Nebraska high schools thirty-two years ago. It has functioned continually since that time, furnishing a large majority of the teachers in the rural schools of the State. Recent studies show that more than two-thirds of the teachers now teaching in our rural schools are normal training graduates. These people are continually improving themselves by taking advantage of the summer sessions in our state teacher training institutions, the University, and denominational colleges. More than tour-fifths of the teachers in the rural schools today have preparation beyond the high school. This preparation runs all the way from six weeks to four years. Many who began with high school normal training now hold degrees and occupy prominent places in the schools of the State. The normal training program definitely centers its whole program around the rural school. Every subject is taught with the idea of preparing young folks for teaching in the one-room rural schools in our State with a knowledge of the conditions as diey actually exist. Much attention is given to the plan - ning ot schedules, teaching practices, and the development of an understand - ing of the life in rural communities. It must be clearly understood that the purpose of the high school normal training program from the first has been to supply trained teachers for the rural schools. Eighty thousand four hundred nine pupils are enrolled in these rural schools. The Department stands squarely for the best possible op - portunity for the country boys and girls and the homes from which they come. Prosperity on farms means prosperity throughout die State. For this reason, educational opportunity in the rural communities must be on a par with die best in urban communities. In this connection it must be remembered that if rural teachers are to meet die needs of rural communities today they cannot restrict dieir service to instruction in the schoolhouses of the district. Parents have a right to ex - pect of them co-operation in the welfare and progress of the community in its entirety. In short, the rural teacher must be more than an employee of the district; the rural teacher must be a friend to the children and a neighbor to the parents of the community. These priceless relationships build good will essential to a good school and a good place to live for everybody in die community. On this basis no teachers have larger opportunity for service than the rural teachers of Nebraska. This opportunity is worthy of die best and truest in the ranks of die profession. As in all teaching positions the call is for people who, in addition to teaching subjects, inspire love of learning and worthy character. The State Department fully recognizes these requirements of the rural schools, and is willing to change the provisions of the high school normal training program when teachers colleges and other higher institutions can in - sure an adequate number of specially trained teachers for die rural schools. It </seg>
            <seg id="p030">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT ""\/ must be borne in mind also that rural teachers, in common with other teach - ers, are entitled to salaries commensurate to their preparation for service. When better prepared teachers are available and conditions warrant in the State, the Department will continue to welcome a graduated advance in certification standards for all teachers in the public schools. Section 79-1103 of the School Law, providing for Normal Training reads: "The sum of one thousand ($1,000.00) dollars for the biennium shall be paid from the appropriation made for that purpose to each school district in which a class of not less than ten is organized and in - structed in accordance with die provisions of this act; Provided, that funds derived from this appropriation shall be devoted exclusively to die payment of die salary of a special instructor or supervisor of Normal Training subjects who has the qualifications prescribed by the state su - perintendent of public instruction." At present, 179 public high schools offer normal training under this guarantee. Of this number, 148 actually qualified for apportionment in 1937-38. A list of the high schools receiving normal training aid in 1937-38 appears in Table V. In view of the number offering the work, ar - rangements should be provided for a maximum of 12 additional schools making a total of 160 schools. The amount necessary to cover this guaran - tee is #160,000.00. Section 79-1106 further provides that die "expenses of inspection and supervision shall be paid out of appropriations for this purpose." This requirement approximates an additional $25,000.00. The allowance available during 1937-38 for each school under die ap - propriation of the current biennium was £(253.1?, instead of the $500.00 spec - ified in the law. The request for normal training is $185,000.00.

The outline of previous experience in the state l TS? 1 '"l^, chapter headin g s of NEBRASKA, OLD AND NEW by Addison i E ; Sheldon. Episodes include: "Hard Winter of 1857," "Prairie F*e of 1871," ''Hard Times of the 9O's.» Mingled with these accounts of adversity are others that record the triumph over difficulties: "Land For Free People," Law and Order," "The Coming of the Railroad," "The First Arbor Day," "Good Times Again," "The New Capitol." Likewise the historian of this period will tell of a cycle of drouth, of the return of grasshoppers, and persistent economic depression. This same nutonan will also tell of the conservation of water resources, the control of pests, better highways, and continued effort to build "the house of State where men live well." In 1938, as in every other period, the chief concern is a broad con - structive program for citizenship and community welfare. Schools of the past won literacy for the citizenship of the State. In 1930 only 1.2 per cent of the people of Nebraska over ten years were unable to read and write. Schools of the present accept the larger challenge to help young people meet the varied problems of an increasingly complex civilization. To be effective in the future, the educational program must relate directly to individual and community needs. Farm tenacy, for example, is a growing problem in many rural communities of Nebraska. Thousands re - ceiving Old-Age Assistance require an increasing proportion of state revenue. Population in the institutions under the State Board of Control is a matter of vital concern to every citizen. Schools cannot make immediate correc - tions in these conditions inherited from the past, nevertheless, consciousness of them is an obligation to die future. Schools in America are not charitable institutions supported by taxpayers for pupils and teachers; they are power stations for economic and social progress In die presentation of the financial report of the schools, it is not the intent to place expenditures for any odier public service in unfavorable con - trast to expenditures for the schools. For example, the people of Nebraska are well aware of the fact diat the chief item of increase in the state budget is Old-Age Assistance. In diis same connection, however, investigations show clearly that relief rolls are recruited from the ranks of citizens with meager preparation for life. </seg>
            <seg id="p033">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION The Federal Unemployment Census in November, 1937, reported these conditions in Nebraska. 44,872 Totally unemployed. 29,526. Patrially unemployed. 25,850 Retained in Federal Emergency Programs. The large majority of these 100,000 workers had eighth grade education or less. Under these circumstances, it is time to face frankly and courage - ously the financial requirements of schools in relation to the financial re - quirements of all other activities of government. Recriminations are out of order in the presence of human need. The solution to the problem of per - sonal independence and economic recovery may be found in larger investment in schools rather than in bigger appropriations for relief! The mission of the schools is to help youth prepare for citizenship and to inculcate loyalty to country. Upon this service depends the establishment of homes and the prosperity of the communities that make up the Commonwealth. To realize these values, it is necessary to appraise school costs along with all other governmental costs and cooperate with citizens and officials for die common welfare. Observance of one hundred-fifty years under the Consti - tution of the United States impresses this obligation to the young people who will Carry On where die present generation leaves off.

            <seg id="p034">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Summary of School Statistics Since 1869 the County Superintendents in the State of Nebraska have filed reports of individual school districts with the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. The reports appear in varying forms up to 1926, at which time the Department of Public Instruction adopted standard account - ing forms. It may be of interest to know that the Nebraska system of school financial accounting is one of the few approved by the United States Commissioner of Education. Nebraska has been a leader in school statis - tics. By the first Monday in July, of each year, District officials submit dis - trict reports to County Superintendents. In turn, the various County Sup - erintendents send the compilation of their district reports to the State Super - intendent by August 15. From these County reports, the State Superinten - dent tabulates the Statistical Summaries for the entire public school system of the State. In many respects these data provide more satisfactory interpretation of school conditions than can be presented in any other form. Here, for ex - ample, are the figures of enrollment, the number of teachers in the various di - visions of the system, the value of equipment, the total receipts, and the total expenditures; besides other items telling the effort of the people of Ne - braska for the education of their children. Since these reports have die same form each year, a comparison of items reveals die trend of various phases of die program over any given period of years. Trends in education throughout die State are very helpful to admin - istrators, officials and citizens generally. It makes litde difference about the location of the school of the service performed.

In this light even the statistics are thrilling.

            <seg id="p042">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Program of School Finance The position of the State Department of Public Instruction on school revenue is expressed in the following statement contained in the Thirty-Fourth Biennial Report: "In so far as taxation for public education is concerned the State De - partment of Public Instruction does not presume to be an authority on forms or sources of public revenue. Because of the complexity and magnitude of the problems involved in the establishment of a fair and adequate system of revenue, the State Department of Public in - struction hereby joins with many citizens and organizations in recom - mending to the Legislature that provisions be made for a special com - 'mission to make a scientific study of the entire structure of assessment and taxation for all governmental purposes." ■ In response to public demand, the First Unicameral Legislature estab - lished the Nebraska Legislative Council for the investigation of governmental problems. This body is authorized "to study and inquire into the financial administration of die state government and the subdivisions thereof, the problems of taxation including assessment and collection of taxes and the distribution of the tax burden." Reports of the Director of Research, Dr. Roger V. Shumate, provide the factual, data and interpretations essential to a sound program of finance for all divisions of government These problems await solution: 1. Determination of the claims of the public schools to "license moneys arising under the general laws of the State," as provided in the Constitution. (Sec. 5, Art. VII.) 2. Provision for sound business administration of funds and resources derived from the federal land grants to the State. (Special Report, pace } \ 3. Thorough consideration of the tax basis for the support of public education. 4. Provision for scientific' equalization of educational opportunities and burdens. The following statement from Report No. 2 of the Nebraska Legislative Council confirms the findings of school authorities on the relation of school support to other requirements of government: "Perhaps the most striking fact illustrated by the tables on govern - mental costs is that the local units have not followed the same trend as the National and State Governments. While the two first-named </seg>
            <seg id="p043">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION units show an almost phenomenal increase, the counties and cities have practically stood still, and the school districts show a sharp decline. This decline seems to have reached its low point in 1934, at which time another increase was begun, but as yet school expenditures since 1934 have not climbed to, or even approached, the pre-depression level. The school district is the one principal unit of govern - ment which shows a considerable net reduction in costs for the whole period under consideration. "The reasons for the differences between the trends in costs of gov - ernment at the different levels are fairly obvious. In the first place, with the advent of the depression all levels of government tried, tem - porarily to reduce costs, by reducing salaries and curtailing activities. These efforts, however, were almost immediately overwhelmed by die impact of the depression itself, with its demands for increased assist - ance and welfare work, the brunt of which has been borne almost en - tirely by the National and State Governments. The counties and cities, however, have had some increased obligations in assistance work, which have just about offset their initial economies. The school districts, on the other hand, have not had to absorb any of the in - i creases in assistance and welfare costs, hence all funds saved through reductions in salaries, number of teachers, and building programs, show as a net gain. "x x x x x x x Revenue receipts for all units of government during the fiscal year, 1937, were: Federal __ £ 14,151,895.00 State 18,160,167.00 County 18,044,516.00 School Districts 16,413,930.00 ( ' City and Village 10,050,840.00 (2) Drainage Districts 184,000.00 Irrigation Districts 256,332.00 Total $ 77,261,680.00 The State Department welcomes scientific investigation of school sup - port and pledges cooperation in the effort to find the truth as it must inevit - ably come to pass. In Nebraska loyalty to die public schools is accepted as loyalty to children. In die presence of obligations to posterity and country our people will carry on in die future as they have in the past. The im - mediate task is to develop plans for a program of citizenship worthy of our State and Nation. </seg>

            <seg id="p045">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Property Tax Basis for School Support Approximately ninety cents out of every dollar for the support of the public school program in Nebraska is derived from local property taxes. Un - der these conditions, it is imperative that school authorities and citizens gen - erally give continuous study to district valuations, levies, and tax delinquencies. Property valuations are under control of the State Board of Equalization and assessment. This Board includes in its membership: the Governor Sec - retary of State, State Auditor, State Treasurer, and the State Tax Commis - sioner. Section 1, Article VIII of the Constitution of Nebraska provides: "The necessary revenue of the state and its governmental subdiv - isions shall be raised by taxation in such manner as the Legislature may direct; but taxes shall be levied by valuation uniformly and proportionately upon all tangible property and franchises, and taxes uniform as to class may be levied by valuation upon all other property. Taxes other than property taxes, may be authorized by law. Existing revenue laws shall continue in effect until changed by the Legislature." The trend of valuation in the State during the ten-year period, 1928-1938 appears in the following tabulation: 1928 —0,125,856.462.00 1929 3,167,489,300.00 1930 3,102,050,571.00 1931 3,045,793,706.00 1932 -2,521,000,981.00 1933 2,073,283,250.00 1934 2,059,678,928.00 1935 2,030,243,533.00 1936 2,060,835,168.00 1937 2,058,224,967.00 1938 2,033,302,482.00 A study of levies in rural school districts and high school districts is presented in Table No. VII. It will be noted that average levy of the former for general school purposes is 6.34 mills, while the comparable figure for the latter is 10.68 mills. The condition of tax delinquencies appears in an official statement of the Tax Commissioner on December 3, 1938, which reads: "The total taxes levied for the state general fund in 1930 was £6,798,545.58; on June 30, 1932, there was delinquent from that total, the sum of £285,839.07, or 4.2% of the amount levied. "In 1936, there was levied for the state general fund £3,729,469.78, and on June 30, 1938, there was delinquent £435,283.57, or 11.67%. of the total amount levied. "From the foregoing it is evident that there is an increase in tax delinquencies in 1938 over the delinquencies in 1932, or 7.47%. </seg>
            <seg id="p046">46 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT While the figures used above apply only to state taxes, it is reason - able to assume that substantially the same situation prevails insofar as all other property taxes are concerned." The intimate story of tax delinquency is recorded in the official tax sale notices published in the home newspapers of the state.

The guarantee against loss appears in Section 9, Article VII of the Constitution of Ne - braska and reads: "AU funds belonging to die state for educational purposes, the interest and income whereof only are to be used, shall be deemed trust funds held by the state, and the state shall supply all losses thereof, that may in any manner accrue, so that the same shall remain forever inviolate and undiminished; and shall not be invested or loaned except on United States or State securities; or registered county bonds of this state, or registered school district bonds of this state; and such other securities as the Legislature may from time to time direct. And such funds with the interest and income thereof, are hereby solemnly pledged for the pur - poses for which diey are granted and set apart, and shall not be trans - ferred to any other fund for other uses."

            <seg id="p049">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION The Endowment Magnificent is a heritage worthy of the most careful conservation in the power of the state. Every dollar of endowment earnings takes -the place of a taxpayer's dollar, so long as the endowments are kept intact. Even more important than the money values in these endowments is the example of integrity in trust administration before the young people who are the legal beneficiaries. For several years officials and citizens of Nebraska have sensed the need for die revision of the administration of public school and institutional trusts derived from the federal land grants to the state. At the general election in November, 1936, voters approved an amendment to the Consti - tution abolishing the office of Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings. This count showed 246,682 For thb Amendment and 210,443 Against it. The outline of developments in the program of improvement since the abolishment of die office of Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings at the general election in 1936 follow: a. Statutory provision for die transfer of the powers and duties of the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings to die State Board of Public Lands and Funds. L. B. No. 383 b. Authorization of the Board of Public Lands and Funds to employ a secretary on die basis of special qualifications for service to serve as die executive officer of the Board at a salary of #3,000 per year. L. B. No. 483. c. Submission of a Constitutional Amendment at die general election in 1936, making die State Superintendent a member of die Board of Public Lands and Funds. L. B. No. 60. Unfortunately, die Amendment making die State Superintendent a member of die Board of Public Lands was included in die provisions of the Short Ballot Amendment. The vote on diis proposal was 145,345 For and 168,035 Against. Consequendy, after January 3, 1939, when die term o* office of die present Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings expires, die Board of Public Lands and Funds will be made up of die Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, and the State Treasurer. In order that the proposal might be considered on its own merits, a separate amendment to the Constitution, making the State Superin - shonld be submitted to the next general election in November, 1940. tendent a member of the State Board of Public Lands and Funds </seg>

Judge Vauck was one of the pupils attending the school at the time, it being known as Fairview School. The enrollment then numbered 55 pupils. '(While Fairview School had an enrollment of 55 pupils in 1888, Judge Vauck states that the school was closed this year for lack of pupils. The few that remain are transported to other schools, this being more economical than to maintain the school. Fifty years ago 70 _ Per cent of the patrons in the district owned their own farms, while today less than 30 per cent are owned by residents. In 1888 there were 26 families in the district, as compared to 20 now. In the early years the families were for the most part headed by young people, many of them homesteaders of some few years before. The average age of the children attending school was eleven years, and the future was ahead of both the parents and the children. Today older people live there, their children grown and scattered." Seward Independent, December 8, 1938. The official organ of the United States Office of Education for March. 1938, gives this parallel report for the nation: </seg>
            <seg id="p051">I OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION "In the 20 years from 1916 to 1936 the total number of one-teach - er schools has been reduced from 200,094 to 132,831. This is a re - duction of almost exactly one in three. "In 1916 the one-teacher schools constituted 71.1 percent of all die schools in the United States; in 1936 they were only 56.7 percent of the total. Considering the problem in terms of all of the teach - ers employed in the public schools of the Nation the data show that 20 years ago nearly a third of them were in one-teacher schools; at present only about one in seven is employed in such schools. "However, there are still more than 130,000 of these schools in ex - istence; they still constitute 56.7 percent of the total number of schools of the Nation, and 62.8 percent of all of those located in the rural communities. They still enroll 3 million American boys and girls. It must, therefore, be said with emphasis that this school still forms a very important segment of our public-school system and that it should be treated as such." Improvements in School Buildings Daring 1937-1939 The Biennium of 1937-1939 has shown marked improvement over the preceding biennium with respect to the housing program for the schools. Through the financial assistance of the government, districts have been able to construct new buildings and modernize old ones. These plants are adapted to the needs of the community as well as to die needs of the children in the schools. In addition to assistance in the construction of new buildings and repair of old buildings, a great deal of help has been given to the schools of Ne - braska in such improvements as grading and laying out athletic fields, painting and redecorating of buildings, landscaping of grounds, etc. These improve - ments bring cheer to surroundings and inspire pupils to more effective edu - cational effort, consequently the improvement in housing results in definite improvement in the entire instructional program.

            <seg id="p056">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Educational Standing of Nebraska Among the States of the Union Many requests are received in the course of the biennium for the edu - cational rank of Nebraska among the States of the Union. This informa - tion; on comparative expenditure per pupil and average salary of teachers ap - pears in darts III and IV respectively, taken from Bulletin No. 2, 1937, of the United States Office of Education and entitled, "Statistics of State School Administration, 1935-1936." Copies of this Bulletin are available at die United States Printing Office upon request. Address of J. Edgar Hoover, Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation, United States Department of Justice, delivered at The National Commanders Banquet, Twentieth Annual National Convention of The American Legion, Los Angeles, California, on September 19, 1938. "In the days succeeding the Great War, somediing happened to the coun - try's morale, to its fundamental spirit. There was a weakening of moral principles, and unprecedented numbers and kinds of predatory crimes were committed. Crimes of violence became so commonplace as to cause little, if any, resentment on the part of our citizens. The public was apathetic. Not only in our larger cities, but in our rural sections, corruption pursued an almost unmollested course. Civic consciousness waned, and in some places became extinct. ****** « **The crime bill for this country is approximately fifteen billion dollars annually, or about $120 for every man, woman and child. Does this not mean that law enforcement is battling an enterprise of greater economic significance than any odier in the country? Our homes and our lives are threatened by an army of lawlessness numbering over 4,600,000 individuals. ****** Every 22 seconds, a serious crime is committed in this supposedly civilized land. Every time we see a sunset, we must correlate this with die fac: diat between die time the sun rises upon our daily life and the time it set! in the evening, 37 persons, men and women, will have been murdered. There is a death by criminal violence in the United States every 39 minutes. During the past year nearly 1,500,000 major crimes were committed, such as murder, manslaughter, rape, robbery, burglary and aggravated assault. It . is most disturbing to realize that a serious crime eventually will be perpetrated against. ' three . out of every four homes in the United States unless drastic measures are taken to stay the onslaught of our domestic enemy." </seg>

Even public officials frequently use the terms as if they were synonymous. This con - fusiot. is unfortunate for an adequate understanding of the tax proplem. As an illustration of diis point, the National Government, with its vast rev - enues and expenditures, does not receive a single dollar from property taxes, and t le Statej of Nebraska, at present, derives less than 20% of its total rev - enue from that source. It is not meant to suggest that the property tax is an unimportant item, as it remains a source of considerable revenue to die State and the principal source for most of the units of local government. It recounts for a considerable, though not die major portion of dii : whole cost of government. It will be seen, dien, that an understanding of the tax problem involves an appreciation 'of the many kinds of taxes levied, and the rdarive importance of each land, as well as of the non-tax sources of governmental revenue."

            <seg id="p061">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION CRUCIAL ISSUES IN EDUCATION : : ■ -; by i •;■•■; .;■:.. John W. Studebaker Commissioner of Education of the United States . . , FIRST : £J Cmd f bsUe » «*»*» grows out of a major conflict which is swiftly reaching the stage of a crisis throughout the world. The conflict is between two principles of social organization. One principle is ancient and we thought discredited. The other is modern, but it faces new tests. In a word, the conflict is between dictatorship and democracy, between tyranny and tolerance. No important institution can ignore this issue. The question which confronts us is: "What more can education do to undergird American democracy?" Or to put up the question another way: "What are the implications of the issue so far as educational policies and processes are concerned?" SECOND. Crucial issue in education arises out of another major conflict of worldwide proportions. This conflict is between two principles of economic opportunity. One principle asserts that "man shall live by the sweat of his brow." The other principle, if general practice may be sum - marized, is that a large percentage of men shall not be permitted to live by their work but shall be forced to accept a meager charity. In a word, the conflict is between equality of opportunity and a state of widespread unem - ployment. Again, no important institution can escape the responsibaity of dealing with this issue. The question which confronts us is: "What more can education do to assure educational, recreational, and work opportunities to youth as our special responsibility?" This issue, the outcome of which vitally concerns our national welfare and our whole system of education, involves the adjustment of American youth to modern conditions. We are still confronted with the baffling problem of the gap between the school and the job. Whether the number of idle youth seeking jobs is 5,000,000, 3,000,000 or 7,000,000, the issue is a desperately serious one. That this issue would pass with the lifting of the depression is. found to be a vain hope by the daily events with which you are all familiar. Large numbers of high-school graduates, let alone high-school drop-outs, cannot find jobs. More than 2,000,000 young people reaching the age of employability each year encounter the regiment of newly invented ma - chines which have thrown jobs into the discard. </seg>
            <seg id="p062">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT You know the picture. I do not have to paint it for you. The Feder - al Government has come forward in the emergency with die CCC and die NYA. The services of diese agencies are generally recognized as among die most useful of die emergency contributions. The Office of Education has been happy to have a part in their development. Their services, however, fall in an area not limited to die emergency. Services now being performed by diese agencies must be continued for many years, possibly indefinitely. As we progress from diis emergency period into die next phase of our national life, it is essential diat we lay definite plans for long-term developments and permanent services. This period of depres - sion and readjustment has certainly briught us face to face with a variety of new circumstances — a more compactly organized society and a more intri - cate economy. What is organized education's obligation to youdi in diis new situation? As I have said, I shall deal with diis issue in detail ad some later date. Let me close reference to it at diis time by saying diat your Federal Office of Education, through its committee on Youdi Problems, has been active in this field during the past 2 years. We have made some extensive surveys which are reported in six special publications now avail - able. We are creating a new Youdi Guidance Division to provide advisory assistance to educational organizations desiring to establish Youdi Guidance Centers. We are convinced diat young people; in whose future parents, teachers, and society have invested so much, must not be abandoned at die point of separation from formal schooling. Our job is not finished until diese young people have been guided into permanentj places of service in the life and world of the community. Therefore, we in the filed of education insist upon better coordination, than now exists, of die various agencies serving the needs of youdi. Guidance, which is die fundamental aspect of all .systematic educa - tion,! and is, dierefore, a primary responsibility of schools, must not be terminated until die individual young person makes a successful connection with his life work. And even after that,! there are many times in the lives of m Ilions of adults when die guidance function of organized education must come to their service again. FHIRD.

EIGHTH. As much as we may emphasize vocational preparerness and econimic well-being in the acheivement of the more abundant life, we know that "man does not live by bread alone." What further provisions should we make for the lifting of the cultural level of America? The material poverty of great masses of our people is only exceeded by the spiritual starvation they suffer for die lack of good music, fine art, beauty, color, and inspiration.

The demand for policies under which American citizens in general may be given reasonably equal educational opportunities. "In the last analysis the trends in child care and in the child population express the social values of the nation. In the longer perspective of history what we are doing to and for our children may prove the most significant of all social trends because the child is the bridge— biologically and so - cially — to the future.— Lawrence K. Frank from a Chapter on "Childhood and Youth," appearing in Volume II of Recent Social Trends, published by McGraw-Hill Company, 1933. "Education rests upon the will of the people. Popular attitude is de - termined by confidence and understanding. Education must therefore co-op - erate with the social group in a continual process of developing group under - standing, appreciation of need and .aggressive support! Education itself must co-operate. It must not be aloof, a stranger to the community. It has a two-fold responsibility in educating the community and in understanding and interpreting the community." — Frank Cody. </seg>
            <seg id="p064">[ REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT SAFETY PROGRAM In March, 1936 the State Department of Public Instruction joined forces with the Nebraska Press Association in a campaign to reduce the losses caused by accidents throughout Nebraska. Each week a trained worker reads the accounts of accidents in 250 news - papers supplied by the Association and compiles a report for the members. Since July, 1938 the Nebraska Safety Council has given financial support and worked directly with the Department and the Press Association. Since its establishment in November, 1937 the Nebraska Safety Patrol has contin - ued to render every possible assistance in the phase of the program dealing with accidents on the highways. Because of the varied form and frequent recurrence of "accidents in all activities, every effort is made to enlist individuals and organizations in a common campaign for the welfare of all of the citizens in the state. LOSSES ARE HEAVY The seriousness of the problem appears in the following statistical sum - mary of the first year of the enterprise which began March 1, 1936 and ended February 27, 1937. :nL Accidents Injured Disabled Deaths Total Motor Vehicle accidents 5107 5761 84 336 6181 Other Public accidents 7931 3133 36 226 3395 Agriculture 2995J 1607 25 66 1698 Industry ______ 952 798 25 49 872 Home 1945 1243 4 m 1358 TOTAL 18930 12542 174 788 13504 The corresponding data for the year beginning March 6, 1937 and end - ing February 26, 1938 appears below: No|.

            <seg id="p065">I OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION INCIDENTS REVEAL CLASSES OF ACCIDENTS In order to understand the conditions bade of the compilations it is necessary to present some details included in I the several Categories — Motor Vehicle, Other Public, Agriculture, Industry, and Home. A sample of a highway accident included in the Motor Vehicle Category: "SMALL BOY IS KILLED WHEN STRUCK Iby CAR Columbus, Nebr., Nov. 19 (AP) — Platte county authorities I indicated no inquest will be held into the death of five-year-old Thomas — , killed by an automobile when he attempted to run across a high - way to join his mother. ' Thomas was struck by a car dri - ven by , Humphrey farmer, who stopped when he saw the boy approaching, then started up again when it appeared the boy intended to wait for him to pass. Thomas' Mother, Mrs. , was sitting in another automobile waiting for the child. They had gone to the farm of a relative to obtain water." — Lincoln Star. The above is also a sample of children's accidents of which this orrice keeps a continuous weekly record. An example of an Other Public accident story: , "Mrs. was painfully injured Monday afternoon near the postoffice when her ankle turned and she fell on the sidewalk. Her glasses were broken and she suffered severe cuts and bruises on her head, nose, hands, and knees." — Orchard News. In the Agriculture Category such stories appear: " Mr - — was brought to town Monday with a fractured leg near the knee as the result of getting mixed up in a runaway of a team </seg>
            <seg id="p066">i REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT of horses. His limb was placed in a cast and he was allowed to return home the same evening." — Benkelman Post. The story of a disability in an Industrial accident is as follows : " IN HOSPITAL Robert , son of Mr. and Mrs. , is a patient at the Lolouch Hospital following two amputations Tuesday morning. The thumb on the right hand and about one-half of the index finger on the left hand were amputated. Mr. 's hands were seri - ously burned by electricity Dec. 29, 1937, while he was working as an employee of the department of utili - ties on the construction of a trans - mission line northwest of Schuyler. The accident resulted in the loss of about half of the index finger, the little finger and the tip of the thumb on the left hand and the thumb on the right hand." ; — Schuyler Sun. The following is typical of Home accidents: " Anna , who is a teacher in the Beatrice School, came home and was helping with the washing when her hand was caught in the wringer and quite badly injured." — Daykin iHerald. Each of these articles has a poignant story to tell. These stories do not mean much to the stranger until he sees in them the threat of danger to j himself. Property loss, suffering of men. women, and children, need - less loss of life, and disaster to family circles make up the consequences of many preventable accidents. PROGRAM HAS PRACTICAL APPLICATION In addition to the direct influence of die weekly accident summary in the newspapers of the state, this information is available to educational and civic authorities for investigation. Many have availed themselves of rfiese </seg>
            <seg id="p067">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION sources. Schools throughout Nebraska and in many other states are writing in for copies of past news releases for use in their classes. Through this activity, safety can be brought "home" to each citizen. The State Department of Public Instruction has a definite goal in mind for the instructional service in this field. A tie-up between the press and the schools in each community will result in a common cause of safety with the newspapers as the texts of the safety program. The newspapers carry the accidents as they occur. A great majority of them publish the accident report in whole or in part showing from week to week the trend in accidents. At various times during the year die newspapers carry articles released through die National Safety Council, they print editorials on particularly bad situations, and publish helpful articles on safety. As a public servant, die newspapers do a great work for die citizens of Nebraska in the cause of safety. Another activity in connection with safety is die tie-up with the Nebraska Safety Patrol, an organization under the Motor Vehicle Division of die Department of Roads and Irrigation. These men are doing a great service on the highways of Nebraska. Each week the accident report is sent to these men giving them an opportunity to check up on the accidents occurring in their localities. Suggestions for diem are incorporated into die accident report from time to time as well as reports of dieir work. Last, but not least, and in die eyes of this Department the most im - portant, is die job of bringing safety "home" to die 300,000 school children of this state. This is something that must be done outside of the local newspapers. The weekly accident report furnishes valuable data to be used for die children and a compilation has been kept for nearly a year of die number of children's accidents, injuries, disabilities, and deaths. The Nebraska Educational Bulletin sent out monthly during 1937 carried a monthly article of special interest to die teachers and childen on die subject of safety. The practice will be followed this year. This Department also obtained a large supply of Motor Vehicle Driving Rules booklets and these are sent to teachers upon request. Every opportunity is utilized to encourage safety study in the schools of Nebraska. NEWSPAPERS SOUND KEYNOTE OF SUCCESS An article in the Stuart Advocate under date of November 24, 1938 sounds die keynote of the project itself and the effect it has upon the citizens of die state. The article is as follows: " The 'Grim Reaper' is forever lurking on the highways and by- ■.".." ways of the nation, but many of us fail to realize this until events similar to those of the past week call the </seg>

            <seg id="p069">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION CONSERAVTION IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS By M.B. Jenkins, Director Forest Research University of Nebraska Recent drouths, accompanied by several years of crop failures, dust storms, floods and consequent financial disturbances and widespread unem - ployment has focused public attention on the importance of farm forestry, and the care of farm woodlands to the general conservation of our soils and other natural resources. Thinking men and women have become abrupdy aware that the depletion and liquidation of our natural resources must stop at once if die nation is to maintain its economic, social and cultural stability. That there is a basic interrelationship between the resources of the soil and the future well-being of every citizen of America is becoming more and more apparent. Today state governments are cooperating in unprecedented projects of soil conservation, shelterbelt planting and wildlife conservation. In Nebraska, schools recognize the need and, without compulsory legis - lation, are actively cooperating with established conservation agencies in gathering data and perfecting plans which will be used in a well integrated program of conservation instruction for our public school system. It is recognized that most of our rural schools have few or no plantings about them, giving small opportunity for die study of trees and woody plants, and at the same time leaving die school grounds barren, unnattractive and de - void of wildlife. The State Department of Public Instruction is working widi die Con - servation and Survey Division, die Agricultural Extension Forester and die United States Forest Service in perfecting plans for establishing rural school plantings around each school playground of from one or two acres of well selected hardy trees and shrubs. With such plantings, it will be much easier for rural school instructors to teach the identification of our native trees and shrubs, and dieir relationship to agriculture and wildlife. At the same time these plantings will serve to bring greater comfort to the children at hand, ef - fect economy in the heating of die school building and establish beautiful civic centers for rural life. It will require time, much investigation, and some personal sacrifices to bring these ideal plantings to die 6,000 Rural schools in Nebraska. Rural teachers, Parent Teachers Associations and rural school boards may help by insisting that these plantings be established. By taking active part in die observation or Arbor Day, and giving support to all constructive conserva - tion movements each community can contribute its sphere of influence in the accomplishmnt of die worthy goal of, "An adequate Planting for every Rural School in the State." By working together to realize such an ideal, Nebraska may again become worthy of the name "Tree Planter State." </seg>

Continued emphasis has been given to courses of study in physiology and hygiene with special reference to the effects of alcoholic drinks and nar - cotics upon the human system as required by Section 79-1409, Nebraska Statutes. Health education is a vital part of the Course of Study for Ele - mentary Schools of Nebraska. Units of this section of the course of study arej devoted to Temperance Instruction and to Nature and Effects of Nar - cotics. Section 79-1410, Nebraska Statutes, provides as follows: "No certificate shall be granted to any person to teach in the public schools of the State of Nebraska who has not completed a satisfactory course or passed a satisfactory examination in physiology and hygiene with special reference to the effects of alcoholic drinks and other stimu - lants and narcotics upon the human system." Some of the ablest instructors of the state were selected to prepare die Syllabus for Alcohol and Narcotic Education. The outline submitted by this committee presents the biological approach and is intended to enable the student to acquire the anatomical and physiological knowledge that is neces - sary for the scientific understanding of the subject by the teacher. Through scientific instruction the young people must be given the truth. </seg>

School Libraries Records in die State Department of Public Instruction in die two years of die Biennium show increased expenditures for rural, city, and village school libraries. In the year 1936-1937 rural schools spent #19.010.25 on their li - braries while city and village) schools spent $82,696.22 making a total of #101,706.47 in all., The figures for the year 1937-1938 show that rural schools gave out #20,985.27 for their libraries and city and village schools contributed #89,157.82 toward maintaining their libraries making a total of #110,143.09 spent during this period. The grand total of die two-year per - iod came to #211,840.56 spent for school libraries. According to die reports kept by Miss Chloe C. Baldridge, Director of Rural and Elementary Education, 3,215 rural schools enriched their libraries during die year 1937-1938 and 3,118 districts had pupils participating in home recreational reading. The Bulletin, Rural Education Moving For - ward, stressed die great need of a school library. One of the institutions contributing to the educational' life of die State is the Nebraska Public Library Commission, located in the State Capitol. Since 1901 die Library Commission has extended library service throughout the State, and has made books available to libraries, schools, and individuals. From December 1, 1936 to November 30, 1938 the Traveling Library Unit of the Commission, has loaned 78,498 volumes to rural, small town, and many high schools diat have found it necessary to borrow for dasswork. The Filing Department Seven years ago last May a centralized system of filing was established in die State of Public Instruction. This department has grown very rapidly. Its work is more complicated and its filing has increased tre - mendously. It is die pivot around which die other departments work. Today, it ranks along with the other departments in serving die needs of die children and schools in die state of Nebraska. The Filing Department is composed of die ' following divisons: I. A general alphabetic file in a 660 division index, legal size which includes: A.

Approved schools are filed by county and des - ignated by a salmon label! Correspondence having a direct bearing upon the report, which de - termines the approval or accreditment of a school, is attached to the report for that year. Miscellaneous correspondence filed in date order in front of the folder. ; Reports and correspondence on private, denominational and paro - chial schools are filed by county, alphabetically in one folder. C. General correspondence filed in miscellaneous folder. Legal correspondence filed by county in individual folders and des - ignated by white label. D.

A charge-out system was established when the centralized system was put into effect, thus fixing responsibility for papers loaned by the filing de - partment. Transfer is made yearly after January 1st, as of July 1st, when the de - partment is not quite so busy. These files are put in a transfer room in which, there are about ten times as many files as there are in the main filing room. Many of these records are of historical nature, dating back as far as 1871. The past year, 1937-38, shows the largest filing record of any year and is an increase of 19,253 pieces over the previous year, or a 21.3% increase over the year 1936-37. The filing department keeps close check on all letters and reports called for and all letters written and filed, by keeping daily, week - ly and yearly reports. These reports show the amount of mail handled through each of the several departments. During the months of June, July and August there was about 60% in - crease in mail, due mostly to die fact that the whole certification law was changed to keep abreast of the times. This, of course, had to be handled through the filing department. Each letter that came in for the certification department entailed from three to five, and sometimes more, look-ups. The filing department did its "bit" in keeping pace with the teachers' requests for new certificates. This entailed long hours overtime and many, many trips to the transfer room. The Department of Public Instruction also extends its service to citizens of the state. Many individuals, desiring to secure a degree from the Univer - sity of Nebraska, use our department to continue their research in chosen fields. This entails much extra work, often as many as 800 school reports to be taken out of die files. The work in the filing department is varied and interesting. It has in - creased with the years, and die filing department feels diat it renders a dis - tinct service to die Department of Public Instruction. The following figures will give a partial picture of die rapid growth of the department: Look-ups Filing 1931-32 40,392 1931-32 88,905 1932-33 32,827 1932-33 77,449 1933-34 36,194 1933-34 76,431 1934-35 35,902 1934-35 83,096 1935-36 42,121 1935-36 80,157 1936-37 57,737 1936-37 90,376 1937-38 55,372 1937-38 109,629 </seg>

One third of this number are in brivate schools; two thirds are in schools under public control. The ratio of college students to high school students in the state is one to five. More than nine out of ten in these splendid assemblies come from the homes of Nebras - ka. This procession of youth is by no means a holiday parade; it is a march over the battleground, vhere the present generation is struggling against tre - mendous odds to hold past gains of civilization, to even more strenuous fields beyond.

The State Department is happy to acknowledge common cause with all institutions of higher learning in Nebraska. In the interest of economy and efficiency, it is believed that the control of the University and the Teachers Colleges should be under a single board elected by the people, as the mem - bers of the Board of Regents of the University are now elected. This plan has proved its merit in increasing numbers of states and should be given care - ful consideration by the people of Nebraska.

            <seg id="p075">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION William Kirk Fowltr Tribute is due to the life and work of William Kirk Fowler who passed from this life, March 28, 1938. Born at Tenafly, New Jersey, of Scottish parents, Mr. Fowler was educated in New York City; Monmouth, Illinois; and Edinburgh; Scotland. He came to Nebraska in 1883 and settled at North Bend where he began his teaching career in the rural schools of that vicinity. He served as principal of the Scribner schools for five years and was later superintendent of the Blair Gty Schools for a like period. In 1900 he was elected State Superintendent of Public Instruction and served until 1905. The results of his work during these four years in this State Department of Public Instruction attest to the splendid leadership, the progressive policies, and faithful service which he gave to the schools of the state. Improvement of instruction, better training of teachers, more adequate school buildings, and four years of high school available to all the boys and girls of the state are only a few of the many advancements in the field of education for which he worked constantly. A number of the improvements became effective during his administration, others were realized in later years. One of his chief sat - isfactions was to see a work which he had begun carried to completion by his successors in office. Mr. Fowler was a member of the Nebraska State Teachers Association for over 50 years. He served as clerk of the educational council for two years, was a member of the legislative committee for another period, and was for several years on the executive committee. He was an active member in the National Educational Association from 1892 to the rime of his death and also held membership in the National Association of School Adminis - trators. After leaving the office of die State Superintendent, Mr. Fowler continued in the field- of education through his work as the representative of two of the school publishing firms, the University Publishing Company and die John C. Winston Company. Mr. Fowler's splendid public service was the reflection of a noble and inspiring home life. He lived to see each of his six children receive a Uni - versity degree, two of them well established in business careers and four en - gaged in his own profession, the field of education. His record is one of more than half a century of superior citizenship and service to the youth of Nebraska. </seg>

The following four-year teacher training course of study has been adopted by the University of Nebraska for those who plan to teach in the high schools in Nebraska: Four* Year Course for the Preparation of High School Teacher* The Teachers College of the University of Nebraska assumes that the minimum essential program of training for teaching in the secondary schools involves as a minimum the completion of a four-year program of study, in - cluding both academic and professional work. In conformity with the recent enactment of a new teacher certification law which ultimately requires that every secondary school teacher have a degree, the Teachers College has seen fit to modify its program of studies. Included in the professional training of every student, there shall be a certain amount of practice teaching. Similarly, there has been provided opportunity for a distinct broadening of the base of subject matter preparation. A number of studies, two of which have been made in Nebraska, indi - cate very clearly that the raising of the general level of subject matter prep - aration of high school teachers is closely related to the problem or' spreading preparation to include more than one subject matter field. Evidences reveal, also, that in most high schools, even the larger ones, not enough classes in a single subject are taught to make a full load for one teacher. In fact, the number of classes taught is frequently so small that two, three, and even four subjects must be assigned to the same teacher in order to arrive at a full instructional load. It is only the unusual case that a teacher is respon - sible for instruction in only one subject matter field. An investigation of the teaching assignment of 926 teachers in Nebraska schools accredited to the North Central Association shows that there were only 106 cases or approxi - mately 10% where a teacher was responsible for a single subject matter area. Sixty-one of these were in English and thirteen in Latin. The next highest number of eight was in American History. </seg>
            <seg id="p098">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT A second reason for emphasizing a breadth of subject matter prepara - tion is occasioned by the belief that the most successful teachers are generally those whose interests are broad and whose understandings of life and its many problems are greatly enhanced by reason of breadth of knowledge. The trend in elementary and secondary schools will demand nothing less. The Teachers College seeks through its program to make all of its students con - scious of the necessity for extending the breadth of their subject matter prep - aration. The minimum requirements for the Bachelor of Science in Education De - gree as well as for the Nebraska Initial Secondary School Certificate, follow: Minimum Requirements for Bachelor of Science in Education Sem.

History of the Certification Law of 1937 A conference of die representatives of the certificating, agencies in die state was called by State Superintendent, Charles W. Taylor, on March 4, 1936 for die purpose of discussing requirements for teachers certificates and for die formulation of plans and policies governing die issuance of teachers certificates in die future. This conference met at die Cornhusker Hotel in Lincoln on March 26, 1936 at which time a committee from diis group consisting of representatives from die teacher training institutions in attendance at each of die conferences, presented die following set of reso - lutions which was unanimously adopted by die entire group: Recommendations. 1. We recommend that all certificates shall be issued by die State Superintendent of Public Instruction upon recommendation of die Board of Education of State Normal Schools or die Board of Regents of die Uni - versity; diat schools odier dian those under the jurisdiction of diese boards have their certificates issued likewise; and diat a committee somewhat as now organized, shall determine whedier these other institutions are meeting the requirements as prescribed by these boards. </seg>
            <seg id="p102">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 2. We recommend that no certificate shall be granted on less than one year above a four-year high school course, after .September 1, . 1940. 3. We recommend that junior high school certificates for grades seven to nine shall require sixty college hours. 4. We recommend that highl school certificates shall require one hundred twenty college hours. 5. We recommend that supervisory certificates for the elementary schools, having six or more teachers; shall require one hundred-twenty col - lege hours and two years of experience. 6. We recommend that the supervisory officer in any system of ten or more teachers shall have 30 college hours above the baccalaureate degree and two years of experience. 7. We recommend that one semester (the equivalent of diree semes - ter hours) of cadeting, or teaching in a practice school or in other ap - proved school under supervision, be required for all new certificates. 8. We, recommend that students shall not be admitted to die pro - fessional courses in normal training high schools or to the professional courses for elementary teachers in colleges until they pass the battery tests in die tool subjects. . 9. We recommend that an increased appropriation be made available to the State Department of Public Instruction for strengthening its super - visory program. Also by a unanimous vote the group formed itself into die Nebraska Council of Education on which council each of the collegiate institutions of the state would have representation and with the State Superintendent of Public Instruction as ex-offido chairman. A second meeting of die Nebraska Council of Education was called by State Superintendent, Charles W. Taylor for Monday, December 14th, 1936. Invitations to attend die meeting were sent to the Presidents and Di - rectors of Teacher Training of all of the higher institutions of learning in Nebraska and also diose others who were directly interested in die teacher - certification problem. The meeting was held in die State Capitol Building in die Supreme Court Chamber, number 2, and began shortly after 9:00 A. M. A full representation of die members of die Council was present and in addition several other persons from the public schools also attended. The meeting was opened by Superintendent, Charles W. Taylor, who pre - ■ ' sided at die entire conference. Remarks by Chairman Taylor: "On die 26th of March we called a meeting of certificating agencies to - gether. About nine years ago we had a supposed certification set-up and it </seg>
            <seg id="p103">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION disintegrated, largely because of the failure of one group of people to allow its success. I said to Mr. Cushing at that time, 'As far as I am concerned, we will never try to pass certification rules and regulations unless the time should come when we can all work together.' "You know what has happened from that time to this. We are having as many griefs on certification now as ever before but there are indications that more people will react kindly toward new kinds of certification change than ever before. "I feel that the group of people who actually grant certificates is the first group to be called together. I say that in deference to the Nebraska State Teachers Association. I have asked Superintendent Burke of Kearney who represents the State Teachers Association to come here, as well as Dr. Zeigel and Mr. Charles Bowers. "I said to you in your deliberations that from the way I saw normal training I probably would not be able to agree with, you. I do not think as I see the field out in the state that we can do away with normal training at the present time without serious injury to our rural school children. In our Biennial Report of current date we very definitely stress that. We want to be honest with each other because we want to know just what is being done. "Mr. Rosene has drawn up a set of resolutions for your consideration. I will now turn the meeting over to Mr. Rosene at this time." Mr. Rosene, Director of Certification, presented a plan of modifying the present certification laws and in his discussion stressed the present need for making provision for a sufficient number of qualified rural teachers each year. Mr. Harry Burke, member of the Educational Planning Commission of the Nebraska State Teachers Association, was asked to comment on the certification problems and continued the discussion regarding diese problems by asking that Dr. Zeigel of the Kearney State Teachers College be allowed to present the plan for teachers' certification which has been worked out by the Nebraska Committee on Professional Training, Certification, and Higher Education of the Nebraska State Teachers Association. Dr. Zeigel was per - mitted to submit his plan and a general discussion was entered into by the entire group regarding the suggested plans. The meeting recessed at 11:30 A. M. to meet again at 12:30. At the beginning of the afternoon session the discussion was continued regarding the two plans which had been submitted by Mr. Rosene and Dr. Zeigel. It was moved by President Pate that the Council vote on whether or not an entirely new certification law should be written. It was carried by a vote of 20 to 3 that a new certification law be written. It was moved that a committee be appointed by State Superintendent Taylor with Mr. Rosene as Chairman and this committee should draft a proposed certification bill to include all </seg>

Authority to issue teachers' certificates should be centralized. (Adop - ted.) 3. Teachers should be certificated on the basis of credentials and recom - mendations of colleges and universities instead of by examinations. (Adop - ted.) 4.

(These items were referred to die Com - mittee upon a motion, which was voted upon and passed.) A brief discussion regarding reciprocity between states was given by Mr. Rosene namely to die effect that other state superintendents desired re - ciprocity if all states' certificate requirements were identical. Widiout iden - tical requirements, reciprocity is impossible, other states feel. It was moved by Mr. Mitchell that die question of reciprocity and other questions be left in die hands of die Committee to be appointed by Chairman, Charles W. Taylor. This motion was passed. At 3:30 P. M., die meeting of die Council of Education was adjourned by State Superintendent, Charles W. Taylor. In addition to the foregoing, the State Department of Public Instruction submits die following points and suggestions for die guidance of die Com - mittee on Certification: First: In ■ view of the fact that it is absolutely essential that a sufficient number' of well-trained teachers be prepared each year for die one - room rural schools of die state and since it is well established that through die present Normal Training Laws this - has been provided, we wish to say that we are absolutely and whole-heart - edly for die present scheme of teacher training for die rural </seg>
            <seg id="p109">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION schools until such time that an, adequate supply of teachers, who are specifically prepared for rural work, be provided by the high - " er institutions of learning in the state. We would caution die com - mittee to use every effort to safeguard the interests of die rural schools in the drafting of a new certification law. Second: Since die field of adult education is enlarging in scope each suc - ceeding year,, and since there is a definite trend in the direction, of an increased amount of adult education, we feel that it is impor - tant that this be considered in a teacher certification scheme. We would also suggest that the field of vocational education be simil - arly studied and that any action taken give due regards to future development in this field. Third. The present certification law provides in a practical way for the shifting of a teacher from one teaching field to, another without handicapping the teacher in any way. It will be necessary, in framing a new law, to protect the teacher who is already in the field so that it will be possible for her, with a minimum, of incon - venience, to accept a teaching position in another field. from die one which she now holds. Fourth: The State, Department of Public Instruction stands on the prin - ciple that it is absolutely necessary that there be a central record - ing agency and diat all teacher's certificates issued in the state be signed by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction before they become valid. This is not a question of authority but one of proper procedure and records. The State Superintendent of Public Instruction, through the authority given him by die Nebraska Council of Education, has appointed the following Certification Committee and respectfully asks that each member thereof ac - cept the position to which he has been assigned and work with his sub-com - mittee chairman to the end that the best possible certification law may re - sult: W.

            <seg id="p111">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Nebraska Council of Education February 6, 1937 We wish to express to you our sincere appreciation of the loyal support you have been willing to give the matter of a revision of our teacher certifi - cation laws. We particularly appreciate the fact that each college and university in Nebraska participated and was willing to assume a give-and-take attitude to - ward the problem. It was the first time all schools joined together to work for die common good. May we suggest that we hope die same spirit will continue. You have been called togedier for die reason that we have been com - pelled to make certain revisions so as to make the program agreeable to die Legislature and to the people of die state. Frankly, it is die policy in the State Department of Public Instruction to advance widi die people rather than to take chances on presumptive steps of progress diat have to be retraced under public orders. The citizens of die State of Nebraska are overwhelming in their support of die normal training program. We believe, therefore, diat it is our duty to stand squarely by diis program until we have evidence to die contrary. If you will allow normal training to continue as it is, we feel diat there may be some chance to have a Certification Bill considered on its general princi - ples. We believe you have made a distinct advance in considering the main features of the proposition in your Certification Bill. As we see it, die cen - tralization of authority of die issuance of certificates will hardly be discussed as far as the Legislature is concerned. This matter is wholly in the hands of die school men and women diemselves. One other point which may cause difficulty to the passage of die Certif - ication Bill is die setting up of certain requirements for supervisors and ad - ministrators. This is not, however, as vital an issue as the one which I first named. We believe that deference to die people in diese matters of vital edu - cational import is in keeping with the principles of democracy. We are well aware of the. fact diat our! ideals of government are on trial these days. The endurance of diese ideals depends upon die will of our people to accept re - sponsibility for dieir government. Our part in die schools is not so much to make wise decisions for die people as to help them make wise decisions for diemselves. In this service is our opportunity as schoolmasters of the nation. I commend you for your work in the formulation of this program of certification. You have set up splendid professional goals. The road to diese goals must still be traveled. We must make sure that we keep our people widi us as we move forward. • • </seg>

The spirit of this effort has brought to us and your State Department of Public Instruction greater hope for progress in the future. Much remains to be done. Regardless of what may be die outcome of this thing, I want to again thank you for die work which you have done. Very truly yours, CHARLES W. TAYLOR State Superintendent of Public Instruction CWT:PMB This meeting of die Nebraska Council of Education, held on Saturday, February 6, 1937 in die State Capitol Building, brought final agreement to all but a few minor points in die proposed new certification law. These re - maining items were remodeled in committee meetings and with the approval of die entire council die bill was introduced in die First Unicameral Legisla - ture by Senator W. F. Haycock of Callaway, Nebraska on February 14, 1937. The bill came up for consideration in die committee on education com - posed of Senators Carlson, Carsten, Roy Johnson, Neubauer, Nuernberger, Pizer, Reynolds, Schultz, and Slepicka, and was reported out widi only one change in the entire bill, a lowering of the fee for certificates from #2.00 to #1.00. The final vote was a tribute; to die cooperative effort of die entire group which had undertaken the work. New Certification Law The new certification law is embodied in the following sections of die Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929, Supplement of 1937: 79-1301, 79-1302, 79-1303, 79-1304, 79-1305, 79-1309, 79-1314, 79-1315, 79-1316, 79-1317, 79-1318, 79-1404, 79-1408, 79-1410, 79-1501, 85-311, and 85-318. Meeting of the Nebraska Council of Education October 16, 1937 On October 7 State Superintendent, Charles W.

Watson, Nebraska Central College F. E. Weyer, Hastings College (54) At 8:45 A. M.. on October 16, State Superintendent Taylor opened the meeting with die following remarks: The certification law, as you know, was passed unanimously by the legis - lature. On the 6th of February I made the remark to you diat one point which might cause difficulty in passage of die certification bill was the setting up of certain requirements for administration. I also made the statement that the members of die legislature were opposed to any change in the certification law in regard to rural teachers. The farther we went with the Bill the more clearly we saw diat was true. I could see certain other things in the certification law which I imagined would take serious consideraton but you will remember that I said to you right along 'Are you all satisfied with the law as proposed? If you are not satisfied now is the time to tsiik.' The University and Creighton authorities were not exactly in accord. We got die University and Creighton authorities together and that proposition was easily ironed out. That demonstrates what can be done in an educational way in legislation if you get all your groups together. Now die law is passed, and we want to talk over several things with you, and dien appoint various committees to iron diese things out. Let me </seg>
            <seg id="p115">I OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION call your attention to the fact that the certification law was proposed exactly along the same lines as the previous law. The normal schools have one line of work, for instance, in the present law the first grade certificate is granted on two years of work. There - fore for all schools operating on less than four years of college work you have to take the state normal schools as the pattern. Then the Univer - sity steps into the picture for the upper undergraduate work and they have to be taken into consideration for every certificate that is granted. Now there was a conflict between these two ideas. We have done our best to draw this diing up having in mind that the state normal schools and the State University make the pattern. As far as our office was concerned we didn't care anything about the so-called centralization in our office. You will notice that on page 1 of the law, section 1301 de - finitely mentions the board of regents and the board of education of the state normal schools. Section 1302 mentions that all college credits shall have been earned in the regular teacher training courses. Now diat is a University proposition or state normal school proposition. Page 3 men - tions the 'physical fitness and health condition of die applicant.' We have used the very same phraseology in the new law as in die old law in die sections referring to die University of Nebraska and state normal schools. In odier words, we haven't made any changes other than those which had already been made by die board of regents and die board of education of state normal schools. I diink that is very vital because in various discussions diat may occur in the normal schools and die Uni - versity I imagine you will want to know exactly what the law says. We are going to act according to die law. We have learned diat is die only safe way we can do diese diings. Now dien, in writing today's call we had in mind five points to be dis - cussed. Of these five, die first one has to do widi die forms of certifi - cates and credentials and I believe diat diis is die most important one. The second point, graduate credits and graduate courses of study, isn't a thing diat diis group can do anydiing about except discuss. Inasmuch as we are a group of people interested in education I think it is very proper for us to discuss diis since die consensus of diis group enters into what we ultimately determine. I have been approached already by one mem - ber of the state normal schools, asking what would be our decision on die meaning of graduate credits and courses of study. I gave him die law and said diere were so many diings involved diat I couldn't take any ac - tion one way or another. I said to you once upon a time diat I could see various elements of dissatisfaction in die bill die way it was proposed in the higher levels. I said to diis friend in die normal schools, 'Why in the world didn't you mention diat during die period of discussion?' He replied diat he hadn't diought of it, and I said, 'You hadn't thought very far.' I imagine diere will be quite a Iitde discussion on diat proposition. Problem number three is physical and mental fitness and moral charact- </seg>
            <seg id="p116">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT er of applicants for certificates. I want a good discussion, on what this means, and I hope we can turn this over to the institutions themselves be - cause we haven't any money to bear the expense of examinations. Problem number four is requirement regarding physiology and hygiene and effects of alcoholic drinks and other stimulants. I may say to you this law has not been enforced since I was not given any authority in the matter. Now we have the authority. Problem number five is life certificates. I am sorry that Mr. H. M. Eaton was not able to be here. He was vitally interested in this ques - tion. This office has issued life certificates to persons from other states who have had two or more years of college preparation after the com - pletion of three years of teaching experience in this state. Now that ap - plies to all types of schools — parochial schools and public schools. It is a blanket proposition. I may frankly say that if any one questioned our authority I suppose we would have hard work to make it stick. There is no authority for that sort of thing. These are the problems as I see them. 1. Forms To Be Used in the Issuance of the Initial Certificate Referring to problem number one mentioned in the call Mr. Taylor said: This does fall under our jurisdiction and we are compelled to act upon it. In regard to the form of institutional credential, I should like very much if all the colleges would make some sort of jcredential that would correspond very readily to die state teachers certificate issued by die University of Nebraska and the state normal schools at the present time. I think that any person who graduates will be interested in having some sort of credential. I should like to have that form of institutional credential made so that they can be used by every school in the state. At the present time the state normal schools differ somewhat from the State University and the various other institutions, and so on. I believe thnt there could be a form of institutional credential that you could use, and each institution could obtain die money for these dirough fees. The present university teachers' certificate doesn't cost the University any - thing. That isn't anything that we have any jurisdiction over — any - thing more than to make die suggestion to you. The form of application blank and transcript is a matter for our office but we would like your recommendations. Here Mr. Taylor asked Mr. Rosene, Director of Certification to explain several points. Rosene I do want to mention two things about die form of ap - plication blank and transcript, and the form of certificate or license. There will be some added expense in our office and we want to be as economical as possible. We want die </seg>
            <seg id="p117">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 117 forms to be as simple as possible. The transcript form should be of a size to fit our files. It seems to me that as a starter if we could have the application on one side and the transcript on the other, it would be as simple as possible. We have used this type of form for the institutional certificates which are issued by the denominational colleges for several years and it seems to work out very nicely. The expense of the thing is quite important for our office. We received no additional appropriation for that. I doubt that we could have had the bill passed if we had insisted on the certificate fee brine #2.00 Pate What kind of transcript do you have in mind? Rosene We don't require the entire list of high school subjects. We require only a statment that the person is a graduate of a four year accredited high school. What we must have is a trans - cript of college credits. It seems to me that this could be worked out easily. (Cited Chadron blank.) Pate If all the credits of everyone who is entitled to a certificate are to be sent to the State Superintendent that means a great deal of work on the part of the registrar. The force would probably have to be increased. Mr. Hayward, how many do we graduate in a year? Hayward About 80 degrees, I believe. Probably 50 two-year people, and perhaps 70 or 80 one-year people. The total would probably be 200 to 225. It was estimated the University issued about 350 per year. Taylor What is your idea on the form of credential, Mr. Chancellor? (Chancellor Burnett refferred the matter to Dean Henzlik.) Henzlik The credential is handled by the registrar's office. That should be submitted in such a form that would be intelligible and sworn to by the registrar. I think it should be done very similarly to the way we do it now. The submitting of the credential is one thing, and the application and recom - mendation for the certificate that the individual is to get is a vastly different thing. Mcfcahey The certificate to be issued by the State Superintendent would ■ take the place of the certificate we now issue? Taylor Not necessarily. McGahey At the present time we grant a diploma certifying the stu - dent's name, the course in the college which he attends, a </seg>
            <seg id="p118">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT summation of the credits he has earned, and the form of certificate or license to be granted. Foster Does that mean four forms: (1) certificate or license by the State Superintendent, (2) form of application blank (that application to be made by the individual to your office), (3) transcript of record that is signed by the registrar, and (4) the institutional credential? Taylor We are thinking of combining these. Henzlik There must be a recommendation along with the credential coming from the professional group of the institution. Burnett What you want, Mr. Taylor, is something everybody can use. Rosene Mr. Fulmer mentioned to me the fact that those who finish the course in vocational agriculture receive a credential from the University of Nebraska, which I presume would be sim - ilar to what a graduate of the law college would receive. Per - haps you give only a diploma there. Those who finish vo - cational agriculture get a credential from the University stat - ing that they are qualified to teach Smith-Hughes agriculture in Smith-Hughes high schools. P"te I think there are two or three ways of handling it in. the nor - mal schools. We issue a degree, a diploma and a one-year certificate. All of them not only represent a credential from the institution but they are themselves certificates to teach. They say so. Under the new set-up we will still issue the credential, and recommend to the State Superintendent that he grant the certificate, and the only valid form which would qualify for teaching will be the certificate granted by the State Superintendent. The other is merely a credential of attainment from the school itself. Foster Three forms then: (1) diploma from the normal schools, (2) a recommendation, and (3) the State Superintendent's license. Pate No, only two. The board of regents of the University and the board of education for the normal schools will simply rec - ommend to die State Superintendent an individual for a cer - tain certificate. That will be determined by the courses the student carries. The State Superintendent will dien issue the certificate. Chancellor Burnett stated that die University would be glad to use any form set up by the State Superintendent's office. </seg>
            <seg id="p119">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Bowdem We are getting along all right at Crdghton with the present forms prescribed by the State Superintendent and will be glad to adopt any forms convenient. Hayward Iowa requires a complete transcript. Colorado asks only that we certify that a student is a graduate of a two or four year course, giving his total number of hours and the specific courses which are required in the law. Rosene I have the application and transcript forms from eleven differ - ent states that have laws somewhat similar to our own. A number of states have a state board that makes the rules gov - erning the issuance of certificates. In these other states which have laws similar to our own they have certain application forms, etc. that they use. I think perhaps die committee that takes this up might be interested in seeing the various blanks and forms. I would like to have a committee appointed from this group, the committee to contain at least one registrar from one of the schools represented here. This committee could take up die matter of evolving the different forms. If we could or - ganize into groups as we did in die matter of framing die law, we could do better work. Mr. W. F. Kruse, Cocordia Teachers College, discussed die meaning of die word "credential." Burnett Will diis certificate bear the name of any institution? Taylor Yes, I think it should have die name of the institution on it. Pate I think this group took action to that effect one time — that it should bear die name of die institution. In die case of attendance at several institutions, die. name of die last one giving recommendation would probably be die one put on die certificate. Burnett The credential is a form filed in die State Superintendent's office as die basis of issuance of die certificate. Chancellor Burnett brought up die questions of an institution cutting credits below the point! where a student could be recommended for graduation and asked if die student would have any appeal if he thought he had ample credits. The opinion of. die group was that there would be no appeal. Moritz Suppose a student has completed 50 hours credit in institu - tion A, transfers to institution B and has those credits cut to 40. It takes 10 more to meet die requirements for certifi - cation. Institution B, die last institution he has attended, </seg>
            <seg id="p120">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT ' * I will not certify to 60 hours— only 50. What happens to then? Taylor The answer will be that our office is not going to enter into a discussion of that kind. We will stand on the college itself settling that question. Mr. Moritz remarked that the result would probably be that students would be very cautious about attending schools that cut credits. MOTION on Problem 1. Moritz I move that the Chairman appoint a committee to confer with the state department on forms. Pate Seconded. Motion carried. Roscne I would like to have 6 or 10 persons on this committee be - cause I believe it is, important to get! the viewpoint of the various institutions, and a correct form as simple and econ - omical in time and operation as possible. DISCUSSION on floor. Rosene Suppose a person first thinks he wants to be a teacher, then decides to go into engineering. Woulcl the dean of the en - gineering college have the say-so in the matter of his course of study. Oldf other The dean of die college of engineering and the faculty. Rosene I wish Dean McProud of Wesleyan University would tell us something of what diey do in his school. Nebraska Wesley - an is a university diat has two colleges and a school of fine arts, and they have worked diis problem out very satisfactory it seems to me. ' | . Dean McProud stated diat in Wesleyan University a student may enroll in cither the arts college or die teachers college) and obtain dieir institutional cer - tificate. In either case, however, the dean of die teachers college is his advisoi, and approves his academic as well as his professional work. Oldfather Do you have separate colleges on your campus? You say peo - ple who expect to teach are under your direction. Will diey register in die different art colleges? McProud Yes but they are under the jurisdiction of the teachers college. We have always certified teachers from the college of liberal arts. Those people are responsible, with me, as die advisor of </seg>
            <seg id="p121">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION all liberal arts students who take certificates. We require that they meet the professional requirements and majors and minors as do other people. Oldfather Are your major and minor requirements the same as they are in the liberal arts college or is there a special program for students in the liberal arts college? McProud They have no difficulty in meeting the majors and minors and at the same time the requirements of die teachers college. Burnett You become the advisor of all students who register in educa - tion courses? McProud I am so far as certification is concerned. 2. Graduate Credits and Graduate Courses of Study The matter of the junior graduate college, and die North Central Associa - tion's regulations in regard to graduate work were brought up for detailed discussion. Discussion included the regioinal lists of schools approved for graduate work. Dean Upson explained the list approved by the Association of American Universities. Dean Henzlik pointed out that the October number of the N. C. A. Quar - terly explained the action which the North Central Association will take in die future with regard to institutions beginning to offer graduate work. He stated that they will be subjected to a re-inspection, and if they fail to measure up in graduate work, "The whole institution is put on the un - approved list for the North Central Association approves institutions as a whole and not in part." Dean Bowdern suggested that the board of examiners become the inspection agency in the matter of graduate work for the higher certificates. McProud We have nothing to do with the academic standing of any college. Our function is to examine these colleges to see whether or not diey are meeting requirements for teacher training. Rosene You understand that the board of examiners has no jurisdiction over die teachers colleges. Mr. Cushing was asked his opinion on the matter of graduate work. Cushing I am not an authority on graduate credit. I prefer to leave die matter to those who are authorities. MOTION. Bowdern I move diat die state board of examiners now accept as part of their function the recommending of graduate credits to the State Superintendent for the issuance of high school certificates. </seg>

            <seg id="p124">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Motion seconded (Later motion was withdrawn, with consent of second, in favor of a committee and further consideration.) Li support of his motion Dean Bowdern explained that the board of exam - iners would have no jurisdiction over the academic standing of an institution but would merely report to the State Superintendent that their graduate work was acceptable for the granting of high school certificates in Nebraska. Here Mr. Archer L. Burnham, Scottsbluff Junior College, explained that before graduate work of any college could be approved, that college must first be accredited as a graduate school by one of the accrediting agencies. Chancellor Burnett suggested die advisability of appointing a committee for further study on die mater before taking a vote. MOTION on problem 2. McProud I move that the chairman appoint a committee to take this matter of graduate credits for certification under advisement, and report back. Bowdern Seconded. Motion carried. Dean Bowdern recommended that in appointing die committee the chairman bear in mind toe personnel of the present board of examiners. 3. Physical and Mental Fitness and Moral Character of Applicants for Certificates Taylor It is our recommendatioin that we pass this requirement back to die schools themselves. Cushing It seems to me that this matter could be discussed endlessly. It appears to me that the suggestion which your office has made diat diis matter be handled by die individual institutions is the only manner in which it can be handled at the present time. As I diink of my acquaintance widi die various colleges of toe state, it seems to me diat toere is no college that would recommend its graduates as people of good physical and mental fitness and moral character to represent toeir institution if diose people did not measure up. I would simply endorse die recommendation of your office and endorse toe plan set up in the proposed blank which Mr. Rosene submitted. Mr. Taylor mentioned the drive being made by federal authorities against venereal disease. Dean He;izlik explained the physical examination required of freshmen students at toe University. MOTION on Problem 3. </seg>
            <seg id="p125">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Cushing I would move that die member institutions be required to sub - mit such statements as to physical and mental fitness and moral character as the State Superintendent sees fit to require. Weyer Seconded. Motion carried. 4. Requirements Regarding Physiology and Hygiene and Effects of Alcoholic Drinks and Other Stimulants Mr. Rosene suggested that this requirement might be used as a sort of tariff barrier for states bordering Nebraska inasmuch as most of them have set up barriers of one kind or another. Iowa was mentioned as requiring a course in Iowa Govenment, Kansas a similar course in Kansas Law, and every state bordering Nebraska has some requirement which works to the disadvantage of out-of-state applicants for teachers' certificates. GENERAL DISCUSSION followed. 5. Life Certificates Taylor This office has issued life certificates to persons from other states who have had two or more years of college preparation after the completion of three years of teaching experience in this state. We have had a number of requests to waive this requirement since it is not specifically stated in the law We should like very much to have your reaction to this problem. Mr. Rosene read a portion of a special delivery letter received from County Superintendent, H. M. Eaton, Douglas County. Dean Weyer suggested that no change be made in life certificates at this time. GENERAL DISCUSSION MOTION on problem 5. Ostdiek I move that at the end of one year of Nebraska teaching ex - perience plus a minimum of two years teaching expierence outside the state a life certificate be granted on die basis of the present certification law. Hansen Seconded. Motion carried. (21 to 11) Adjournment At 11:50 A. M. die meeting was adjourned subject to die call of die chairman. Chairman CHARLES W.

Reed, University of Nebraska Byron S. Stoffer, Doane College H. G. Stout, Kearney State Teachers College F. W. Upson, University of Nebraska Joseph Zuercher, Creighton University In harmony with the motions indicated, we have appointed the above committeees. We urge you to keep in mind, during your deliberations, the supreme importance of the training and certification of teachers in the educational program. All of the effort and all of the money invested in schools find return in the help teachers are able to give to children on the pathways of learning and character development. We must, therefore, relate every phase of our teacher training program in the interests of the children of Nebraska. In brief, institutional consideration, as always, must be kept secondary to opportunity for institutional service. The new certification law is yet to be tested. We want y^u to know that this office will do its best to make its enactment stand out as a land mark of professional progress and educational welfare. At the same time, we have always felt that the certification law is a vital responsibility of institutions in charge of teacher training and of all members of the pro - fession who work under its provisions. On this ground, we ask for the cooperation of all represented in the council in its interpretation and en - forcement. We are placing the operation of the committees in the hands of W.. A.. Rosene, Secretary of the Council. It isn't necessary for each committee to meet at the same time, but we trust you will give a lot of thought to the- problems and be ready to report and work out your committee action not later than January 10, 1938. I think it will be well for all commmittees to hold their meetings in the state department of public instruction. Finally, on behalf of the schools, I express to you sincere appreciation for the unselfish service of all teacher training institutions of Nebraska. In the splendid spirit of your cooperation is assurance of the successful administra - tion of the new certification law. Very truly yours, CHARLES W. TAYLOR, State Superintendent of Public Instruction </seg>
            <seg id="p128">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Teachers Record File Established During 1937-1938 the State Department made the beginnings of an Active Duty File for all members of the teaching profession actually at work in the State. The task involved the accumulation of the personal records of 6,000 teachers in the rural schools, 4,500 in die city and village grade schools and 3,500 in the high schools. Since it was necessary to start from scratch, those in charge thought it would scarcely be possible to secure complete returns in a single school year. But teachers, as well as Superintendents, realized the value of the service and kept sending in records until the count was almost 100 per cent by September, 1938. The Wprks Progress Administration supplied the clerical assistance for the transcription and compilation of records. Information includes: date of birth, school address, home address, type of certificate held, date of is - suance of certificate, date of expiration of certificate, names of training in - stitutions attended, subjects in which the teacher took her major and minor preparation, the number of hours earned in education, degree earned, date of issuance of life certificate, places taught since her teaching career began, grades or subjects taught, and the exact years taught in each school. The files are restricted to professional use under official supervision. Accumulation of this data makes possible the solution of many problems of certification, etc, affecting educational service in die state. Approximate - ly 2,500 new teachers enter the schools in Nebraska each year. Many changes in position occur. In order to be of continuing value, adequate pro - vision must be made for the maintenance of this service. Continuing Contract Law Decision in die place of delay, confidence in die place of worry, is die contribution of die Continuing Contract Law to die educational program of Nebraska. These values warrant sincere cooperation on die part of all con - nected with die schools in this outstanding improvement of administration. These amendments provide, in all schools except those known as Article III schools, that after a teacher has received her first contract to teach in a school, which must be by a majority vote of die board of education, in order to terminate this contract for die next ensuing year, it is necessary for die board of education to take action by a majority, vote to terminate die contract. This action must be taken on or before April 1st and should the board fail to take this action the teacher's contract automatically holds over for another year. It is necessary for the teacher to file a written notice of his acceptance of this "hold over" contract, with the secretary of the board of education not later than April 15. Failure on the part of the teacher to file this acceptance within the time limit automatically cancels the contract. The statement of die law for Article VI Schools appears in Section 79-603 and reads: "* * * diat die first contract of employment widi a teacher shall require die sanction of a majority of die trustees, but thereafter said contract </seg>
            <seg id="p129">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION shall be deemed renewed from year to year and shall remain in hill force and effect until a majority of the members of the board of trustees vote on or before April first to terminate the contract at the close of the contract period, or until the contract is superseded by a new contract mutually agreed to by the teacher and the board of trustees: Provided, that any teacher whose contract is automatically renewed according to the aforesaid provisions shaH file written notice with the director of the board of trustees within fifteen days thereafter of his or her acceptance of said renewed contract and failure to file such a notice shall be re - garded as conclusive evidence of his or her non-acceptance of the contract. The corresponding statement for Article XXV schools is found in Sec - tion 79-2508. v^? o °, Sp t dfic P rovision » **&amp; for employment of teachers in Article XXIV Schools and the ruling under 79-2406 is based on the provisions for Article XXV Schools, the phases of the Continuing Contract Law for the Article XXV Schools holds for schools organized under Article XXIV. Rural Boards May Employ . 1 J e . I l ew TT I ? w *e requirements regarding the election of teachers in Article III Schools so that any two members of the board of education may elect a teacher for the ensuing year prior to the annual meeting. Here - tofore, it has been necessary, in cases where two members of the board elect - ed a teacher, that the terms of office of these two members extend through the term of the teacher's contract. (Section 79-411.) The following questions and answers from official correspondence are sub - mitted in order to help realize the values included in this vital legislation for the improvement of the educational service in Nebraska. 1. Does the Continuing Contract Law apply to rural schools? No. The amendment to Section 79-411, authorizing boards of educ - ation in Schools organized under Article III to employ teachers, merely permits trustees whose term of office does not extend beyond the contract period to vote for teachers, subject only to the relation - ship to candidates. In short, board members in these districts can now elect, at any time during the current year, a teacher, for the ensuing year. Whereas, under the old law, it was impossible in many districts to hold elections until after the annual meeting in June. 2. Are contracts for the current year, in all except rural schools, Con - tinuing Contracts under the new law without renewal, so far as tenure is concerned, even though modified so far as salary is concerned? Unless the contract is officially terminated by an action of the board, and the terms of employment remain the same, die teachers' contract </seg>
            <seg id="p130">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT i holds for the ensuing year. A change in salary requires a new con - tract mutually agreed to by the board of trustees and the teacher. (Sections 79-603 and 79-2508.) 3. What is the definition of the "majority of the members of the district board" required to terminate a teachers contract under the Continuing Contract Law? The long standing ruling of the State Department on the "majority of a six-member board" as recorded under Section 79-2508 is jour members. Four members are required to terminate a teachers contract. 4. Does the Continuing Contract Law apply to Superintendents as well as teachers? The Continuing Contract Law applies specifically to Superintendents in Article XXV Schools (Section 79-2508). In Article VI Schools the election of Superintendents is included in the general authority for the election of teachers under Section 79-603. 5. Is the Board of Education required to notify teachers of election under Continuing Contract amendments? Written notice of election is not required by law, but sound business procedure calls for a personal report to each teacher as the basis of his action. A form letter announcing election will be satisfactory preliminary to the issuance of, a contract. 6. Does a newspaper announcement of faculty elections constitute official notice? A newspaper article is not a satisfactory communication of official business. Cooperation with! the press is always in order but the newspaper cannot take the place of business correspondence. Teach - ers are public servants; nevertheless, they are entitled to a fair measure of privacy in the conduct of the personel side of their affairs the same as people in other walks of life. 7. If the Board wishes to permit automatic renewal of a contract, is the board under obligation to notify the teacher of election? The intent of the Continuing Contract Law is not automatic election; rather the intent of the law is timely and careful consideration of all teachers in keeping with the importance of the service to be rendered. If a teacher is to be retained on the same basis as the current year, therefore, she should be notified to this effect (and commended for devotion to duty.) 8. If the Board takes action terminating the contract but does not notify the teacher, is the teacher elected? </seg>
            <seg id="p131">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION The teachers' election is determined by the action of the board as recorded in the official minutes. If notice is not given to a teacher on or before April 1, the teacher has a right to request official notice. If the action is favorable or no action is taken, the teacher is under obligation to file a reply either accepting or declining the position. "Nebraska became a part of the United States through the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. Its history before 1854, when it became an organized territory, consisted for the most part of the findings of military expeditions or the tales .of travelers crossing the great plains. On the whole the stories of the latter were that this country was a drab treeless desert unfit for die habit - ation of white people and doomed to be a wasteland not unlike the great des - ert regions of the globe. However mournful these tales might have been, the traveler did not seem to consider that a land which could support countless bison, antelope and odier wild creatures, that a domain upon which 40,000 Indians lived, must have some capabilities of supporting civilized life. In 1834 the entire region was proclaimed by the United States Government, 'The Indian Country', and citizens of the United States were forbidden to settle widiin its boundaries." — from Nebraska's Population, Nebraska State Planning Board, page 1. "In view of the relationship between the enlightenment of people and their economic and political independence, these trends in school and state expenditures give rise to vital questions in Nebraska at this time! 1. Is there any connection between the small appropriations for 'Weak School Districts' and the increasing requirements for relief in the states? 2. What is the relationship between the school program and the con - ditions of employment in the state? 3. The report of the Federal Unemloyment Census in November, 1937, showed 44,872 totally unemployed in Nebraska; 29,526 more were partially unemployed; 25,850 were retained on Federal Emergency Pro - jects. In addition to these people, listed in the unemployment census, approximately 28,000 were receiving old age assistance. What can the schools do to help people to a larger measure of independence in die future? . "Our chief concern in 1938 is a constructive program of citizenship and community welfare. These interests are not antagonistic, they are supple - mentary to each other. The development of a satisfactory program is a common obligation to all who live in Nebraska." </seg>

Baldridge, Director of Rural and Elementary Education CONTENTS— The Rural and Elementary Schools of Nebraska To - day—Rural Students in High School— Outstanding Problems and Needs— The Work of the Division of Rural and Elementary Education — Helpful Publications — Rural School Achievements. In Nebraska, there are 75,693 boys and girls attending one-teacher ele - mentary schools in rural districts and 131,086 boys and girls attending ele - mentary grades in other schools which have more than one teacher and which are located in the open country, villages, towns, and cities, making a total of 206,779 boys and girls in the elementary grades of Nebraska schools. There are 5,772 Nebraska one-teacher rural schools. In 1937, there were 25 507 rural students enrolled as free high school tuition students in the accredited ,and non-accredited public high schools whose total enrollment included 83 021 high school students. This number of free high school tuition students does not include the rural students attending the thirteen county high schools of the state. The schools have been recognized as the power house of the nation. Each school needs the whole-hearted support and cooperation of the entire com - munity. It is hoped that through the report of this division, that many ques - tions of interested patrons and taxpayers may be answered. The public is entitled to all information in regard to the condition of the schools through - out the state so that they may intelligendy support or oppose the state pro - gram for the advancement of education. The rural and elementary school problems, objectives, and achievements are of vital interest not only to the rural sections, but to aH of Nebraska. Information as to the progress and achievements of the schoo^ consideration of their problems and needs, as well as the efforts that are bang made to bring about improvement should be or interest to all parents, taxpayers, and legislators.

During the school year 1936-37, the aver - age number of days for the state that elementary rural schools were actually open was 173.36 days. During the school year 1937-38, the average num - ber of days for the state that elementary rural schools were actually open was 174.40 days. During the school year 1936-37, the average number of days for the state that the city, town, and open-country schools, that offer more than eight grades, were open was 176.36 days; in these schools the average for the year 1937-38 was 176.89 days. A large number of the rural schools would not be able to maintain school for a nine-month term if it were not for their share of the state ap - portionment. , ■ ; j The Nebraska Elementary Course of Study The Nebraska Elementary Course of Study has been welcomed in the state as "A New BiH of Rights" for the school child and has been giveri most favorable comment throughout the state and in other states. Its constant and intensive use by teachers determines its real worth and empha - sizes its value to the childhood of Nebraska. The Office of Education, United States Department of die Interior, in its publication, "A Survey of Courses of Study and Other Curriculum Materials Published Since 1934," summarizes as follows: "The Nebraska Course suggests materials, activities, procedures, and standards for each grade by subject. It includes type units, special helps for diagnosis and remedial instruction, and means of adapting the Course to the rural schools." According to a published comment, the Nebraska Course exalts the needs of the child above the curriculum and undertakes to embrace a philosophy of education whereby the everyday activities of the life of the child, the home, the community, and the state are definitely linked up with the school- County superintendents have spoken in highest praise of the New Elementary Course of Study and of what it is doing for the schools of Nebraska. The following comments by county superintendents are heard throughout die state: "The New Elementary Course is making real teachers." "It looks as if our teachers are using die Course of Study one hundred per cent." The new Course speaks eloquently of the educational work that the schools are actually doing in Nebraska. It represents die work of members of die teaching profession who were carrying very heavy schedules. It is of interest to know that die work on die Elementary Course of Study was i </seg>
            <seg id="p134">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT donated free of charge to the people of the State of Nebraska. A neighboring State Superintendent commented: "The entire Course of Study shows evidence that it is the work of people who understand die problem and who know how to attack it. The school children and the teachers of Nebraska have been well served by those who labored so unselfishly to produce this volume." The Nebraska Elementary Course of Study is one illustration of how Nebraska teachers have responded with improved methods during these "lean years." Not less, than 1400 members of the teaching profession in Nebraska made contributions which provide enrichment in this publication and repre - sent the wealdi of experience, scholastic training, and work of 36 instructors in teachers colleges, 23 supervisors, 11 city teachers, 44 county superintend - ents and ex-county superintendents, laymen, advisory committees including the 93 county superintendents, and 1200 rural teachers who worked on assigned problems. The work on die Course of Study has been donated free of charge to the people of the State of Nebraska. The .people of the state are entitled to know of this contribution by die teaching profession, without cost to the taxpayer, and to make comparison with the cost of compiling in 1933 the Course of Study in South Dakota, which amounted to about £60,000, and to the cost of the 1926 curriculum .revision program in the St. Louis public schools at a cost of approximately $100,000 during the year. The state educational survey of Florida, carried on in 1928, cost $575,000 and die cost of the curriculum construction in 1932 was in the neighborhood of $10,000 in Florida. The cost of the Course of Study in Virginia in the fourth year of *heir program was $32,576.00. The Nebraska Elementary Course of Study has been recognized as a real contribution to die curriculum field and has been cited as to what can be done when conscientious, hard-working educators put their talents and their hearts into a real undertaking, j Qualifications of Teachers For detailed information, refer to the survey given in the report of the Division of Secondary Education and Teacher Training. The economic status of the rural teacher is of major concern in the findings of this report. An illustration of the courage, the commendable growth that teachers are making, may be shown by a letter from a young man who is teaching in western Nebraska. He stated that he earned six hours by taking college courses by correspondence while he was teaching and then attended the twelve - week summer session in Chadron, thereby earning eighteen hours of college credit during one year. </seg>

Increase in Number of Standard Schools and Improvement In School Buildings There are 826 standard schools and 18 superior schools in Nebraska. During the past twelve years, the number of standard schools has increased 115.10 per cent. Twenty-eight new school buildings have been erected during 1937-38; during the year 1936-37, 60 new school buildings were erected. ■The standard and superior rural school program has aided in providing healthful conditions for the boys and girls. Standardization of rural schools is a voluntary procedure on the part of the school districts themselves. No right of self-control is affected by standardization. Satisfactory phys - ical environment is considered very important to the school life, health, and progress of children and has led to definite standards in buildings, grounds, and working equipment. .These standards, conducive to greater care in providing healdiful educational advantages for rural children, have been established in order to secure the best one-teacher schools possible. </seg>

Salaries, Lowered in 1933-34, Have Shown Slight Increases Each Year Since That Time In 1929-30, the average salary of the teacher in the one-teacher rural school was $861.28 for men and #766.46 for women. There was a large decrease during each of the succeeding years until the year 1933-34. In 1933-34, the average salary for the year for men in the one-teacher rural school was #472.29; the average yearly salary for women in the one - teacher rural school that year was #455.80. Since 1935, an increase in the average salary has been reported for each year. During the school year 1937-38, the average salary for men in the one - teacher rural school was #513.61; the average salary for women in the one - teacher rural school was #493.12. It has been noted that salaries vary greatly in counties and seem to be greatly influenced by the crop conditions in die respective counties. In a few of the counties, the crop failures caused a decrease in salaries rather dian die slight increase that is noted as the average for the state. State aid has increased salaries in some of die sparsely settled counties. The average monthly salary (for not more than nine months) for women in the one - teacher rural schools in die various counties is as follows: Adams — #53.20; Antelope— #49.95; Arthur — #65.92; Banner— #62.90; Blaine — #54.87; Boone — #55.23; Box Butte — #67.94; Boyd— #42.88; Brown— #53.10; Buffalo — #50.81; Burt— #59.89; Butler— #59.05; Cass— #60.10; Cedar— $54.98; Chase— #61.16; Cherry— #55.18; Cheyenne — #70.00; Clay— #49.97; Colfax — $53.79; Cuming— #55.82; Custer— #51.71; Dakota— #65.00; Dawes— #60.09; Dawson — #63.10; Deuel— #63.32; Dixon— #53.56; Dodge— #55.94; Douglas ;—#82.14; Dundee— #57.45; Fillmore— #49.03; Franklin— #43.89; Frontier U#50.90; Furnas— #47.38; Gage— #54.79; Garden— #59.97; Garfield— $49.68; Gosper— #59.13; Grant— #60.00; Greeley— #50.72; Hall— #59.76; Hamilton— #51.43; Harlan— #45.88; Hayes— #54.83; Hitchcock— #55.69; Holt — #47.24; Hooker— #63.00; Howard— #49.51; Jefferson— #53.27; Johnson— #48.85; Kearney— #55.18; Keith— #69.93; - Keya Paha— #42.79; Kimball— #76.43; Knox— #50.18; Lancaster— #60.53; Lincoln— #58.65; Logan— #56.67; Loup— #50.55; McPherson— #53.94; Madison— #50.02; Merrick— #57.58; Morrill— #63.69; Nance— #48.41; Nemaha-^54.83; Nuckolls— #48.87; Otoe— #53.56; Pawnee— #47.92; Perkins— #65.48; Phelps— #55.91; Pierce— #49.52; Platte— #55.27; Polk— #52.37; Red pillow— #54.07; Richardson— #52.55; Rock— #46.53; Saline— #48.74; Sarpy— #75.68; Saunders— #59.95; Scotts Bluff— #78.26; Seward— #55.16; Sheridan— #58.71; Sherman— #48.11; Sioux— #62.10; Stanton— #50.81; </seg>

The teachers have made tremendous and personal sacrifices, paralleled by farmers and other Nebraskans, in order to keep the schools open and to give the boys and girls, to the best of their ability, educational opportunities. Many schools would have been closed had it not been for the spirit of determination and sacrifice which characterized our pioneers. With the sympathetic support of those who believe in the importance of public education, we look forward to the future, believing that financial programs will be readjusted in harmony with available incomes and that the return of prosperity to the Nebraska farm will bring more adequate compensation to the teacher. A report from the Advisory Committee on Education, appointed by President Roosevelt, reveals on page 13, that the United States average current expenditure per child between five and seventeen years of age, 1935-36, and estimated revenue available for the education of each child, if each state made average effort, 1935, is #51.77. The expenditure for each child in Nebraska is just below the average and amounts to #50.05. It is also shown that Nebraska is one of the thirteen states who are keeping their expenditures within their ability to pay. This report also reveals that Ne - braska stands thirty-first in the current expenditure per pupil in average daily attendance in the various states, 1935-36. The United States average is #74.30. The Nebraska average is #64.75, as given in the Appendix of the Advisory Report. The states ranking just below the average for the United States and just above Nebraska are: Iowa, Idaho, Indiana, Utah, Kansas, and Vermont. Continued Home and School Cooperation Much of the credit for the progress that has been made in the rural schools during the past twelve years may be attributed to the splendid co - operation 'between home and school. The basic needs of a child, namely, security and an* opportunity to develop, depend on his own home, his school, his church, and community for fulfillment. In order to give the boys and girls in the rural communities the educational advantages which they should have and in order to solve the problems which our rural communities are facing, we must have a strong spirit of cooperation and harmony existing in rural communities. Patrons' Days- have done much to bring about a good spirit of fel - lowship. During the school year 1937-38, Patrons Days or School Open House Day were held by 3,101 schools. Patrons and taxpayers have be - come interested in school improvement and community activities when they have had an opportunity to become acquainted with school problems and needs and to observe pupils in their daily work. </seg>
            <seg id="p140">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Parent Teacher Associations and other community organizations co - operating with the schools have promoted a better understanding between home and school and have enabled parents and teachers to cooperate intelli - gendy in the training of a child. Rural Students In High School The fact that an increasing number of rural pupils are attending high school is an indication of progress. More rural children are securing this additional training. This increase in the number of free high school students is of especial interest since the number of students passing the eighth grade varies comparatively little from year to year. During the school year 1936-37, 25,507 rural students were enrolled as free high school tuition students. This number of free high school tuition students does not include the rural students attending the thirteen county high schools of the state. The number of free high school tuition students has steadily increased. Since 1919, the number has increased 262.7 per cent. Since 1926, the number of free high school tuition students has increased 47.8 per cent. Certainly, rural pupils are entitled to high school privileges and the Nebraska legislators are to be commended for their vision in providing free high school privileges for the rural youth.

            <seg id="p141">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION The Work of Rural Pupils in High School Rural pupils, entering high school, require a period for orientation and then hold their own with resident pupils. Conferences widi county and city superintendents will confirm the statement that rural pupils require a period for orientation on their entering high school. This important period seems to vary in high schools. In one school, a period of four weeks enabled rural pupils to progress at the average rate of resident pupil progress. In another, the city superintendent felt that the first six weeks were apparently lost and that after that six week period, generally speaking, the nir.-/ pupils fitted in the city high school in good shape. Another high school in which half of the students were from rural districts found that there was no handicap in class work after three months. It was stated that after a short "warming-up" period of three or four months, diat rural children were holding their own. Superintendents declared that it was most important for the teachers to have a sympathetic attitude, especially while the pupils were in this new situation. Some schools made a practice of placing their best trained, most sympathetic, experienced teachers in charge of the ninth grade class. One superintendent deemed it necessary to give a course in "How to Study" during the first semester. It was the opinion in one large high; school that the rural pupils were better in grammar that the resident pupils; on the other hand, the resident pupils were better in oral and written expression in English. It was reported that in another school, die rural pupils made minor adjustments; in four weeks but that they were not happy ir} their work until toward the close of the semester. The comments were nufde by long - term, experienced superintendents in towns whose high schools! have large enrollments Since farm property pays approximately 64 per cent of die taxes in Nebraska, and since almost two million dollars are paid for high school tuition annually to the high schools of die state by farm taxes, rural pupils are entitled to understanding, sympathetic, and interested teachers who will give careful consideration to dieir problems and will aid them in becom - ing adjusted to the school environment of die large high school, thereby helping them to succeed in their work. Outstanding Problems and Needs The economic status of the teacher is a serious problem in education in Nebraska. Refer to statistical data given in the report of die Department. Economic difficulties have curtailed school funds. Inadequate teachers' salaries are tending to retard professional improvement. Adequate library facilities and reading materials are needed for teach - ers and children. </seg>
            <seg id="p142">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT . ecial instruction for physically and mentally handicapped children should be provided. j Provision for clerical assistance should be provided by legislation to t those county superintendents who do not have clerical help. The work of sup - ervision is greatly handicapped when county superintendents are compelled to devote a major part of their time to clerical work on account of the lack of stenographic help. j Nebraska should look forward eventually to giving further assistance ;to county superintendents by providing supervisors for the improvement of instruction. In 1930, there were 945 rural school supervisors reported in 516 counties in thirty states, in addition to the county superintedents. In three states, Wisconsin, Delaware, and Maryland, rural school supervision was statewide. In three other stataes, California, New Jersey, and Connecti - cut, it is practically state-wide. Each state, however, must take the person - nel and available means of supervision that it has and work to bring about I better conditions. The schools cannot wait for conditions that, if realized 'in the far distant future, may seem ideal. Existing problems of the rural school must be met. The best interests of the individual boy and girl must be considered. The number of the eighth grade examinations ma y we ll be reduced without interfering with the subject matter to be mastered. This matter should be considered by the legislators. Refer to report on eighth grade examinations. The Work of the Division of Rural and Elementary Education County superintendents, teachers, school officers, and patrons have earnestly cooperated in attempting to provide improved educational ad - vantages for the boys and girls in the rural districts each year. Decided progress has been made. The success of each individual child has been the goal of all. The work of the Division of Rural and Elementary Education is to give particular help to county superintendents, school officers, teachers, and patrons in formulating and developing county-wide and local progressive school programs that will result in the improvement of elementary schools. Intensive effort is directed toward the realization of certain goals, namely, improvement of instruction, more effective learning by pupil, enriched li - braries, improved equipment, standard and superior rural schools, and greater cooperation between home and school. As in other states, the work of the Director of Rural and Elementary Education in Nebraska is concerned with promoting the state program of rural and elementary education, supervision of instruction, encouragement of greater home and school cooperation, and research.

The promotion of efficiency and professional growth of teachers may be realized and is being realized by classroom visitation, commendation, constructive individual criticism, classroom demonstrations, testing programs, standards of achievement, individual instruction, contests and exhibits, teachers' meet - ings and institutes, school demonstration days and patrons' days, the issuance of circulars and bulletins, and emphasis on teaching units, projects, and activities. As a part of the field work, this biennium, the Director of Rural and Elementary Education has addressed fifty-three county teachers' institutes and has given many addresses at group teachers' meetings, district teachers', associations, school officers' meetings, eighth grade promotion audiences, local and state Parent-Teacher Association meetings, standardization and superior school meetings, school house dedications, normal training classes and clubs, radio audiences, and other community meetings, has conducted rural school chorus work, has visited classrooms, and held conferences with county superintendents, school officers, and teachers. During the biennium, some type of field work has been carried on by this Division in eighty-two counties of die state. The office work of die Division has included the revision and follow - up work of die Course of Study for Elementary Schools in Nebraska; preparation of "Rural Education Moving Forward, Revised," the rural teachers' manual of two hundred pages; the preparation of Supervisory Bulletins for County Superintendents; the preparation of the Fire Prevention Manual, a course of study for Nebraska boys and girls of ninety-three pages; issuance of certificates of membership in the State Rural School Chorus; issuance of recognition certificates for better rural school teaching; recog - nition of standard and superior rural schools; preparation of eighth grade examination questions; rural and elementary school correspondence; and conferences with parents, teachers, school officers, other taxpayers, and pupils. The objective of the Division is to realize, with the cooperation of the home, the school, and the church, the richest dividends for the Nebraska boys and girls, namely, die achievement of permanent interests in inspirational and recreational reading, the development of good habits of study, the appreci - ation of good music, and the acquisition of qualities of good citizenship. Twelve State Supervisors of Elementary Education Attend Office of Education Conference The following report was released by the Office of Education in regard to die conference on elementary education which die Director of Rural and Elementary Education of Nebraska enjoyed the privilege of attending. This conference was especially significant and was a real recognition of die importance of elementary education. </seg>
            <seg id="p144">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT "Continuing the practice of calling into conference with its staff Specialists, educational leaders from the various States to discuss jointly die improvement of a particular field of education, the Office of Education, Department of the Interior, held a meeting to consider problems facing America's elementary school teachers, supervisors, and administrators. Di - rectors of elementary education from twelve State departments of education attended the conference, called by John W. Studebaker, Commissioner of Education. "For two days the visiting conferees, representing nearly 150,000 teach - ers and more than one-fourth of the Nation's elementary school population of 22,000,000 children, discussed their common problems and revealed what might be done bodi by State departments of education and the Office of Education to aid in improving elementary education." ■. { "It was emphasized by Assistant Commissioner Goodykoontz that educa - tion is a 'big business' in these United States when it is considered from the point of view of numbers of teachers and children concerned. In relation to the whole field, the elementary, level is probably of the greatest importance. Of every 100 boys and girls who are in school, approximately 75 are enrolled at die elementary level, in spite of an estimated decrease in number of elementary school children. To look at the problems of this school group from yet an - odier angle, 20 in every 100 are foreign-born or of foreign-born parents; 52 of every 100 live in places under 2,500 population, widi die odier 48 in larger towns and cities. Elementary education with its complex characteristics has called increasingly for better trained teachers to guide the approximately 22,000,000 children in elementary schools of the nation." As a result of this office of Education conference, specific reports were worked out by committees in the conference. These reports attempt to an - swer three questions important to the improvement of elementary education in the United States: 1. What makes a good elementary school? 2. What is a desirable plan for the organization of a State department of education in relation to elementary education? 3. What types of services can the Office of Education provide for supervisors of elementary education in State de - partments? These reports represent preliminary thinking and are to be con - sidered as a stimulus to more intensive discussion, and the eventual formula - tion of comprehensive statements. In answer to the question, "What makes a good elementary school?", 'good' is a relative term which may need modification as applied to the one - room rural school, the town, city, and consolidated school, and within these situations to die various types of organization, to varying ability to pay school costs, to teachers and to communities with different backgrounds. </seg>

Preparation of the Eighth Grade Examinations The completion of the courses of study and passing satisfactorily die final eighth grade examinations under die direction of die county superinten - dent entitle the pupils to die privileges of the free high school law in Ne - braska. "Section 79-901, Nebraska School Laws, Free High School Education, High School Grade Defined, Course of Study, Rules of Admission.

            <seg id="p148">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT | "First. For die purposes of this article all grades above the eighth grade in any public school district of this state shall be deemed high school grades. The course of study for the first eight grades in common schools shall be composed of the following subjects: agriculture, bookkeeping, civics, drawing, arithmetic, English composition, geography, grammar, history, men - tal arithmetic, orthography, penmanship, physiology, reading. The State Superintendent with these subjects for a foundation shall lay out a feasible course of study adapted to rural school conditions keeping in view the good of a thorough education for die child in these branches rather than the completion of the course in a given number of years. Every pupil after taking die course of study may by applying to die county superintendent take examination in these subjects, such examination to be held at a time and place designated by the county superintendent and held^ by him or his assistant, and at no time shall be held by a teacher any of whose pupils are taking die examination. 1 he questions used in such examinations shall be furnished by the .State Superintendent and be die same in all counties each year. The county superintendent at the close of such examination shall after ascertaining that the name of the pupil is not written on any examination paper, record each set of papers by name and also by number, after which such papers shall be turned over to the examining board who shall consider die papers by number only. Said board shall be appointed by the county superin - tendent and shall consist of at least five competent examiners widi qualifica - tions at least equal to those required for a second grade county certificate. Each member of said examining board shall give careful consideration to die ; grading of each paper, expense of such grading to be paid out of die general fund of the county, and if such pupils shall have passed widi an average of seventy-five per cent in die subjects named in this • chapter, no subject less dian sixty per cent, die county superintendent shall issue a cer - tificate stating the pupil is entitled to free high school tuition, providing die ninth grade is not being taught in die district where pupil's parents or guard - ians reside.

Examinations have been conducted by the county superintendents on specified dates in January; April, and May. The suggested alternation plan in die rural schools enables pupils (who desire to have dieir tuition paid by die county) to have at least seven days in which to complete die required eighth grade examinations. An opportunity is given seventh grade pupils to complete their work and to take four examinations each year on die April and May examination dates. An opportunity has been offered eighth grade pupils to take five of die examinations on one day </seg>
            <seg id="p149">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION in January or February each year. Then the eighth grade pupils have not less than three additional days in April and May of their eighth year to complete their examinations. Pupils may retake examinations if necessary. All of the subjects are offered in the April and May examination. The purpose of the final eighth grade examinations is to determine the eligibility of pupils to receive free high school tuition from the county for high school instruction in public approved high schools. According to the law, all eighth grade pupils, public, private, parochial, town, city, or rural, re - gardless of the school they are attending, must pass these examinations in or - der to be entitled to privileges under die free high school law, namely, free high school tuition. The issuance of a high school admission certificate involves an expendi - ture of county funds that can only be justified by strictly complying with the provisions of the law (Section 79-901, Compiled Statutes). During the school year of 1936-37, 25,507 Nebraska boys and girls attended high school under this free high school tuition law (Section 79-901, Nebraska School Laws) . Contrast this number with the 984 non-resident high school students who attended school in 1900 and paid their own tuition. The State Elementary Course of Study is the basis for die preparation of examination questions. A conscientious effort is put forth in order that these examinations may be a fair and reasonable test of the pupil's ability to satisfactorily do high school work. These examinations conform with the standards of attainment for promotion as listed in the Elementary Course of Study. The examinations also help to diagnose deficiencies in die pupil's work and are helpful to die teachers in determining remedial measures. The number of eighth grade examinations may well be reduced to eight or ten without interfering with the subject matter to be mastered. A re - quirement could be made for each pupil to submit certain assignments from the Art Course of Study for die County Exhibit in place of the drawing examination that is required at this time. The arithmetic examination could well include the arithmetic, mental arithmetic, and bookkeeping. The English examination could include grammar and English Composition, now required. History and civics could be given as one examination. Geography and agri - culture could also be given as one examination. In addition to these exam - inations, physiology and hygiene, reading, writing, and spelling should be re - quired. A plan should be worked out whereby sevendi grade pupils should be permitted to answer certain questions in a few of the subjects which diey have completed in part. The qualifications of the examiners of eighth grade papers should be changed from qualifications equal to those required for second grade county certificate (which certificate is no longer issued) to qualifications equal to those required for a diird grade elementary certificate. </seg>

In accordance with Section 79-1202, Nebraska School Laws, a new edition of the Fire Prevention Manual was prepared by the Director of Rural and Elementary Education and distributed to all teachers in the rural and city schools of Nebraska. Nebraska schools have been recognized by the press and by a Michigan fire prevention publication as leading in the teaching of fire prevention in the nation. Relation of Alcohol and Narcotics to Health Taught Section 79-1409, Nebraska School Laws, provides that instruction shall be given in the public schools with reference to the evil effects of alcoholic drinks and narcotics upon the human system. Courses of Study on "Al - cohol and Other Narcotics and Their Relation to Health" have been issued by State Superintendent Taylor and have been in the hands of the teachers since 1929. Four thousand eight hundred fifty-five rural teachers have reported that they taught the relation of alcohol and other narcotics to health during the year 1937-38, as given in Table I. Hot Lunches The hot lunch enables the pupils to relish their noonday meals and causes better digestion, better health, and greater power and desire to study. We should like to pay a sincere tribute to the 2j227 rural teachers who are supervising the lunch period, preparing hot lunches during the winter months, or having the pupils bring food in Mason jars, to be warmed by being placed in hot water. The number of districts serving hot lunches in each county is shown in Table I. Rural Field Day Rural Field Day was observed in 1,432 districts during the school year 1937-38, as reported in Table I.

Reverence for State and National Constitutions was taught in 5,511 rural districts last year, as indicated in Table I. Junior Red Cross Pupils in 890 rural school districts participated in Junior Red Cross work during 1937-38, as shown in Table I. This organization has contributed to personal hygiene and community health. " 4-H Club work was carried on during die school year of 1937-38 in 1,139 rural districts of Nebraska, according to the reports received from county superintendents in Table I. Rural School Achievements Scholastic Activities Reading Demonstration Days Throughout the state, the slogan has been "Every child a better reader." In addition to developing a love and desire for reading, the state-wide read - ing program has consisted of three phases, viz.: first, the diagnostic or testing phase, according to die chart on pages 42-54, Elementary Course of Study; second, remedial instruction as provided in the Course of study; and third, die observance of Reading Demonstration Days. Today reading is recognized as a tool on which all schoolroom activities depend and is essential for in - telligent participation in all activities of modern life. Reading Demonstration Days were conducted last year by 1,065 rural school teachers, as given in Table II. The Reading Demonstration Days have brought about keener interest on the part of the parents, have inspired the children to do better work, and have given die teacher an opportunity to observe the reading in other schools. Rural School Libraries Enriched During the school year 1936-37, 3,029 rural districts purchased library books. As shown by Table II, diere were 3,195 districts which purchased library books during the year 1937-38. A survey of 28 counties revealed in 1930 that, out of 1,924 schools who reported, 1,363 districts listed tte library books in dieir respective counties. It was found that 490 reports did not list any library books, while reports from 71 </seg>
            <seg id="p154">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT districts stated definitely that there were no library books in their respective schools. On the library reports from 1,363 districts, 37,672 books were listed for an enollment of 25,545 pupils. This meant that each pupil in these 1,363 districts averaged 1.47 books. It will be conceded that this is decidedly inad - equate. This survey of the rural school library demonstrates the importance of the 1929 library law. This law provides for the enrichment and enlarge - ment of the school library. It provides that the school board of every district shall set aside the sum of five dollars per teacher for the library fund. Three thousand one hundred eighteen teachers report that pupils are doing home recreational reading, as indicated by Table II. Good English Club* In order to help every child to speak and write correctly, with clear-cut sentences and no misspelled words, standards of achievement in English have been set forth for each grade. Good English Clubs were sponsored by 1,788 rural school teachers last year, as reported in Table II. i Spelling Contest* were held in 2,086 rural school districts of Nebraska dur - ing the 1937-38 school year, according to the report received from county superintendents in Table II. Ciphering Contests wer e conducted in 863 districts last year, as shown in Table II, as an incentive for increasing interest in rapid calculation. Rural School Chorus We wish to express our sincere appreciation to county superintendents for the splendid results that are being secured in the rural school chorus. This work was conducted by 2,075 teachers during the 1937-38 school year, accord - ing to Table II. During the biennium, 8,250 rural boys and girls received the Nebraska rural school chorus certificate signed by the State Superintendent and were eligible to sing in the rural school chorus at the State Fair. These rural boys and girls had previously sung at the eighth grade promotion exer - cises and at the county rural school choruses. Fathers, mothers and teachers have been delighted to listen to the beautiful tone quality that has been devel - oped in the singing of the boys and girls by this method. A most appreciative and attentive audience greeted the two appearances of the rural school chorus on Tuesday, September 7, 1937, and Tuesday, September 6, 1938. This work is being promoted by this Division in order that the boys and girls of the rural school may share in the joys of self-expres - sion and appreciation that only good music can bring. Details in regard to the rural school chorus work are given in the Elementary Course of Study on pages 515-517 and in "Rural Education Moving Forward, Revised," on pages 100-101. </seg>
            <seg id="p155">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION School Exhibit! Reports received in this office indicate that counties throughout the state are complying with Section 79-2120, Nebraska School Laws, which provides that there shall be held, under the supervision and direction of the county superintendent and county board, an exhibit of school work done in each school district of each county during the school year. Four thousand seven hundred forty-eight teachers reported to this office that they prepared exhibit work during 1937-38. The school exhibit at the State Fair, held under the direction of the State Fair Board, was very creditable. For several years, the county superinten - dents have been using the county fairs as a means of acquainting the public with the progress of education. Achievement maps portraying the rural school achievements in the var - ious counties were exibited in the booth of the State Department of Public Instruction at the State Fair. Pictures of part of these maps are included in this report. The interest shown by Fair visitors insures the continuance of this booth each year. Rural School Achievement* — School and Home Patrons' Days In order that patrons may know the school and understand the problems, needs, objectives, and achievements of the school, Patrons' Day is quite gen - erally observed in the rural schools. Three thousand one hundred thirteen teachers reported observance of Patrons' Day during 1937-38, as shown by Table II. School officers and all patrons were urged to visit their respective schools on Patrons' Day for the purpose of hearing pupils in their everyday recitations. Parent-Teacher Associations The rural people of the various communities are glad and willing, in the great majority of cases, to improve their schools as far as economic factors make it reasonably possible for them to do so. Therefore, encouragement has been given to the forming of Parent-Teacher Associations, community centers, and kindred organizations that are interested in the home and school. Dis - cussion material for these organizations has been prepared by the Director of Rural and Elementary Education for the purpose of bringing about a better understanding of the problems and needs of the child by patrons and teachers organized for the purpose of child development. This material has been in - cluded in school and home cooperative units in "Rural Education Moving Forward, Revised." Among the discussion topics are: safety, fire prevention, reading, how the home may cooperate in the formation of better study habits, development in play, music in the rural schools, thrift and child development, scientific </seg>
            <seg id="p156">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT temperance instruction, citizenship ideals taught in the home and school, stan - dards for rural schools, dignity and necessity of common labor, honesty is the only policy, respect for parents and the home, and health. The Parent- Teacher Association is one of the most important agencies for interpreting to the school patrons the aims and needs of the schools. Encouragement and support of progressive school policies may be counted on from parents who take interest in the schools their children attend and who participate actively in the work of the Parent-Teacher Association. It is not enough that teachers be concerned with educational results. The legislator, the teacher, the parents, and other taxpayers must work together for a unified, balanced educational program. In order for this to be done, all groups should be in full possession of facts in regard to the schools. Leg - islators are earnestly desirous of doing the thing that will do the greatest good for the greatest number. One thousand two hundred seventy-five districts participated in Parent- Teacher and similar community organizations last year, as given in Table II. This Division has assisted in the promoting of community recreation, including school affairs, harvest festivals, county-wide pageants, and edu - cational parades. Seven hundred sixty-three districts participated during the biennium in educational pageants or parades. The themes of several of the pageants or parades are: "Pioneer Days," "March of the Nations," "Pro - cession of States," Health Parade," Spirit of Progress," "Carnival of the Holidays," and "Nebraska History." County School Officers' Meetings ' A county school board association is one of the very best agencies for developing an active interest in the improvement of school conditions throughout the country and for inspiring a more united and cooperative program of work. Since the improvement of a school is so dependent on the school board and community, this Division is interested in school officers' meetings being held in order that school officers may become better informed as to the needs of the school, educational progress and policies, plans for modern school buildings, and financing of schools. Some states require county school officers' meetings. The following counties held county school officers' meetings during the biennium: Adams, Box Butte, Boyd, Butler, Custer, Dawson, Dodge, Douglas, Hooker, Howard, Keith, Kimball, Lincoln, Merrick, Morrill, Otoe, Pierce; Polk, Red Willow, Saunders, Sheridan, Sherman, and Thayer. </seg>
            <seg id="p157">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Standard and Superior Rural Schools For every child, a school that is sanitary, well lighted,, well ventilated, and provided widi good healthful equipment! Vision, courage, and coopera - tion on the part of all are needed in order that all rural schools may be&gt; supplied with equipment for the protection of the health of the pupils. Sound health is the first of the cardinal objectives of education. Through our compulsory education laws, die state claims every child as a future citizen. Therefore, every child has a claim against die state; namely, die opportunity to become a healthy, happy, efficient citizen. Children are entitled to attend school in a well-lighted, well-ventilated, and comfortable school building. They should have good, comfortable seats and desks placed the correct distance apart. The seating arrangements in a schoolroom should provide for die best lighting possible. Detailed information in regard to seating is given on pages 127 and 128 of "Rural Education Moving Forward, Revised". The direction of die light for each child should be considered. The im - portance of proper light cannot be overestimated. The number of school children who suffer from defective eyesight is appalling. Two dungs are well established with reference to lighting the schoolroom; first, die window area should be equivalent to one-fifdi of die floor area in our section of die United States, and second, die light should come from die left and rear of die pupils after they are seated. This arrangement prevents die shadow of pen or hand from falling on die paper as the pupil writes. Let us not forget, however, that the left-handed child is entided to have die light come over die right shoulder in order to prevent shadow. i Light from bodi right and left has a tendency to irritate die eyes. At no time should children be seated facing die windows. The lighting should be carefully studied when tables are used in primary rooms', and facing die light should be avoided. Suggestions for heating units are given on pages 124 and 125, "Rural Education Moving Forward, Revised." The difference between success and failure is sometimes die difference between good healdi and poor healdi, between good vision and defective eye - sight, between good hearing and poor hearing. Many more do not realize die importance of good drinking water and a sanitary method of supplying it. In order to safeguard die healdi of pupils and teachers, the school must be supplied with plenty of pure, clean water. There should be a good well on die school grounds for supplying pure water, and a bubbling drinking fountain. </seg>
            <seg id="p158">&lt; REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Number of Standard Rural Schools in Nebraska 1916 __ 35 1930 ■ 674 1920 ; 65 1932 ; 757 1922 301 1934 802 1926 384 1936 _ 824 1928 584 1938 826 There are 826 standard schools and 18 superior schools in Nebraska. For detailed information in regard to standard and superior schools refer to pages 108-147 in "Rural Education Moving Forward, Revised." Home Recreational Reading by pupils has been reported by 3,127 rural districts of Nebraska during the last school year. The action of the Legislature in providing for a library fund has brought good results. Arbor Day was observed in 2,591 districts in Nebraska, according to die reports submitted by county superintendents for 1937-38. Storm Caves had been constructed in 1332 districts in Nebraska in 1936. Musical Instruments were found in 4,017 districts of Nebraska during the school year 1936-37. "Nebraska territory was organized in 1854 with a population of 2,732 per - sons. Because of the fact that white migrants had not been allowed to settle in the 'Indian Country' the entire 2,732 recorded were living in counties or - ganized along the Missouri River. Settlement in Nebraska the next six years was rapid, so by 1860 — 28,841 persons had become citizens of the territory. The decade 1860-1870 shows an increase of 326.5 per cent. This, of course, was largely due to the small population in 1860. This period saw the war between the states fought and finished, the Homestead Act providing free land in the Wiest enacted, the Union Pacific Railroad pushed across Nebraska and the admission of Nebraska into the Union as a state. The greatest actual increase in population was between 1880 and 1890, the next greatest was between 1870 and 1880. During this twenty year period, railroads and industries made rapid expansion, 1 and agriculture, due to heavier rainfall and unlimited markets, was increasing by leaps and bounds. The West radi - ated confidence, the boom days had arrived. Then came the 1890's, years of droughts and hardship. A National depression stopped expansion and as a result 1900 found Nebraska with only 1,066,300 people, 3,644 more than in 1890, an increase of 0.3 per cent. ■ "The growth over the next thirty years was slow. 1910 showed an increase of 11.8 per cent over 1900, 1920's acceleration upward slowed to 8.7 per cent over 1910, and by 1930 the poulation was 1,377,963, a 6.3 per cent increase over 1920."— from Nebraska's Population, Nebraska State Planning Board, pages 2, 3, 4. </seg>

            <seg id="p165">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Program for Education of Crippled Children In its program for crippled children, the State Child Welfare Bureau has found it necessary to move children from their homes to places where special treatment is provided. The location of the Orthopedic Hospital in the Capital city has resulted in the transfer of a proportionately large num - ber of cases to Lincoln. Actual count has shown that as many as twenty (20) handicapped chil - dren from out in the , state have attended the Lincoln Public Schools in a given period. The Board of Education in Lincoln requested the State Sup - erintendent of Public Instruction to issue a ruling upon tuition claims for the education of these children. Interest of District and Children Involved The school law on the subject plainly limits school privileges .to the dis - trict of residence. To issue a ruling on this basis would not only remove the handicapped children from the schools in Lincoln, it would have the same effect on all children maintained away from their homes, under similar cir - cumstances. On the other hand, to rule that these children are entided to school privileges in Lincoln without tuition would be unfair to the Lincoln School District and all other districts where handicapped children are quar - tered. When Mr. H. J. Becker, Director of the Child Wjelfare Bureau, ap - pealed to the Attorney General for his interpretation of the problem, his de - partment ruled that the Lincoln District could not be compelled ,to admit the children without payment of tuition, but that the : district could furnish school privileges without charges if the Board of Education approved. Program Is Cooperative After very careful study of all phases of the problem, it was apparent that a decision must either bear unfavorable consequences to the handicapped children or result in imposition upon the school districts of the state Con - sequently, the State Superintendent withheld his ruling and adopted a coop - erative program wherein the State Department has worked with representa - tives of the Child Welfare Bureau, the Crippled Children's Society and a Consultant from the University on a law to safeguard the interests of all concerned. A draft of this law has already been prepared and is under con - sideration at this time. This procedure insures a happy and satisfactory solution to an exceedingly difficult problem for many unfortunate children and communities of Nebraska. </seg>

Bowers, Assistant Director V CONTENTS — Introduction— Recent Trends in Secondary Education — Comparative Statistics of Nebraska High Schools — High School Inspection and Accreditment — North Central Association— Approved Schools — Prospects and Retrospect — High School Normal Training. Introduction The responsibilities of the Division of Secondary Education are: (a) the inspection of high schools for the purpose of recommending accred - itment by the University of Nebraska and of approval by the State Depart - ment of Public Instruction, (b) the rendering of all possible assistance in the solution of the problems of these schools and (c) the direction of the high school normal training program in accordance with the laws and the regulations pertaining thereto as set up by the State Department. In this work we have the co-operation of the University of Nebraska, the county superintendents and all divisions of the State Department of Public Instruc - tion. Observations of the work done in the high schools of the state lead to the conclusion that the teachers and administrators are, on the whole, pro - gressive and eager to serve their communities in accordance widi best educa - tional practice. They are constantly attending summer school sessions, con - ventions and conferences in spite of the reduced salaries of recent years. They are hampered, however, by two circumstances. In the first place, in - adequate financial support imposes burdens of too many and too large classes with the result that teachers do not have enough time for adequate preparation or for the necessary guidance of individual pupils. In the second place, there is a great need in every community for an evaluation of the work the school is doing and a careful study of tke» needs of the com - munity in which the school is operating. . \ Scientific evaluation of all phases of the work of a &gt;school is now being made more certain as a result of the Co-operative Study of Secondary School Standards recently worked out by the six regional accrediting agencies in co-operation with the American Council on Education. The committee in charge of the Study has practically completed its survey and is now engaged in the interpretation of its findings and methods to the secondary schools of the country and to the general public. Conferences and demonstrations of evalution procedures are being held in sample schools. It is hoped that offi- </seg>
            <seg id="p167">Ob PUBLIC INSTRUCTION oal representatives of the committee may come to Nebraska to hold con - ferences with secondary school leaders and that as a result of these confer - ences, we can work out a state-wide program for the more effective evaluation or our schools and a stimulation of these schools to develop better programs for the high school youth. 6 Recent Trends in Secondary Education Anyone who attempts to keep up with the developments in secondary education, knows of the many experiments that are being conducted and of the vast amount of time"and money that has been and is still being spent in educational research. As Dr. Geo. Zook, President of the American Council on Education, said in his last annual report, "It is possible that future educational historians will characterize our generation of pedagogues as disciples of tests, measurements, and evaluation." Secondary Education, Universal Out of it all there seem to be appearing a few fairly distinct trends In the first place, there is a growing interest in promoting the ideal of free universal secondary education. There are still more than three million eligible students not enrolled in institutions of secondary education. Many of these are not financially able to attend schools, even if the schools offered the kind of training they need. But there are no jobs for these youth and it is going to be necessary to take care of them in school or else in some other agency such as the Civilian Conservation Corps. The trend is toward a policy of adequate general education for all. The ever-present threat to our democratic institutions from totalitarian governments will no doubt help to hasten our progress toward this ideal. Secondary School Curriculum Under Revision In the second place, curricular changes toward the realization of a more adequate school program are under way. A committee of the North Central Association on the Subject Matter Preparation of High School Teachers, under the chairmanship of Dean F. E. Henzlik of the University of Nebras - ka, found the following six curriculum trends in the high schools of the United States: 1. The trend toward a more explicit social functionalism. 2. The trend toward a more socially comprehensive curriculum. 3. The trend toward individualization and the assertion of pupil inter - est and need as fundamental curriculum criteria. 4. The trend toward subject and content integration. </seg>
            <seg id="p168">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 5. The trend toward greater emphasis on the higher mental powers. 6. The trend toward activism. In the third place, greater continuity of educational experience has al - ready been achieved through a better articulation of elementary and sec - ondary education. In fact, the barriers and levels between these two levels are fast disappearing. Such phrases as "child centered," "life centered," "functional," "education for the common life," and others of similar meaning are on the lips of educators today and show the direction in which we are going. Ef - fort is made, perhaps rather * slowly and blunderingly, as is the way of democracy, to find the best way to deal with the six million, seven hundred thousand pupils who crowd our secondary schools today. School authorities are confronted with the task of developing an educational experience suited to the needs of a cosmopolitan student body. "As a result, courses of study are gradually developing into something substantially different in subject matter and approach from anything hitherto existing — called, quite properly general education."* Perhaps the two most important questions facing educators today are: first, what shall be the nature of general education and, second, what special education should be given to prepare pupils for their further education or occupations? The subject of general education is now receiving a great deal of at - tention. Experiments on the junior college level are under way in the uni - versities of Chicago, Minnesota and Florida, in Pasadena Junior College, in Antioch and Swarthmore colleges and in a number of institutions in Ohio. Kentucky, Missouri and Michigan, in an attempt to work out the problems of general education. The North Central Association, American Council on Education, Progressive Education Association, Educational Policies Com - mission of die National Education Association and many other agencies are studying die problems of general education on both the high school and junior college levels. The question as to what and how much special training the schools should give to prepare pupils for their future education or occupations is an old one, but still far from being settled. The interests of those who in - tend to go to college have always been stressed, but until quite recendy the other group received scanty consideration. Even today, financial consider - ations prevent the adding of many vocational courses in the smaller high schools. However, the adding of vocational courses is not the on!v way and perhaps not always die best way in which to improve our curricula. •Dr. Geo. Zook, President of the American Council on Education </seg>
            <seg id="p169">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Youth Problem Receives Consideration Dr. Homer P. Rainey and Dr. Harl R. Douglass, who have made care - full and sympathetic studies of American youth in their work with the American Youth Commission, agree that the solution of the youth problem does not lie in the direction of overburdening the curriculum with tech - nical or specific vocational courses. For the large majority of occupations, you cannot give specific technical training. Most occupations can be learned on the job much better than the school can teach them in a comparatively short period of time. Dr. Rainey, after giving the results of many inves - tigations, concludes that practically the entire secondary school period can be relieved of the responsibility for vocational education of a specific sort and is thus freed for a program of more general secondary education. He calls it "education for the common life." It is his idea that this should be "an education that would acquaint all of us with the essential factors of our national life, interpret to us our national ideals, make us intimately famil - iar with our literature, develop within us a love for and an appreciation of good music and encourage wide participation in arts and crafts. It should place i new emphasis upon poetry and religion. It should also place a great deal of emphasis upon a mastery of contemporary problems," or as it is sometimes called, "education for democracy." In fact, this last is no doubt the most important responsibility of secondary education. Dr. Harl R. Douglass never ceases to plead for part-time schools in which the youth's timq will be equally divided between school and a job. In this way, he would not graduate from high school until he was nineteen or twenty years of age. Dr. Douglass would have every youth attend school the equivalent of at least four hours a day the year around until he has com - pleted the equivalent of a high school education, and until he has accepted a full-time job. The money he would earn, even though not a large sum. would mean that he could take his place socially among his fellows. There are in operation almost two hundred such "co-operative" schools- in nearly every state, in cities of every size above three thousand population, but of course this is just a small beginning. Dr. Douglass feels that "if school administrators had the vision of real estate development promoters and the drive of auto salesmen, it would be in the bag nationally in eight or ten years." He advises further that if the federal government wants to do some - thing for vocational education, instead of appropriating more money for full-time vocational education than we can find ways of spending honestly, it should set aside twenty-five million or thirty million dollars annually for the promotion and supervision of part-time schools, furnishing the salaries of men and women who are charged with the responsibility of developing and supervising part-time arrangements. In the rural areas, seasonal attendance </seg>
            <seg id="p170">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT for six months annually could be arranged. For older youth and for young men and women, an American version of the Danish Folk High School would admirably meet the needs of millions of youth. The Junior Colleges Face Problem of Adaptation Dr. Clyde M. Hill of the College of Education of Yale University, has a plan for junior colleges which would seem to be along the line of Dr. Douglass's idea. Dr. Hill combines in his plan vocational education and social security such as is being offered by the Federal Government to a certain extent in the C. C. C. and N. Y. A. He calls it "Social Security in Education." The suggestion is that the government (federal and state) offer to young people a project in educational social security— a project which offers the opportunity to continue education beyond the high school, while at the same time supporting themselves in the institution which affords them the opportunity. His plan also contemplates vocational placement of all students after they have finished the course in the school. At first glance this seems to be a very ambitious program, but Dr. Hill is not the only; educator who feels that we cannot continue to turn young people out of high school or even junior college and pay no further attention to them. We have almost attained co-ordination between the elementary schools and the high schools. It remains to secure co-ordination between the high school and college for some, and between the high school and a job for others. Dr. Hill and other leading educators feel that too many junior colleges are merely weak imitations of the first two years of the senior college and university. "Public junior colleges, no matter where located, can never justify their existence until they recognize that not only must the vocational education they offer be of satisfying personal value and genuine social sig - nificance, but also their entire influence must be exerted in the direction of liberalizing the thinking and liberating the talents of hordes of our young people who will forever be denied the opportunity of brooding under the benefident wings of our great universities." The Advisory Committee on Education appointed by the President of the United States for the purpose of making a study of the experience under the exiting program of Federal Aid for vocational education has made recommendations which coincide with the ideas of Dr. Rainey, Dr. Douglass Dr. Hill and others. They found that "through the extension of education - al opportunities to the underprivileged, the Youth Administration has un - covered a reservoir of competent youth desirous of continued education for whom no provision has been made in the past. It has demonstrated the possi - bdity of providing educational opportunities at small cost which have proved of considerable advantage to the youth and to the institutions involved Experimentation which grew out of the necessity for combining work with </seg>
            <seg id="p171">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION schooling has demonstrated possibilities of profound educational significance. Especially noteworthy are those work projects, sponsored by educational in - stitutions, in which youth are maintained in residence at the institutions and undergo a course of training related to their employment on work of bene - fit to the institutions themselves. To the point that the National Youth Administration has been successful in thus mmKini^g work and schooling the more pointedly by contrast does it emphasize the inadequacies of the conventional current curriculum and guidance policies at both high school and college levels." Guidance Essential in Secondary Schools Space does not permit a discussion of guidance which is rnming to be recognized more and more as an essential part of a functional school program. There is a technique of guidance, in fact there are many different techniques, but guidance is more than a technique — it is a philosophy. And this phil - osophy must underlie the whole program of the secondary school: admin - istrative, financial, teacher-training and curriculum-making. At present, die attitude of too many school officers and teachers is either that of active opposition or at least indifference, based on lack of understanding. Un - less all, or at least a majority of die teachers in a school, are actively sympa - thetic, the work of the best trained and most efficient guidance counselor will be largely ineffective. After several decades of guidance by guidance officers, it has become clear that guidance cannot bo really effective until it is integrated widi die regular school routine. The immediate need, dien, is to discover some effective way of re-orienting teachers in service. And in die teacher-training institutions guidance should be die corner stone of die professional education of teachers, not merely a finical specialty studied by only a few. Co-operative Study of Secondary School Standards Under Way Two projects of our great educational organizations deserve special men - tion. The Co-operative Study of Secondary School Standards was initiated by die North Central Association, but was carried on co-operatively by die ix regional accrediting agencies and die American Council on Education. Two years ago, die committee on die Co-operative Study was engaged in die evaluation of two hundred high schools in all parts of die United States. Since diat time the committee has analyzed and arranged its data and its conclusions are now available in three publications: die manual, How to Evaluate a Secondary School, die Evaluative Criteria, and die Educational Temperatures. This study has been carefully made and has aroused a great deal of favorable comment. The demand for dieir manual, "How to Evaluate a Secondary School" and die "Educational Temperatures" has </seg>
            <seg id="p172">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT been so great that the first edition was practically exhausted by November 1, less than three weeks after its publication. Orders have come from even) state in the Union. The committee is now engaged in the final phase of its work; that of getting it before the public. In pursuance of this purpose they are making addresses, writing articles for educational publications and holding interviews and conferences with educators, in various parts of the nation. Teacher-Training The other project is a five year study of teacher education recently undertaken by the American Council on Education. The Council received a special appropriation from the General Education Board with which to carry forward this study and Dr. Karl W. Bigelow, formerly of Teachers College, Columbia University, has been chosen as director. The Council has never undertaken any activity in which there seems to be more widespread interest than there is in this project. Many educational associations and institutions of all types have expressed their willingness to cooperate with the Council in improving the character and quality of teacher education. The first step taken by the Council was to survey all the educational institutions and organizations which are studying problems in this field. After this information has been collected it is hoped that the work of conducting the study may be divided among several organizations in such a way as to avoid needless duplication of effort and also cover the field more completely. The study to be completed by January 1, 1943. ■ Research Contributions Show Need of Evaluation There is beginning to be a demand upon the part of educators that the great amount of research which has been done within the past twenty years shall bear fruit in some specific recommendations. Of course it is realized that in a democracy not only teachers but boards of education and even the general public must be convinced of the desirability of a change before it can be put into effective operation. Dr. Zook, in his annual report of the work of the American Council, made a comparison with the United States Department of Agriculture. For years, through experiment stations in every state in die Union, a great mass of information for farmers was steadily built up. But die information was of litde use because the farmers did not know of it. Then someone conceived the idea of the Extension Division and, as a result, agricultural practice has been revolutionized within twenty-four years. Education is just where agriculture was twenty-four years ago. The findings of educational research must be made clear, both to educators and to general public, not only by reports, articles, and conferences, but by ex - ample and demonstration. Dr. Briggs, in an address entitled "An Un- </seg>
            <seg id="p173">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION cultivated Field," delivered before the North Central Association in April, 1937, made a comparison, not with agriculture, but with industry. He said! Industry uses a development engineer which education needs to use too " 1 he responsibility of the development engineer is to take what the theo - rist has found or what works in the laboratory and make is work on a large scale in the factory. We will not cease to carry on research. That will be continuous. But the need now is that some competent agency should evaluate and interpret the many research studies that have been made and that gifted people be broadly and intensively trained to be "development en - gineers in education. Three years ago, Dr. Briggs proposed that there should be an evaluation and popular interpretation of all published studies in educa - tion. This would require a large sum of money and also the continuous ser - vices of the best research workers in education directed by a single agency It has not been done so far, but a step was taken in that direction when, representatives of our leading educational organizations met in Atlantic Gty fast February for a preliminary consideration of the problem. Another hope - ful indication of better co-ordination is the Joint Educational Conference held annually in October in New York City. In 1937, over a thousand school people from thirty-two states attended the sixth conference, an increase of forty per cent over the registration of the preceeding year. Comparative Statistics of Nebraska High Schools 1936-37 1937-38 Total public high school enrollment in accredited and non-accredited high schools.™ 80 552 79 538 Enrollment in accredited public high schools. 77595 77 028 Number of accredited public high schools™ '515 520 Number of teachers in accredited public high schools 3 523 3 563 Number of graduates from accredited public high schools 15,426 16^193 As will .be seen from the above table, the number of graduates from ac - credited public high schools in Nebraska increased from 15,426 in 1936-37 to 16,193 in 1937-38, a gain of approximately 5 per cent The previous year showed a gain of more than 6 per cent. There has been an increase of eight in the number of accredited high schools during the biennium and a very small increase in the number of teachers employed in accredited high schools In spite of the increase in the number of accredited high schools, the enroll - ment decreased from 77,589 in 1935-36 to 77,028 in 1937-38, or a decrease L?" Ca ? , bicnnium - The P«ak enrollment was in 1936-37 when 77,695 pupils attended Nebraska's accredited high schools. The same trend in enrollment is evident in the approved high schools. This reduction in en - rollment is probably due to the fact that many families have moved out of the state and that others are financially unable to send their children to high school. </seg>

            <seg id="p175">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Organization of High Schools The great majority of Nebraska high schools are still operated under the 8-4 plan, a very few use the 6-2-4 plan, twenty-one the 6-3-3 plan, and fifty the 6-6 plan. One school has changed over to the 6-3-3 plan during the biennium but the 6-6 plan has grown the most rapidly, ten schools having adopted this form, of organization during the biennium. The change from the 8-4 to the 6-6 plan enables a school to offer a broader program oi studies, more vocational work and more extra-curricular activities. Only two school systems, those of Scottsbluff and McCook operate junior colleges. The enrollments in both are good. The junior college at McCook now has an enrollment of 140 students and is housed in a new building donated by a citizen of McCook. A course in commercial arts has been added to the curriculum of this school during the biennium. Vocational Courses Ninety-five high schools are offering Smith-Hughes agriculture, while there are approximately twenty-five schools, other than Smidi-Hughes schools, offering one year in agriculture. Many other schools offer one semester. All the normal training high schools are required to offer at least one semes - ter of agriculture. Eighty-two high schools in the state offer Smith-Hughes home eco - nomics courses, while many other schools which do not quite qualify for Smith-Hughes assistance offer one year of home economics. Many schools offer one semester of either sewing or cooking, or offer sewing one year and cooking the next. One hundred seventy-eight schools are offering manual training courses of some kind. Approximately fifty offer one year while about thirty offer two years or more of this type of work. Several of the small high schools offer it least one semester in manual training. This number has been increased in the last two years. There are, at the present time, four hundred diirty-five high schools offering typewriting. The majority of these high schools give but one year of typewriting, although many of the larger high schools give from one and one-half to two years. Typewriting is growing very rapidly probably be - cause die schools feel that the students who take this work will have occasion to make use of it in after life. Two hundred diirty-eight high schools offer either one or two years of shorthand. There may be some question concerning die desirability of offering this amount of work in diis field. A survey of a typical large dty school showed that, of diree hundred fifty pupils who took shorthand only eighty-eight secured positions calling for the use of shorthand without further </seg>
            <seg id="p176">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT training. On the other hand, five hundred twenty-two or ten per cent of the high school graduates of one class became clerks or salespeople in stores — and yet only twenty of these took courses in retail selling. It would be abvisablo for a school to make a survey of the graduates of its commer - cial course and find out how many have made any use of dieir shorthand. Bookkeeping is taught in three hundred sixty-six schools in the state. Several of our larger high schools have well-developed courses in bookkeeping. There would seem to be litde argument concerning the value of a practical bookkeeping course. All normal training high schools are required by regu - lation to offer bookkeeping. Year by year, music is assuming a more important place in our high schools. In fact, no other subject seems to be making as rapid a growth as music. There is no doubt that our district and state contests have hao! much to do with the increased popularity of this valuable subject. The radio may have played its important part. Four hundred high schools are offering some phase of music work. Some are offering well-organized courses, while others offer it as an extra-curricular activity but give credit for the work done. Health and Safety Education A new bulletin on physical education has just been distributed to the schools. This bulletin has been favorably received and will no doubt furnish an impetus for die development of the physical education courses in many schools. This course is designed to be used from the first grade through the high school. A healdi education program should be stressed in every high school which finds it possible to give such a course. Several high schools in the state hold health and dental clinics each year, which accomplish much for the health of die boys and girls of dieir communities. Two years ago, a new course in safety education was distributed among the schools of Nebraska. Many schools have found this helpful and some have also made an effort to gather other materials useful in die development of dieir safety program. The American Legion has been very active in supporting diis program and many pdier agencies have done likewise. Sta - tistics would seem to prove that the work that has been done has already borne fruit in a lowered accident rate. Number of Master's Degrees Increasing It is interesting to study die applications for accreditment which are sent into this office each year, and to note die increasing number of superin - tendents, principals and teachers who have earned their master's degree. It is a healthy sign diat die number is increasing year by year. It will not be long 'until the great majority of our high schools will be able to hire teachers widi master's degrees. </seg>
            <seg id="p177">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Lengthened Recitation Period It is encouraging to note the number of schools that are increasing the recitation period from forty to sixty minutes. Two years ago, about ten per cent of the high schools were operating on this basis but today the number has increased to about eighteen per cent and several have expressed their desire to go upon the one-hour basis during the coming year. Supervised Correspondence Courses u- L A u al F number of fuUv accredited, minor accredited and approved high schools are taking advantage of the opportunity offered to them in the supervised correspondence courses of the University of Nebraska, and are thus able to extend the number of their subject offerings. The number of high schools that have taken advantage of these courses is as follows: 1936-37 1937-38 Approved schools (2 Yr.) 8 7 Approved schools (3 Yr.) 1 0 Approved schools (4 Yr.) 3 3 Minor accredited schools 19 15 Fully accredited schools 155 162 Total 185 jg7 The total number of registrations for the past four years has been as follows: 1934-35 1935-36 1936-37 1937-38 836 1244 1331 1610 The steady growth shown by these figures is evidence of the fact that the schools are finding these courses worthwhile. This method of enriching the curriculum and meeting the varied needs of individual pupils is especially helpful to the small high school. In all, one hundred thirty courses are of - fered by the Extension Division, thus affording a wide choice of subjects. Guidance Educational and vocational guidance, which until recendy was confined to a few large high schools in Nebraska, is beginning to make progress in' our smaller high schools. The University of Nebraska and one of our state teachers colleges have recendy added a course in guidance to their curricula, this course being offered both in summer and regular sessions. A similar course may also be taken by extension from the University of Nebraska. The Educational Conference, held each summer by the University, had guidance as its theme during its 1937 session.

Hi»h School Inspection and Accreditment </seg>
            <seg id="p179">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION The University has set up certain standards of accreditment for the high school inspector to use in determining the evaluation of the schools vis - ited as well as serving as a guide to school authorities in planning the or - ganization of their curricula. The standards as given in the University Ex - tension News Bulletin of May 25, 1938, are: "The University of Nebraska maintains a list of accredited schools, the graduates of which are admitted to the University (and to nearly all of the colleges and universities of the United States) without entrance examinations in subjects that are properly certified as completed within these schools. Unless a graduate of an accredited school, a candidate for admission must be prepared to take examination in those subjects in which entrance credits are desired; provided that graduates of non-accredited four-year high schools may be excused from taking the academic examination by passing an intelligence test with a standing that shows ability to dithe work of a college freshman. 'Accredited' schools are such as are found to meet the 'standards of Ac - credited Schools' to a degree that meets the approval of the University Com - mittee on Accredited Schools.

            <seg id="p187">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION North Central Association Another accrediting agency heretofore and at present recognized in Nebraska, as in twenty other North Central states in contiguous territory, is the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. The object of this association is that of establishing closer relationship between the secondary schools and the institutions of higher learning widiin the group of states in the North Central area as well as between other areas of the United States. Membership in this organization is entirely optional and voluntary. It is a mutual society, the Constitution of which provides that all decisions of the association bearing on die policy and management of secondary schools and institutions of higher education are understood to be purely advisory in character. In order to realize die above objectives, several odier immedi - ate aims have been set up, among diese being the following: First to bring about a better arquaintance, a keener sympathy and heartier spirit of co - operation among die leaders of die secondary schools and colleges by enabling diem to meet at personal conferences at least once a year; second, to encour - ™age the free discussion of common educational problems and to devise ways and means of solving diese problems through the exchange of views at con - ferences and through published reports; and, third, to promote the physical, intellectual and moral well-being of students in secondary schools and colleges by calling attention to the need for proper sanitary conditions in school buildings, adequate library and laboratory facilities, defensible curriculum organizations, high standards of scholarship and professional achievement among teachers, scientific practices among administrators and, finally, to suggest better ways in which adequate financial support may be given to die carrying on die necessary programs of secondary education. As indicated, membership is purely voluntary. There is and can be no compulsion. Any school choosing to become a member of die Association may make application therefor and shall be visited by the proper officials authorized to make such visitations and, having been found to meet die desirable standards or qualifications as set up, will be recognized for approval. The significance of diis plan of regional accreditation lies in die fact diat die graduates of such institutions as are accredited to the Association are admitted to practically every higher institution of learning in die United States. Neither does diis Association seek to control die schools when accredited eidier as regards dieir course of study, dieir curriculum, dieir plan of organization for administration and supervision, the personnel of dieir faculty, or any odier of a number of factors generally considered in accreditment relations. This Association has approved die application of 137 public high schools and 14 private high schools in Nebraska. Schools so accredited are indicated on preceding pages and are designated by a dagger placed to die left of die name of each school. </seg>
            <seg id="p188">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Approved School* Another function of high school inspection by the State Superintend - ent of Public Instruction is that of approval of high schools. This is the sole responsibility of this office and deals with the determining of which schools shall be designated to receive free high school tuition students and be exempted from payment of high school tuition tax. The purpose of approval is separate and distinct from that of accredit - ment, the former having to do with the relationship of the school to the Department of Public Instruction and the latter with the relationship of the school to the University of Nebraska. There is, more or less, an overlapping of organization. The purpose of approval has been aptly stated in the bul - letin issued by the State Department of Public Instruction entitled "Approv - ed Rural and Village High Schools": "It is, of course, a recognized fact that many of the smaller schools of the state find it impossible for various reasons, economic and otherwise, to meet the standards of accreditment as set up by the authorities at the Uni - versity of Nebraska. Many of these schools cannot maintain more than a nine grade or a ten grade program. Fewer still can attempt an eleven or twelve grade program which is of such a nature as to justify full accredit - ment by University authorities. These schools naturally must look to the State Department of Public Instruction, therefore, for guidance and direc - tion in the establishment of their high school instructional work. In justice to die children living in such communities, the State Department of Public Instruction has set certain standards of attainment which may be reasonably met and which may induce greater educational progress. "All students completing work in such approved schools will be ad - mitted to accredited high schools without necessarily having to meet any examination requirements which may or may not be set by the authorities in the accredited schools in compliance with the suggestion of the University authorities as contained in their statement of standards. "It is the purpose of this Department, therefore, to establish certain standards for the approval of schools giving high school courses in order that a more complete system of education may be developed. Through such standards as these, the work of approved schools may be made to harmonize more completely with die courses in higher institutions of learning, thus af - fording die ambitious child an open door to more efficient preparation for life. "All schools approved by the State Department of Public Instruc - tion are privileged to collect free high school tuition as provided for in the Jaw, paticularly Sections 79-901 to 79-905, inclusive. Schools privileged to icollect free high school tuition are also exempt from die payment of die high school tax levy." </seg>
            <seg id="p189">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Among the provisions set up for approval is that relative to the number and qualifications of teachers to be employed. The following statement is also quoted from the bulletin "Approved Rural and Village High Schools": Nine Grade Schools — The teacher may teach the seventh and eighth grades when combined in one class, in addition to teaching the ninth grade. Ten Grade Schools — (a) The ninth and tenth grades may be com - bined in one class if the enrollment is small and, in addition, the teacher may teach the seventh and eighth grade work combined if the alternation plan is followed. See Elementary Course of Study plan, (b) At least one teacher should devote entire time to die ninth and tenth grades, if not com bined. (c) If die seventh and eighdi are not combined, only one of these grades may be taught in addition to the ninth and tendi grade work when combined, (d) Not less than Nebraska Initial Senior Grade School Cer - tificates are accepted. Eleven Grade Schools — (a) Two teachers should be secured for die teaching of die high school subjects and may teach, in addition to die high school work, two of the elementary grades when combined in one class, (b) Eleventh grade work cannot be approved if only one teacher teaches in the high school. Twelve Grade Schools — (a) At least two teachers should devote their entire time to high school work, (b) The ninth and tenth grade classes and die eleventh and twelfth grade classes should be combined in at least one - half of die work when not more than two teachers are employed, (c) For eleven and twelve grade schools, not less than Nebraska Initial Secondary School Certificates are accepted. Minnimum Requirement — A teacher in an approved two-year non-ac - credited high school shall hold not less than a Nebraska Initial Senior Grade School Certificate. Teachers in three-year or four-year non-accredited high schools shall hold not less than die Nebraska Initial Secondary School Cer - tificate.* Teachers who teach Latin should have at least six semester hours of college credit in Latin in addition to credit for two years of high school Latin. Three years credit in high school Latin may be accepted but is not advised. See note on Latin under suggested program. Departmental Recommendation — The minimum preparation for teach - ers in the approved non-accredited high schools has been stated. However, in schools offering elventh or twelfth grade work the Department very strongly recommends die following: • Regulations applicable to certificates in force prior to September 1, 1938, will continue to apply during the life of such certificates. </seg>
            <seg id="p190">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT (a) All teachers of high school academic subject matter shall show the completion of not less than twelve semester hours of college credit in at east two of the fields of academic subject matter that they are called upon :o teach. *^ (b) All teachers of foreign language and mathematics should have credit for two years of the foreign language (to be taught) in high school followed by six college semester hours and three years of mathematics in high school followed by six college semester hours, which will be accepted temporarily as teaching minors. Final approval of schools fa not given until the first day of June of (each year by the State Department of Public Instruction, at which time county superintendents, county clerks and county treasurers are notified of the approved schools in their respective counties. A school or added grades must be in actual operation before it receives the consideration of this office for approval. Exemption from the tax levy or any part of the high school tax \evy depends upon the approval as reported by the State Superintendent for fhe year just past. This seems to be the most logical course of procedure under the law as it exists in the statute book at the present time. Certain denominational schools other than the public schools have been appoved by this office for academic purposes only. These schools are not privileged to collect free high school tuition money as paid by the district, county or state. The Constitution of the State of Nebraska, Article VII, Section 11, provides that, "No sectarian instruction shall be allowed in any school or institution supported in whole or in part by the public funds set apart for educational purposes."

            <seg id="p195">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Prospect* and Retrospect The close of a year is an important time to the businessman. Then it is customary for him to take stock of his business, to take time to make a care - ful survey of the record he has made, and to plan for the future in the hope that he can improve on the past. So with our schools! As the biennium draws to a close, a survey of the conditions prevailing during the period may help to determine what the future has in store. If we are to take an inventory, certainly, we must take cognizance of the conditions attending the depression in which we have found ourselves for several years past— conditions which have made the task of the teacher and superintendent almost a superhuman one. Schools have found themselves in the predicament of having larger and larger enrollments to care for with con - stantly decreasing revenues. The unemployment situation has forced an in - creasing number of young people into the schools and, at the same time, the decreasing property valuation has resulted in a much smaller amount of money available for school support. This seems to have been particularly true of the past biennium. Teaching staffs have been reduced to the minimum and, in some cases, even below a justifiable minimum. This has mein: .1 great in - crease in the size of classes taught and a corresponding decrease in subjects offered — a variation from accreditment standards that bade fair to become a serious blow to the standing of many of our schools. The increased size of the classes brought about another result— a natural one but a disadvantageous one also— namely, the lack of sufficient texts and supplies. Many schools found themselves needing more and better texts but having no funds with which to purchase them. Teachers' salaries have been reduced from ten to forty per cent while, at the same time, there has been a corresponding increase in living necessi - ties. But in spite of these things, be it said to the everlasting credit of the teachers of Nebraska, not once have they failed to give their best, their whole - hearted effort to the task they have undertaken— service to the children of the state. So much for the records of the past — the inventory, so to speak, of the schools for the past biennium. But what of the years to come? Are there signs of brighter times ahead? If not, then indeed has our cause become desperate. Happily, signs are not lacking that such better times are being heralded for the future. No one can deny that a growing spirit of optimism is prevalent in the minds and hearts of our teachers today. One cannot travel over the state and see the teachers at their work without realizing the changed attitude for the better — an attitude founded on hope, it is true, but a hope that is well-grounded on recent tendencies and happenings. One of the most hopeful signs that schools are beginning to get somewhat out of the depression is the awakened interest in school libraries. The library </seg>
            <seg id="p196">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT was probably the first to feel the results of enforced economy. Many of them were allowed to fall far below reasonable standards in all departments, es - pecially in fiction for use of English classes. Attempts were made to meet this need by resorting to die public library where one existed in die town, but too often this was not as successful as it was hoped it would be. Such libraries are often so located as to be difficult of access to pupils when most needed. They are necessarily organized for general reading and are unable to provide die special types of books satisfactory for school pupils' reading. The public libraries have also been handicapped by lack of funds, and this has resulted in fewer books and shorter hours when the library is open, many being open only two or three hours once or twice a week. They have done the best they could under the circumstances, but die results have too often been far from satisfactory. There has been a definite tendency on die part of the schools to enrich the school library to overcome these conditions. Libraries are being cataloged and books are carefully selected. Teachers who have had some li - brary training are being made responsible for the work and, in many in - stances, work in library methods is being given to student helpers. These helpers sometimes receive credit toward graduation for such work. All things considered, there is a great improvement in the general school library situ - ation. Through the assistance of die national government, many schools in all parts of the state have been enabled to renovate and repair school plants, making them, sanitary, cheery, pleasant places for children to assemble rather than the dark, dreary buildings they formerly were. This is not all, for many communities have constructed new 'buildings or remodeled those they have un - til die plants have been made adequate to the school needs of die boys and girls, thus insuring better, more efficient instructional service. Again may we say that this is not all of die picture. More bountiful crops and increasing financial returr a from diem have in most sections of die state served to restore confidence and peace of mind to school patrons so that they are beginning to demand the restoration of courses and subjects that were forced from die schools by the economic stress of die times past. The res - toration of these courses is made possible in many communities by die in - creased financial support now possible. These are but a few of the many causes for the growing confidence in the future so apparent in our educators today. Based on a clear under - standing of die difficulties of the past and a firm belief in the improvement of die present, is it too much hope that this optimism will carry die cause of education to higher achievements and greater opportunities in the biennium to come? Achievements represented by a continuation of an enlarged plan of res - toration of curricula and departments until our educational system has not only regained that which was lost but has more nearly attained die plane mark- </seg>

During that time approximately 47,000 teachers have been prepared to teach in the rural schools. Exact figures, available for the last twenty-five years, show 42,438 students graduated from the two-year normal training course, or an average of 1,697 per year. The number of approved normal training high schools and the enrollment in the normal training courses has been decreasing gradually since 1924-25 for two reasons. In the first place, the number of one- and two-room rural schools has been decreasing steadily, thus reducing the demand for the graduates of normal training schools. In the second place, the four state teachers colleges have been supplying an increasing number of rural teachers. </seg>
            <seg id="p198">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT The following table shows the number of normal training high schools, the enrollment in the normal training courses, and the number of teachers employed in die one- and two-room rural schools from 1929-30 to the present time.

The above table shows diat during die past biennium, over half of die graduates of die normal training course have gone out die next fall to put their training into practice. There is no way of knowing how many secured positions at a later date, but it is certain that many did so. </seg>
            <seg id="p199">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Selective Enrollment in Normal Training Courses This department has consistently emphasized the importance of greater care in the selection of students for enrollment in the normal training course. All normal training bulletins sent out by the department have stressed the im - portance of scholarship, personality and character. No doubt, this policy has had its influence upon; the enrollment in the high school normal training courses. Moreover, the fact in the great majority of schools the normal train - ing subjects are very well taught and demand a great deal of effort on the part of the students, serves to deter the less serious from mmlling Normal Training Courses Produce Good Teachers As a result of the greater selectivity in enrollment and the constantly im - proved courses of study and methods of presentation on the part of die su - pervisors, the normal training high schools are producing graduates who do a very acceptable type of teaching in the rural schools of the state. In fact, it is the testimony of many county superintendents that they are very defin - itely preferred to those who have had training in higher institutions, but no special training in the field of rural education. Courses Are Based Upon Rural Needs In die high) school, not a few but all of the courses making up the normal training curriculum, have been planned with one central idea of training a rural teacher. They center around rural conditions and are based upon rural needs. The supervisor, herself, has had teaching experience in the rural schools. During the two-year course, the students review thoroughly the common branches in order that they may have their subject matter well in hand, and they are required to observe and do practice teaching, under su - pervision, in rural schools. Supervisors Are Highest Type Teachers Our normal training supervisors are an exceptionally fine group of teachers, in sympathy with the problems of the rural areas, and earnest in their attempts to provide the kind of training which will best meet those problems. Their efforts are not limited to training in subject matter and the techniques of teaching. They endeavor to point out to their students die opportunities for leadership which will be theirs as they enter a community as a teacher and to help them to see the advantages and possibilities of rural life. The results of their efforts are seen in die improvements of the personalities of many of their students during the two years they are under the influence of the super - visor. </seg>
            <seg id="p200">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Majority of Student* Are Rural Boys and Girls It must be kept in mind that most of the students who take die normal training course in high school are rural boys and girls who are familiar with rural conditions. A teacher without this background, no matter how fine her training, is obliged, in many cases, to make a very difficult adjustment when she teaches a rural school for the first time. The ideal situation would be to take 1 rural boys and girls, fitted by nature to become teachers, and give diem at least two years, beyond high school, in a teacher-training insti - tution with a rich rural curriculum. They would then, however, demand better salaries and better working conditions than exist in the average rural school today. When a greater degree of prosperity returns to Nebraska, it is to be hoped and expected that the rural schools will rapidly work toward such a goal. In the meantime, the normal training course in high school seems to offer die best solution. Normal Training Is a Vocational Course During the past twenty years, a great deal of emphasis has been placed upon die necessity of including vocational courses in the high school curri - culum. The normal training course is vocational. It is very doubtful whether any other course offered in the high schools of Nebraska prepares as many of its graduates to go . directly into positions where they are able to earn their living. The Pre-Professional Phase of Normal Training The normal training course has another value which our high schools are coming to recognize more' fully — and this is what may be called the pre-pro - fessional phase. In short, the course becomes a college preparatory course for young men and women who plan to go on to institutions of higher learning and later enter die teaching profession. Evidence at hand seems to indicate that the normal training course is superior to any other course offered in high school as a preparatioin for college entrance for those students who expect to prepare themselves for the teaching profession. Number of Rural Teachers Required Each Year At the present time, diere are one- and two-room rural schools in Ne - braska,, employing 6,059 teachers. The number, of new teachers required each year for these schools is normally about twenty-five per cent of the total number employed. That is, about 1,500 new teachers are needed each year to fill the vacancies in die rural schools. In June, 1937, die four state teachers colleges issued 278 General Elementary Certificates; all other colleges issued </seg>
            <seg id="p201">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 142. In June, 1938, the teachers colleges issued 273; none were issued by the other institutions. Thus, it is seen that during the year 1936-37, 420 teachers were prepared for rural teaching by the higher institutions of the state, and in the year 1937-38, only 273. Teachers Colleges Add New Rural Courses The teachers colleges of Nebraska have added several courses during the past biennium which materially strengthen their rural curricula. Each college now maintains a rural school for observation and practice teaching. These improvements in the rural departments of the teachers colleges are to be heartily commended. No doubt, any considerable improvement in economic conditions in Nebraska will find many teachers taking advantage of these add - ed courses. Normal Training Graduates Continue to Improve ThemselTes Reports received from the county superintendents from rime to time, show that a large proportion of the high school normal training graduates continue to improve themselves professionally by attending summer and regular ses - sions of the University of Nebraska and die four state teachers colleges. They have continued to do this, even during the past six years when salaries have been low. Leaving out of consideration those who are teaching for the first time this fall and hence have had no opportunity to get further training, it would seem that only about one-fourth have failed to continue their educa - tion at some institution of higher learning. New Certification Law Protects Normal Training The new certification law passed by the Unicameral Legislature of 1937, went into effect September 1, 1938. This law provides that graduates of a high school normal training course are eligible to receive the Third Grade Ele - mentary Certificate upon the completion of the seventeen state examinations required by law. When this bill was before the educational committee of the legislature, they made very sure, before they gave it their approval, that it would in no way interfere widi or injure normal training. The bill was passed by both the committee and the legislature widiout a dissenting vote. The conclusions of this department in regard to high school normal train - ing are, therefore, as follows: 1. The number of normal training high schools and the enrollment in the normal training courses has been decreasing gradually since 1924, but the program still provides a service for which there seems to be no substitute at the present time. 2. During the past four years, there has been a considerable increase in the number of normal training graduates securing positions immedi - ately. </seg>
            <seg id="p202">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 3. Normal training graduates continue to demonstrate their ability to teach successfully in the one- and two-room schools of Nebraska, according to the testimony of patrons and county superintendents. 4. The program is successful because it is based upon rural needs, taught by the finest type of teachers, and the students are mosdy rural boys and girls who are familiar with the situations which they will have to meet. 5. The normal training course more successfully fits young people to earn dieir living than does any odier high school course. 6. The normal training course has great value as a college preparatory course for future teachers. 7. The teachers colleges, though they have recendy improved their cur - ricula, granted, in June, 1938, only 273 General Elementary Certif - icates. The number of new teachers required normally to fill the vacancies in the rural schools is approximately fifteen hundred. 8. Normal training graduates continue to improve diemselves by at - tendance at higher institutions of learning. 9. The new certification law protects high school normal training. It is diei belief of this department that most of the communities in the State which now have a normal training program, desire to continue it as long as there is a demand for it on the part of the young people of the com - munity, and as long as a reasonable proportion of the graduates can secure teaching positions. This department desires to cooperate with the commu - nities and school authorities in the effort to make the program even more ef - fective and successful dian it has been in the past. CRISIS OF EDUCATION "Throughout the past years The American Legion has strongly defended public education. In every state where an economic attack has been made upon the schools, the Legion has expressed in no uncertain terms its unwill - ingness to see serious cute made in the curriculum of the schools. These attacks were usuaUy presented against the 'frills' of education, when in reality those falls should truthfully be classified as a thorough modernization of the schools. The Legion is unwilling to see our kindergartens eliminated - our music and art departments eliminated or seriously reduced; our athletic departments curtailed; our vocational training reduced to a bare minimum; bur adult education and night classes closed. Under the guise of economy^ the trend of sooal order of today compels us to defend Ind even expand tiiese phases of vocational training. It is the duty of the Legion-it is Ae duty of every thinking American citizen in every state-to see to it that neither by regulation nor legislation shall these cuts be made"— from the Americanism Manual of the American Legion, page 15 </seg>

            <seg id="p204">KEPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Coon* of Study in Character Education Special emphasis has been given to character training throughout the Elementary Course of Study for Nebraska Schools. It includes also a special unit on character education with suggestions as required in the law. The well-planned curriculum considers the individual needs of the child Reogramzation brings about a special orientation and gives the child oppor - tunity to do things that are of sodal value. He must be made to feel that he i, , worth-while. In addition to formal training, modern education is con - cerned about the chad's social attitudes, his emotions and his conduct. The child should be trained to live well with others. He should be taught to ac - cept his individual responsibility wherever he may be. The purpose of education is to guide, direct, and encourage the growth pattern of the individual. Character education covers both moral train - ing and moral instruction. Teachers and elders aid the child in discovering and accepting certain basic, ethical principles and help him in applying them to new problems in order that he may become a worthy citizen. The following statement appejirs in an article by the Bureau of Pub - lications, Teachers College, Columbia University: "There are three ways to build a program for the education of children: (1) The adult-made program-superimposed upon the child. The adult gives the orders, the child obeys. Such a program is not designed to de - velop personality. i ! (2) The gang-made program— a program of the neglected and often misguided gang which may be more destructive than constructive. (3) The cooperative program— a program designed by boy or girl groups under a trained leader. | "Granted a wide range of activities and a rich field of electives to choose from, a plan of organization and a method of procedure, an alert group of boys or g*ls under an able leader can work wonders in program building.

Supplementary Organizations for Youth Nebraska character education courses include the splendid training given in numerous youth organizations which have been designed with character education as their major objective. The Nebraska Elementary Course of Study gives specific information on Junior Red Cross, Girl Scouts of America, Boy Scouts of America, Boys' and Girls' 4-H Clubs, Girl Reserves and the Hi- Y Movement. Full recognition is accorded the value of these and other organizations which have sprung up to supplement home and school in the moulding of youth and in providing for youths' interests. (Pages 395-404, Elementary Course of Study.) Teacher Training Character education receives proper emphasis in Bulletin A, Professional Training, 1937-1939. The professional training course outlines the general aims in character education and suggests Related Problems and Projects. Normal training students are given suggestions on understanding the behavior of the child in relation to his environment. Colleges and universities are offering courses to aid teachers in giving practical emphasis to character education. President Herbert L. Cushing. Kearney State Teachers College, declared, "Clearly, if it is to be die duty of every teacher to give special emphasis to the character traits enumerated in the law, it is the responsibility of every institution which assumes to prepare teachers, to give them some special help in the devising of methods and procedures which will permit them to do their work most effectively." — (Nebraska Educational Journal, March, 1938.)

The church loses none of its' responsibility in developing </seg>
            <seg id="p210">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT spiritual leadership and in helping boys and girls to acquire those fundamental ideals which are basic in character education. The State Department of Public Instruction is in full sympathy with the program _ of citizenship training that is being projected in our churches and Bile schools everywhere and: hai cooperated in every way consistent with official responsibility. Through die Nebraska Education Bulletin, teachers are urged to work with the institutions and organizations which will help them in developing a community-wide program in character education. The schools must share the responsibility but they must have the vital aid of the home and community if their work is to be effective in character training. National Recognition The nation-wide interest in character education is reflected in the numerous requests for information on the Nebraska courses. Within the last tew years these requests have come from nearly every state in the United btates, from Canada, Mexico, Alaska and the Hawaiian Islands. A group of CW^ f"* KCea £ "H* a 1 ~« h studv «d reared the bulletin, Character Development Through Religious and Moral Education in the Public Schools of the United | States. The courses of study for every state were considered. The authors of the bulletin quoted the Nebraska Character Education law and then added, "Several other states are following the same program that is being used in the Nebraska schools, which indicates that the principles of the Nebraska plan are good and that its methods are acceptable." «* ri™* S meral TiT ti ° n f Women ' s Clubs approved compulsory studies m character building and crime prevention and urge school authorities to include these studies h, the curriculum. The following statement appears in an Sn I Sj * ? wT VefSUS Ctime '" pubHshed in Tbs Clubwoman, General Federaaon of Women's dubs, for September, 1937: "The forty - third session of the Nebraska Legislature was significant in that it legislated a program of character education. This law, passed in 1927, marks one of the farst instances a commonwealth set up legislative machinery definitely charging the schools, both private and public, with the necessity of giving the same attention to the building of character as has been and is being given to the teaching of the so-called fundimentals." Handicaps to Character Education Among the many handicaps to character education, the following stand out as most prevalent and most detrimental: indifference, unfortunate GUT™ F 6 * 1 ? u ? oun&lt;iin &amp; and unwholesome social practices of every SSI'- C J U £r° rS t C ? C rCSCarch buIIetin - Carter Development Through gSSm:*!* Moral Education in the Public Schools of the United States, </seg>
            <seg id="p211">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION declare, "One of the chief handicaps to real achievement in character development in the public schools is the indifference of the majority of the people toward the use of agencies and influences by which character may be affected. The public schools, it must be said, are not backed by an enthusiastic society in the task of character education. The general run of society knows very little as to the kind of ethical training that is being given or, in fact, whether any kind is being given. Only in extreme cases of crime or delinquency are many questions asked as to whether die schools are seeking to develop character." Responsibility of State State law provides for free school privileges for all children diat are of legal school age. It makes compulsory die requirements of attendance for certain ages and under certain conditions. The state law provides diat each and every teacher must give special emphasis diat will aid in character training and requires die State Superintendent of Public Instruction to prepare and outline suggestions for use of teachers. The people of the state must not shirk die responsibility which is theirs in a state-wide movement for character development. In influencing character, "Adults have four tools — Example, Doing With, Encouragement, Expectancy of Good" (Page 371, Elementary Course of Study.) The people of our state must fill their responsibility by giving youdi a fitting example if the schools are to promote and develop an upright and desirable citizenry. "Character is not an inheritance, it is an achievement — an achievement widi one's inheritance." "Education at die secondary level in this country was for a long time considered a special privilege, available only to a few on die payment of tui - tion fees, and designed chiefly as a preliminary preparation for certain pro - fessions. During the latter part of the nineteenth century die growing real - ization of die implications of democracy led to die development of die high school as a part of the common school system. "In retrospect, nodiing in the evolution of American education is more striking in its sweep dian die development of die secondary school. Nodiing like it has ever happened before in any odier country. As late as 1890 in the United States only 3.8 percent of the number of young people 14 to 17 years of age were enrolled in public high schools; at present more than 60 percent of die population of high school age are enrolled in public high schools. In 1937 for die first time die number of graduates from high schools in a single year passed die million mark. There are now some 25,000 public high schools in which over 230,000 teachers instruct almost 6,000,000 boys and girls, by means of a curriculum that is gradually, although inadequately, being adapted to meet die individual and social needs of American youdi." — from The Report of die President's Advisory Committee on Education, page 12. </seg>

In Young Farmers' Classes the boys may receive instruction in agriculture and related subjects during the farmers' "slack season". The work is largely concerned with "doing things" rather than book study. Laboratory and shop-work constitute a large part of die course.

Rehabilitation Division The vocational adjustment of persons disabled by disease, ac - cident or otherwise has always presented a difficult economic problem. The mechanization and speeding up of industrial and agricultural production bringing about more stringent physical requirements for workers has increased its seriousness. Concurrent with the increasing use of machines and faster pro - duction methods in industry and agriculture and with die intro - duction of the motor vehicle and greater speed in modes of trav - el has come a tremendous increase in the number of those dis - abled by accidents. The dependent condition of many of these people creates an ec - onomic load which Vocational Rehabilitation is designed to re - lieve by assisting physically handicapped persons to prepare them - selves to engage in occupations whereby they may be self-support - ing. During the past year 66 handicapped persons have been fitted for and placed in occupations in which they are earning a living. These were prepared by school training, by employment training and by die provision of artificial appliances, physical restoration and careful re-adjustment to suitable occupations. With die aid of this division 266 disabled persons are now pre - paring themselves to engage in new occupations. Applications from many others are pending.

FULMER, State Director of Vocational Education. "The history of the United States affords no more dramatic and sig - nificant spectacle than the growth of its educational system. It is a story of the determined struggle of a free people to advance their standards through the improved education of succeeding generations. American education is a phenomenon of American democracy; and the present strengths and weak - nesses of American democracy are in large part the result of the strengths and weaknesses of the educational system. "As an enterprise in mass management, public education is one of the largest of all public businesses. Its plant, its personnel, its annual expendi - tures all rank it among the largest governmental functions. By 1930 the total value of the property and endowments of the public schools had reached the impressive sum of #6,674,445,000. Their annual expenditures, including interest and capital outlay, were at a level of about #2,300,000,000. Drastic reduction in expenditures, followed by partial recovery, has occurred since 1930; in 1935-36 the schools were maintained with enrollments sub- Slr^ a r thoSe of 193 ° the expenditure of about #2,000, - 000,000.»-from The Report of the President's Advisory Committee on education, page 6.

            <seg id="p231">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION DIVISION OF ADULT IMMIGRANT EDUCATION EDITH MARTIN, State Director of Adult Immigrant Education Background Little provision had been made for the Education of the adult alien until after the World War, which showed clearly that the security of the nation was not only in materials such as arms, ships, munitions and food but also in the efficiency of our people in matters of literacy, hygiene and general understanding of the issues involved. Night schools had been conducted in larger cities, but for the most part an alien, wishing to learn our language and become a citizen, found it to be a hardship; and as a result, thousands from foreign shores had been living here over a long period of years and were unable to speak the English Lan - guage. Particularly was this true of the mothers. Prior to 1922, the mo - ther and minor children became citizens when the father, received his final papers but many families continued to speak their native tongue. A movement was soon under way to set up schools providing for citizenship training as well as instruction in the common branches of learning. Nebraska Establishes Program In 1927 the state legislature enacted a law establishing the Adult Immi - grant Education Division of the Department of Public Instruction for the education of the adult aliens and illiterates under the direction jof a state supervisor appointed by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction (Sec. 79-2301— 79-2303.) Under this law, local school boards and school authorities are empow - ered to expend money for schools and classes in buildings, in industrial est - ablishments, places of employment and other places expedient for the pur - pose of giving instruction to foreign born and native adults and minors over the age of sixteen. These courses of study include English, history, civics, and other subjects tending to promote good citizenship and to in - crease vocational efficiency. The State Superintendent has power to designate courses of study, ap - prove the selection of teachers and supervise the instruction. He is also authorized to disperse from the funds appropriated for his department suf - ficient money for supervision, instruction and other necessary expense of the adult immigrant division. From 1927 to 1933 this work was carried on according to law. Then, the appropriation was cut off by the 1933 Legislature. At that time there were thirty-five teachers conducting classes over the state with more then nine hundred aliens enrolled. Some of the classes were discontinued but the major portion carried on with the aid of volunteer instructors, which was not altogether satisfactory. </seg>
            <seg id="p232">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Attention must be called to die Citizenship class under the tutelage of Mr. Kenneth Hunt at the, Y. M. C. A. in Omaha. This group has been under the direction of die State Department since 1927 .and has continued with small remuneration, as have other classes over die state, when teach - ers could not qualify for, die relief program, and die students objected to any other teacher. Mr. Hunt's class has an outstanding record of achieve - ments in citizenship. Transition to Larger Field In January, 1934, more aliens applied for citizenship papers in die dis - trict offices than in any one month of die three previous years. The de - mand for instruction grew and die Emergency Educational Program was welcomed in every section of die state. Under that particular program during die years 1934-1935 more than seventy-five teachers gave instruction to three thousand alien adults. Since die program was taken over by the Federal Works Progress Ad - ministration, this department has been limited in its activities. All govern - ment textbooks are available through the State Department of Public Instruc - tion and material prepared by the director has peen distributed to die WPA. A new series of government textbooks is in the process of preparation and die author has conferred with die state office from time to time and has asked for criticism, of manuscript submitted, which has been gladly given. Upon receiving his final citizenship papers, die average alien is no longer content with his education and is desirous of continuing study along some line of general adult education and often he proves to be a valuable ad - dition to classes with his old country background. At this point, die needs of die foreign-born American merge widi die needs of all odier adults in this rapidly changing period of our history. Nebraska Council of Adult Education Organized A state council of adult education was organized in Omaha, October 7, 1938, at die close of die Missouri Valley Conference of Adult Education. Nebraska is die first state in die group of six, comprising Minnesota, South Dakota, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas and Nebraska to complete die organiza - tion of such a council. Twenty-six educational agencies were represented, as well as spectators from the other states. Nebraska has not been without provision for adult education. Exception - ally strong classes in literacy, citizenship, vocational work, farm extension, university extension and general adult education have been functioning in many localities for several years. .With die aid of federal money, every pro - gram has been enlarged; but die field remains without coordination and a definite unified program, which will be die work of die council. </seg>
            <seg id="p233">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Organization of the council offers opportunity to representatives of these groups to share the development of local service with die background of state-wide experience and effort in this particular field. The constitution of the council is built widi this purpose in mind; the interchanging of ideas between the many various groups. Council of Education for Home and Family Life In September, 1936, the State Department of Public Instruction coop - erated in die organization of a council of Education for Home and Family Life. The membership is composed of representation from each educational agency in the state, particularly those agencies directly interested in Child Welfare and Parent Education. Meetings are held quarterly and die Coun - cil has sponsored each summer a conference at die University of Nebraska. During July, 1937, die first conference was under die direction of Miss Flora Thurston, acting professor of home economics education, Graduate School of Education, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York. In die summer of 1938, the Council again sponsored a conference at the University of Ne - braska. Dr. W. E. Blatz, Director of St. George School for Oiild Study, affiliated with die University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada. The first meet - ing this season was held at die Municipal University in Omaha on October 27, when Miss Flora Thurston was again guest speaker. Bulletin of Adult Education In May, 1938, a bulletin of adult education was edited by die director, die first of the kind in die state. It deals with die three general divisions of adult education: 1. Literacy and Citizenship, 2. Vocational, 3. General or Avocational Education. It has been received by the public and educators and already is to be found in the libraries of colleges, universities and state departments of public instruction in many states besides Nebraska. President's Advisory Committee Report Recognizes Need for Adult Education In September, 1936, die President of die United States appointed a committee of outstanding leaders in several fields (a) to investigate die ex - isting educational program, (b) to study its relation of training to general education and to prevailing economic and social conditions, (c) to de - termine extent of need for an expanded program, (d) to develope recomen - dations for the Congress and die Executive. The following statement is from die report which Chairman Floyd Reeves submitted in February, 1938: "The 75,000,000 persons who constitute die adult population of die United States today, were, in most cases, given only limited educational opportunities in childhood. Over 36,000,000 of diem did not finish elementary school; at least 3,000,000 are completely illiterate. Among </seg>
            <seg id="p234">232 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT i. the 4,300,000 resident aliens, large numbers are in need of elementary education, and almost all need further training in American principles and practices in order to become citizens. "Current unemployment, migration, and occupational shifts have made the vocational retraining of adult workers a problem of major impor - tance. ****** Jxi. addition to removal of common school deficiencies and to vocational retraining, educational services for adults are needed for a wide variety of other purposes. In earlier times, the schools could assume that such education as they were unable to give a child would last him throughout his life. Changes in economic and social conditions usually came slowly; facts learned at twelve years of age were still much the facts at sixty. Today there must be recognition that a large part of the information taught in school and college in the first decade of the century has already become obsolete. Even attitudes of mind have to be changed with changing times. The recognition of this new condition has led to the great growth of adult education, aimed not merely at teaching illiterates to read, but even more at giving adults a chance to acquire some of the knowledge and to solve some of the problems that have appeared since they were in school. Education as a process con - tinuing throughout life is now seen to be necessary for intelligent citizen - ship in the present day. "The Committee therefore recommends that special Federal grants to States be provided for educational services to adults. "The primary purpose of the proposed grants should be to stimulate the States to make adequate provision for civic, general, and vocational part - time adult educational activities, including workers' education, citizen - ship classes for aliens and teaching of illiterates. "The proposed grants for adult education should hot be restricted to expenditure through public schools. That should also be available for expenditure through other appropriate non-profit education agencies. The needs for adult education are so varied in character that no single type of educational agency is very likely to be able to meet all of them. "In each state, a single appropriate agency should be responsible for weighmg the relative needs for the various types of educational service for adults and for cooperation in the allocation of the proposed grants to the schools and other institutions best equipped to use them effec - tively. "The recommendation is, therefore, made that the grants be conditioned upon the designation of each state of its department of education or a board of education controlled by that department, as the agency to co - operate in the distribution of grants. </seg>
            <seg id="p235">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION "The adult education program of die Works Progress Administration has suffered from a lack of long-term planning, from frequent changes in policy, from a lack of adequately trained teachers, and from inade - quate coordination with educational activities under State and local di - rection. Not withstanding the deficiencies, the program has contributed a very substantial volume of educational service. It has called atten - tion in a dramatic way to many of the inadequacies in the regularly constituted programs of education." The recommendations of die Committee are: 1. Spedal grants to the States should be provided for educational services to adults. The amounts recommended are #5,000,000 durine the fiscal fear 1939-40; #10,000,000 during the fiscal year 1940-4lJ and #15,000,000 during each of the succeeding fiscal years through 1944^ 45. The grants should be allocated among die States in proportion to their respective adult population. 2. The primary purpose of the .grants should be to stimulate the States to make adequate provision for civic, general, and vocational part-time adult educational activities, including workers' education, citizenship classes for aliens, and the teaching of illiterates. 3. The grants should not be restricted to expenditures through the public schools; they should also be available for expenditure through die extension services for colleges and universities and dirough other ap - propriate nonprofit educational agencies. 4. The grants should be conditioned upon the designation by each State of its department of education, or a board of education controlling that department, as the agency to cooperate in die distribution of the grants. Distribution within die States should be provided for through plans joindy agreed upon by the respective State and Federal adminis - trative agencies. The plan for each State should be prepared widi die assistance of a State Council on Adult Education, on which each major type of adult education program in die State should be represented. Dr. Luther H. Gulick of the Advisory Committee on Education has said: "America cannot be governed satisfactorily "or administered industrially in the days that lie ahead, on the basis of the kind of schooling eighty per cent of the boys and girls now receive." </seg>
            <seg id="p236">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT BUREAU OF EDUCATION AND REGISTRATION FOR NURSES Carol L. Martin, Director of Education and Registration of Nurses CONTENTS — Introduction— New Requirements and Regulations Conference on die New Curriculum— Annual Institute for Nurses — Schools of Nursing Accredited in the State— State Examinations for Nurses—Regis - tration of Nurses — Financial Statement Introduction The Bureau of Education and Registration for Nurses is maintained solely through fees paid by graduates of accredited schools of nursing in Nebraska and nurses who become licensed in this state by taking state exam - inations for nurses or through reciprocal relations with other states with comparable or superior standards. Income from no other source is available for the support of the Bureau. Under Chapter 33, Article 1, Compiled Statutes Supplement for Nebraska 1937, Sections 33-155 to 33-157, which was enacted during the legislative session of 1937, ten per cent of all fees collected by the Bureau are taken for payment of office space occupied by die Bureau in the State Capitol Building. The registered nurses of Nebraska, through their own efforts, are ren - dering a vital service to die people of this state in maintaining diis Bureau and in establishing a law, the sole purpose of which is to provide safer and more intelligent community nursing service. Did nurses themselves not carry on this undertaking, it would have to be done by the state in sheer self protection of the public against an influx of nurses from other states who are poorly qualified and to circumvent questionable projects for the prepar - ation of nurses which are promoted solely for commercial gain. Through definitely established legal requirements, the Bureau also protects the inter - ests of young women who enter the accredited schools of nursing in Nebraska so that they may receive preparation according to acceptable standards of nursing education. These are highly necessary to enable them to render intelligent professional service which only is safe in caring for the sick and disabled and for the prevention of disease and conservation of health. Community Nursing Service does not indicate a new type of nursing; neither does it imply a special field of service. It is a comparatively new phrase that is used to define all of the nursing services which a community may re - quire. It is inclusive of practically all services which a professional nurse may be called upon to render and it covers a wide range of activities. In the main, these are divided between the fields of curative and preventive health work. Further advanced preparation is necessary before the graduate nurse can qualify </seg>
            <seg id="p237">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION in some phases of Community Nursing Service. However, the law in Nebraska governing the education and registration of nurses is concerned only with the general, the basic course which all nurses must complete to become graduate, registered nurses in this state. It is the foundation for all advanced and spec - ialized courses in nursing regardless of which field of community nursing service the graduate may enter. New Requirements and Regulations One of the most important achievements of the Bureau during the biennium has been the compilation of recommendations, requirements and regulations authorized legally under Chapter 71, Article 15, Compiled Statutes Supplement for Nebraska, 1937 which reads: "The Bureau shall adopt and promulgate such rules and regulations, not inconsistent with law, as it may deem necessary to properly carry out die provisions of this act and to effectuate its purpose." After spending several months in making a careful study! of requirements and regulations in over half of the states in the union pertaining to the educa - tion and registration or licensure of nurses, the members of the Bureau prepared tentative requirements and regulations with recommendations also. These were presented on December 16, 1937 at a meeting of members of the Bureau and representatives from every accredited school of nursing in the state when they were discussed, criticized, changed and finally agreed upon after which they were adopted accordingly by the Bureau. As a measure of economy and for the con - venience of those who use them, they are published in three different forms: I. Recommendations, Rules and Regulations for the Accreditment of Schools of Nursing m Nebraska. 2. Requirements Pertaining to Licensure or Regis - tration of Nurses in Nebraska. 3. Regulations for State Edaminations for Nurses in Nebraska. These recommendations and requirements are needed primarily for the graduates of schools of nursing so that their preparation is adequate to enable them to meet present day needs according to modern scientific methods in med - ical and health work. They are also needed to qualify Nebraska nurses to be - come registered in more states through reciprocity and especially in neighboring states. Through definite, required standards in schools of nursing in Nebr - aska, the graduates will be allowed more credits in leading colleges and univer - sities throughout the country as they endeavor to take advanced or specialized courses needed, more and more in various fields of nursing service.

Since making out standards known through these pamphlets, Ne - braska nurses have encountered less difficulty in being licensed by reciprocity in other states. j .■.'"■ Conference on the Curriculum In the spring of 1937, a new curriculum known as "A Curriculum Guide For Schools of Nursing"' was published by the National League of Nursing Education. Much of the content or subject-matter remains the same as has been taught heretofore but it has been revised in the light of changing conditions and new scientific discoveries and methods in the treatment and prevention of disease. Greater emphasis has been placed on teaching meth - ods and proper sequence of the various courses required in order to build a sound program of nursing education in both classroom teaching and clinical practice. At die request of several administrators of schools of nursing, the Bureau conducted a conference on die new curriculum widi die aid of die Committee on Curriculum of die Nebraska State League of Nursing Educ - cation which was held on March 15, 1938 at Lincoln. In advance of die conference, questions and problems for discussion had been submitted by die faculty members of several schools of nursing and diese were classified under several topics: 1. The Preparation of Faculty Members 2. Teaching Mediods for Schools of Nursing 3. Clinical Services and Facilities for Teaching 4. Administrative Problems in Schools of Nursing. It is com - mendable diat representatives from every school of nursing in die state at - tended and it was deemed so beneficial diat a unanimous request was made, at die dose of die meeting, to hold a similar conference each year. Institute for Registered Nunei Each year during die biennium, die Bureau, widi die assistance of die State League of Nursing Education, has conducted an institute for nurses who are registered in Nebraska. Student nurses, in accredited ' schools are always welcome to attend any of die sessions. The institute usually covers ! a period of diree days and prominent speakers in the fields of education and health work are obtained from var - ious parts of the country to contribute to die program. Nurses, who have done effective work national in scope in die various specialized fields of nurs - ing, also aid in programs arranged for local specialized groups. Every nurse who is licensed in Nebraska is eligible to attend and no admission fee is re - quired as die institute is made possible through die reregistration fees paid each year by nurses who are licensed for active practice. For die first time, </seg>
            <seg id="p239">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION the institute was held this year (March, 1938) in conjunction with die an - nual convention of the Nebraska Hospital Association. The programs for the two groups were open to all and they were conducted separately during the day. In the evening all united for the banquet and to enjoy the pro - gram which followed. Such cooperative efforts bring about clearer under - standing of the common problems confronting both groups and promote harmonious inter-professional relationships. General Information of Schools of Nursing At present there are thirteen accredited schools of nursing in Nebraska: Omaha: Bishop Clarkson Memorial Hospital School of Nursing Creighton Memorial St. Joseph's Hospital School of Nursing Immanuel Hospital School of Nursing Nebraska Methodist Episcopal Hospital School of Nursing St. Catherine's Hospital School of Nursing University of Nebraska Hospital School of Nursing Lincoln: Bryan Memorial Hospital School of Nursing Lincoln General Hospital School of Nursing St. Elizabeth Hospital School of Nursing Grand Island: St. Francis Hospital School of Nursing Hastings: Mary Lanning Memorial Hospital School of Nursing Scottsbluff : West Nebraska Methodist Episcopal Hospital School of Nursing Alliance: St. Joseph's Hospital School of Nursing Number of Students Enrolled in Nebraska Schools of Nursing on No - vember 1, 1938: Preliminary or Predinical Course i 334 First year students exclusive of preliminary or predinical...... 50 Second year students j 285 Third year students 290 Total enrollments i 959 </seg>
            <seg id="p240">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT The number enrolled fluctuates almost continuously as students complete the course, as they drop out of the schools voluntarily or because of failure in scholastic work and inability to adjust satisfactorily in meeting the require - ments of the schools. Nine schools admit only one class each year which usually results in a more thorough and better organized teaching program in both theory and practice as more time is available for teaching the various courses. A better sequence of subjects and clinical assignments is possible in most of die institutions through die admission of only one class annually. Four schools admit two classes each year usually in September and Febru - ary. Annual Surveys and Accreditment of School* : -.■■•■ One of die most important functions of the Bureau is the annual inspec - tion or survey and accreditment of schools of nursing. The State Director of Nursing Education, who is also secretary of die Bureau, made die annual sur - vey of each of die^ thirteen schools and she prepared accordingly twenty-sev - en reports (during die biennium as one school closed voluntarily early in 1938) on the findings in each institution, which widi recommendations were submitted at regular meetings for consideration for accreditment. -'.■■' ■ Selection of Students The selection of students most likely to succeeed in die professions they contemplate entering is a problem, common to all professional schools and one which deserves careful consideration in die interests of die students, the schools, and the general public Unwise selection of prospective students in schools of nursing has been one of the greatest difficulties with which we have been confronted but improvement has been made during die last two years as more schools admit only those who rank in die upper third or half in die high school class or they require a general average of 85 in high school. One school now admits only students who have had at least one year of col - lege work in certain prescribed subjects. Anodier advantage in requiring one or two years of college preparation is that more mature students are admit - ted. However, it is unwise to admit college students whose scholarship is of low grade into a calling so serious in significance as nursing. In all schools of nursing, intelligence tests are being given on or shortly after admission, and various aptitude and achievement tests are given also in three schools. These psychological tests, in addition to die usual tests and examinations in scholastic work, are helpful in evaluating more accurately and justly die various abilities of the student nurses. • • ■ Immaturity of Entrants to Schools of Nursing One of the difficulties encountered in schools of nursing is die immatur - ity of entrants to these institutions. The admission age requirement is a min - imum of eighteen years inasmuch as an applicant for registration or licensure </seg>
            <seg id="p241">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION in this state must be at least 21 years of age and the requited course covers a period of three years. However, eighteen is too young and it is commendable that two schools of nursing are gradually establishing a requirement of at least 19 years on admission, and a minimum age of twenty, years is pre - ferable. These young women are often called upon to aid in caring for very sick patients and more mature students would be able to adjust more satisfac - torily to the innumerable and varied situations which will confront diem. Health Examinations While health examinations have been given on admission to all student nurses for several years including preventive measures against smallpox, and typhoid fever and latterly against diptheria and scarlet fever, yet they have been done more thoroughly during the past two years. More schools now give tests and take X-Rays of chests for the detection of tuberculosis, and, in four schools, die Wasserman test is also given to all students. It is advantageous to die students, the institutions concerned and the public diat diese precautionary measures are being taken. Particularly Well planned healdi programs have been arranged in three schools of nursing. The amount of student illness is gradually being reduced which is due in no small de - gree to the increase in preventive measures, reduction of hours on duty in the hospital and the allowance of longer vacations for student nurses. Hours on Duty A marked improvement during die biennium has been the reduction of hours on duty in die hospital for student nurses. A schedule of not more dian 48 hours on duty per week is in force in nearly all of die hospitals which maintain accredited schools of nursing, which includes class periods in three schools while in others only one-half of class time is included. How - ever, in the majority of schools class periods are held in addition to the week - ly schedule of forty-eight hours of practice. During the first three months of die preliminary or pre-dinical period die students are not on hospital duty at all in three schools of nursing. In eleven schools, each student has one full day off duty each week which is appreciated very much indeed. Under these reduced schedules of practice the students have more time for study and recreation, which in many instances results in better scho - lastic work and more effective classroom teaching inasmuch as the students are not so fatigued for class attendance as formerly under more arduous pro - grams of practical experience. Teaching Equipment More teaching equipment has been furnished in ten schools of nursing and an entirely new teaching unit has been provided in two schools. Much improvement in library facilities and service has taken place in three of the smaller but progressive schools. The library is the nucleus for the whole </seg>
            <seg id="p242">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT teaching program and therefore, a well stocked library, with carefully selected reference books (not too many cast-offs from other libraries) and with ad - equate service, augurs well for advancement in die status of the school. New units well equipped for demonstration purposes in teaching nursing procedures have been added in two schools but we regret to note diat in three schools diis equipment is inadequate and nothing has been done in die last two years in the way of improvement. Needed in most of our schools are better teaching facilities on the wards inasmuch as emphasis has shifted to teaching in the hospital ward which, after all, offers the most important laboratory course in the whole curriculum for student nurses. Small con - ference rooms and teaching centers are necessary where the student is having her clinical experience, one of the most significant learning situations avail - able to her. More adequate laboratory facilities for teaching the physical and biologi - cal sciences have been provided in four schools through the purchase of more equipment for teaching purposes or through forming affiliations for such courses with a college or university in die community. Sound teaching in these fundamental sciences is decidedly necessary as they form the founda - tion for nearly all of die courses in the curriculum which follow. These teaching facilities are inadequate still in three schools of nursing. Curriculum During the past one and one-half years, Nebraska schools of nursing have been gradually installing die new curriculum which was issued by the National League of Nursing Education in 1937. The number of hours of classroom teaching has been increased in all accredited schools, also, the num - ber of demonstration and laboratory periods in the. sciences and nursing arts courses. The most outstanding improvement which has taken place during the year is the establishment of an affiliation (a course of four months) in psy - chiatic nursing at the Hastings State Hospital, Ingleside, for student nurses in accredited schools of nursing in Nebraska. The course in classroom teaching, as oudined, includes a total of 150 hours of instruction in Psychiatry, Clinical Neurology, Psychology and Men - tal Hygrcne, Social Service, Psychiatic Nursing, Physiotherapy, Occupation - al inerapy, Recreational Therapy, and Round Table in Psychiatic Nursing Uinical experience is given each student in all services to give her sound preparation in the nursing care of the various types of psychiatic patients. With a daily census of about 1500 patients, the Hastings State Hospital of - fers a rich clinical field for observation and study of the care and treatment neededi to help this unfortunate element of our population. About thirty stu - dents from six schools of nursing are enrolled at present for the course and </seg>
            <seg id="p243">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION it is earnestly hoped that more schools will avail themselves of this opportun - ity for an affiliation which is greatly needed. The whole course is well or - ganized and it is directed by a well qualified nurse who has special advanced preparation in this type of nursing service and who holds a Master of Arts degree. Teachers College, Columbia University. Arrangements are bring made for post graduate courses for graduate nurses who feel the need of this kind of preparation or who have not had it as student nurses. Gready needed in the state are better clinical facilities for teaching ped - latnc nursing. They are totally inadequate to meet the needs of Nebraska accredited schools of nursing. The students of two schools at present are being sent to institutions outside of the state for preparation in this highly important field of nursing service. Plans are under way to conduct a sur - vey of the facilities in the state for affiliations in Public Health Nursing for schools of nursing. The Nebraska State League of Nursing Education has appointed a committee to initiate this project, which will be assisted by the Bureau of Education and Registration of Nurses. In order for these efforts to prove successful, the schools of nursing must become actively interested in the endeavor to overcome the deficiency in the state in this highly im - portant service. More than ever before, emphasis is being placed on the program of ward teaching and closer integration of classroom teaching with ward ex - perience. Nine schools have been working assiduously to improve the teaching of students while they are practicing nursing in the hospital. Merely ex - posing students to a curriculum will not help diem to learn to adjust to die innumerable situations with which they are confronted. They must 'learn by doing", as well as through formal instruction, under intelligent supervision, and the hospital ward is replete with learning situations of great social, psy - chological and scientific significance as well as for the development of skills and technics. Thorndyke says "There must be an opportunity to point out mistakes so as to avoid them." "Wnat is taught in the curriculum for nurses affects the very lives of individuals and therefore safety of die public and prevention of disease are of paramount importance in the education of nurses. The new curriculum prepared by die Curriculum Committee of die Na - tional League of Nursing Education serves as a guide for developing die teaching program in schools of nursing. During the institute for nurses, Dr. A. C. Bachmeyer of the University of Chicago in his address stated: "This Committee refutes die idea so ardently supported for many years that die basic training of die nurse should deal only with the bed-side care of die sick. It strongly contends that 'health' nursing is just is important and as basic as 'sick' nursing. This is in accord with the trend in Modern Medi - cine in which an ever increasing emphasis is placed on die prevention and con - trol of disease rather than on cure, important as that continues to be. </seg>
            <seg id="p244">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT The new curriculum, also recognizes the need for instruction in sociology and psychology in order that die nurse may know something of society and may have knowledge to guide her in her social adjustments and human re - lations. Emphasis is placed upon developing a proper balance between die - oretical and practical studies. The hospital nursing unit is to be regarded in die same light as is die chemical or nutritional laboratory. Opportunity should be afforded for recreation, for the up-building of die student's own health, for die development of her cultural interests. The philosophy and die aims of die Committee are set forth in dear and definite terms. The goal is die production of well-trained, competent and intelligent nurses, who can carry responsibility, who can meet the exigen - cies of professional service widi confidence and who can render the highest quality of nursing service of whatever type die community has need." Faculty Preparation All but three of the directors or superintendents of schools of nursing hold college degrees, and all have had college courses in nursing education. It is very commendable that so many nurses on die faculties of schools, as directors, instructors or supervisors have taken advanced college courses in administration, teaching methods and supervision during die last two years, This work has been done at die University of Chicago, the Universities of Minnesota, Michigan, Nebraska, Creighton, Teachers College Columbia Un - iversity, and odier institutions of higher learning. The new curriculum can - not be made effective widiout a well prepared faculty and broad, general ed - uration as a background is as essential as die basic course in the school of nursing. Since more and more students with college preparation are enter - ing our schools of nursing, it is incumbent upon nurses on die faculty (dir - ectors, instructors, and supervisors) to prepare themselves accordingly for dieir work widi students on a professional level of education. The basic course given in accredited schools of nursing is die foundation which every reg - istered nurse must have completed in order to qualify for advanced or specialized courses in whatever field of nursing she desires to practice. There - fore, a well prepared faculty is necessary, as a program of education or a school is no stronger than the abilities of die faculty members to make the whole curriculum effective. State Examinations Three state examinations for nurses were held each year for graduates of Nebraska accredited schools of nursing to become licensed, and for those from other odier states who were eligible (meet Nebraska legal requirements) but who were not registered in odier states. The objective type of examination questions are given in five subjects and diey are prefered by die examinees to die essay type of questions which are used in five subjects. The exam - inations are given in Omaha and Lincoln. </seg>
            <seg id="p245">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION During the biennium five hundred and thirty nurses (inclusive or those who had to repeat) took the examinations and, of this number, sixty-nine failed. The subjects in which most of the failures occur are: Psychiatric Nursing (Nervous and Mental), Anatomy and Physiology, Materia Medica, and Ethics and History of Nursing. Licenses Issued by the Bureau of Education and Registration for Nurses From January 1, 1937 to January 1, 1939 Licenses issued by reciprocity 90 Licenses issued by examination. 456 Total number of nurses licensed (now) for active servicc.2,751 Total number of nurses assigned to non-practice. 1,774 Approximately 411 nurses have been transferred from Nebraska to other states where they presented their credentials for registration through recipro - city. Note: The numbers above change continually. The purpose of licensure or registration of nurses is to provide pro - fessional nursing in order to protect the public as far as possible from in - competent nurses just as licensure of physicians, dentists, pharmacists and the certification of teachers is required to protect the public against incom - petence in those professions as far as possible. " "R. N." is the symbol of the Registered Nurse. There's meaning to the symbol. It is the state's guarantee that the nurse has met all legal requirements for registration in that state and practices nursing by virtue of her professional preparation, knowledge and legal status. The symbol safe - guards the patient and it identifies the nurse." Conclusion At present, no advanced, specialized courses for nurses registered in Nebraska are maintained continuously on a pemanent basis in any college or university in the state, therefore our nurses must go to institutions of high - er learning in other states where such courses are organized in well equipped departments provided for nursing education on a professional level. One of the most important aims of the Bureau of Education and Registration for Nurses and of the nurses throughout the state whose fees maintain the Bur - eau, is to accumulate adequate funds to assure permanency of the Bureau and to eventually be financially able to establish college courses in die special - ized fields of nursing in some university or college in the state in a depart - ment well equipped to meet the needs of nurses (library, demonstration rooms, laboratories, etc.) . At present it is commendable that Nebraska </seg>
            <seg id="p246">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT nurses incur the expense and make the effort to go some distance to improve themselves for better service in die community wherever they may be lo - cated in die state. This is necessary in die light of changing conditions, new mediods, and newer fields of service opening to nurses. In speaking on die profession of nursing, Dr. A. C. Bachmeyer of die University of Chicago maintains: ' "The profession of Nursing renders a great humanitarian service in our homes, in our hospitals, in die highways and by-ways of die community. The public, through our great educational institutions, public and private, recognizes die need for and makes provisions for die education and training of '■ students in all other professions. Why not nursing? Surely die profession of nursing merits die same consideration. The public is quick to call for nurses' services in times of epidemic, flood, war or other great disasters. It places great reliance upon her service when illness invades die family. Why not provide proper schools and adequate financial support for diem so that in die normal course of community life as well as in. times of great distress there may be an assurance that die nurse will be properly prepared to render a high standard of service whether it be in die home, in institutions or in die community at large."
