SE1ZIRES ANU CONVICTIONS During the last biennium the Commission has caused the airtil of 236 persons charged with violations of the Game and Fish laws: 176 of these were convicted and paid fines; 16 jail sentences intlicted. The total lines imposed and paid to the various county treasurers amounted to $1,4X8.70. The number of unlawful fishing nets and traps confiscated and de stroyed during the past two years were 822. Twenty-one seines were destroyed during the year of 1913 by the different Ux-il and special game wardens. A great many lines, having more than the legal number of hooks thereon, have also been destroyed. In every case wh&lt; re tish were found in these tiaps they were released. During 19 IB over 2.80(1 pounds of fish and thre^ deer were confiscated and given to ihe nor. Fourteen grouse, twelve prairie chickens, five ducks and 60 other ! irds were con - fiscated and given to state institutions or poor pto"le. During 1914 several kind of game and about 700 pounds of fish were distributed among the different state institutions. There were no seine licenses issued during the past I i.nniinn. Judges and prosecuting attorneys before whom nearly all prosecutions were brought seemed very lenient in imposing penalties. In every in - stance a minimum fine was given. The officers of this department have at a'l times endeavored to do their duty and have at no time insisted upon heavy fines for first offense, but in several instances where parties have t?en arrested the second time we have tried to have a greater lienalty imposed. In many cases where the offense was trivial, as in case K parties hunting without a license, the offender has been pernitted to with 8 warning. GAME BIRDS The propagation of Ring-neck pheasants and other game birds in ■ activity in the state has not proved as successful as had been expected. In the first place, to carry on the propagation of thev». birds there would have to be a large tract of land secured in order to give plenty of space and to allow as much as possible the liberty they would have in the wild state. The birds will not do well penned up. When this propagation was started there was not enough money appropriated to provide for a large space and the birds were kept for a time at the City Park where they had shelter, but noi enough space to roam and get sunshine. The last legis - lature discontinued the appropriation for this work and the birds then tia-itivity «en stnt out over the state to the most suitable places, mostly Kj^ed districts and river farms. I have kept in touch with parties who reived these birds and have hid several very good reports from them. have learned that they have increased in number and are in healthy ndition. They can be seen in great number along the Niobrara river and also along the Platte. There were some placed on an island in the Ptette near Columbus and they have stayed very close an 1 are doing fine The distribution is as follows: 2 birds — Ilalsey.

The general condition of game in this suite is quite satisfactory con - sidering the protection we are able to give, including quail, which have increased a great deal in some western counties in the, state. The severe winters are hard on game of this kind. However, there has been a big increase during the last few years. People are becoming more interested in the Game and Fish of the state and a great many cooperate with this department in the preservation of the same. It was only a few years ago I hen no one thought of buying a hunting license, but now we scarcely er find a hunter or sportsman without one. RECOMMENDATIONS. I would recommend that a bill be passed prohibiting all un-uaturali/.cd foreign born persons from carrying fire arms, also recommend that a bill be passed by the legislature for all moneys derived from the sale of licenses be used for the protection and propagation of game and tish. The Game and Fish Commission employ three deputy wardens on a salary not to exceed eight months of the year, leaving four months for each deputy without employment, and giving the department the actual service of two men for twelve months. This is insufficient assistance, and 1 would recommend that a bHl be passed allowing at least the three deputies pay for twelve months of the year. This department also appoints a great many special deputies, who receive no compensation, excepting one-half of the tine actually imposed and collected from violations, and in this case the special deputies must act as complaining witnesses. These special deputies do not feel disposed to spend their time protecting th" game and fish, with only a prospect of receiving a portion of a fine imposed on some friend or neighbor; thus very little assistance is secured from this source. ! would recommend that the appointment of special deputies be </seg>

VALENTINE SIB-STATION". At this hatchery the main improvements were the addition of two large and four small ponds covering in all about ten acres — the two larger for Bass, Crappie and Perch culture and the smaller ponds for spawning and nursery ponds. The old division pond dam has been strengthened and commodious spillways built around all dams in ravine. On the 2d day of July, 15*13, a cloudburst swept down government canyon from which the water supply is drawn for this hatchery. This flood carried out a partlv constructed dam at the head of the pond system, and part of the old diver - sion dam and supply pipe line causing a property loss of about $500.00 and the loss of thousands of Bass, both young and adult, but as they were car - ried directly into the Minnechaduza Creek and from thence into the Nio brara River they will go far towards stocking the sloughs and bayous along this stream. This damage to ponds and embankments was promptly re - paired and m-.-asures taken to prevent a repetition of this kind of accident in future. In addition to the pond building, the shanty used for a tool house during the time the two original ponds and cottage were built has been lined with plaster board partitioned off, a veranda put on and con - verted into a dwelling for one of the employees; a cement walk has been built from roadway to Foreman's cottage; the lawn seeded to blue grass and a number of shade trees planted. The original supply pipe ditch has been filled in, considerable grading done around hatching house and other parts of the pond system. In all it is estimated that 250,000 yards of dirt has been moved in making improvements during the period covered by thic report; a substantial bridge has been built across the Minnecha - duza Creek at the entrance to state property hatchery and employee* </seg>

OPKNINC. OF RKSKRVAT1ON. The For* Niobrara Military Reservation, of which the hatchery site «a&gt; formerly a part, was opened to settlement in April, 1914 and in order to protect the hatchery water supply the officials of the town of Valentine purchased the land along government canyon creek from the present site to the head of creek at a cost of about MM.M, and they should be reim - l.ursed for this outlay out of the next appropriation This additional land should be fenced. CONSERVATION Out of the .*::, iMiii.no fund appropriated by the last legislature foi thi&gt; purpose, drying up ponds and shallow lakes have been seined and thou sands of fish that otherwise would have perished have Uecn transplanted to living waters near the following points: Ashland Saunders county: Forest Cit&gt; and Bellevue, Sarpy county; Staplehurst, Seward county; Cody and Dewey Lake, Cherry county: Oakland. Hurt county; South Sioux. Jackson ind Homer. Dakota county; Champion Chase county, and Culbertaon, Hitchcock county. While it would be impractical on account of the delay in handling to keep a strict account of the number of fish handled in this way at a low estimate at Wast Null tish from Ingerllngs to adults have been transplanted comprising Bass, Croppie, 1'erch Sunfish. Catfish. Bullheads, Carp and Buffalo fish; by actual count over H.immi adult Croppie were transplanted from Jackaca to Crystal Lake. Dakota county, and every complaint of tish liable to perish in this way has been investi - gated and wherever practical or profitable to the state interests the fish h.ive been saved On account of the large number of drainage projects and in straightening of streams this leaves ratals and shallow pools into which the fish go during periods of high water and when the water re pflirm livins in the vicinity usually take out the larger tish and the balance too small for the tal le are left to perish either by the ponds dr&gt;ing an dining late summer or suffocation during the winter. The 1". S. Bun an of Fisheries. Wisconsin, Illinois. Iowa, and many other states are spending large sums on this work, and I consider it just as important as the builclin: and operation of fish hatcheries; many of the lakes in the sand hill see tie i: should have the outlets protected by tubing and screens to prevent the tish | assing out during periods of high water, as the dense atlon In the f hallow ponds and Bwnnpa In that section of the state precludes rhe possibility of profitable seining operations, and the ta tubes and screening would be less than the cost of seining. </seg>

Dining one week in November, 1914. according to tig nished by ihe Fishing Gasette eleven carloads of Carp were sold in tin New York market in direct competition with the lest &gt;:\\\ &gt;vati On page 15 of the 1911 report of the V.

Om ■ nth Dakota which has few streams or lakes adapted to the i-ulti non-game tish, has enacted a law providing thai Carp and Buffalo and other coarse tish be seined or netted by employes of the gani' and lish department, and the fish sold at a reasonable price and the proceeds l» turned into the. fish and game fund for the support of the- game and tish department.

In future I would recommend that none be distributed free, but that all lish be sold at a nominal price-. 1 may be over-optimistic on this, but 1 am firmly of the opinion that if all the Carp now in our streams and lakes could be taken and properly marketed, there would be enough value therein to reimburse the state for every dollar paid for fish propagation in the past twenty years, and the employees of this commission should be empowered to do all seining where it is deemed necessary for the benefit of the game - fish, and the proceeds of the sale of these fish, over expense of conducting the work, should be paid into a fish and game fund foi the support of this department. </seg>

            <seg id="p031">GAME AND FISH COMMISSION 31 IRRIGATION DITCHES While only a small portion of our state is under irrigation, there has been more or less complaint of loss of game fish on account of intakes not being screened, and a law was enacted at the last session of our legisla - ture requiring that intakes be screened. As far as I am aware bo prose - cutions for violations of this law have been made. After thirty years' experience and observation I am convinced that the contention of most ditch managers or superintendents that a fixed or stationery screen cannot be maintained without interfering with the flow of water on account of blocking up with trash and debris, but there is now being manufactured an ngenious device to prevent tish from entering these ditches which is endorsed by many of the fish cult mists in the mountain and Pacific Coast states where irrigation is carried mi extensively, and ;m effort should be made to have the ditch intakes on all streams furnishing water for irriga - tion ■ quipped with this d \ ice. I think very few ditch district manager* would object to installing screens if they were assured the device was practical and would not impede the Mow of water That tin re is con - siderable destruction of fish in these reservoirs, ditches and laterals was amply demonstrated last November win n over s.ooo channel catfish were rescued from the works of the Frenchman Valley Irrigation District near Culbertson after the water was shut off. In this connection I wish to thank Supt. Green of this water district for notifying an agent of this department when the water would be shut off and for his cooperation in removing the fish; he displayed the proper spirit towards this department. FI8HWAY8. At every session of the legislature bills are lattpduced to compel own - ers of dams to build and maintain tishways for the free passage of fish over or around the dams and in some instances these fish passes are needed, but in a state like Nebraska a tishway law should have limitations us to time of operation. On some of the streams at certain seasons there is not enough water for power or milling purposes, and if a dam owner is cam - lulled by law at such times to allow enough water to flow into a tishway to maintain its usefulness it may seriously interfere with the operation of many milling and power plants. If a law requiring the installation of fce simple and cheaply constructed fishway was enacted with the under - ding it was only to be kept in operation during spring freshets or when there was a surplus of water, and to be closed or shut off at other times. 1 think most of the owners of mill and power dams would not object to the expense of putting in fishways, but a drastic law compelling dam owners to build and maintain at all times a working fishway would impose such a hardship on many that it would result only in useless litiga - tion and endless expense in its enforcement. POLLUTION OF STREAMS tThe streams seem to b« looked upon by the owners of many industrial iblishments, by some municipalities and a good many citizens as a nat - ural sewer of filth, and a number of well founded complaints have been made to this department to have this nuisance and detriment to both fish and human life abated — there is at present no law to prevent this pollu - tion. In many states laws have been enacted to stop the use of streams as sewers. In Pennsylvania the Department of Health and the Game and Fish Commission are charged with the duty of abating this menace not only to fish life, but public health and seem to be making substantial progress. Legislation along this line is urgently needed. </seg>

The Carter Lake Club mainly composed of Omaha business and professional men represents an investment of over 1100,000 and main - tains a commodious club house grounds and cottages on Carter Lake, near Omaha. The Seymour Lake Country Club near Ralston is another wealthy Douglas county organization maintaining a costly club house and grounds on Seymour I-Ake. The Chas. Metz Hunting and Fishing Lodge on New - berry Lake, near Cody, Cherry county, Is another famous hunting and fishing club, but not open to the general public, while the better Bass lake* in the sand hill country all have from one to half dozen club houses dotting their shores, the Hackberry Club, located on Hacklwrry Lake, Cherry county, being the latest to build. This club represents an initial invest - ment of about $15,000.00 and will be devoted to fishing and outdoor recrea - tion. Many of the members of this club formerly sjicnt their fishing va - cations in Wisconsin or Minnesota, but have decided that we have just as good Bass fishing within our borders and have resolved hereafter to see "Nebraska Bass waters first," and spend their money at home. Two large public club houses cater to the wants of those who wish to boat and fish on Crystal I&gt;ake, Dakota county, while dozens of summer cottages have been built at this popular lake the past two years. The Yellowstone Club near the mouth of the Elkhorn River is the inecca towards which many Douglas and Sarpy county sportsmen wend their way almost daily during the summer months and there are hundreds of less pretentious fishing and hunting clubs scattered all along the Missouri, Platte, Elkhorn, Loup and other rivers. These organizations are usually composed of the best sports - men who take an interest in our fish and game, and incidentally in out - door life and recreation. Every effort should be made to foster and de velop closer relations between the members of these clubs and the em - ployees of the fish and game department, as our intrests are mutual. Personally I am under obligations to many of these club members for assistance in planting fish and other courtesies extended and they can also be of invaluable aid in the enforcement of proper fish and game legislation. FRICTION OVER FISHING RIGHTS As the nuii'ber of anglers increase there is noticed a disposition on th»- pan oi land owners to question the rights of persons to go u»on their lands to fish in the streams or lakes, and a number of complaints hare been made ihat land owners were preventing persons from fishing in streams after same had been stocked by this Commission. In one instance during 1914 the case of Black vs. Naylor involving the rights to angle in Bordeaux Creek, Dawes County, for trout, the litigation was carried ur to the Supreme Court which upheld the contention of the landowner Naylor that he had a right to exclude from his land* anglers or fishermen. REVENUE COMMENTS. During the years 1911-12 a little over 175,000.00 was collected from all sources, resident and non-resident hunting and fishing licenses, sein - ing licenses and sale of fish for private waters, and a little less than $45,000 was expended by the fish and game department for all pur - poses, so the State Treasury or the State School Fund was richer by over $30,000.00 as a result of the activities of this department. According to figures quoted in the 1914 report of the Louisiana Conservation Com - mission and statistics that I am at present collecting, every state in the Union now has a non-resident hunting and fishing license, the lone </seg>

Practically ev-Fry state in the Union turns the money derived from these licenses into a State Fish and Game Fund. Nebraska alone turns this money into the State School Fund, and the officers of this department are corapellfd every two years to go before the legisla - ture and ask for meagre support for this Commission, when for the past four years it has practically paid into the State Treasury two dollars for every one drawn out. Kansas in the past two years has spent over $150,000.00 on her single fish hatchery alone. The Missouri fish and game departments which are separate 8'ient fully as much, part being derived from their license system, and the Fish Commission received a direct appropriation of J32.000.00 additional. Iowa spent over $100,000 all derived from licenses. Colorado, on the we»t of us, spent three times the amount of Nebraska, and South Dakota, which does not yet have even a State Fish Hatchery, spent $32,000.00 in. a single year, and ha.s about $45,000.00 on hand for the building and equipping of a modern fish hatchery, all derived from licenses, confiscat ion of game, sales of coarse fish, etc. While this department has virtually been trying to make a "silk purse out of a sow's ear" and some misguided people have been wondering why we have not a more efficient game warden's department. Without endeavoring to disparage the work of our neighbor- Ing state. I can justly say that with the possible exception of Kansas, their fish hatrherifs do not bear favorable comparison with ours. These figures are not quoted or comparisons made with the object of asking for more money out of the general fund, but it is time that the sports - men and anglers assert their rights and demand that legislation be enacted m that the money paid by them for fish and game propagation and protection be put where it rightfully belongs and not diverted to other purposes. I have not the figures showing the amounts collected from resident and non-resident fishing and hunting licenses during 1913-14, but it will likely be larger than the prior two years with the exception of the amount derived from seining licensee, none of which have been issued by the present chief warden but this loss of revenue will to made up by the sales of coarse fish, and fish for stocking private waters. RECOMMENDATIONS. Change our present license to a gun and rod tax, to be collected like all other taxes by the county treasurers, and remitted to the State Treasurer, and placed in a separate fund to be known as the Game and Fish Fund, and irake the department self-sustaining in all its Repeal the law licensing seines, except in boundary streams, and enact a law placing a tax on Missouri River fishermen. Proceeds from this tax to be devoted solely to saving fish from overflows along this stream, modeled after the Iowa fish law. Enact a law providing that all seining for coarse fish, except in boundary streams, be done directly by this department, and all proceeds over the exoense of seining be turned into the fish and game fund. Pass a law providing a reasonable size limit at which all game and food fish may be taken, and provide a severe penalty for taking or de - stroying immature fish.

            <seg id="p037">37 for this display the most deplorable tragedy of my life occurred on the 24th day of June, 1914. I detailed my stepson, Mannie A. Bunker, to go to Plattsmouth to secure a large specimen of Catfish caught by George Barr, a fisherman from the Missouri river. On the way to the river to secure the fish on the afternoon of the above date, Chief of Police Ben Rainey and his night officer, named Neuman, overhauled Barr whom ■e wished to arrest for being engaged in an alleged saloon brawl. Al - though there were two officers present to arrest one man, Officer Rainey deemer it necessary to draw a large revolver and in the quarrel and re suiting sculfle, the revolver was discharged, killing my stepson who had got out of the express wagon and was coming up to where the scuffle •ccurred. Although Rainey was not a spectator of the saloon brawl in which Barr was supposed to have taken part and had no warrant to justify him in making what was clearly an illegal arrest, Cass county •fficials have up to date convicted no one for the perpetration of this un - speakable and wholly needless tragedy. FISH DISTRIBUTING CAR. I The 1889 legislature made an appropriation of $2,000.00 for the purpose securing a specially equipped car for handling the products of the fish tcheries, and in 1890 the present fish car "Antelope," was purchased. I has been in service ever since; although this car has been repaired i painted from time to time as needed, it is now becoming structurally ak, and is liable at any time to be condemned by the railroad inspectors being unsafe to haul or handle on passenger trains. The present car s built at a time when all railroads furnished free transportation and only forty-five feet long, and when a new car is provided it should be or 70 feet long, have double the tank room on the present car and juld be equipped with modern heating and lighting system. The cost such a car would range from four to fourteen thousand dollars, accord - ; to whether a built-over or new car was provided. The Montana and chigan fish departments have recently secured Pullman cars, and had sm converted into fish cars at a cost of from four to five thousand dol - *, while the Wisconsin Commission have had a new steel fish car built a cost of thirteen thousand five hundred dollars. NEEDED IMPROVEMENTS. While the state property at both hatcheries is in good shape, it will require some money to continue it in this condition and make better merits. At the Gretna hatchery more cement walks and other cement work should be provided. The Bass, Croppie, Perch and Catfish ponds should ke deepened and the accumulated mud removed; some of the stone dams ■eed reinforcing and other repairs. The ten-inch tile used for flushing mud and leaves out of trout ponds will have to be relaid in some sections and repaired. The main part of the superintendent's residence, which has been erected for over thirty years, requires extensive interior repairs. The fence enclosing fifty-three acres of state property will need some rebuilding and while the wire on this fence is in fair condition, we should in future use either steel or cement posts. A building should be erected for the convenient storing of seines, nets and fishing appliances; also some grading and ditching to take care of flood waters. During heavy rains some provision should be made for taking care of the large number of automobiles that now daily visit the hatchery during the summer months; additional shade trees, sodding, shrubs and vines should be provided. This hatchery is now a beautiful property of which every Nebraskan can justly feel proud, but it can be further improved. </seg>

Cherry county is not only the largest county in the state, but also can claim th&lt; hunting and fishing grounds, and the amount of revenue derived I y this department from those who wish to hunt and fish in this county is large. Now that the success of the work of fish culture at this hatchery it sured it should be improved commensurate with its value to the stat' RESULTS OF FISH Cri.Tl'HK. The present is an era of unrest and inquiry, and few depariinents and institutions escape the shafts of criticism. In a state like ours where only a limite.l amount of &lt; oniinercial fishing is permitted and no tax imi on this, or statistics collected as to its importance to the state, it is diffi - cult to establish the importance of fish and game propagation and protec - tion. Except the showing of revenue derived from those who fish and hunt, a great many people, even among those who tish and hunt exten - sively, pay no attention to the increase or decrease of the supply of game or fish, and when a strange or unknown fish is caught in waters that they have not taken such fish from before, they are loath to admit that it Is the result of fish propagation, or transplanting, but prefer to think that this strange tish, like Topsy in the play of I'ncle Tom's Cabin, "Jess growed." However, it is a well established fact that we had no German Carp in our waters prior to 1883, and that now we have a generous sup - ply of them: that we had no Rainbow Trout prior to 1885 when they were introduced by this Commission, and at this time in streams that are adapted to them they are quite numerous, and the same is true of the Brook Trout, with the possible exception that there might have been a very limited number found in some little streams near the border of South Dakota. Ths l\ S. Fish Commission is generally credited with bringing or accidentally dumping the first Black Bass into the Elkhorn river in the late seventies as the result of a railroad accident. But the excellent Bass fishing now found in the sand-hill country can be all right - fully claimed as the work of this department and the old Fish Commission; no Croppie were found in our waters prior to 1894, except in very limited numbers in sloughs bordering the Missouri river, and their introduction has proven a wonderful success. Perch have not proven so successful, and from some eastern Nebraska waters they have disappeared, but they are still numerous in some localities. As to the success or the value of the propagation of Pike, and the transplanting of Channel Catfish, this is more difficult to determine, as they are both native species, but with all the fishing that is done they are still quite numerous, and in many of our streams afford fine sport, but the attempt to introduce both these species into the sand-hill lakes has been a failure, as the Pike do not seem to thrive and the Catfish will not spawn and reproduce at all in these water*. The countless millions of Bullheads and Sunfish found in all the western lakes, as well as in the eastern part of the state, show they are well adapted to our waters, and our feathered friends, the water fowl, have assisted in distributing them thoroughly over the state.

On the other hand those varieties of fish not propagated, or of which little or no attempt to conserve has been made, are rapidly disappearing. Thirty years ago the waters of eastern Nebraska were teeming with Buffalo fish, today, except in overflow ponds along the Missouri river, a large Buffalo fish is seldom seen. Twenty-five years ago the striped, or what was locally known as thp Straw Bass, were numerous in the lakes in Northeastern Nebraska; today they are practically extinct, and the Fick.-rel is fast disappearing, and Is only found now in a few localities. While some efforts have been made to hatch and conserve the Pickerel, lack of proper conditions have rendered the work unsuccessful. and practically no attention has been paid to the other two varieties. There is no necessity yet in our state for the artificial propagation of the Buffalo fish, for if funds were available thousands of young Buffalo fish could be saved from the overflows along the Missouri river, and a brood stock of the striped Bass should be secured and their propagation begun in one of the large ponds at the Valentine sub-station. While the opportunities for beneficial results in fish culture in prairie states like Nebraska are not to be compared to what can be accomplished in more favored states like Wisconsin or Michigan, yet enough has been attained to show the influence of many over fish production.

This ought to be the creed and aim of every good citizen who wishes to conserve and add to our natural resources STATE PROPERTY AT FISH HATCHERIES.

I am deeply in- debted to many citizens who have co-operated with me in planting fish and furnibhing information as to the conditions of fish life in their sur rounding territory- While all who have made application for fish have probably not got as liberal a supply as they sometimes wished, all have been treated alike and the distribution has been made so as to as nearly as possible meet the requirements of different sections of the state, and I have endeavored to slight no one. I am also under obligations to the press and to employees of the different railroads foi the courteous treat- ment extended both to myself and the other employees of the hatcheries while delivering fish. My colleague. Chief Game Warden Kutenbeck, has given me generous assistance and co-operation at all times, as well as the employees at both hatcheries. All these agencies have contributed their share to whaterer success I may have achieved in this branch of the department Respectfully submitted, W. .1. O'BRIEN, lh l&gt;uty Fi*h Commit si oner.
