         <seg id="p012">8 STATE BOARD OF CONTROL CREATION AND ORGANIZATION The Board of Control came into being with that title in 1913, when the legislative session on April 21 of that year passed and had approved a Bill which changed the name from Board of Commissioners of State Institutions to that of Board of Control. This statute defined the duties and responsibilities of the newly named Board of Control, and it continued under this original mandate until the adoption of a new State Constitution on September 21. 1920. at which time the Board of Control was included as one of the constitutional offices of the State of Nebraska. This is provided for in Article 4, section 19 of the Constitution of the State of Nebraska. This section pro - vides there shall be a Board of Control of state institutions consisting of three members who shall be appointed by the Governor by and with the consent of two-thirds of the members of the Senate. </seg>

         <seg id="p022">ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT Department of Institutions Functional Divisions In order to better facilitate the fulfilling of the obligations imposed upon it by law, the Board of Control in its Department of Institutions found it necessary to set up functional divisions having supervision over some major phase of the Board's duties. These departments are: Divisions of Construction En - gineering, Dietetics, Education, Farming, Finance and Accounts, Operative Engineering, Pharmacy, Prison Industries, and Pro - curement. With the exception of the Prison Industries the names of these different divisions are indicative of the main type of work supervised by each. The Prison Industries is that division of the Board of Control's activities which manu - factures goods for the use of the institutions under the Board iif Control. Its functions are described in greater detail under the bending "Prison Industries". DIVISION OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING In as much as most of the buildings made possible by the 1935 Legislature were not completed until more than two years later, and since no report was made of these building activities in the last biennial report, a complete summary of all construc - tion work completed or arranged for from 1935 to 1939 is being carried in this report. In 1935, before any new buildings were started, a thorough study of the problem of caring for the mentally ill in Nebraska \v;is made, after which a future building program for each hospital for the mentally ill was planned. It is estimated that this program will be sufficient to care for the problem for the next twenty-five years. From present facts obtainable it is considered that a hospital for the mentally ill should not, to he efficiently operated, house more than 2500 patients. De - tailed maps were prepared showing all present improvements 18 </seg>
         <seg id="p023">as well as the proposed new buildings. Service to buildings such as water and fire protection lines, sewers, heating mains, lighting, s :eam tunnels, etc. were designed to adequately serve the future buildings, if and when they are constructed. A land - scapearcHtect was employed to make immediate and future planting pans, and to locate driveways and sid :walks. Since it is impossible to anticipate all of the future n;eds that may arise, it was necessary to make the plans flexible enough' to permit changes without disrupting the whole scheme. With the aid of WPA and the State Planning Board, such a plan Was made for each institution where it was considered likely expansion would be needed. From the years 1935 to 1941. the following funds were available for construction: ; ,: 1935-37 State Fund 5.......... .". '.'¦..

Where possible permanent methods are being employed so that -when a building is repaired, a thorough job is done, and it wil not be necessary to spend large amounts each bien - nium on the same structures. After a building is once in good 19 </seg>
         <seg id="p024">condition, the regular maintenance department in the institu - tion can usually keep it up satisfactorily for many years. There has never been sufficient money for maintenance, to bring all of the plants up to a good standard of maintenance, but it is felt much progress has been made in the past four years. Near the end of the 1937-39 biennium a WPA program was approved by the President allowing the use of approx - imately one million dollars of WPA funds to be spent in the various institutions on major repairs and reconstruction, pro - vided the state can raise an amount equal to 25% of the cost of the work. These federal funds will greatly speed up the work of renovating the various buildings and plants under the Board of Control. The problem of housing state wards and providing necessi - ties and comforts of life will always be facing the State, and for economy's sake, it will be better to first construct adequate buildings using the best known methods and materials; and second, to maintain such buildings and equipment in a good state of repairs, since much permanent damage can be done by lack of repairs at the proper time. Following is a table showing the improvements made and the cost. 20 </seg>

         <seg id="p026">DIETARY DIVISION One of the very essential departments of the Board of Control is the Dietary Division. The division which has the task of planning meals on an exact budget, supervising the buying of food, supplies and equipment for the dining rooms and kitchens, is necessarily of great importance. It has been definitely ascertained that food not only nourishes the body, but has a definite relationship to the mental attitude of those who may partake of it. For example, nothing will cause riot or insubordination in a penitentiary quicker than poor food, poorly prepared food, or insufficient amounts of food. During the past biennium, distinct and very tangible sav - ings have been made by several changes in methods of opera - tion. Improved quality of foods served has necessitated the use of more efficient methods in order to maintain a high standard of service at little change in per capita cost. The problem of planning a balanced diet for a large number of patients and employees is no small one. Where a carefully balanced and adequate diet is provided to undernourished patients, a marked improvement may be observed. To provide at least a pint of milk a day, or its calcium equivalent, also a sufficient amount of fruits and vegetables, the proper amount of meat, fish, and eggs, and also sugars and fats that will maintain a correct bodily weight on a budget which is strictly limited, is no small task, and yet to a reasonable degree, at least, it is felt that this feat has been accomplished for the great majority of patients, inmates, and employees. To be able to accomplish this has not been a rapid process. It has taken time and a good deal of cooperation with other divisions such as the farm products division and the canning departments and meat processing plants, in order that the right kind of foods might be raised and processed by the institutions in sufficient quantities to make them available for inmates and patients. Although marked progress has been made in this procedure, there is still room for more improvement, through better or - ganization, cooperation, and an increased budget, which are necessary in order that the mentally ill and physically handi - capped may obtain a completely adequate diet. Progress is 22 </seg>
         <seg id="p027">being made in that general direction, and as time goes on, no doubt manir of these objectives will be reached. One of the things which has made possible this improvement in the dietary without greatly increasing the cost, has been the perfection of a better \vorking organization during the last biennium. A graduate dietitian has been provided forj each of the four institutions for the mentally handicapped. These appoint - ments, in conjunction with helpful suggestions, food bulletins, and general letters of commendation from the Board's office have resulted in a better trained and more cooperative per - sonnel. Round table discussions, concerning individual pro - blems held between the supervising dietitian andj the heads of the dietary departments in the institution have resulted in better understanding of common problems, greater interest, and a better professional attitude. It has been found necessary in some pis ices, to alter the working schedule of employees, in order to increase efficiency. This was done only after very careful study and much consideration. All of these things have resulted in a personnel which is.much better qualified to do the task t iat they are assigned to. Considering this group of employe es as a whole, they are probably lower paid than any other .group, and yet their interest does not lag, and their cooperation is splendid. Raising standards to a higher degree is feasible, but it is going to be somewhat difficult to select employees of a higher type, unless better salaries may be paid for these services. One of the physical improvements made, was the dressing of all kitchen and dining room employees in white uniforms. This in itself has:had a very definite psycho - logical eff;ct on the morale and general appearance, and an interest in cleanliness in general has been improved with this technique; ¦ /¦ ¦¦'. . . ; Better arid more palitable food has been made possible through several improvements. The specifications on foods purchased from commercial concerns are specifically made with a higher standard of quality than previously. Experimental tests are a so made on foods, to determine in what manner they may be utilized to the best advantage. Jobbers and packers, who would resort to misrepresentation in marketing their pro- 23 </seg>
         <seg id="p028">ducts, in order to dispose of inferior goods at the price charged for first quality foods, have been discouraged. In order to reduce this hazard to a minimum, very accurate checking of all fo&gt;ods is now made to make sure that these commodities are up to specifications. That is, quantity and quality are checked by the stewards and tests and analyses are made by the food administrator, or dietitimi, and when necessary chemical analyses may lie made to determine accurately the ingredients of the food. I'ure Food and Drug laboratories make many tests lor the Board on articles such as baking powder, fish, butter and some canned products, before the quarterly grocery buy is made, and blind tests are run on samples of gelatin and similar foods, according to price. These samples are judged for quality and value. Coffee and tea are tested semi-annually by the University of Nebraska, and they also run tests on dry beans, macaroni and similar foods. One of the biggest problems in handling foods is the sani - tation problem. This is one phase of food preparation which cannot be over-emphasized, and upon which constant attention is necessary. Much of the equipment in the kitchens and food preparation centers was made of wood, and this in most cases was difficult to keep in a sanitary condition because of the absorption ol moisture, the likelihood of cracking, and the tendency to wear away under constant use. In order to elimin - ate this hazard as much as possible, an attempt has been made to replace, in so far as the budget would allow, this wooden equipment with metal, or some other sanitary material. Much o/~ this metaJ equipment is made by the Prison Industries, and thus money is saved and labor is provided for the inmates of some of our state institutions. In a few instances, especially in new buildings, dishwashers have been installed. The reasons for these are: they are more sanitary, reduce breakage, and save a lot of valuable time. Dishwashers have been installed in the new buildings at the Lincoln State Hospital. Hastings State Hospital, Kearney Hospital for the Tuberculous, School for the Deaf, and in the School for the Blind. There is also need for dishwashers, especially, in the larger institutions like the ones at Beatrice and Norfolk. One of the needs which has been called forcibly to our 24 </seg>
         <seg id="p029">attention is that of storage space. More adequate, as well as better storage is needed. In other words some foods show much less loss if they can be kept in lower temperatures, which require art fical refrigeration. This is especially true of such things as cried fruits, cereals, and vegetables; in addition to regular perishables such as meats and dairy products. Be - cause of the production by our own institutions, there is a greater carry-over,of farm.products for a period of time. More storage space is needed, and in addition to this, certain kinds of food produ:ts must be examined at regular intervals to check spoilage and waste. This may be true of potatoes, institution canned goods, etc. Many of the institutions raise most of their own garden products, and the price list is sent out by the supervising dietitian. This price list determines how much shall be charged against the daily menus for the use of such products, and also what should be charged another institution in case the y wish to buy some of the surplus products. . Moderv culinary facilities, preparation rooms, and elec - trical equipment have in some cases been provided. : A new 80 quart mixer was purchased for the Lincoln State Hospital, and one for the Institution for the Feeble Minded at Beatrice. Hav - ing these tieces of equipment, makes possible a greater variety in the met us because of the easier preparation of large quan - tities of foods. Two items in the diet of many institutions which hay: materially relieved the sameness of the menu are the home :anned fruit and vegetables. Most of this material, unless the *c is a cannery building, is prepared in the regular kitchens after the meals are prepared. This has resulted in long hours and extra duty for the kitchen employees. Canner - ies are loc ited at Geneva, Boys Reformatory, and Penitentiary. One of the things which all institutions have t|o be thankful for is the amount and quality of the milk available. Most in - stitutions have their own herds that provide them with milk and crean-, and some have their own pasteurizer. Raw milk is bought from the Lincoln Institutions by Prison Industries, pasteurize I at their Reformatory plant and enough separated there to furnish the cream requirements. The; Prison Indus - tries sell cuahtities to the institutions at it is needed, thus pro- 25 </seg>
         <seg id="p030">viding milk for the Orthopedic Hospital, Home for Dependent Children, Boys Reformatory, Lincoln State Hospital, Peniten - tiary, School for the Deaf, and the School for the Blind. In a little different manner the State Industrial School at Kearney produces its own milk, and in addition sells milk directly to the Hospital for the Tuberculous. The same type of arrange - ment might be used for the manufacture and the distribution of ice cream, as is done for the milk. This would have several advantages. The larger institutions could have it more fre - quently, it would serve as a variation in the menu, would in - troduce more milk into the diet, and is one of the less expensive desserts. This is the first biennium in which accurate per capita meal costs have been kept. This has been made possible through the keeping of accurate records of the number of meals served, and all items of expense accurately tabulated. At the end of each week the complete menu for each day, the total cost, and the cost per capita per meal are sent to the Board's i iff ice. These menus are checked by the supervising dietitian for adequacy, color, and cost, and returned to the institutions with comments. A monthly report is also sent in by the in - stitutions, which breaks clown the foodstuffs into definite cate - gories such as meats, eggs, vegetables, fruits, milk, cream, butter, poultry, etc. This report shows the amount purchased and the amount produced by the institutions, with the cost of each charged separately. This gives quite an accurate picture of the costs, in dollars and cents, for that month's dietary. In past years there were at least eighteen patterns of dishes to be purchased semi-annually. Extra heavy vitrified, rolled - edge vitrified, and semi-porcelain in ransom, racine, two green lines, a blue band, blue lines, black and white checks, and all varieties of floral dinner ware were found in our institutions. The semi-porcelain ware was easily cracked, would craze and was very unsanitary. To simplify this condition standardization was accomplished by introducing- three new types of china all of which were vitri - fied. The plain white rolled edge is used for State subjects, the 26 </seg>
         <seg id="p031">- - ¦' ¦ " ¦ ¦ - ¦ ¦ ¦¦ '¦'-'.¦ white rolled edge with a blue State Seal for employees, and the lighter weight plate edged with blue State Seal and two blue lines for all the Superintendents. For the purpose of improv - ing sanitati m, morale, and the service in our penal institutions, china ware was used to replace the metal cups, plates, and serving disl.es. A record is kept in all institutions of breakage and losses in each dining room. Stainless steel table ware has been introduced for all the institutions. The plain Windsor pattern is used for the State subjects, and the same, with "Staff" on i:he handles, for the employees. This will eliminate the thin black nickel silver previously used:for State subjects, and the silver plated ware which is so difficult to jkeep in good appearance without a burnisher. Savings have been effected through the counting of table ware before and after each meal. In the future table ware will be purchased semi|annually the same as china! A partial list has been prepared of all kitchen utensils sue i as the sauce pans, dippers, and the like, in order to standardize.buying, and so these may be purchased at quan - tity price and on contract. This list will be completed as vapidly as possible.; Great savings have been shown through the pur - chasing of tetter'quality, heavy gauge utensils in preference to those of lighter weight metals previously purchased. Not only has a saving been accomplished in, the. purchasing, but also a saving has resulted in the durability of the utensil. Lighter weight utensils became battered, pounded j out of shape, and very unsightly and unsanitary, where jthe heavier gauge welded handle utensil will stand many years of service. Recipes are now being retested by all i institutions to re - assure the test for accuracy and measurements and ingredients before placing them in the newly proposed standard ; recipe book which it is hoped will be published in Ithe near future, j 27 </seg>
         <seg id="p032">EDUCATIONAL DIVISION The Board of Control, having charge of the schools for the handicapped of the State of Nebraska, namely the School for the Deaf and the School for the Blind, found it necessary to select a Director of Education to coordinate the educational activities in all the State Institutions under the jurisdiction of the Board of Control. The educational program conducted by the Board of Control during the past biennium has been im - proved over that of any other similar periods. In spite of the fact that money has been scarce, every effort lias been made to maintain in all cases the high standard of the educational program as it was set during the last biennium, and in some cases the standards have actually been raised. There has been an increased consciousness on the part of the Board of Control itself in connection with educational matters. There has also been an increased consciousness on the part of Superintendents of the eighteen institutions under the Board of Control, in connection with educational affairs. It is very essential that this consciousness precede any real advancement in the educa - tional program, if such a program is organized on a solid basis. \\ hile no startling changes in the educational program have been made during the biennium, there were several things that seemed very meritorious, and will act as stepping stones for future advancement in the educational program. One of these, the accreditment of the high school in the State Indus - trial School at Kearney to the Nebraska State University, rep - resent*, the achievement of a goal set several years ago. To reach this goal, it has been necessary to reorganize a portion of the crop program of the institution as we/1 as the work detail program of the entire institution, in order that the boys might find the necessary time to attend school. In addition to this reorganization of institution procedures, it was neces - sary to add more and belter qualified teachers, as well as more equipment and materials. This has been accomplished without any undue burden being placed upon the operation or finances of the institution. The making of the high school at the State Industrial School into Kearney West High School, which is accredited to the Nebraska State University, has brought about 28 </seg>
         <seg id="p033">some other interesting results. Now a student ; graduating from Kearney West High School may enter any of j the schools of advanced | learning in Nebraska on the: same basis as graduates of I other accredited High Schools] It |also means that the boys in the high school athletic teams may be able to compete with athleticttermsa rms whose schools are members of the Nebraska State High School Athletic Association. We feel these changes are important for one main reason; since our efforts in the Industrial School are to make the boys as ¦ nearly'normal citizens as possible, it is essential that they be treated as normal individuals, and competition [with other schools whether it be in art, dramatics, music, or athletics will tend to bring about this factor of sociability 'quicker than any one thing. [While '.'only one new teacher was added to the teaching staff during the past biennium, he had charge of the Industrial Arts department which was badly; needed. Thein - sitution has klso improved to a marked extent its; high school reference library, its equipment, and supplies, j All of these help to make a better educational program. Another of the out - standing educational advancements during the last biennium has been the addition of a recreational supervisor tp the teach - ing staff at Geneva, Beatrice, and the School for the Blind. These recreational supervisors have provided'a phase of work for the .students, in those institutions where! they :are located, that had beer badly needed for some time, jln all; three cases the emphasis in recreation has been placed upon the social factor of the children, how to make the students: appear and act as normal individuals. In line with one of the more recent tendencies in education, visual education has been strengthened through the purchase of sound on film moving picture machines, at :he Orthopedic Hospital, Geneva 1, York/School for the Deaf, Genoa, Lincoln State Hospital, and Beatrice. These machines may be used for educational purposes,^ as well as recreation. ¦:/•¦¦:'.¦ ¦"' ."¦.'¦ i ¦¦¦¦' At the Orthopedic Hospital a kindergarten teacher was added, which filled a dire need in the educational program in that institutiDn, and in addition it was made possible through extension courses on the elementary school level, to provide 29 </seg>
         <seg id="p034">education and instruction tor children in convalescent homes. This is one phase of the educational work throughout the state, which is so neglected, and one which needs to be corrected by means of comprehensive laws and financial assistance in order that the handicapped children may receive the education to which they are entitled. More and more the educational work in the children's in - stitutions, where the children have been committed for delin - quency, has become a factor in reducing discipline, and develop - ing contentment. The example set by those in school, who makes marked progress, is an incentive to those who previously had a disliking for school. The l&gt;ig majority of the children in these correctional institutions are on the junior high school and high school levels, and where it is not possible to find in the high school curriculum the subjects desired, these may be obtained through the extension division of the State University. The correlation of vocational work with the studies in the class room is developing new vocational interest, and may well pre - pare the way for vocational ability, which will enable the child tv find better [placement and adjustment when he leaves the institution. It is also well tv call attention to the fact that in connection with the educational program and in close cooperation with the Child Welfare Department, the Director of Education has had charge of the psychological testing in the children's institutions. Referals made to the Child Wel - fare Division for psychometric examination are referred to the Director of Education, who either gives the examinations personally or refers them to the Department of Educational F'hychology of the State University for their consideration. This is true of all the children's institutions, with the exception of the Orthopedic Hospital, and the Institution for Feeble Minded. In these two cases referals for examination are made to the Child Welfare Division, who in turn refer them directly to the Department of General Psychology at the University of Ne - braska. Not only are the special referals for psychometric tests taken care of, but as a matter of routine procedure, all incoming children in the state institutions are given a group 30 </seg>
         <seg id="p035">intelligence test. In addition to the group intelligence test there may be other tests of achievement, aptitude, etc. 1, given. The testing program has become one of the major, portions of the educational director's work. This is probably a good thing since most of :he children attend school in the! institutions, and since practical y all of them are maladjusted when: they come into the- institutions. Surely if an educational program of understanding and merit is given to these children, some know - ledge must be had of their mental potentialities and educational achievement, '\ ocational interests, emotional and behavior pat - terns. It is also desirable that some record be made from a statistical standpoint, as to the probable cause of the commit - ment of the children to the institution. If no'record is kept of the mental potentialities of all of the incoming children, it is pretty difficu t to draw any general conclusions as to their mental condkions, and the part they play; in determining children's beMavior patterns. Not only are they needed then for the; purposes of education, but the record will also be| needed to make the case history of a child more adequate. Until Junj of 1939 the Director of Education! worked in close contact with Dr. Richie, the staff Psychiatrist of the Child Welfare Division. At that time Dr. Richie resigned and no one has b:en appointed to take his place. However, the cooperation between the Child Welfare Division and the Di-j rector of Edu ration, is still present, in order that an unneces- - sary duplication of records and efforts may not be had. The primary interest of both divisions is the welfare of the child, and the psychometric testing is directed toward that end. 31 </seg>
         <seg id="p036">THE FARMING DIVISION Dairy Division For the past nine and one-half years the dairy herds in the state institutions have been undergoing improvements, and this work has been supervised by one person working directly out of the office of the Board of Control. In this length of time, considerable progress has been made toward the de - velopment of more efficient dairy herds. One of the most important improvements has been to provide a constant and adequate source of high grade milk, which is one of the basic foods used by 9,000 people in the Nebraska institutions under the jurisdiction of the Hoard of Control. In 1932 the entire number of dairy herds together in the institutions produced a total of almost 4,000.000 pounds of milk, while in 1938 all of the dairy herds together produced almost 6,000,000 pounds of milk. This production practically fills the basic needs for all of the institution milk requirements. Also in 1932, in spite of the high production at that time, five institutions were buy - ing milk from commercial distributors. At the present time ;ill of the basic requirements for the institution milk needs are supplied l&gt;y the dairy herds of the institutions. In the six years intervening between 1932 and 1939, the production per cow has been materially increased not only in pounds of milk, but also in pounds of butter fat. In 1932 the average cow pro - duced 9.452 pounds of milk a year, which contained 333.7 pounds of butter fat; while in 1938 the average cow produced 10,680 pounds of milk a year, which contained 373.8 pounds of butter fat. This increase in production has resulted in more profitable dairy herds. If the dairy herds were still on the same pro - duction level per cow as in 1932, it would be necessary to main - tain 66 more producing cows to equal the present total milk and butter fat production, with the resultant increased cost for feed. If the same price were used for feeds for the six year period, the average cow in 1938 would return fifteen dollars more, over and above the feed cost, than in 1932. As a result with 600 cows now engaged in milk production, the income over and above the feed costs would amount to nine 32 </seg>
         <seg id="p037">thousand dollars more a year. This improvement in the pro - duction record of the cattle has been accomplished chiefly be - cause of a rigid health program which has been applied to all of the her is in the institutions. This hygienic program has required regular testing of the dairy herds for Tuberculosis, Bangs Disease, (Contagious Abortion) and Mastitis or Udder infection, with the'resultant elimination from the herds'of all infected cattle. 1 Anpthtr of. the essential contributing! factors in the in - creased he rcl production has been the establishment of a scientific breeding program. The replacement stock is being raised at the different institutions, and by the use of carefully selected pure bred sjres.the replacement of individuals of the herd has resulted in a. higher production! record per animal with each new generation introduced. Ani adjunct to the im - proved production record has been the improvement of the type of cow due to the use of pure bred sires, j j Having supervision of the production! of all of'the milk consumed in the institutions is a very essential thing. It enables th&lt; Board of Control to know definitely that the milk used in each institution is of high quality, not only as regards percentage of. butter fat, but also as regards the condition of the milk so far as sanitation and disease germs are concerned. As was said earlier in this statement, milk is one of the essential foods used in all of the institutions, and jin some, especially such as tne Hospital for the Tuberculous and the Children's Institution: where it is used in greater quantities, it is es - sential tha the milk supply be of high standard in order to pro - vide adequately a proper food for undernourished children. It is somewhat difficult for the Board of Control to buy milk commercially and be sure that its production has been carefully supervised and that the content of the milk is of high quality. Another way in which the dairy herd serves the state, is as the background for training in a scientific educational dairy program at the State Industrial School in Kearney. This dairy herd also is frequently used by visiting high schools for dairy cattle jud jing. ' ¦¦ • 33 </seg>
         <seg id="p038">Reorganization of Farming Operations In order for these dairy herds to make some of the marked progress already mentioned, it was necessary that an ogan - ized crop production program be instituted at all of the institu - tions having farms. As a result of this need the Board, on July 1, 1938, placed all of the agricultural activities under the direction of the then employed dairy supervisor. Mr. Robert Bell, and changed the title from that of Dairy Supervisor t&lt;i Farm Supervisor. So at the present time the Farm Supervisor looks after not only the dairy program, but also the poultry program, hog program, farm crop program, and general garden - ing activities. While this coordinated agricultural program has been in operation for only one year, considerable progress has been made toward more efficient farming operations. One of the first steps initiated was to work out a balanced agricultural program to fit the requirements of the institution so far as feed needs were concerned. These needs meant not only those of the inmates of the institutions, but also of the live stock kept at the institution. This efficiency was brought about by de - termining the yearly requirements of all of the state institu - tions so far as feeds were concerned, and then the attempt was made to obtain this need as adequately and cheaply as was possible. It was evident from the beginning that the raising of live stock and gardens were the most profitable end of the farming operations. This was true because both of these ac - tivities produced food stuffs that were readily consumed with only a minimum of processing. The field crops, on the other hand, were limited strictly to the feed requii ements of the live stock and poultry at the institutions. Cash crops such as sugar beets, which were formerly put on the open market, have been practically eliminated. It has been very evident that, since the Board finds it necessary to buy large quantities of alfalfa, the increased production of alfalfa wherever feasible, is desirable, and steps have been taken toward that end. Processing Plants Also a more efficient utilization of live stock produce has been effective. A pasteurizing plant for processing- milk was 34 </seg>
         <seg id="p039">installed at the Reformatory for Boys in JLincoln, and all of the milk produced by the institution herds in Lincoln, comes to this plant tor processing. It" is sold to the Prison Industries, who in' tun sell it to the state, institutions under a process de - scribed in jreater detail in the report of the dietician. Since si great number of hogs are produced at the institu - tions, and i large number of fat hogs are ready for slaughter within a short period of time, twice each year, it was felt nec - essary |to build a processing plant: to take {care of these fresh meats ;as 1 hey become available. This processing plant was built at the Genoa State Farm, a Minimum Security Institution, whose j inmates come from the Nebraska I State Penitentiary. Formerly :t was necessary to sell the excess production of fat hogs or the open market and then to go|to the open market to buy this meat when it was needed later on by the same institutions that had raised the hogs in the first place. A very similar sit lation developed in regard to the poultry, where 15,000 cockerels, which were raised annually, in addition to the pullets, become of marketable size at approximately the same time It was necessary to keep these cockerels on feed past the stage where,they would make efficient gains, or else it was necessary to sell them on the open market because they could not De consumed by the institutions \ as fast as they be - came read y for slaughter. The second year of the biennium they were hauled into Lincoln by a state truck and were dressed ard drawn, and placed in cold storage. They were 1 then supplied: to the institutions as their need developed for poultry. ' ' , ;¦¦' ) Poultry Division j ; \ Egg production has been increased steadily as the size of the flocks 'ias been increased, and as fast asjthe necessary hous - ing facilities are made available. And yet the production of eggs is not yet up to the needs of the state institutions. When it is possible to bring the production up to the basic needs of the state institutions, it will no doubt be necessary to provide cold storage facilities for eggs, in order that during the seasons of excess production it may be possible to keep some of the 35 </seg>
         <seg id="p040">eggs so that there are enough available during the slack pro - duction season. The reorganized poultry program is under way and already is giving encouraging results. This plan is funda - mentally the same as that followed in the development of the efficiency of dairy herds. The development of a scientific health program, which protected the health of the flock I&gt;y the elimination of those with diseases and by replacing breeding stock from the best family lines, and by improving feed formulas, improving housing conditions, and introducing other scientific procedures, has improved the flocks. Two new incubators were installed in the Hastings State Hospital in 1939, each with a capacity of 8,000 egg*. Eggs for hatching were supplied from the three best white leghorn flocks, which are located at the Hastings State Hospital, the Girls Training School, and the Genoa State Farm. These leg - horn flocks were seleced because they had demonstrated higher eSS production records than the other breeds which had been used, and eggs are oi greater importance in the dietary of the institutions than the poultry meat. All of the hens selected for breeding purposes in these three flocks were carefully selected because of their high production record, and also the large size of the eggs produced. These hens were then banded and housed separately. They were also tested for pullorum disease and any reactors found were removed. This was a very essential part of the selection because pullorum disease is transmitted through the c^ and accounts for a great part of the mortality in baby chicks, while in the bmnd stage. The hens selected for brooding purposes were mated with selected cockerels from the high producing families in the University of Nebraska State Agricultural College flock. The hatchery operations were unusually successful, with 31,000 chicks hatched from 43.000 eggs, and all the institutions reported the best success with the brooding of their baby chicks that had ever been experienced, incurring a mortality average of about five per cent. After the brooding age, the pullets were placed on clean range and housed in inexpensive open sided shelters. At the present time the pullets are the largest in size, most vig - orous, and best colored of any raised, and can reasonably be 36 </seg>
         <seg id="p041">expected to give the best egg production in the coming season that has yet been achieved. The demand for dressed.poultry meat at the state insti - tutions far exceeds the supply of the young cockerels. To meet this further need, the turkey raising operations are being expanded. Turkeys have been chosen for this purpose in pref - erence to other classes of fowl for two reasons. First, the meat can be produced more economically: at the institutions than chicken or duck meat, and also they arc ready for slaugh - ter in a season when other fowls are not so readily available. Another reason why turkey raising is desirable is because the Board of Cdntrol during the Holiday season, in order to make the Holidays more appropriate, has bought on the open market, large numbers of turkeys for institution consumption. Turkeys also are .very beneficial in helping to keepj down insect pests, and in so doing provide themselves with considerable food materials. In order to produce a higher; quality of turkey, toms of the full breasted meat type were purchased on the Pacific Coast, and mated with fifty select j native hens in the flock.at tie Hastings State.Hospital. Also select eggs were purchased from the breeder on the Pacific; Coast of the same . type of turkey and hatched at the .Hastings Statue Hospital/ in order to obtain full blooded foundation stock. At this time these poults promise to be considerably superior ¦to our native strain. Pcults sired by full breasted strain toms were pur - chased for the Reformatory for Boys and the Girl's Training School, in rhe spring of 1939. As more breeding stock is avail - able from the flock at Hastings State Hospital other turkey flocks will be established at the institution for the Feeble Minded at Beatrice, and the State Industrial School for Boys at Kearne}. " : Swine Division !. - '¦¦':¦¦:¦" ¦¦¦:'¦. ¦-¦'¦'¦ ..."¦ - ::. ..-:. -'.¦¦''-.. '¦ :¦'''. ;'-';, :. ! ; The development of the swine program has showed much the same pattern as that used in the development of dairy herds for the past nine years. The greatest improvement in raising the standards of swine herds can be expected to come, through using sanit try methods which will prevent the death losses and 37 </seg>
         <seg id="p042">costly gains in weight caused by disease. So far as the equip - ment permits, the hogs are being raised in-portable hog houses which are moved to a clean range at least once each year. This has eliminated most of the death losses and lack of thrift - iness caused by worms and necrotic entritis. All pigs are vac - cinated lor cholera shortly after weaning, and this in itself lias helped to reduce the losses to a minimum. Very careful attention has also been given to the selection of sires, since about fifteen sires will determine to a large extent the quality of twenty-five hundred hogs. A pure bred Hampshire herd is being developed at the Reformatory for Boys, and this, it is expected, will furnish most of the required sires for the other institution's herds. GARDEN PROGRAM The institution gardens supply over two million pounds of readily edible vegetables and fruits annually, with tomatoes being the one crop of greatest value, and sweet corn a close second. The bulk of this garden produce is consumed as it is harvested. Varieties are so selected and planting so spaced that there is a fairly steady supply for six months. At times when there is a surplus raised at any institution, the extra amount produced is cither sold to other institutions or is canned, pickled, or dried, or stored for winter consumption by the institution which raises it. In order to derive the most benefit from the garden, can - neries are operated at the Reformatory for Boys, the State Penitentiary, Genoa State Farm, and the Girl's Training School. These arc the institutions where cannery buildings exist as such, and where surplus garden products are canned. This does not preclude the canning operations which are carried on with the urdinary kitchen facilities in other institutions. All of the garden seed for 1939 was purchased at one time by formal competitive bids. Specifications for these bids in- 38 </seg>
         <seg id="p043">eluded a juarantee as to purity and germination. Samples of , all seeds delivered under this bidding system were tested by the State Seed Laboratory for purity and j germination. Those failing to meet the specific requirements ¦ and those failing to meet this guarantee were rejected. By this method of pur - chasing, ?ve have succeeded in procuring better seed at a lower cost.: Much attention has been given jto newly developed strains tl at are more drouth and disease]resistant. So far as it is practicable, the garden crops are bjeing planted so that standard row-crop farm implements can) be used for tillage. This will eliminate much of the slow tedious hand cultivation methods, and in consequence, larger acreages can be efficiently handled.';. '" . ¦ : /.;: ¦/¦ ¦. '¦"'/'¦¦'-J- :¦¦'[ . ...-¦¦ •¦¦..?' ¦¦ : -¦'."•¦' ¦-. . ;\.!.: I More irrigation ¦ equipment has been installed and more 'land is teing brought to grade in an effort to increase the garden production at several institutions, by means of pump irrigatior. This has been notably true jat the Norfolk and Hastings State Hospitals, and also at York and (Geneva. These institutions have shown an appreciable increase in production as a rest It. Not only is the increase in production of benefit, but it .also results in the saving to the state in another mariner. A seed which has germinated and started to grow is not wasted because of lack of moisture as has been the case in previous years. : FIELD CROPS I i Most of the cash crops raised on tfhe farm have been elimin - ated fro m the farm program because every acre of available farm lard is needed for the support of live stock and poultry, and also 1; because of the man-hours required ]to till the soil. Because of extreme drouth conditions existing in Nebraska in the last several years,, it has been necessary to plant large quantities of the so-called "Camel Crops," because of their greater producing qualities under drouth conditions. Atlas sorgo has replaced corn almost entirely for silage purposes. sorgo hi 39 </seg>
         <seg id="p044">Other sorghum varieties have also replaced corn to a great extent, for grain production. While it is still necessary to buy tame hay in large quantities, every effort is being made to increase the alfalfa acreage. This, of course, has been difficult to do because of the combined drouth and grasshopper infesta - tion. In spite of these handicaps, the total acreage is slowly being increased as conditions permit, and is one of the definite objectives in the farm program at the present time. It is estimated that it will require the production of at least 500 acres of alfalfa to supply the needs of the live stock and poultry departments in the institutions. PASTURES A definite plan for pasture rotation has been incorporated in, and platted for, each institutional program. This is being followed as nearly as is practicable. This has already resulted in more productive pastures because it has resulted in greater acreage, and the production is more continuous and prolonged during the growing season each year. This plan, which is now in operation, consists of a four field rotation scheme, in which sweet clover, rye, and sudan grass are planted in rotation. POTATOES Because ot soil, climatic, and hydrostatic conditions at Kearney, Hastings, and Grand Island, there are located at these places the largest acreages devoted to the growing of potatoes. Ihe potatoes produced at these institutions consistently yield higher averages, and are of a better quality than those raised elsewhere by the Board of Control. Many surpluses raised at the already mentioned institutions are sold to other institu - tions under the Board of Control. These sales usually take place after the other institutions' local crops are consumed. Very careful attention has been given to the source of the seed 40 </seg>
         <seg id="p045">.¦potatoes'"used,- since the seed is such an important factor in 'the yield «nd the quality of the crop. Only a -certified seed jis purchased.

In a few leases; however, the hybrid va iety has not been stiperior. It will take several years of experimentation to determine which location needs u-hich variety, and this will be one of the objectives which must be worked toward. ;'.'.¦'. BIND-WEED ERADICATION Infest ition of weed seed and insects has been one of the serious obstacles in farming operations during the past bien - riium, and these coupled with the drouth; have resulted in a very seriously curtailed production. Of all of the weeds, no doubt the bind-weed infestation is the worst, due to the nature of the we«d. It has existed on a number of the state institution farms, for several years, and though the men in charge of the farming and gardening operations have been much concerned about it, there has been no definite plan to eradicate it. With the aid of the State Bind-Weed Committee, 600 acres of land at the institutions hear Lincoln were surveyed at a time when the bind-v reed appeared to be at its worst. A chart was drawn up, showing the location and the extent of infested areas, but funds have not permitted the purchase of sodium chlorate to use on thi bind-weed, in order to carry out this; one successful means of eradication. 41 </seg>
         <seg id="p046">Approximately 50 acres of bind-weed infested land have been subjected to subsurface tillage during the growing season of 1939. As a result of this the plants are showing a great loss of vigor, but it will require at least another season of tillage to destroy them completely. With the addition of one or more duckfoot machines, and a carload of sodium chlorate, it is hoped that most of the bind-weed can be eradicated from the state land. FORESTRY Due to the prolonged drouth, thousands of trees have died on state institution land. During these drouth years it has been very conclusively demonstrated by both Federal and State Agencies that properly arranged planting of trees contribute immensely to increased crop production. They accomplish this by catching the drifting snow in winter and by checking the hot winds in summer. In cooperation with the United States Forestry Service, shelter belts were planted in the spring of 1939 at the Norfolk State Hospital and at the State Industrial School at Kearney. These numbered about forty thousand trees. Through the University extension department, ten thou - sand Clarke-McXarv seedlings were obtained and planted. Further extension plantings were made at the Reformatory for Boys and Hastings State Hospital and the Lincoln State Hospital. Plans and arrangements are being made to plant several hundred thousand trees in 1940 on State lands under the jurisdiction of the State Board of Control. The Board of Control and the men supervising- the agri - cultural work in the state institutions have appreciated the helpful service and counsel given by the faculty of the Colleges of Agriculture and the University extension department of the College of Agriculture and the several departments in the State Capitol. 42 </seg>

         <seg id="p058">ACCOUNTING DIVISION The 1929 Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, Chapter 83, art - icle 110, in part says, "The Board shall prescribe a uniform system of records and accounts for all institutions junder its control, and shall provide all necessary books, blanks, and other supplies for the making of reports and keeping of accounts. It shall establish a uniform system of bookkeeping, so far as practicable, in similar institutions, and shall institute and recjuire the keeping of a system of accounts and requisi - tions showing the purchase, storage, and consumption of sup - plies for subsistence, construction and other purposes. The Board shall keep at its office in Lincoln, a complete set of books and accounts with each institution, which shall show every contract made, and every preparation by the Legislature for the support of each institution, receipts from all sources and every expenditure made for any purpose. Said baoks and records shall at all times be open to the public inspection." With this statute in mind, the Board of Control set ap a new internal accounting system in the institutions about tne middle of the first year of the biennium. The financial records of the several institutions operating under the direction of the Board of Control had been changed very little during the past twenty years preceding this biennium. This old system based upon single entry bookkeeping represents items of expense when paid, and not when expense was incurred. These figures were misleading unless they were carefully scrutinized. It was dur - ing this twenty year period that the institutions were increas - ing in size, in activities, and in transactions between them - selves. The single entry system of records was not adequate to provide reliable information for the Board of Control or for the officers of the institutions. The reports would show only the total amount of money disbursed, and the classification of the disbursements, and would not show total costs incurred. Also the operating departments did not appear on the report as a separate cost report, and any production received from the departments were not reported as such on the financial statement of the institution. Such reports were misleading as to per capita operating cost, analyses of expenditures and total 54 </seg>
         <seg id="p059">costs inclined. It was to correct these discrepancies that the Board of Control authorized; the organization of the account - ing system of the institutions under the direction of Mr. C. L. Rogers, supervising accountant. If the superintendents of the institutions arid the Board of Control are to efficiently finance the activiti ;s of the organization on the appropriations made available b &gt;• the Legislature, they must halve, available, ade - quate and accurate reports at their disposal as to the funds on hand, costs incurred against these funds, md an analysis of these costs. The general plan under which the accounting department was reorganized is as follows: (1) Double entry, standardize i bookkeeping systems were installed in all insti - tutions. T lese bookkeeping procedures recorded all cash re - ceived, the production units of all operating departments, of expenses ir cur red, the payment of these obligations, and the record of all materials purchased and used.j Each'department is then charged with its production and operating expenses, and materic 1 requisitioned, and is credited with its' production units. (2) \ financial report is submitted by every institution at the close of each quarter of the fiscal biennium. These re - ports india te fund balances, inventory valuations, accounts payable, the joperating cost of the institution, the cost and the production of the departments, total costs incurred, and the re - sulting per capita cost of that institution, j (3) Adequate and accurate budgets were set up for each institution. The book - keeping sysjtems of the institutions provide an accurate analy - sis of operating costs, and the resulting per capita rate is a sound basis upon which institutional budgets may be computed. (4) Correction of the budgets and financial reports of the institutions were made. This correlation was made since the budget was set up on the basis of a certain per capita cost figure. Ftture statements from institutions should substan - tiate this psr captia cost, if they operate within their budget as is expected. This general plan, as indicated above, will also provide thi: Board of Control with adequate details and ac-. curate information so that requests for operating funds from the institutions in future years may be carefully analyzed before being submitted to the Governor and the Legislature for their consideration. 55 </seg>
         <seg id="p060">The most of the reorganization in the accounting depart- ment has been completed during this biennium. The double entry bookkeeping system has been inaugurated at all the in- stitutions. Some training work is needed at a few of the in- situtions, so that better financial reports may be submitted to the Board of Control. The first few months of the next bien- nium should find the greater part of the required training com- pleted, so that financial reports based on figures from the newly installed records will be available for each quarter of the coming biennium. Budgets have been established for each institution. Against these budgets are charged all contracts, requisitions, etc., as soon as they are encumbered. Institutions are advised monthly of the amount of encumbrance, and also amount of the free balance, so they may govern their future requests and keep within the budgetary figure established for that institution. Consequently, the greatest value, resulting from the reorganized accounting department, is that each in - stitution, as well as the Board's office is aware of theicost of the program, and as each are watching, expenditures are watch- ed more closely, and all will do their part in living within the established budget. 56 </seg>

         <seg id="p069">PRISON INDUSTRIES DIVISION With the passage of the Hawes-Cooper Bill by Congress, the practice of a state selling its prison labor to private con - tractors,; to be used in competition with free labor, was pro - hibited. Consequently, in 1934 the contractors who had been working p isbners in the Nebraska Penitentiary and Reforma - tory for B )ys were forced to give up their operations and the prisoners who had been thus employed became idle. In 1935 the State legislature was called upon to set up a system where - by the inmates of the penal institutions could be given work. The plan known as the, "State Use System of Prison Employ - ment," wa; adopted. Under this plan the Board was author - ized to establish factories suitable for each penal institution. This law provided that all public departments or institutions supported :ri whole or in part by taxation shall purchase prison - made goods. There was a heavy penalty for selling the prison manufactured articles to other than tax-supported departments. However, 'arm: supplies, material, and equipment were exempt from this penalty/ . . Soon after July 1, 1935, the Board of Control established the Nebraska Prison Industries. In as much as this depart - ment was to operate in each of the penal institutions and the products would be sold to the other institutions under the Board, it was set up as a division directly under the Board of Control . In establishing the factories there were several policies followed: . , : ;¦'¦¦¦•'•• First, the Board soon recognized that the principal con - • sumers of the products would be the state institutions under the jurisdiction of the Board of Control, and products meeting their needs must be made. , Second, where possible, factories that would not compete with other Nebraska Industries were established. 65 </seg>
         <seg id="p070">66 Third, since the purpose of the Prison Industries was the employment of prison labor, factories were established that required a minimum of machine labor and a maximum of hand labor. Fourth, the types of Industries that could show a profit were started so that no tax funds would be necessary in operating the division. Fifth, to establish the type of work that is not detrimental to the inmate's health and enables him to learn a trade that will furnish him with a livelihood after his release. Sixth, most of the men to be worked are the type of men who, because of their crime, must be confined within the walls of the I'enitentiary, and work that can be carried on within the enclosure must be provided. 11l order to provide for the starting of the division, the Legislature set up a revolving fund of $10,000 and an equipment fund of $70,000, and the law requires that each fund be paid back to the general fund of the state within ten years if pos - ible. We are pleased to report that at the end of this biennium, after four years of operation, the Nebraska Prison Industries has paid to the State $51,000 of the SBO.OOO loaned, and it ex - pects to be able to pay the remaining $29,000 within the suc - ceeding biennium. The first branches started were the garment factory, the shoe factory, the tailor shop, and the broom factory. The Prison Industries absorbed the factory for the manufacturing of Nebraska automobile lisence plates, as well as of state highway road signs at the Reformatory for Buys. Fur the past three years, not only have the Nebraska automobile li - cense plates been made there, but also the Wyoming auto - mobile license plates have been made, and in exchange for this service, Nebraska has made use of woolen blankets made in the Wyoming State Prison. An exchange of prison-made mer - chandise has also been made with the Utah and Kansas prisons. In each industry as much hand labor as practicable was used, and machines were utilized only when necessary in the production of high standard products. In the shoe factory most of the shoes are made by hand methods. It is felt that this </seg>
         <seg id="p071">not only increases the amount of labor so that more men will be employed, but that a man can learn a trade better and the work is mare rehabilitative when he is taught to work with his hands, md to produce worthwhile articles. Many men are now practicing outside, the trades learned while working for the Nebraska Prison Industries. Following is a list of the Factories and operations con - ducted by Prison Industries: State Penitentiary—Suit arid overcoat factory and clothing factor}, furniture factory, broom factory, feed processing plant and shoe repair. State Reformatory for Boys—License plate factory, highway road-sign factory, hunting badge factory, shoe factory, milk processing plant, and a tree nursery. State Reformatory for Women—Garment and bed linen fac - ¦ "¦' tory- ¦¦'¦ ¦' ''.¦¦ '.: ¦'¦''.¦ ': ' -¦¦ Genoa S ate Farm—Meat processing plant. There were employed an average of 260 men and 12 women during the biennium. In addition to the inmates working for the Prison Industries there were a large number of men work - ing in tie operation and maintenance of the inside of the; prisons and o"n the farms and gardens outside. These activities ; re reported under the activities of each institution at another place. 67 </seg>

         <seg id="p074">CHANGES IN INSTITUTIONAL HEADS DURING THE BIENNII/M Mr. Reuben Clark, Superintendent of the State Industrial School at Kearney, resigned August 1937, and Mr. John F. Gettman, formerly Superintendent oi the Prison Industries was named to succeed him. Mr. Alex Zieg was appointed to succeed Mr. Gettman. Miss Lena Ward and her sister, Miss Suede Ward, acting in the capacity of Superintendent and Assistant Superintendent, respectively, in the Girl's Training School at Geneva, resigned on July 1, 1938 and Mrs. Blanche Clouse, Superintendent of the Woman's Reformatory at York became the Superinten - dent of the Girls Training School. Mrs. Clouse had previous to the time she became Superintendent of the Woman's Refor - matory at York, worked under Miss Ward, as Supervisor in the Girl's Training School. On July 1, 1938 Mrs. Hattie B. Bowley became Superin - tendent of the Woman's Reformatory at York, succeeding Mrs. Clouse. Mrs. Bowley was a former business woman, and just prior to her appointment as Superintendent, was a Supervisor in an NYA Girl's Service project. On December 1, 1938, Dr. D. G. Griffiths, Superintendent lit the Lincoln State Hospital for twenty-five years, resigned and was succeeded by Dr. A. H. Fechner, who previous to that appointment had been Assistant Superintendent of the Hastings State Hospital for the mentally ill at Hastings Nebraska. On January 7, 1939, Ivan S.

         <seg id="p075">On July. 1; 1939 Mr. Woellhaf, Commandant of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Home in Mil ford was automatically removed as the result of the closing of that institution by the legislative enactment of that year. ; I "¦¦ ' '"¦'.*" ¦¦¦¦..¦ ¦" ¦ -¦¦.." ¦. " : ...'¦-. .¦'_¦'¦ t ¦ : "- : REORGANIZATION The Legislature of 1937 gave to the Board of Control supervisioi of the State Assistance program, thus unifying under one organization many of the welfare activities; in the state. Because the Child Welfare Bureau was Administering two of Nebraska's social security programs, Services for Crippled Children and Child Welfare Services, the Child Welfare Bureau w is included in the new Assistance administration. With the beginning of the 1937-1939 biennium, the Board of Control reorganized its program to make the most effective use of th&lt; resources available through the field staff of the State Assistance and Child Welfare. To carry out this pur - pose, the Board created administratively, the Department of Institutions, caring for the old duties of the Board, and the Department of Assistance and Child Welfare to better organ - ize the Assistance program. _.;¦ ¦¦¦.;'! The (hiidrens' institutions, under the Board seemed the most logiral place to demonstrate the value of co-ordinated field servkes by a saving of time, energy, money and the elim - ination oi over-lapping services. Some of the childrens' in - stitutions: had one social service worker who was required to cover the whole State in the supervision of placement, parole and the securing of pertinent data concerning children in their respectivej institutions, the Home for Dependent Children had two such persons, and most of the childrens' institutions had no field service, that work being done by the very busy superintendent. The Child Welfare Division had nine district consultants assigned to various districts covering the whole state, these districts designed to eliminate unnecessary travel and reduce case loads. The addition of the institutional case • load to thje Child Welfare staff, while it was still in the process 71 </seg>
         <seg id="p076">of organization, served to temporarily slow up both organi - zations, but the improved administration of child welfare functions, long before the end of the biennium, pointed the way to further consolidation of field work, with the end in view of organizing such work for the adult institutions along with the Assistance field staff. The staff of the Orthopedic Hospital has been enlarged to include a pediatrician as medical director, and various other specialists, so that complete medical care is now given, in addition to orthopedic care. This staff of specialists has been made available for consultation and care for the children re - ferred by the local physicians of all the childrens' institutions, so that not only has the medical care program of the Orthopedic Hospital heeii improved, but that of all of the other children's institutions. Through the Federal funds made available for the exten - sion of Child Welfare services, a psychiatrist was added to the staff of the Child Welfare Division, so that for the first time since the amendment of the Juvenile Court Law in 1919, the State provided psychiatric and psychological examinations for state wards, as required by the Juvenile Court Law. Further details of the reorganization will he indicated in the individual reports of the childrens' institutions. GIRL'S TRAINING SCHOOL GENEVA. NEBRASKA The Girl's Training School, located at Geneva, Nebraska, was established to provide a school for the retention, educa - tion, industrial training, and reformation of female juvenile delinquents. This is set forth in Chapter 83, paragraph 1201 of the 1929 Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, and paragraph 1202 of the same authority says, "The girls committed to the school shall he instructed in the principles of morality, self - government, domestic duties and such other branches of knowledge as are taught in the public schools of the state. The 72 </seg>
         <seg id="p077">¦Board. majf further provide for instruction in such light, prac - tical industries as may be best suited for their age, sex and capacity." , •. . ' } Girls may enter this institution in the same manner as for the boys who enter the State Industrial School at Kearney, for Chapter 83, paragraph 1204 says, "All proceedings, service of orders, examinations, commitments and Other provisions necessary :o give this article full force and effect shall be made and carried out in accordance with the provisions of article XI of this chapter, and the amendments thereto,; which article, together with any and all amendments thereto, are hereby made part of this article and shall govern all commitments of girls who are fit subjects for an industrial school." No doubt these prousions are almost the same as those pertaining to the State Industrial School for the reason that at one time the boys :nd girls who were juvenile delinquents were sent tb the one institution at Kearney, Nebraska. . 1 A girl may enter the Girl's Training School at Geneva tjhrough commitment by a court or by transfer of the Board of Control from one of the other state institutions.' When they are committed to the institution by the court, they are com - mitted until they are twenty-one years of age, as provided for under Chapter 83, paragraph 1109, or until otherwise discharged or paroled through regulations set up by the institution. There is no minmum age for commitment, but the maximum age for commitment is eighteen years, and the majority of those who enter the institution are between the ages of fifteen and Seventeen years. i &#132;"•;:, . After it has been ascertained, by the social worker in the institutior in conjunction with the staff members of the in - stitution tihat the girl is ready for parole, the Child Welfare Divi - ¦ Jon is notified and a Child Welfare Consultant makes the ar - rangements for a place for the young lady when she is paroled. After it has been determined into which type of place the girl may go, the opportunity for work, the possibility of making an adequate adjustment, and many other factors taken into 73 </seg>
         <seg id="p078">consideration, the report is sent back to the social worker in the institution, who in conjunction with the Case Committee, which consists of the Director of the Child Welfare Division, the Supervisor of Intake and Parole, the Superintendent of the School, and a member of the Board of Control, determine the time the girl shall leave and where she shall go. After the girl has been placed, she is supervised by a Child Welfare Consultant. When she reaches twenty-one years of age, she must be discharged from her parole, or in some cases where it is deemed wise she may be discharged by the Child Welfare Division of the Board of Control before she reaches the age of twenty-one. In some cases also, it may be necessary to keep the girl in the institution until she reaches the legal age for discharge, in which case she may no longer be held against her will. Many of the girls having been discharged so value their training and shelter at the institution that they may either return temporarily or write back for guidance or advice from time to time. While every attempt is made to pevent the girl from relying too strongly upon the shelter of the institution, yet on the other hand, it is probably desirable that enough of an attachment for the institution and its training be created so that the stimulus of this training will help the girl to make her adjustment more effective after she leaves the institution. This adjustment is a matter of individual personality. Education The institution is called, "The Girl's Training School," and according to the citation to the statute in the opening portion of this statement, education is mentioned specifically as the purpose of the institution. It is not surprising to find then, that the educational program is the strongest division of all the activities in the institution. Aside from the maintenance work connected with the institution, there is no other activity carried on at the institution, except the farming, which is not related very closely to the school and its program. The school maintains a seventh and eighth grade on the elementary level. This seventh and eighth grade attempts also 74 </seg>
         <seg id="p079">to meet the heeds of some of the unclassified students on a lower level. In addition a full four year high school is maintained, and is called, "Geneva North High School." This high!school is located within the institution and it is also in the city school district of Geneva. All diplomas issued to the graduates of Geneva North High School are signed by the Superintendent of the Geneva public schools and by officers of the city school board. In this way the diploma issued may be shown at any time in fut are years without the possibility of any stigma being attached. ' ; ;, • .'¦¦-. '-.'.. Another outstanding point in connection with this school is the fact that it was the first of the state institution schools under the Board of Control to be.accredited to the State Uni - versity. AY a result, students taking required work at Geneva North High School may enter the University or any of the denominational schools of the State without taking. entrance examinations, and on the same basis as the graduates of any of the larger public schools of the state. During the last bienmum three graduates, of the institu - tion went'on to study at the University, two graduates went into Schools of Business in the State, and three took Nurses' Training. ¦; ••.'.;•,:; : :~ : iThe educational program at Geneva is interpreted in a very broad sense. Education meaning, the training'of the girls to become a person who is accepted in social environment. Consequently a part of the education of the girl which must be stressed very; thoroughly is that of social adaptation, or in other jvords, teaching the girls how to be social beings, ac - cepable tjj society at large. No matter what the background of these £irls may be, they will all go into society to take their places as) members of some community in a relatively short time. Consequently; it is the duty of the institution, through its educa ional program, to so change the behavior pattern of these girls that they are acceptable to society at large. One of the phases then of making the girl a good citizen is to provide lier with some type of training at which she may become partially or totally self-sustaining. 75 </seg>
         <seg id="p080">There are three courses offered at Geneva North High School which are designed primarily to meet this particular need. There is first of all the course in domestic arts, which teaches the girls the essentials of home making in all of its phases. This is of great benefit to those who may leave the institution and get married at once, or to those who seek posi - tions in domestic service after they leave. The work taught them at Geneva North High School in the domestic art de - partment is probably on a much more practical basis than at most public high schools in the State, for this work carries right over into the institution activities, and the training de - partments are a part of the institution's regular work. The girl, for example, does not learn to cook in a domestic science laboratory, but she does learn her cooking in the general kitchens of the institution under the guidance of a domestic science teacher, and also a kitchen supervisor. Her sewing also is of a practical nature as she learns to make her ov.-n wardrobe which will include her graduating dress at the time she finishes higli school. She not only learns to sew on new materials but she also learns how to mend, repair, and remodel her own clothing. Leisure time activity includes fancy work, which is done by most of the girls. Of course help and in - truction in fancy work is given during class hours, but the performance of most of it is clone during the girl's leisure time. In the domestic science division, considerable emphasis has been placed upon canning, and since the institution puts up many thousand quarts of home grown vegetables, the training there is certainly of the most practical kind. The farm program is not at present an organized training program for the girls as much of it is work that is too heavy; however, the girls do all nt the milking, take care of the chickens, and raise all of the vegetables, and though no class in agriculture is taught in the class rooms a very practical knowledge is obtained from many of the farm activities. All the garden seeds are planted by the girls, crops are weeded and irrigated as they grow, and later are harvested entirely by means of the labor of the girls. Another of the vocational training programs is a com- 76 </seg>
         <seg id="p081">mercial training course in the high school. Here the girls are taught upjto-date commercial methods, and the use of some office machines such as the mimeograph, the adding machine, and the typewriter. : As is true with a person who finishes any training pro - gram, theie is no guaranty in the program that it will provide a job for the person who completes the course successfully. And there is [no definite way of knowing what the market will.be for these particular occupations when the girl leaves the school. On the other hand that As a chance any one takes in any scrool when they prepare themselves vocationally. All those in charge of the educational program can do is to try and see tb it that the training program is complete, adequate, and thorough, so that when the opportunity arrives, the student is ready :or it. : The f nding of a job depends largely upon the Child Wel - fare consultant who has the girl's parole, and also upon the initiative and temperament of the student herself. It is contemplated at the present time to add at the end of this biennium, with the new .school session, a course in cosme - tology, wiich will furnish a third vocational training program. Plans are already completely drawn up, and if the. finances are available, this course will be a part of the educational program during th; next biennium. In addition to these vocational programs there is the acade - mic educational program. It is not believed that the voca - tional and academic program are separate, but that they are regarded as having many common elements. For example, it does not seem reasonable to suppose that you can divorce spelling, grammar, or English composition as academic subject matter from a course in commercial arts. No person who learns to manipulate a typewriter in an efficient fashion can hope to succeed through that medium alone. Some knowledge of English, grammar, and spelling, certainly are necessary, and it is felt that a considerable amount of this academic work is necessary. The department has eliminated from the course of study such subjects as Latin, and Algebra, except in a very 77 </seg>
         <seg id="p082">small number of cases where it was found necessary to teach them to some girl who plans to continue her training- work where such subjects may be required. In substitution for the subjects mentioned there has been added to the curriculum, a course in biology, a course of personal hygiene, a course in general mathematics, and such other subjects as seem to fit the needs of the girls more adequately. Not only are academic subjects offered which seem to be of greater value, but in teaching these subjects more emphasis is placed upon their practical application than is probably done in the orthodox school system. Thirty-two credits are required for graduation, and in case a girl enters the institution during the middle of the year from some public high school with a subject partially completed, which is not being taught at that time, individual instruction is given so the girl may not have to drop the subject and lose her credits for that semester. In addition some sub - jects may be desired which are not a part of the regular cur - riculum offered. In this case an attempt is made to get the necessary courses, through the Extension Division of the Uni - versity of Nebraska, on the secondary school level. It also may happen that some person who has finished a high school course as offered and who is not-ready to leave the institution, may want an advanced course of some kind. The school is conducted all day on a nine months basis, beginning in the fall and continuing until the end of May of the following year. There are eight teachers on the teaching staff, all of whom have valid Nebraska State Teachers certificates. Two members of the faculty have Masters degrees; four members of the faculty have A.B. degrees; and the position of the other two does not require a degree for the type of work handled. One is a teacher in the elementary school, and the other is a full time music teacher. Visual education is one of the phases of the educational program which receives considerable emphasis. A sixteen milli - meter sound on a film, moving picture machine is used for visual education purposes as well as for recreation. And the high school contains many separate pieces of equipment for teaching by the visual method. 78 </seg>
         <seg id="p083">79 MusicJ both vocal and instrumental, is a very essential part of the inst tution's activities. The instrumental and vocal work are taught-by a full time music teacher, who devotes her entire time to this.work. •., The school orchestra is composed of girls, most of whom could not play a note when they entered the institution. When they leave the institution, they have their places filled by other girls-who are nearly as proficient as themselves. In addition to the orchestra, a large number of individual piano lessons and other kinds of individual music lessons are given. Music fills a very definite need in the institution, it furnishes . the background for the weekly religious services, also for special musical programs such as cantatas, and fulfills a very definite need for the girls' emotional nature. It is not nec - essary that a girl learn to play a musical instrument, but if she is able to enjoy a good sing fest at frequent intervals, it does offer relief from emotional stress^ In other words, music has a very definite therapeutic value in the institution. RECREATIONAL One' of the departments which was added at the institu- 1 tion this jbiennium, was a recreational department under the direction jof a recreational supervisor. The last supervisor left at the end of the school year in 1939, and has not been replaced. • The recreational program has stressed the desirability of de - veloping pleasing personalities rather than the development of athletes. [The girls do enjoy playing kitten ball, hand ball,' and some of :hose activities which can be indulged in out of doors but the emphasis has been placed upon social behavior, posture, and the development of a normal social consciousness. It is difficult for a girl who has never attended a party, an inforrial gathering, or other affair such as found in modern society to know how to conduct herself properly when suddenly faced wiih these situations. It is with this idea in mind that | the recreational supervisor as well as the entire staff of the j </seg>
         <seg id="p084">80 institution attempt to teach the girls the social graces which are so necessary in modern life. In connection with the recreational activities, there are had at intervals, hikes, weiner roasts, parties and other gatherings at which the girl may enjoy herself as a social being. Another of the recreational facilities is the library which contains a large number of books, some of which are rather old, but to supplement these, current magazines of considerable number are subscribed to, and the girls are surprisingly well informed on current affairs. One of the magazines which iproves of exceptional interest to the girls is Popular Science, and one of the interesting courses in the academic work is biology. This rather seems to show that the girl's matter-of-fact existence stimulates an interest in their surroundings. HEALTH One of the phases of the program at the institution which receives a great deaJ of emphasis is the health and sanitation program. Each of the girls when entering the institution is given a very complete physical examination. Until the present biennium, girls afflicted with syphilis were refused admission to the institution. The last year of the biennium, this pro - cedure was changed and now such girls are admitted, and very careful attention is paid to sanitation and hygiene. This emphasis placed upon sanitation and personal hygiene has re - sulted in a very low sick rate during the biennium, and for the most part the general health of the girls has been excellent. There have been no epidemics, and a very few accidents of a serious nature. The institution does not have a hospital, but does have quarters for isolation purposes and for treating ill - ness of a minor nature. Cases of a chronic nature may be sent to the Orthopedic Hospital for correction. Medical service is provided for on a part time basis by a Geneva physician who is also subject to call at any time. Dental work is handled on an individual basis entirely, and paid for by the Girl's Train - ing School. Emergency cases requiring operations would be taken care of in one the local hospitals. A registered nurse </seg>
         <seg id="p085">is employed on a part of the day basis, and she is also subject to call at my special time. T. RELIGIpUS SERVICES Since the moral training] of the girl was emphasized in the organization statute, religious services are not overlooked. Religious training is provided by means of Sunday School each Sunday nurning, and; Chapel.services Sunday afternoon, which services are conducted by members of the Geneva jMinisterial Associatioh. In addition the whole atmosphere of the institu - tion Is conducive to good moral training. : -.'. : '.¦:¦ ["¦"¦ ¦•¦¦:¦'.; . _. .-¦ ./' i SOCIAL SERVICE In brier to more adequately prepare for the time when the girl leaves the institution, and to help her make the adjust - ment reg lired, it is necessary for the institutional staff to learn as much as possible about the gusher past environment, and her ambitions, temperament, and personality as is possible One of thje means used to help in this respect is the psycholog - ical examination. Psychometric tests were given to all of the girls, whtl came to the institution during the biennium, in the form of group intelligence tests, and in many cases these group intelligence tests were supplemented by individual intelligence tests. In addition to these, there were given to some of the girls, achievement tests in order to better ascertain to what level the r; academic training had progressed. The psycho - metric tests were given under the guidance of the Director of Education, who worked in close relationship with the Depart - ment of Educational Psychology of the University of Nebraska. Dr. Bailer and members of the Graduate School of Educa - tion of the University of Nebraska with the required training, gave some tests at the institution during the biennium. This work has'been a decided help to the institutional program dur - ing the biennium, and in all probability future years will see a 81 </seg>
         <seg id="p086">much more extensive use of this evaluating medium than is now had. These intelligence tests results show that, contrary to the layman's opinion, the majority of these girls have the same average intelligence as an average population of similar aged females outside would have. Lack of mental potentiali - ties then cannot be the entire cause for the situation in which these girls find themselves. Other factors such as poor en - vironmental background, wrong behavior patterns, and emo - tional instability have played an important part. There have been a number of girls tested who had intelligence quotients that were quite high, and some of these have left the institu - tion to go into activities which were in line with their intelli - gence. There have been some improvements made of a very de - sirable nature during the biennium. More class rooms were added in the administration building and this necessitated add - ing more living quarters for teachers. A new gravel packed well, designed to give an abundant supply of water for institu - tional use as well as for irrigation, was completed, and a large supply tank was erected to provide adequate pressure. A new cold storage plant was equipped, and considerable interior dec - orating was done. 82 </seg>

         <seg id="p093">THE NEBRASKA HOME FOR DEPENDENT CHILDREN Lincoln, Nebraska ESTABLISHMENT The Nebraska Home for Dependent Children as it is now known, was created by legislative enactment in 1915. Previous to that time there had existed the Nebraska Home for the Friendless, which was located near the corner of iOth and South streets in Lincoln. The Nebraska Home for Dependent Children is in reality a continuation of the Nebraska Home for the Friendless under new statutory provisions. The en - actment la.w stated: ... ¦ "The name of this institution shall be the Nebraska Home for Dependent Children. The Home shall be located in the City of Lincoln, Nebraska." Laws of Nebraska 1915, Chapter 132, page 297. PURPOSE The purpose of this institution, as outlined in the original statutes is as follows: "The Home shall receive such dependent or neglected children as are under sixteen years of age, and have'been duly committed to it by any district or county court of this State; and at the discretion of the Board of Commis - sioners of the state institutions, may receive for temporary care, children under sixteen years of age not so committed to it..;..... "Laws of Nebraska 1935, Chapter 132, para - graph 50. Later under the juvenile court law the legislature saw fit to raise the age of those who might be committed to the custody of the stcte as wards, by means of the following provision: "All minors under eighteen years of" age, who in the judge- I ment of the juvenile court, are delinquent, dependent,; de - ! fective, or neglected, and require state institutional care, shall be wards of the State/and shall be committed to'the care and custody of the Board of Control, which Board 89 </seg>
         <seg id="p094">90 thereupon becomes invested with the sole and exclusive custody of such minors." Compiled Statutes 1929, Chapter 43, paragraph 223. CLASSIFICATION The Home for Dependent Children is a children's institu - tion, because children of eighteen years or over are not com - mitted to it, and any child when he reaches the age of twenty - one and is a resident in the Home for Dependent Children or under its jurisdiction, is no longer a ward of the State. The law provides for this in the following manner: " in no case shall a child be confined after he or she &gt;hall have reached the age of twenty-one years, and marriage of any child committed to a state institution under the age of twenty-one years shall not make such child of the age of majority " Compiled Statutes of Nebraska 1929. Chapter 43, paragraph 210. POLICY The policy of the Board of Control in regard to the Ne - braska Home for Dependent Children is set forth in the Statutes as follows : "The Board of Control is hereby made the legal guardian of all children now in the custody of the state school for dependent children and of those who shall be committed to its care. It shall be the duty of the board to afford temporary care and to use special diligence to provide suit - able homes for such children and it is hereby authorized to place them in such families for adoption or on a written contract during minority or until eighteen years of age, in the discretion of the hoard, providing for their education in the public schools where they may reside or otherwise ior teaching' them some useful occupation, for kind and proper treatment as members of the family where placed, and for the payment on the termination of the contract to said board for the use of the child any sum of money that may be provided for in the instrument. Whenever any ward of the board who is not indentured has become </seg>
         <seg id="p095">self-supporting, the board may so declare by resolution and the guardianship of the board shall then cease and the child thereafter be entitled to its own earnings. Whenever one or both parents of any ward who is not indentured have b :come able to support and educate it the child may, by res Diution of the board, be restored to its parents, in which case the suitableness of the home shall be certified in the same manner as herein required to place on inden - tures, and thereupon the guardianship of the board shall cease. The board shall also have authority in case per - manent free homes cannot be obtained to provide and pay for their maintenance in private families or boarding honies at a rate riot to exceed Thirty Dollars ($30.00) per month 5." Laws of Nebraska 1937, Chapter 202, page 826. The Nebraska Home for Dependent Children is a place for refuge am! care for children until some satisfactory program has been worked out for them by the county or by state child welfare workers. This institutional care continues until a more suitable adjustment may be made for the child in more home-like surroundings. The first consideration in this whole program i&gt; the welfare of the child, his physical, mental, emo - tional, and social welfare is considered, and the program of the Nebra ska Home for Dependent Children is directed toward that end. ¦•:.•, ; ; V . V - '. ¦ - ¦ - ¦ ¦ i . ' ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ¦'¦¦: '¦¦',; Placements The placing of the children for adoption or in any of the other types of homes is done by the Child Welfare Division, and only after thorough investigation by a member of the competen: Child Welfare staff. In case it is not possible to place a child satisfactorily before the age of twenty-one, then the relationship of the ward and guardianship terminates, and the child is at liberty to leave the home and seek his own adjust - ment. ¦¦-.Tiiis is provided for in the Statutes as follows: "..,... ..in no case shall a child be confined after he or she shall have reached the age of twenty-one years, and marriage of any child committed to a state institution 91 </seg>
         <seg id="p096">under the age of twenty-one years shall not make such child of the age of majority .." Compiled Statutes of Nebraska 1929, Chapter 43, paragraph 210. Since the placements of the children through the services of the Child Welfare Division is one of the principal functions of the institution, it became necessary on October 1, 1938, to add an Administrative Assistant in charge of Social Service to the staff, and with the addition of this person, a much better adjustment program is possible. Psychological Tests Since it is not possible to place a child adequately without knowing as much as possible about him, an individual psycho - logical study has been considered a necessary part of the child's case history. This work has been carried on under the direction of the Child Welfare Division, and through the cooperation of the Department of Educational Psychology at the University of Nebraska. Dr. Warren Bailer of that department, with the aid of conpetent graduate students has given most of these tests. As a result of these tests, and by observation of the child himself, the Nebraska Home for Dependent Children is better able to meet the individual needs of each child. The re - sults obtained from individual intelligence tests given to ninety - six children at the Home, who were two years old and above showed a median intelligence quotient of ninety-four, which is only six points of I.Q. below the median score on a normal curve distribution. This would indicate that as far as the measurable intelligence was concerned that the mental poten - tialities of these children varied but little from the normal children population outside the institution. For twenty-one months during the biennium, Dr. Richie, psychiatrist with the Child Welfare Division, spent one day each week at the Home for Dependent Children and considered special cases. His work consisted of individual case work, conducting staff meetings, and giving consultation to workers on special problems. 92 </seg>
         <seg id="p097">School The Nebraska Home for Dependent Children maintains an eighth grade school at the institution, in which are taught the same subjects as are found in the public schools of the state. The teaching staff consists of five teachers, all of whom hold valid Nebraska State Teaching Certificates, and were selected because of their possibilities of working harmoniously with the children. After the children have finished the eighth grade, those who show any inclination and aptitude are sent to high school in tie city of Lincoln, and tuition is paid the Lincoln City Schoo.s for this instruction" It has been found that the boys and girls from the Nebraska Home for Dependent Children fit in well with these high schools, and are. represented in the orchestra, chorus, choir, glee clubs, school papers, girl reserves, and in fact practically all activities of the schools. Some of t^ie students receive honorary scholastic recognition, which helps to finance their way through college. Some children take:. nurse's- training, some are preparing to teach, and others hold down part time work while attending school. Thirty boys and girls have graduated from high school during the last biennium. It was found necessary to maintain an elementarj school at the Home, because children come into the Home during any time of the school year. They may have been out of school for some time previous to their entry to the Home. They are usually emotionally disturbed, and need time to make adjustment. Some of them are behind their chronological age group, and need individual instruction. A program of social development is maintained at the Home at all times. This is expressed in many different ways. The recreational, religious, musical, educational, and work programs are an outstanding part of this social development. Work is considered an essential part of the training of each child, and each one is assigned a task as nearly suitable to his age and ability as is possible. Younger children may run errands and do simple tasks. Older children help with the maintenance of the institution. As one phase of the work program, the Home for Dependent Children owns and operates a 40 acre farm, two miles east of the main institution. This farm provides ex- 93 </seg>
         <seg id="p098">94 cellent facilities for a training program in agriculture, and also to give the boys an easy outlet for their excess energy, and helps to make the institution partially self-supporting. About sixteen of the older boys are in residence at the farm. Older girls have household duties which are rotated from person to person, so that each one may learn all the phases of domestic science and domestic art. Many boys and girls are hired to work by the day or during the summer months, by people who have learned the value of these young people's services. The older girls have an honor cottage which serves as a complete training unit for domestic duties ami also helps to make the girls more self-reliant. The honor cottage is in charge of a house father and mother and as near a normal home environ - ment is provided as possible. Recreation Recreation is encouraged through the media of parties, outdoor games, hikes, picnics, tours to points of interest, camp - ing in the summer time, and other means of normal recrea - tional activity. The results of the entire program at the institution pro - bably shows up in the countenances of the children. Many visitors at the institution have commented upon the freedom and happiness of the children. That is a situation of which the Home is proud. After a child has seen his own home broken up by death or for other reasons, and if he has been removed from familiar surroundings and friends, and brought to a new community to be placed in the care and custody of strangers, it is in many cases difficult to have the child carefree and happy as a child reared in normal environment would be. The fact that he can laugh and play and sing as a normal child should is some evidence that the program of the institution is meeting the needs of the child. Religious Services The Religious atmosphere at the institution is maintained by encouraging children to attend churches of their own de- </seg>
         <seg id="p099">nomination and faith. While Religious services are not a regular part of the institution's program, except for Sunday School, the children are given every opportunity and assistance to reach th&lt;: church of their choice on Sunday. Health All children are given complete physical examinations upon entrance to the institution, and what is more important, the needed corrective procedures are applied. The pediatrician, is chief of the medical staff, and he has been ably assisted by other specialists. The remedial dental work is taken care of by a dentist. This adequate medical program makes it possible to meet the needs of all the children. Not only is the physical well being of the child looked after, but everything is also done that is possible to study the child's emotional snd mental make-up. 95 </seg>

         <seg id="p108">NEBRASKA INDUSTRIAL HOME MILFORD, NEBRASKA ESTABLISHMENT The Nebraska Industrial Home was established by legis - lative enactment March 31, 1887. The institution was located at Milford and was opened for use May 1, 1889. Purpose The idea of the founders is expressed in the original act as follows : "Beside.- shelter and protection, the object ol said institu - tion shall he to provide employment and means of self - support tor penitent women and girls, with a view to aid in the suppression of prostitution." Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, Vol. Ill: 491. Believing that poverty was the chief cause of this social prob - lem, it was thought that education for self-support through industrial training was the solution, and provision was made in the law for one or more teachers for that purpose. As an educational institution, a lengthy period of residence was es - sential, and rules were adopted requiring all women admitted to contract to remain one year. Twenty years later the chief concern of the state had shifted from the mother to the child, and the statute was amended to accord with the spirit of the Juvenile Court law, the state assuming responsibility, "to provide temporary care tor children born in the institution ; and secure suitable homes for such children to receive the custody and control oi any such child duly relinquished liy the mother thereof, and tv consent to the adoption by some suitable per - son approved by the said Board (of Control')." C. S., 1929: 83-1302. Another twenty years saw the last changes in the act relating to the Nebraska Industrial Home. These two pro- 104 </seg>
         <seg id="p109">visions relate to the extension of the use of the Home. The first opens its lying-in facilities to, "worthy married women, deserted by their husbands less than nine months," provided the consent for their admission of the Superintendent and the Board has been given. The second change makes possible the commitment by the district or county court, for a period of not to exceed one year, of any women or girls needing such care, while emphasizing the fact that the institution is in no way a penal or semi-penal one: "The lervices of the State Industrial Home for Women at Milford shall be freely given to any woman or girl who is a pjroper subject for its care on application. When through ignorance, misunderstanding, prejudice, or mental defect, a woman in need of the care of such institution refuses to accept care in this institution, and when it is necessiry for the welfare of the unborn child, provision may hi made for the compulsory care and treatment of sujch persons as prescribed in the following sections." C. S., 1929: 83-1307. To summarize the present statute with regard to the Ne - braska Industrial Home, it provides for 1, voluntay admission of unman ied mothers'and of married women deserted less than nine months and 2, for commitment by the courts of unmarried mothers needing the services' provided by the in - stitution but refusing them. It furnishes to the expectant mothers 1, shelter and protection, including medical care, 2, limited, informal training in the industrial arts, and 3, appro - priate employment upon their discharge. To the children born in the institution, it provides temporary care, and placement in free !or boarding homes, or in adoptive homes upon relinquish - mentiby Ihe mother. ¦ ; CLASSIFICATION It wil be noticed that this institution, though called in the statute, "The Nebraska Industrial Home," is classified in this.report with the children's institutions. As a matter of fact, it dees not fit into any of the accepted categories. It is not a peral institution in spite of. the fact that phrases such as "penitent women and girls" and "court commitment" are 105 </seg>
         <seg id="p110">found in the law ; it is not a "Home" because it is a temporary place of shelter; it is not a "School" for industrial training alone; it is not merely a lying-in hospital though medical care forms the basis for the institution. With the shift of emphasis in the fifty years since its establishment, the chief concern of the state now is for the children born out of wedlock along with responsibility for their mothers to the end that the latter be helped to avoid repeating their error and that in so far as possible their children be reared in either natural or foster homes. An additional reason for classifying the Ne - baska Industrial Home as a children's agency is that over half of the adults admitted are under the age of majority, and hence legally as well as socially "immature." POLICY A number of important administrative problems have arisen in the past few years in regard to the institution which require careful and prolonged study. Briefly summed up, they are as follows: The small number of inmates served each year increases the overhead expense to the point where it challenges the state with the continuation of the financial outlay. The fact that only a small proportion of the unmarried mothers of the state (approximately ten per cent) make use of the facilities provided by the state. 1 The operation of the institution entirely separately from the law relating to children of unmarried mothers and the responsibility of the father for the support of mother and child (C S.,' 1929, Chap. 9); 2 from the co-ordinated child placement program which has been developing in the state over a considerable period of time. The need for a continuing casework policy beginning with the inmate at the time of application for admission, and continuing through the period of institutional residence, and follow-up for the mother and child until both can safely be discharged from state protection and supervision. 106 </seg>
         <seg id="p111">ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES Placements : Children born in the institution may be provided for by different procedures. A mother may wish to keep her child and take it with her* when she leaves. In such situations an investigation is made by consultants of the Child Welfare Di - vision as to whether or not the mother will be able to care for the child or have it cared for by relatives or friends. In some cases the mother may relinquish the child to the Board of Control far adoption, or the child may be transferred to a private institution. School Since the Jaw provides that the mothers in the home be given training in domestic arts, etc., the main emphasis is placed upbn household activities. In other words while await - ing; delivery of their babies these prospective mothers work at daily tasks of which they are capable and which provide training ill household cares. They learn to cook, sew, plan meals, and in general do the things which will be required of them when they become housewives. Care of the infant is a very essential part of this activity and very thorough training is given in.this respect. One of the aims of the institution is to have the mother learn to sew sufficiently well so that she may provide not only the baby's wardrobe but also her own before she leaves the institution. Recreation Entertainment at the institution consists almost entirely of that wfiich is supplied by the girls themselves and the staff of the institution. One night each week is devoted to super - vised play. During the girls' leisure time they have access to a radio, and during the summer months croquet may be played outside, k library is maintained at the institution where books may be secured by girls for their reading wishes. Religious training is provided by means of Sunday School and Church services which are held in the institution on each Wednesday night. These services are non-denominational, and designed [especially for the spiritual uplift of the recipients. 107 </seg>
         <seg id="p112">Religious Services Xo matter what the mother's religious preference may be, she is permitted to have her child baptized in any faith she wishes, and it she is a member of the Catholic Church or wishes to become so. a priest is called and she may profess her religion to him. Health The general health of those in the institution during the past biennium has been exceptionally good. There have been no epidemics of any kind, and this is in spite of the fact that influenza and one or two contagious diseases were prevalent in the state and local community. j There have been admitted during- the past biennium. girls who had syphillis. This was not the case in the past. In several of these instances no treatments had been given for this condition previous to their entrance t&lt;&gt; this State Institu - tion. With all new arrival- a Wasserman test is included in cadi physical examination. In addition a smear test is made. and she is given a Mantoux test for Tuberculosis. Another of the factors which is responsible for the good health record uf the institution is the fact that the rules of hygiene and personal cleanliness are taught to all the mothers while they are in residence at the institution. Babies born to syphilitic mothers are isolated until such time as a doctor deems it advisable to give them a Wasserman test. Physical Improvements In January 1939. one ward building was closed due to the small population and facilities made use of in it were moved to the remaining ward building. Though the population has remained nearly constant tor many years, the extra building had been kept open at considerable expense to the state. The dairy herd was reduced to four cows, and this made possible the reduction in personnel which effected a saving for the State! New linoleum was laid in the front office and vestibule, and all of the wood work on the outside of the buildings was re - painted. These were the principal repairs made during the biennium. 108 </seg>

         <seg id="p119">NEBRASKA SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND NEBRASKA CITY, NEBRASKA ESTABLISHMENT The ]S ebraska School for the Blind was established by Samuel Bacon in 1875, and was known as the Institute for the Blind. Mr. Bacon, who had previously founded the Schools in Illinois md lowa, was totally blind. He served as superin - tendent of the Institution for more than two years, or until the year 1877. The Legislative Enactment providing for the In - stitute for the Blind in the State of Nebraska is found in the 1897 Laws of Nebraska, Chapter 22, page 497. PURPOSE The purpose of the School, as expressed in the original act, is as follows: . "........ the purpose of the Institute for the Blind, now established and located at Nebraska City in Otoe, County, shall be the physical, moral, and intellectual, cultural, and trainirg of the respective classes for whose benefit each institttion was created, to the end that the pupils in each institttion may be returned to society capable of becom - : ing self-sustaining and useful citizens." Statutes of Ne - braska 1897,, Chapter 22, page 497. In 1915 the Legislature, realizing that the purpose of the In - stitute for the Blind was primarily one of education, amended the previous Statutes and changed the name to the Nebraska School for the ißlnid: This was done as follows: "In crder to be better known and more fully recognized as strictly educational institutions........the name of the Institution for the Blind shall be changed to the Nebraska School for the Blind." Laws of Nebraska 1915, Chapter 130, page 293. ; The orignal purpose, as designated in the Statute, was not changed Dy Legislative Enactment until 1937, at which time, in order :o conform to the change-in the educational program that had already been instituted in the School, and also to 115 </seg>
         <seg id="p120">conform to the increased emphasis upon vocational training, the Legislature redefined the purpose of the Institution as fol - lows : "The purpose of the School for the Blind, now established and located at Nebraska City in Otoe County, shall be the physical, moral, intellectual, cultural, and vocational train - ing of the respective classes for whose benefit each insti - tution was created, to the end that the pupils in each in - sitution may be returned to society capable of becoming self-sustaining and useful citizens." Laws of Nebraska} 1937, Chapter 199, page 823. CLASSIFICATION The Nebraska School for the Blind is distinctly a Child - rens' institution in as much as it provides for the education of those who are handicapped by total blindness or by such lack of sight that they may not make normal progress in the public schools of the state. There is nothing in the Laws of the State of Nebraska which indicates that it shall be only for juveniles. This is expressed as follows: "All blind persons and those blind to such an extent that they cannot acquire an education in the common schools, of the State, and who are of suitable age and capacity, and of good moral character, shall be entitled to an education in the Institution for the Blind without charge." Compiled Statutes of Nebraska 1929, Chapter 83, paragraph 303. In the past there have been adults admitted to the School quite generally, although this is not the accepted policy at the present time. It may be interpreted from the Law, that since the public schools of the state are required to give educational service until the age of twenty-one, and that the Law relating to the education of the Blind says those who are blind to such an extent that they cannot acquire an education in the common schools of the state, and are of suitable age, we might infer that no one over the age of twenty-one, handicapped by partial or total loss of vision may receive an education at the School for the Blind. There has been an impression among some of the unin - formed throughout the state, that to have a child go to the 116 </seg>
         <seg id="p121">School for the Blind at Nebraska City, for their.education, was. an admissian of a certain degree of poverty. This is certainly not the intent of the Statute* for there is nothing in this Statute w lich in any sense indicates that the School is open only to indigents. The School for the Blind was originated for the pi rpose of' educating, at the expense of the state, all of the Chi dren 6f the State of Nebraska, rich and poor alike, who on at count of blindness or highly defective vision, could not make normal progress in the public schools. By its very " conception therefore, it is first and foremost, an institution of learning, and is in no sense an institution of charity, custody or correction, The Board of Control, during the biennium, made recommen lations to the Chairman of the Planning Board, that when the question of the reorganization of the schools of the state was considered, that the problem of the School for the Blind be cDrisidered as a part of that problem. The course of study used at the School is that followed by the public schools in the State of Nebraska, and all of the teachers employed in the Nebraska School for the Blind, hold valid Nebiaska State Teachers certificates. The Board of Con - trol feels :hat teachers in the School for the Blind, should have all the prsparation and experience that teachers in the public schools are required to have to teach similar subjects, and in addition :hey should have special preparation for teaching the handicapped. This in itself 'would ordinarily mean that the teachers' salary schedule should be on a higher level than the average of the teachers in the public schools who are teach - ing the sime grade or subjects. This is not the case, how - ever, as the average salary schedule is below the average for the state in similar positions. The educational programof the institution is considered by the Board of Control as a part of the educational program of the rest of the state. The School for the Hind simply takes care of that group of children in 'the State who are handicapped by total or partial blindness, and who do not find adequate facilities in the public schools of the stite,. and yet are, required by Law to attend school. There arc no public school systems in the State of Nebraska who are attempting to teach blind children; consequently, it 117 </seg>
         <seg id="p122">is the duty of the Nebraska School for the Blind to see that those children with this particular handicap have the best instruction available. No tuition is charged any pupil enter - ing the school, except from those who may live outside the state. Those who come from without the state are charged tuition as provided for in Chapter 13, paragraph 307 of the 1929 Statutes of Nebraska. Students attending this school are expected to provide their own clothing and private spending money, if they use any, and in case the students or their parents .ire unable to pay for the clothing which is needed and nec - essary, the counties from which these children come may be forced by law to pay for this clothing. This same provision applies to the transportation costs to and from the School. These provisions are set forth in the Statutes as follows : "On admission of a pupil to either of the institutions named in this article, the parents or guardians shall furnish suit - able clothing for such pupil, shall pay his transportation to and from the institution entered, and shall support the pupil during the summer vacation. Whenever any pupil in either of the institutions is not otherwise supplied with necessary clothing or with the means to pay his trans - portation home at the close of the school term he shall be supplied by the superintendent of such institution with the necessary clothing and means of transportation, and the superintendent shall make out an account of the cost thereof against the parent or guardian, if the pupil be a minor, and agaist the pupil if he or she have no parent or guardian, or have attained the age of majority, which account shall be certified to be correct by the superinten - dent, and when so certified such account shall be presumed correct in all courts. The superintendent shall thereupon remit such account to the treasurer of the county from which the pupil so supplied shall have come to the institu - tion. Such treasurer shall proceed at once to collect the same by suit in the name of his county, if necessary, and pay the same to the superintendent of the institution who furnished the supplies: Provided, if it shall appear that the parent or guardian is unable to pay the account and that such pupil is a pauper, as contemplated in, (83-130), of this chapter, then such account shall be paid from the county general fund, as therein provided." Compiled Statutes for Nebraska 1929, Chapter 83, paragraphs 305 and jUO. 118 </seg>
         <seg id="p123">POLICY A number of important administrative problems have arisen in tiie last few years which required careful analysis and study. Oi c.of these is: ¦."¦.. -j i ¦*..'¦ That since it is one of the institutions which deals almost entirely with juveniles, the Child Welfare Division is ex - treme y interested in seeing that those who need the train - ing get to the schools in the first place. Secondly, that the school program is suited to their needs. Thirdly, that since it is a residential school, that the social life o ' the individual is directed according to the best philosophy of childrens* social needs. In the past, admission to the School fo the Blind was made as a result o: written application to the superintendent, in which applicatior was set forth something of the child's case history which mc uded a statement as to the child's mental ability, the degree of his handicap, and the ability of the child to feed and clothe himself. Under this program, and according to the Laws of the State, the County Superintendents were required to report to the Superintendent of the School for the Blind each summer, the number of blind or handicapped with blind - ness in their counties after the school census had been taken. The Superintendent of the School for the Blind would then get in tpuih with the individuals who were handicapped by loss of sight, and they in turn made application directly to the Superintendent. At the present time application is made through tiie Child Welfare Division on.directly to the Superin - tendent. The case history of the applicant is then written up and considered by the case committee who in turn present it with the application and the committee's recommendations to the Super ntehdent of the school. The case committee consists of the Superintendent of the School for the Blind, the Director, of the Child Welfare Division, and a member of the Board of Contrd, who decide as to the eligibility of the applicant for entry. 119 </seg>
         <seg id="p124">ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES School The School for the Blind consists of one large building which houses the administrative offices, the class rooms, the living quarters of the personnel, and a wing in each end "which provides dormatory facilities for boys and girls in opposite ends of the building, and in addition to the main building, there is another building which houses the heating plant, the laundry, recreation room, and a third building called the industrial arts building. The enrollment in this school is one of the smallest of any institution under the Board of Control, and there has been little change in the enrollment of the juvenile members for some period of time. The enrollment during the first year of the biennium consisted of twenty-three boys and thirty-six girls, and during the second year of the biennium there were twenty-eight boys and thirty-nine girls. This makes an aver - age enrollment during the biennium of sixty-three pupils. This average is only slightly higher than it has been in pre - ceding years, and the small increase is no doubt due to the activities of the Child Welfare Division in seeing that this group of handicapped children receive the education required by law. While there has been a great deal of improvement in the program for the prevention of blindness, there are still some conditions which are difficult to eradicate. Accidents will take place and some other causes of blindness may be hard to control. Since the School for the Blind is a residential School, the educational program must of necessity include not only academic and vocational training, but also social educa - tion, religious guidance, and moral training as well. Many of the students who come to the School in the fall stay for the full nine months period, and do not return home until the sum - mer vacation. That means that they are without the parental guidance and home influence for nine out of twelve months of each year during the entire period covering their education, which may run twelve years or more. It is necessary that the 120 </seg>
         <seg id="p125">School for the Blind attempt to fulfill, partially at least, the influence o [ the home while the child is a student in the School. With that idea in mind, everything is done through the per - sonnel of :he institution to fulfill the needs of the children, realizing ail the time that there can be no adequate substitute for the training offered in a good home. There are no sight - saving classes at the School for the Blind, though some of the pupils have a fair percentage of vision. Sight-saving classes are very desirable.'andvshould.be made use of, however, because of the smairenrollment in the School, the number in any one sight-savin * class might be only one or two, and this would necessitate hiring several more teachers. The expense of such a program would raise the per capita cost of education to a prohibitive level. There is no doubt that sight-saving classes are as desirable in this institution as in any other in - stitution f6r the blind, but the resources of the state will not permit such a program at the present time. All children are taught ho\V to read Braille, and a course of study has been envolved which calls for certain minimum attainments in the reading of Braille as well as in the academic subjects taught. Some educational media made use of at the School for the Blind not found in the ordinary public schools are: The Iraille writer, which is a six-keyed typewriter for writing Braille; The Eictaphone, which is used by blind typists in trans - cribing; letters. A. Talcing Book Machine, which is used to give lectures oi&gt; various subjects, stories, and readings. The Radio, which of course is being used more and more in the public schools of this state. The School for the Blind acts as custodian for the talk - ing book machines, which are the property of the Federal Gov - ernment and may be loaned to the adult blind throughout the state, for their use. These talking book machines may be had upon application to Mr. N. C. Abbott, Superintendent of the KTebraska School for the Blind at Nebraska City. The Federal government allotted a considerable number of these to the stale for the use of the adult blind, and so far there has riot been demand enough to use all of this allotment. The 121 </seg>
         <seg id="p126">records of the talking book machine may be obtained from the public library in Denver upon written request and are transported from the library to the user and back free of charge. The talking book machine has been found to be a valuable adjunct to the other teaching devices at the School for the Blind. The Federal government not only furnishes the talking book machines, but it also supplies a considerable proportion of the school's supplies and equipment in the School for the Blind. Through a subsidy of the Federal government, the American Printing House for the blind at Louisville, Ken - tucky, sends to each State School for the Blind, a credit memo - randum. The school may then pick out the books and equip - ment that they need and charge it against this credit. In this manner many special devices and kinds of equipment that are necessary to teach the blind are available at no cost to the state. This is done in order that the specialized products are available for those handicapped with blindness. The subjects taught cover the same range as those in the public schools both in the elementary school and on the high school level with the possible exception of science. It has been difficult to make the necessary laboratory demonstrations to teach science successfully. Graduates from the School for the Blind have in the past been given permission to enter the State Colleges and denominational institutions of higher learning throughout the State of Nebraska without written examina - tion. This in effect means that the School for the Blind is considered as an accredited school by the State University; however, no formal approval has ever been made to this fact. Vocational training has been given special emphasis during the biennium and an attempt has been made to evaluate the program in order to determine those activities which the blind could best do. The industrial arts department taught special activities as basket making, broom making, weaving, chair caning, and piano tuning, and the girls in the domestic arts department learn how to cook, sew, and to weave. One of the special educational departments has been the deaf-blind division. The teacher in charge is Miss Margaret Hoshor, and she has in this department, just one student who 122 </seg>
         <seg id="p127">is Helen Seifert of Bridgeport, Nebraska. During the past biennium, Miss Hoshor and her pupil attended the New York Institute 'fir the Blind at New York City. It was felt that Helen should attend this school rather than remain at Nebraska City, because Helen was both totally deaf and totally blind, and the School for the Blind at Nebraska City did not have all of the training equipment necessary to meet adequately this parti - cular situaiion. With the educational background of the New York Instil ute and the careful guidance of Miss Hosher, Helen Seifert has made rapid progress in overcoming her handicap. She reads some Braille and speaks a number of words out loud distinctly and what is more important, she has in recent months come to realize for the first time, (she is now twelve years old) that there are a tremendous number of things in the world about which she would like to learn, and it is the assertion c f this inner desire for knowledge which will be the .motivation for carrying, her learning forward at an acceler - ated pace. For five years. the state has had charge of the training, b Jth academic and social, of Helen Seifert. One year this trainii.g was provided for by a special fund,under a Board of Trustees and subscribed to by popular subscription. The other tout fears, the state has made a specific appropriation to take care of the education of this handicapped child. This appropriat on seems to have been more than justified in view of the progress that Helen made. . During the biennium a special effort has been made to raise the standards of the school in every respect. This has been done by buying some badly needed new equip - ment, by ihe addition of many volumes of Braille books made by the NYA project in Omaha, and by haying a survey made of the Institution under the guidance of Dr. P. C. Potts of the Amer can Foundation for the Blind of New York City. Dr. Potts was assisted in making this survey by Miss Virginia Lee Abel of the lowa School for the Blind in Vinton. As a result of I his survey, Dr. Potts made two sets of suggestions, one of which was applicable to short time planning and one which would cover a greater length. As a result of these sug - gestions definite improvements have been made, one of which is an improved attitude on thej part of the personnel. The 123 </seg>
         <seg id="p128">survey results have presented a definite challange to them to originate constructive programs to be applied in the school. It has also resulted in the attendance by some of the teachers at some ol the National Conventions of the Blind, State Teachers Association, Social Welfare Association, and also participation in local educational programs. One of the special activities of the School, was the acting as host for the Biennial State Convention, for the Workers for the Blind, at which time various problems connected with the welfare of the adult blind of the state were discussed. Speakers from outside of the state were heard at this Convention. A musical program was enjoyed. A set of resolutions were drawn up and for - warded to the Board of Control, and a banquet, in the evening oi the last day, bought the convention to a close. The Ne - braska School for the Blind, as part of their educational pro - gram, had an exhibit at the Nebraska State Fair each year of the biennium. This exhibit not only represented the ac - complishments of the School for the biennium, but it also acted as the contact between the School and the public from out in the State of Nebraska who attended the State Fair, and who thus became aquainted with some of the State's activities, who would otherwise not have known of them. This not only informs the people of the School's past activities, but it also helps to explain the institution's philosophy and needs. Recreation The recreational activities of the School have been^-con - siderably improved during the biennium by the additionof a recreational supervisor, who not only teaches physical educa - tion, but who has charge of the general recreational activities. The physical education program has consisted of some athletic sports for the boys such as foot racing, broad jumping, and things of a similar nature which they could do, as well as out door games. The girls had access to play ground equipment, and had some dancing lessons, and the emphasis for both the boys and girls has been upon bodily posture. One of the things which has facilitated the recreational program very materially, has been the play ground equipment which was given to the School through the generosity of Mr. Levy L. 124 </seg>
         <seg id="p129">Coryell, Sri.of" Lincoln. This equipment consists of concrete roller skating track, swings, horizontal bars, a sand pile, giant stride, teeter totter, roller skates, and other equipment. Mr. Coryell haj not only furnished this play ground equipment but has furnished each student a monthly allowance to be spent as each sees fit. Also .at Christmas time and during other special occasions, he does not overlook a single pupil, ani frequently sends cars to the institution for the purpose of transporting teachers and students to special points of in - terest in the vaciriity. Some of these trips for teachers have extended a; far as the School for the Blind in Illinois and to St Louis. This special interest by Mr. Coryell, (former grad - uate of the School) has meant a great deal to the students and faculty of the School. This is especially true because it has helped to maintain the morale, by providing some of the things which the state finds it difficult to do. He has also provided cars for taking the students on drives to the country on -week - ends. Special emphasis in the physical education program has been put upon the correction of bodily posture, because for the blind, the bodily postureand walking habits are two very difficult problems to solve.. The tendency with this handicap is for a person to stoop somewhat and walk with the feet far apart hi order to prevent falling and to maintain balance should they strike an unknown obstacle in.their pathway. This difficulty c in be partially corrected by creating a spirit of con - fidence within the individual in his own ability. ..In addition to the physical education program extra curri - cular activities also form a very important phase of the childrens' social training. The children Jiave had the permis - sion of one of the theater owners down town to attend his show free of charge when allowed to do so by the superin - tendent of the School. This privilege is subject to the super - vision of tile School and is usually limited to one show a week. Music also furnishes.a major part of the extra curricular activities, and the music department is especially strong. One Ml time music teacher teaches all of the vocal work, and in addition gives lessons on the. piano, and pipe organ. Another 125 </seg>
         <seg id="p130">part time music teacher has charge of the orchestra two days a week and also on special occasions when the orchestra appears in public. Music at the School for the Blind is con - sidered to be of exceptional importance because it fulfills a three-fold role. First of all music has a cultural value and any child who knows how to make use of it, receives riot only enjoyment, but prestige because of it. Also from the voca - tional standpoint it may pave the way for future jobs in which music is one of the factors under consideration. Another and fa r from being the least important is the fact that music has a definite therapeutic value, and this has proven to be especial - ly true to the blind. It furnishes an outlet for emotional dis - turbances which a normal person might dissapate in other ways. Both the instrumental and vocal music divisions have entered students in local state musical contests in competition with the public schools in that section of the state. These students have received many awards and recommendations because of their talent. Other forms of entertainment for the students in the School consist of hikes, automobile trips, par - ties, and other socializing activities. They are designed with the idea of teaching the student greater self-reliance and to help them overcome their handicap as much as possible. Religious Services A daily convocation is held each regular school day from 7:50 to 10:00 in the morning. At some of these, the exercises consist of the reading of scripture on a non-sectarian basis and without comment. At others, special groups work out pro - grams, speakers are invited in, teachers report on special ac - tivities of the students, and every other week a local preacher of the minsterial association acts as chaplin. A catholic priest of Nebraska City and laymen have been invited at various times to participate. All of these tend to keep the morning services from becoming stereotyped and formal. On Sunday morning a regular non-sectarian Sunday School is had in place of convocation, and students have permission to attend church services down town. 126 </seg>
         <seg id="p131">Health The general health of the students' during the past bien - nium has been the best of any similar period since the organiza - tion of the School. There have been no epidemics of any kind and very fetv cases of general sickness. Much of this is due to the fact tha: the rules of sanitation and hygiene are taught and carefully preserved. The children arc examined by the Institu - tion doctor very soon after their admittance to the School, and special precautionary measures have been taken when needed. Some of the children have been vaccinated, all have been given the Mantoix test for signs of Tuberculosis. Their teeth are examined aid other precautionary measures are taken as need - ed. In case of a chronic ailment which requires an operation the children are taken to the Orthopedic Hospital for that work. Th( law requires that the health of the children be carefully locked after as it states: &gt; "The physician to each of the. institutions named in this : article (deaf and blind) shall act as physician and surgeon in all :ases! in which his services are needed. He shall visit the institution daily during the sessions of the school, :. and at other times as.he may be needed. He shall watch i sanitary* conditions of the building and premises and notify .; the superintendent of any defects. He should keep an i account of all cases treated in the institution and the date .'•; | thereof i..." &#132; : The dental work at the institution is taken care of by a reg - ularly emp oyed part time dentist, and the children are taken down town to his office for this work. This work was started this bienniuni.: I The School lias a hospital ward which may be used for isolation purposes,, and where children who are in - disposed fcr a few days may be looked after. : ¦.'¦"; Personnel Changes : j ¦..- ¦ ¦':'.'. - - -... :_ . -¦ ¦¦ ;¦¦ ¦¦¦'. _¦¦•-' ¦ . .'..;. r f There were several changes in the personnel at the School fo|r the Blind during the biennium. Miss Josephine Peters, who had teen matron for two. years resigned to be married, and her pace was filled by Miss Emma Jean Kuska Miss' Elizabeth Bartling, who was the office secretary and teacher 127 </seg>
         <seg id="p132">of commercial work, resigned to continue her education, and Miss Clover Beckman succeeded her in the office; and Dr. David D. Stonecypher. who had been the institution physician, resigned and was succeeded by Dr. W. C. Kenner. Miss Helen I.undstrom was chosen to succeed Miss Margaret McClure as children's supervisor. A full time commercial teacher and recreational supervisor were added to the staff as well as a part time dentist. Physical Improvements There has been little change of any consequence in the physical plant during; the biennium. Many improvements made were in the dining room and kitchen, where a four section gas range replaced an old worn out coal stove; a Hobart dish washing machine was installed to take care of the heavy work. A new linoleum floor was laid in the kitchen, and the dining room walls were redecorated, and the floor sanded and finished in a natural color. Considerable other work of a maintenance nature needs to be done as soon as WPA labor is available. 128 </seg>

         <seg id="p138">SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF Omaha, Nebraska The Nebraska School for the Deaf, located at Omaha, Nebraska, was established in 1869, and at that time had an attendance of only twelve pupils. In contrast the enrollment for the biennium covered in this report totaled 217, of which 210 were in school when it closed its session in June. The Nebraska School for the Deaf was established accord - ing to Chapter 199 of the 1937 Statutes of Nebraska, "For the purpose of the physical, moral and intellectual culture, and vocational training of the respective classes for whose benefit each institution was created, to the end that the pupils in each may be returned to society capable of becoming self-sustaining and useful citizens," and section 2 in said original Chapter 83, section 301, is hereby repealed. Chapter 83, section 304 says, "All the deaf and dumli resi - dents of this state, and those deaf to such an extent that they cannot acquire an education in the common schools of the state, of suitable age and capacity and of good moral character, shall be entitled to an education in the School for the Deaf without charge." The Statute in its intent, was to set up a School in the State of Nebraska for those handicapped with deafness, so that they might receive an education when it was not feasible to receive it in a public school in the state. There is nothing in the Statute which in any wav indicates that the School is open to indigents. There has been some impression throughout the state that to have a child attend the School for the Deaf at Omaha was an admission of a degree of poverty or delinquency. This is not the case, and in fact the School constitutes a privilege for aiding those who need it badly. Some states do not have schools for the deaf, and are justified in sending their children to adjoining states, in order that they may receive the benefits of an education. The School for the Deaf is distinctly and foremost, an institution of learning It is not designed for taking care of 134 </seg>
         <seg id="p139">cases which are not adaptable to learning. It is no doubt dif - ficult for mothers to part from their children when only five or | six year s of age and have them attend a residential School for the De; f as the one at Omaha. But from the standpoint of; the i chili 1 arid his future development and happiness, it is far more es ;ential that the mother forego some of her maternal emotions aid send the child to this school, as soon as he is old enough Every year that she delays in doing this, the more seriois the problem becomes. Children develop behavior patterns which are anti-social and work habits which are faulty, and frequent!}' the amount of parental indulgence to the child results in unhappiness when the child meets the com - petition of the social world. The School consists of one big administration building which houses the primary department of the school and the administrative offices; a school building proper, in which they have the intermediate and advanced academic departments; a third building is a shop building, better know as the Industrial Arts Building in which are taught industrial arts, domestic arjts, and other things which relate to an occupational training for the chid. : There are two dormatories on the campus, one for girls and one for boys; and to make the picture complete, there is a fine recreational center which consists of-an audi - torium and gymnasium.' v Childr n may enter the School at the age of five or six, depending upon their physiological and psychological devel - opments. In other words the chronological age in itself is not the soe criterian of the child's readiness to carry school work. It sometimes happens that children who make no pro - gress in the kindergarten for the first year suddenly start a normal progress the second year when the chronological age has increased by a twelve month period. Other children may enter the Jlchqol as old as sixteen or seventeen years of age, de - pending up on conditions. But it cannot be over emphasized that other thin js being equal, the later the entrance to the-School the more difficult the problem of instruction becomes. A child entering the School at the age of five or six years may spend thirteen to fifteen years there, the first two or three 135 </seg>
         <seg id="p140">\ear» being preparatory to entering what is known as the first grade. This length oi time is necessary in order to partially compensate tor the loss oi hearing and lack of speech. The curse after entrance to the first grade consists of twelve grades, and lead.- to graduation. Since the School was established in 1869. 1452 pupils have attended the School in the seventy years. 313 of these gradu - ated. 945 left school without finishing, and 210 are still carried mi the active «,hool rule In the academic department considerable work has been done during the past two years |&gt;y the heads of the depart - ments, vocational as well a- academic, in outlining' and adjust - ing a new course of study. This course oi study includes the subject* u.-irtlh taught in elementary and grammar schools of the state, and with the high school studies changed only in so far as is necessary to meet the peculiar needs of the deaf child. The School strives to keep abreast of the progressive move.- in education and nothing is left out of the course of study (hat it is thought would benefit the child. Chapter S3, section MJ9 of the 1929 Compiled Statutes for Nebraska says. "All children hereafter admitted to the Nebraska School for the Deal and all children who have not advanced beyond three years in the course under present methods in said School shall here - after be taught and trained in such School by the oral, aural and lip-reading method to the exclusion of the deaf alphabet and -ign languages, unless incapacitated by mental defects or mal - formation of the vocal organ.- Mid all pupils now advanced beyond three years in the course shall be taught and trained in the oral, aural and lip-reading method in the regular courses oi study and by means of special conversational courses to be put into effect to the fullest extent which is feasible and practi - cable." The Statute attempts to legislate a certain type of teaching technique which at one" time was considered to he the most advanced in teaching the deaf. It does allow for some exceptions, but the main attempt was to require the instruction of even child in the same manner. This docs not coincide with the more modern philosophy of education which in effect says, we must try and meet the needs, in so far as 136 </seg>
         <seg id="p141">possible, of the individual student, and if he cannot .make nor - mal progress when the main emphasis is put upon lip-reading and oral h struction, then it is better that some use be made of the deal alphabet than, to have the child remain practically illiterate. Every deaf child is given an opportunity in so far as possible to learn to speak and become adept at lip-reading. This is en:ouraged to the limit of the child's adaptability to this procecure. Those who are able to place in a competitive examination and want advanced education, may enter Gallaudet College at Washington, D. C. This is a Federal School for the teachirg of advanced courses to the deaf, and entrance may be had on an academic level of about the tenth grade of the public sch lols of this state. The last year of the biennium one boy and one girl passed the entrarce requirement examination and entered Gallaudet College. During the years preceding, sixty-nine students from the Nebraska School for the .Deaf have entered the college. One phase of the educational program which has been given special emphasis during the past biennium is the voca - tional training. This consists of exploratory work where the child is given opportunity to express his likes and dislikes of the basic vocational subjects, and his background and abilities are studied to determine what occupation or trade the child might best take up as a life work, in order to help the child arrive at a sane conclusion. The child, especially the boy, is rotated ai intervals from one vocational subject to another, in order that he may see something of the activities involved and determine his own reactions. Thus a boy may be in a print rshpp for several weeks and then be transferred to the wood [working, shop. and. so: on to make the work primarily exploratory in nature. Some of the subjects given at the school ard cabinet making, carpentry, cement finishing, paint - ing/printing, drafting, handcraft, domestic science, domestic art. beauty culture, photography, typewriting, laundering, jan - itor training, gardening, and farm mechanics. In addition a child may, his last year in school, by means of the work study plan, be given ¦ an opportunity to learn a distinct trade not offered ir the School, such as watch repairing, shoe repairing, 137 </seg>
         <seg id="p142">dry cleaning, plumbing, photography retouching, and auto - mobile body rebuilding. Through this plan the child stays in school an extra year, and during his last two years he spends half a day in the Nebraska School for the Deaf and the other half day he spends working as an apprentice in the trade which he is endeavoring to learn. This type of vocational training is the most recent develop - ment in the public schools in the State. Where in those systems a Coordinator Teacher is used, whose sole duty it is to find positions where children may learn a trade as an apprentice, and at the same time continue their academic schooling- on the half day basis. EXTRA CURRICULAR PROGRAM An extra curricular program is carefully planned for all of the children and is sponsored by competent people within the school's oganization. These activities include social groups, literary groups, Boy scouts, Girl scouts, a hohhy group, young peoples meetings, student council, regular school parties, athletic games, and moving pictures. The whole program is designed to give the child a well rounded life while he is living at the institution. In the School's athletics, as a member of the Nebraska State High School Athletic Association, the school's teams compete with those of other public schools in the State as well as with some schools for .the deaf outside the State. HEALTH The health of the child is carefully safeguarded at all times. A regularly employed doctor and nurse take care of the usual child ailments and each child is given a medical and dental examination at least once each year as soon after en - tering school as possible. All children who are physically able participate in the physical culture program under the guidance of competent instructors. This physical development gpes hand in hand with the mental development. 138 </seg>
         <seg id="p143">The religious activies consist of Sunday School in the Institution every Sunday morning, Young Peoples Services in the Institution on Sunday Evenings, and Church services for those who care to attend are held outside of the Institution proper, and children are not only given permission, but are ac - companied to the City Churches of Omaha. In addition, once a month seme member of the Ministerial Association of Omaha comes into the Institution to conduct non-sectarian religious activities. . , ; Considerable has been added to the equipment of the school; dun ng the biennium. New courses for teaching photo - graphy anc beauty culture have been added, and with them the necessary equipment. A new 16 millimeter sound on film, moving picture projector has added to the effectiveness of the school work as well as providing some recreation. New power sewing machines have been added to the domestic art depart - ment, land new tools have been added in the drawing and wood working departments. During the biennium a number of im - provements have been made on the physical plant. Much of this hasl bien accomplished with the use of W.P.A. labor, and materials urnished by the State. Some of these improvements made it pcssible to transfer the older girls from an old building which was not fire-proof to another building which is nearly so. The ooms vacated are now assigned to hearing teachers. One cf the special features of the School's activities dur - ing the biennium was the speech correction school, held dur - ing the simmer months for children who were financially un - able tx&gt; hire this work done privately. The 1937 session of the Legislature made an appropriation to the Board of Control to be used fjr speech correction work for a limited number of handicapped children. The Board of Control decided that this training should be given at the School for the Deaf during the summer nionths, and the children were selected and brought in under the guidance of the Child Welfare Division. The School existed for the two. summers of 1937 and 1938 and each session covered a period of eight weeks. Forty-eight children were admitted and given training from three to sixteen weeks depending upon their needs and their ability to profit by it. 139 </seg>
         <seg id="p144">The program consisted of six hours of individual speech drills, except with the rather young children where suoh a period was excessive. The summer children were given group-manual work and simple work activities suitable to their need. The results seemed to show considerable improvement in the children's confidence and hope, and they tended to become more social in their attitudes and activities. In many cases a marked improvement was shown in the speech handicap, even though a complete correction was not made. This work should be carried on in connection with other training in order to make it more effective and lasting. 140 </seg>

         <seg id="p154">ORTHOPEDIC HOSPITAL LINCOLN, NEBRASKA History and Organization The Orthopedic Hospital, located in Lincoln on the grounds formerly occupied by the "Home for the Friendless," was es - uiblished by an act of the legislature in 1905. The building previously used as the "Home for the Friendless" is used as a iiurses'hume and there is also a house for the superintendent on the grounds. A building providing for 110 hospital beds has been added to the original group of buildings. In 1937 when the activities of the State Child Welfare Bureau were assigned by the legislature to the State Board oi Control, it was possible to plan the State program of Ser - vices for Crippled Children and the Orthopedic Hospital as one operating division of the State Board of Control. The 1937 legislature enacted a law establishing a general advisory com - mittee for Services for Crippled Children program. This com - mittee advises on matters of administrative policies relative to children hospitalized under the Services for Crippled Children program. The Director of the Child Welfare Division is also Director of Services for Crippled Children. PURPOSE The Hospital is maintained for the care of "crippled, rup - tured, and deformed children, and those suffering from diseases from which they are likely to become deformed," (C. S. Ne - braska, 1929; Sec. 83-601.) Such deformities as club feet, cleft palate, harelip, and other deformities with which children are born are cared for as are those due to diseases such as infan - tile paralysis, tuberculosis of the bone, and various bone in - fections, and those due to injuries such as auto accidents or other accidents common to farm or city. Under the program of Services for Crippled Children the definition of a child who may receive state aid for medical and 148 </seg>
         <seg id="p155">other {services other than custodial care, is given in the Ne - braska Assistance Act as follows: "A¦physically handicapped or crippled child shall mean a child &lt;uho by. reason of a physical defect or infirmity, either conge ital or acquired by accident, injury, or disease, is or may be expected to be totally or partially incapacitated for eciucatiori or for remunerative occupation, but shall not iv elude the deaf and blind." (C. S. Supplement Ne - .- ; braski, 1937; Sec, 43-504.) Ahbther definition of purpose was made part of the law when the 1937 legislature passed a law which stated that a crippled child is, "one under 21 years of age, unmarried and of sound nind, afflicted with harelip, cleft palate, hernia, con - genital cataract, or disability resulting from congenital or ac - quired he irt disease, or any congenital abnormality or orth - opedic cor dition that can be cured or materially improved. The orthopedic condition or deformity referred to above shall in - clude any deformity or disease of childhood, generally recog - nized by the medical profession, and shall include deformity resulting from burns. It shall not include recent fractures except th)se sufficiently severe or complicated as to likely result-in permanent deformity or disability, or ordinarily pre - ventable when treated in their incipiency." (C. S. Supplement Nebraska, 1937; Sec. 71-3404) Note: See: Manual of Instructions and Suggestions, Part 11, Services; [or Crippled Children, printed by Board of Control, 'Child We fare Division, for detailed outline of administrative policies and procedures of the State program for Crippled Children. ¦;.-'_' f The scope iii the Orthopedic Hospital and Services for Crippled Children programs as expressed in the legal defini - tion of tie types of cases that may be accepted for care is larger than funds and facilities permit. It has been necessary to formulate an administrative definition. The ad - ministrative definition which was drafted with the assistance of the General Advisory Committee and the original Medical Technical Advisory committee is as follows: I "In selecting children for hospitalization, professional ser - vices convalescent and other care, preference should be 149 </seg>
         <seg id="p156">given to children under 16 years of age who are suffer - ing from orthopedic conditions offering obvious promise i&gt;f recovery or improvement to whom shall be given as ¦ ¦omplete medical and social service as possible." Under the State plan for Services for Crippled Children a program for locating the child needing treatment, as well as facilities for aftercare and follow-up services are outlined. Only children are accepted for hospitalization whose parents cannot arrange necessary care privately. The Orthopedic Hos - pital is not a custodial institution but a children's hospital specializing in orthopedic care. Consultation services are avail - able through the Orthopedic Hospital out-patient clinics and the several extension clinics for children suffering from other than orthopedic defects when facilities are adequate. CLASSIFICATION The Orthopedic Hospital is a children's hospital speciali - zing in orthopedic care. Only persons under 21 years of age may he cared for at the hospital. It is a treatment agency and not intended as a custodial institution for cripples. It serves the entire state. Parents able to meet part of the cost of care arc required to do so. Paving patients are not accepted. The Child Welfare Division, Services for Crippled Children, must necessarily work very closely with the Superintendent of the Hospital because the hospital is the treatment agency for the most of the Services for Crippled Children cases. ADMISSION PROCEDURES Application for admission to the hospital or service under the State program of Services for Crippled Children is made through the County Assistance Director on forms supplied by the Child Welfare Division. Investigation of economic need is made by the County Assistance Director and reviewed' and passed on by the Supervisor of Medical Social work, Services for Crippled Children, and the Superintendent of the Ortho - pedic Hospital. Medical need is established after medical diagnosis is made either at the Orthopedic Hospital, out-patient clinics, or one of the extension clinics. Eligibility for State 150 </seg>
         <seg id="p157">care is-decided after the medical need is evaluated in relation - ship to tht ability of the child's parents to pay for care pri - vately. ! REVIEW OF HOSPITAL ACTIVITIES During the period from July .1, 1937, to June 30, 1939, 516 new pitients and 872 previously dismissed patients have entered the hospital for treatment. There were 747 surgical operations 2487 house-patient observations, 892 casts applied, 635 braces .ordered and fitted, 2117 x-rays taken, and 3298 out - patients seim in the hospital clinic, which is in addition to those seen at th&lt;: extension clinics. The laboratory work has also been mark idly increased, and a total of 3131 different labora - tory tests and examinations were made during this period. These figures indicate that the amount of work done at the hospital wis almost double the work done during the pre - vious bieni ium. Several changes in the personnel of the hospital have occurred since July 1, 1937. The more significant appoint - ments include Dr. W. R. Hamsa as orthopedic surgeon, Dr. A. E. Bennett as neurologist, Dr. E. E. Angle as urologist, Dr. H. E. '.Harvey as gynecologist, Dr. J. W. Thomas as otorhinoJ - aryngologiiit, Dr. Roy Whitham as general surgeon, and Dr. J. Marshal Neely as roehtgenologist and pathologist, Dr. Fritz Teal as Orthopedic Sugeonj and Dr. E. W. Hancock as pedia - trician. Mrs. Caroline Elledge has been assigned to duty at the Orthopedic .Hospital as full time medical social worker. Mrs. Anna Walker replaced Mr. Elmer Schmidt, who resigned, as bookkeeper of the Institution. Mrs. Kathleen Harris re - placed Mr;. Marjorie Folger, and Miss Thelma Brewer re - placed Mrs. Mildred Bennett as teachers in the school. Through the efforts of the Child Welfare Division through the program of Services for Crippled Children many former patients who had failed to return for further treatment and observation.reported for more care. A number of new patients also entered the hospital for diagnosis and treatment as the result of the close contact with the county department main - tained/by the medical social work department. The Services 151 </seg>
         <seg id="p158">for Crippled Children program, through the medical social worker, arranges follow-up care for the patient after leaving the hospital, and in reminding the patient of the necessity of returning to the hospital for further care and treatment when requested to do so. and has aided materially in paying for ap - pliances ;ind shoes which the parents were unable to furnish. Many of the children are placed in convalescent homes through the Service for Crippled Children funds until they are well enough to return home or are to re-enter the hospital for further active treatment. By the use of convalescent homes more patients can be benefited and better follow-up work can be done. During this period there was very little redecorating or repair wok done as almost at the beginning of the fiscal year the carpenter and painter were dropped from the pay roll. The nursery was repainted a sky blue, a new linoleum was placed on the floor, and new shades were fitted to the windows. These improvements made the large nursery room appear very attractive. A much needed shower was installed in the main bath room on the first and second floors of the nurses' home. This addition to each floor was heartily welcomed by many who had to use the same bath tub on each floor. A section of the flat roof on the east side of the nurses' home was repaired, as it was leaking badly. A room in the old wing to the ad - ministration building was equipped to handle isolation cases, and two good sized rooms were partitioned off from the north end of the library room so as to make a place for the medical social worker and her stenographers. These partitions have not as yet been painted or the floors varnished. A number of rooms, especially room 19 and the nurses' sleeping room at the nurses' home, are badly in need of painting. On account of the use of wheel chairs, strechers, and wagons by the patients^ the walls, beds, furniture, doors, and corners receive many bangs and scratches, which calls for repeated repairs and re - painting. This is most discouraging, and in a very short time all these look as though they has been used for years. 152 </seg>
         <seg id="p159">During the year 1938, the laboratory was moved from its old site to the north semi-basement room in the Administra - tion Build hg. In the new quarters there is much more room and some $1500 worth of new equipment was. added. This makes a ;ery desirable laboratory, and the services in this departmen: have been extended to include some blood chem - istry and more bacteriological work. "'.;¦ ; •'¦.."¦.¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ ¦ :¦' . .-¦/ ' !. About $500 worth of, improvements were added to the x-ray department. There, are still some; more changes which are needec, and a more suitable place for viewing a series of x-ray films at one time is desirable. Some additions were made to our charting system, which is now veiy satisfactory and has received commendation from the American college of Surgeons and from the Educational Division o the American Medical Association. . V During the past two years, due to infrequent rains, con - siderable tare has been needed to keep hospital grounds pre - sentable to the public, and the trees, shrubbery, flowers, and new grass are in good condition because of this attention. There have been no epidemics, except a few cases of measles, curing the past two years." The general health of the hospital population has been good. Constant vigilance is maintained to ward off the entrance of contagion among the children. Many dubs, societies, business firms, lodges, and private individual: have contributed to the amusement and comfort of the patients, and their efforts are greatly appreciated.' 153 </seg>

         <seg id="p171">STATE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL " I Kearney, Nebraska The State Industrial School is located about two miles west, and one-half mile north of Kearney, overlooking the Platte Va ley. The site chosen for this institution seems to be somewiat in keeping with the philosophy underlying the institutions program. Here is an institution where boys who have had i poor start may receive a fresh vision, a broader outlook 01 life, and may receive inspiration to accomplish better things. 'Certainly as one stands at the front door of the institution and looks but accross the Platte Valley, he receives some inspiration. ¦ ' •¦•-.; ,•;'¦¦ Chapter 83, section 1101 of the 1929 Compiled Statutes for Nebraska, designates the State Industrial School, located at Kearney', in Buffalo county, as a school for the retention, education,'discipline, and industrial training, and reformation of male juvenile offenders. - Section 1102 of the same chapter states, "The boy com - mitted to he School shall be instructed in the principles of morality, .-nd- in such useful branches of knowledge as are taught in the schools of the state. They shall also be in - structed in the principles of mechanical arts and such prac - tical trades as are best suited to their age, strength, and capa - city, and those best adapted to secure them a livelihood after leaving the School." It will be seen from these statements of the law that the primary emphasis in. this institution shall be the teaching, of the boy in many various phases of activity. It stresses specifically academic education, industrial educa - tion,; mora ity and discipline. It 'definitely recognized then that boys committed to this institution must have their be - havior patterns changed as much as possible for, the better, be - fore they are released.. The law does not state what the mini - mum age is for commitment, and there have been cases where boys as young as seven years of age have been committed to this institution, and ages of ten to twelve are not uncom- 165 </seg>
         <seg id="p172">mon. About eighty per cent of the cases range between the ages of fourteen and seventeen. Tables given at the end of this report show these facts in detail. Chapter 83, section 1103 of the 1929 Compiled Statutes of Nebraska says, "When a boy of sane mind under the age of eighteen years (this has by court interpretation, been changed to sixteen years of age) shall in any court of law of this state Ix- found guilty of any crime, except murder or manslaughter, or who for want of proper care or other cause is growing up in mendicancy or crime, and complaint is made, therefore, and properly sustained, the court may, if in its opinion the accused is a proper subject, therefore, instead of entering judgement or sentencing said boy to the Penitentiary, cause an order to be entered that the boy be committed to the State Industrial School, in pursuance of the provision of this article " Chapter 83, section 1109 says, "Each boy committed to the School under the provision of this article 183-1101 to 83-1111) shall remain there until he arrives at the age of twenty-one, unless sooner paroled or legally discharged. The superinten - dent, by and with the advice and consent of the Board, shall adopt such by-laws for the promotion, paroling, and final discharge oi inmates as may be considered mutually beneficial for the institution and inmates. The discharge of any boy pursuant to said by-laws or upon his arrival at the age of twenty-one shall be a complete release from all penalties in - curred by the conviction of the offense for which he was com - mitted." A court interpretation has held that the Juvenile Court in committing a boy to the Industrial School cannot fix a definite term of detention. Boys committed to the State In - dustrial School become wards of the state according to Chap - ter 43. section 223 oi the 1929 Nebraska Statutes. Chapter S3, section 1109 of the 1929 Compiled Statutes, as previously quoted, leaves it up to the Superintendent of the State Industrial School with the approval of the Board of Control, to set up a parole system. In the biennium just 166 </seg>
         <seg id="p173">passed a lew parole system was established. Under this sys - tem each boy's progress is thoroughly studied by the rehab - ilitation committee, and if it is found that he has made the proper adjustment and progress, the committee recommends to the case committee that this boy's case be reviewed for par - ole. The rehabilitation committee consists of the superintendent, the-assistant superintendent, the school principal, the rec - reation director, the vocational instructors and the cottage counselor. The case committee consists of a member of the Board of Control, Director of the Child Welfare Department, and the Superintendent of the State Industrial School. After the boy's case has been reviewed by the rehabilitation com - mittee! and it is found that he has made sufficient progress and adjustment to warrant consideration for parole, his case is then referred to the Child Welfare Department. A field consultant of this department then investigates the boy's home. If. it jis found that the home conditions are suitable and his parents an: able to care for him, arrangements are then made for his release. If the home conditions are hot suitable, the con - sultant locates a strong sponsor foster home, or suitable em - ploynjent, so that the boy will be in a position to make an adequate adjustment. After the field consultant makes his survey, his report is referred to the case committee, who reviews the boy's jcase, and final arrangements are then made for his parole. Plans are made for the boy with the person to whom he is to lie paroled, in order that a thorough understanding may be ga ned of the boy and his case. After the boy is paroled, a consultant of the; Child Welfare Division visits him and his sponsor regularly to ascertain the adequacy of his adjustment. Boys, who are placed on parole in foster homes and who are given employment, may be returned to the institution for medical aid if they are financially unable to pay for it them - selves. In many. cases the School also provides extra work clothing it the time of parole. All the instructors in the academic and vocational school, who have boys under their direct jur sdiction, make an individual written report on each boy, giving all of the information known concerning the boy's habits, character^ and conduct for the past month. Copies of 167 </seg>
         <seg id="p174">these reports are filed in the office of the superintendent, and also forwarded to the Director of the Child Welfare Division. Upon receiving these progress reports, the Superintendent in - terviews each boy personally, discussing his reports with him and makes suggestion which will aid the boy in solving his own problems In order to help each boy make the proper kind of ad - justment during his stay in the institution, he is given every opportunity to join groups which are working for the re - habilitation of its members. One such group is the Bond of Honor group. This group has an open membership to all boys whose records show that they are ready to comply with the rules of the organization, which in turn specify that he must observe all rules and regulations of the institution, con - duct himself as a gentleman, keep himself physically fit and mentally alert, and morally clean, be a true sportsman in all his dealings with fellow students and officers, refrain from cheating, stealing, the use of profane language, excessive quarreling, or otherwise, engage in degrading conduct. Mem - bers of the Bond of Honor group are given special privileges such as going to Kearney to a picture show several times a month, being permitted to go to town with their parents when the parents visit the institution, being allowed to re - turn home at Christmas time, to go fishing, hiking, skating, and participate in other recreational activities which may take them away from the institution. Since by the Statute the Institution is called and Industrial School, it is only reasonable to suppose that a great deal of emphasis should be put upon the educational program. This educational program should be construed in a broad sense. We are not interested in academic schooling alone. Teach - ing a boy a trade will not keep him out of trouble, in spite of the fact that there has been much written to the contrary. What we are intending to do throughout the whole institu - tion is to "Teach Boys". That instruction covers the mental, the physical, and moral and spiritual sides of life. Without the proper emphasis on any one of these, the result may be disastrous. It is no doubt easier to see and measure and 168 </seg>
         <seg id="p175">comprehend the academic and industrial type of training, but that does not mean that they are more important. It is admitted, according to law, that these boys,are committed to the institution because their behavior patterns are anti-social. Since these boys also, according to law, must return again to society not later than the age of twenty-one years, it be - comes the primary duty of the institution to see that the boys' anti social behavior patterns are modified for the better in every case, and, in so far as possible, /definitely supplanted by behavior patterns which are acceptable to society at large. That does not require a staff of teachers, as we ordinarily think of them, it does not require formalized educational train - ing, as such; but it does require an educational program in Avhich all employees of. the institution participate, and in which every phase of the institution activity is a class room, and where the real certificate of graduation from the training course will not be presented until the boy has been out in the world long enough to prove that his behavior patterns are definitely in accordance with society's demands. Considering education on a narrow basis, as many are inclined to do, we find that during the last two years the schools, toth elementary and high school within the institu - tion, have made very definite advancements. There has been a definite increase in curriculum content, as well as in the pupil's time spent in'school. New instructors have been added to; start new departments, and all instructors were required to have Nebraska State Teachers certificates of a very high grade. Much equipment has been added, especially in con - nection with the science department, the commercial depart - ment, and the industrial arts department, and in the music department three used pianos: were purchased for the grade school. Many new supplies such as books, maps, charts and materials for visual education were added. Vocational education has received a great deal of em - phasis in the last decade and undoubtedly will receive more in the decac c to come. Unemployment and'the financial de - pression lave made this more or less necessary. It is felt 169 </seg>
         <seg id="p176">that every boy should learn some type of occupation in so far as it is feasible to teach him one at the institution. With this idea in mind most of the departments in the Industrial School have had their work outlined and planned as courses of study, =o that the boy may not only learn a trade, but receive high school credit for so doing. One of these depart - ments in the institution is a bakery. This department furnishes the institution with all baked goods which include bread, cookies, sweet rolls, pies, and cakes. This not only furnishes an excellant training for the boys, but it provides the pastries for the institution, and since the Hospital for the Tuberculous is so close, the Boy's Industrial School also bakes for them. The boys seem to enjoy working in this department and the records show that many of the boys are able to obtain em - ployment in this particular field when they leave the School. The bakery department has been completely redecorated and several replacements of equipment have been made. A new work bench and bread cabinet have been installed. The bake oven was completely rebuilt with natural gas heat to replace the old kerosene burners. Another of the vocational training divisions is the laun - dry. In this particular division boys learn as much of the up-to-date laundry procedures as it is feasible to teach with our equipment and kinds of jobs. Boys in any of the voca - tional training departments are required to work at each operation in the department for a certain period of time, or until he becomes proficient in that particular operation, and he thus obtains the necessary knowledge and experience to fit him for gainful employment when he leaves the institu - tion. There has been considerable new equipment installed in this department, and this has increased the training facilities offered. Some of this equipment includes cuff and collar presses, double sleeve ironers. sterilizer, water softener, four new hand irons, and four new Bishop type ironing boards. Another of the vocational training departments of con - siderable importance is the print shop. The boys working in this department have made splendid progress under their 170 </seg>
         <seg id="p177">capable ; instructor. They have shown great interest in their work which is done entirely for the Board of Control and institutions .under its supervision. A number of the boys have secured positions in newspaper plants when they left the in - stitution. It is felt that to increase the efficiency of this department, to raise the quality of the work, and what is more important, to enable the student to learn the care and opera - tion of modern machinery* new equipment should be added. A dire nfeed is felt for, an .automatic job press ,in order that the boys may be better prepared to get and; hold jobs in modern 'r.lants- when they leave. It would also increase the output of the printing department and do a better job. During the biennium several improvements have been made in the print shop. A cylinder press and the inter-type machines which were not being used regularly previously were overhaul* d and put in good working condition. In addition the electrical wiring in the department has all been placed in conduit as |a fire preventative measure. The repairing of the cylinder press and inter-type machine has made it possible to teach the operction of and care for these machines. The institution publishes a monthly bulletin called the "Times") that is edited and printed by the boys themselves. .{ The shoe shop is another one of those vocational train - ing devices which we feel has definite future employment pos - sibilities. Every boy in this particular department is taught every op ration in the making of new shoes, both dress oxfords and worl • shoes&gt; and in addition is taught how to repair shoes well. The most of the new shoes may later be purchased from the Prison Industries, yet knowing how to make a new shoe by hand makes a boy better able to repair shoes in a competert manner. In order to make the training program more complete in this department new stitching and finish - ing macHnes have been installed, and the shoe shop has been redecorated and provided with more adequate lighting. Boys m the tailoring department learn how to make com - plete nevr suits, not with the idea that they will become tailors in the shop where new clothes are made, but with the idea 171 </seg>
         <seg id="p178">that they may become first class repairmen in establishments where clothes are cleaned and pressed or are altered. They not only make suits, but alter those purchased new from the I'rison Industries, and in addition they do all of the sewing for the institution which consists of making overalls, table linen, mittens, caps, aprons, and other types of wearing ap - parel which the boys use. Another phase of the work which they handle is that of doing the institution's mending. The Industrial Arts department, which is a newly created division, stresses wood working and general household mechanics. The boys in this department learn how fto use hand tools efficiently, and after they have mastered those operations they may learn how to operate the machines for wood working. This training is made practical because of the fact that these boys are responsible for the repairing ac - tivities around the institution, especially that relating to wood working. Considerable new equipment was purchased for this department in order to build it up and make it strong and functioning. VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE The Vocational Agriculture program at the. State In - dustrial School has received considerable emphasis because of the excellent facilities for putting into practice the theory which is taught in the class room. The many different de - partments in the agricultural program are discussed in full in the next few pages. For detailed statistics in connection with the whole production program you should turn to the table under the division of the Board oi Control relating to the agricultural products. Farm and Garden The School owns a total of 602 acres of land, of which approximately 260 acres is under irrigation. Of the irrigated land. 41 acres are used for growing general garden crops. During this biennium twenty-five different varieties of fruits 172 </seg>
         <seg id="p179">and vegetables were planted, including onions, tomatoes, sweet corn, cabbage, sweet potatoes, cucumbers and so forth. The garden, orchard, and green house are maintained as a separable department from the farm under, the supervision of the gi rdener. It is the aim of the institution to grow all the fruit and vegetables needed and to preserve as much as possible ,:or winter use. Maintained as part of the garden, the school also has an orchard of twenty acres; the fruits grown aie cherries, berries, apples and grapes. The remainder of the irrigated land is used for growing general farm crops. Crops grown during this biennium were alfalfa, lay, corn, potatoes, and atlas sorgo. The general condition of the crops was fairly good, however we were ser - iously-handicapped by drought, hail, and grasshoppers. Sev - eral times during: this biennium and during the extreme drought, when irrigation was most necessary we were unable to irrigate due to the fact that the supply of water in the irrigation canal was depleted. The ion-irrigated land is used for pasture purposes. Pas - ture crojs planted this biennium were sudan grass, oats, rye, alfalfa, and sweet clover. Part of the rye and alfalfa were used for hog pasture, while approximately sixty acres were used as i permanent pasture for horses. In panning the cropping system, the school has tried to establish a system of crop rotation that is in keeping with good farn practices. At the same time we have cooperated with the Federal government in its soil conservation program. New ideis and scientific findings are constantly being em - ployed ir an effort to maintain a high standard of production and soil :ertility. . ¦¦, As with the other departments of the School, the farm seryes a definite purpose in the instruction of the young boys. Plans were made whereby boys who were taking agricul - tural courses in school were permitted to work in the fields during tie summer months. This gave the boys the oppor - tunity of getting the practical side of farming, as well as the scientific. . ¦ '¦¦ 173 </seg>
         <seg id="p180">The School maintains a fine herd of Holstein cattle which supplies the institution with milk and dairy products, and also the State Hospital for Tuberculous with milk and cream. The total number of dairy animals on hand July 1, 1939 was 116, consisting of 109 females and 7 males, including 3 herd sires. The dairy cattle are all Holstein-Friesian and ap - proximately one-half are pure bred. The School has been following an improvement program and grade animals are eliminated as soon as replacements can be made with pure bred.s. During the biennium. the herd maintained excellent pro - duction, surpassing all previous records. The average pro - duction per cow for the year was 397.2 pounds of butter fat and 11.348 pounds of milk. This was an increase of 31.4 pounds of butter fat and 1031 pounds of milk per cow. The highest individual production record was made by a pure bred cow, Segis-Fobes-Lumle Second, producing 668 pounds of butter fat and 17.474 pounds of milk in a lactation period of 347 days as a four year old on twice a day milking. The School hopes to reach a 400 pound herd average. The care and management of the dairy herd does not 1 differ materially from that found on the average well managed farm. The cows are hand milked twice daily approximately twelve hours apart. The basic feeds used are alfalfa hay, corn silage, and a grain mixture containing a variety of grains. The roughage is fed in a ratio of approximately one part of hay to three parts of silage. All grain is fed according to the individual milk production of each cow, the general rule being one pound of grain for every four pounds of milk pro - duced. This of course is varied to meet the requirements of individual cows as to age. condition, and general health. Dur - ing this biennium green alfalfa hay was made into silage, and gave excellent results. In ..rder to reduce the size of the milking herd, fourteen head of milk cattle were transferred to other institutions. We endeavor to maintain a herd large enough to supply our own needs and that of the State Hospital for Tuberculous. 174 </seg>
         <seg id="p181">The health condition of the herd has been very good. The herd was placed on the accredited tuberculosis free list and regular blood tests are made for contagious abortion. At the present itie herd is entirely free of these diseases. Minor ailments occasionally, but no serious trouble has endangered the healt 1 of the animals, with the possible exception of tricho - monas. As yet there seems to be very little information con - cerning this disease, although considerable work is being done by experimental stations. . .'.:¦. A n mber of improvements have been made in the past two yeais in this department, such as: The installation of a new electric feed grinder. Barr s and hog houses rebuilt. New fences. .. ¦ . ."¦ ¦ . ¦ = ¦'¦¦¦".".¦ ¦."¦¦ .-". i ¦ Old fences repaired and repainted. A I. rge shelter belt was planted north of the barns and lo:s, and should prove of great value to the dairy de - partment in future years. In &lt; dditiori to supplying milk and milk products for the two ins itutions, the dairy furnishes an excellent laboratory for the 1 raining of young boys. Problems of feeding, manage - ment, and diseases can be studied and observed by the boys. JDuring :he time that the school is in session, the dairy serves as a iabaratory for dairy cattle judging, calf feeding, dehorn - ing, treatment of minor ailments, and many other problems encountered in a dairy enterprise. Boys enrolled in the agri - culture classes receive training in testing milk, cream, and skim milk by the same methods employed by private dairy farms and creamery operators.! Swine . As • part of the dairy, the school also has a large number of hogs, consisting of approximately 250 hogs. As a rule, fifty ¦gilts-are picked out in the fair which are bred for spring litters, and in the spring about twenty-five gilts are saved for fall 175 </seg>
         <seg id="p182">litters. The average size litter per gilt has been 7.5 pigs for the bicniiium. All of the pigs have been vaccinated for hog cholera. We have been very successful in raising hogs dur - ing this biennium, which has proven very profitable to the institution. The practical experience, as well as the academic train - ing received by the boys in these departments, should help them materially if they should choose to follow these vocat - ions. Poultry Department During the past biennium many improvements have been made in our poultry department. All buildings in this depart - ment were completely razed and rebuilt, being changed from a shed roof type with tar paper roofing to the combination type and shingle roofing. All buildings were partitioned and in - sulated, wired in conduit, and each structure provided with safety switch and fuse box. Two buildings were equipped with electric outlets for use with electric brooders, one being provided with a service room and two poultry rooms, the other with a loft for straw storage and the basement for feed stor - age. Electric brooders built by our engineering and carpentry departments replace the oil burner brooders which constituted an almost constant fire hazard. New commercial feeders and drinking founts replaced the home-made equipment which had been in use for many years. Semi-self-cleaning roosts, so con - structed as to prevent access by birds to refuse, have replaced the former open bar and platform type. To the combination brooding and laying unit have been added a number of portable sun parlors which, during the brooding season, permits earl - ier outdoor movement and direct sun light for chicks. During the past biennium. our chicks were obtained from blood tested stock. We were very much pleased with the chicks received, and, due to the careful selection and hatching, our young stock was free from pullorum disease. 176 </seg>
         <seg id="p183">We have added a poultry range to this department, which has increased our outdoor area and permits more freedom over , clean ground fof all chickens, and has overcome the overcrowded conditions which we had experienced in this department. •All roads in this department were improved by widening and grading. A large part of the slough was reclaimed and a road glide built along the east and south. This reclaimed por - tion was added to a previously unused field which was properly sloped, graded and filled. ; Old fence lines were removed, existing chicken yards grad - ed and fencing restretched to posts set at a uniform distance. New fencing was added to enclose.the field which now consti - tutes a summer range for pullets. An important development was the earlier disposition of surplus stock, cockerels and .culled hens being sold which formerly were of considerable food expense extending over a period of seyeral months. . . This department furnishes eggs and meat for our own use and alsc for the Hospital for Tuberculous. MUSIC DEPARTMENT The music department was enlarged and now is one of the outstanding departments in the institution. A full time music instructor makes it possible to teach public school music in the grades, as well as instrumental music in the high school. There are five active musical groups within the Institu - tion. The senior band probably, represents the supreme achievement in instrumental music at the School. This band furnishes music for the Institution programs, and gives Sunday evening concerts at the School, for the boys and the public. They arje; also frequently called upon to play for civic enter - tainments in Kearney and nearby towns. The boys now wear uniforms of white in place of the old gray ones formerly worn. This band is so constituted that a boy may leave it at any time and another boy from the junior band.will be moved up to take 177 </seg>
         <seg id="p184">his place. In this way a perpetuating organization is had and , an active band is always available. The junior band consists of those who are learning to play, and those who are perfecting their technique well enough to play in the senior band when the opportunity arrives. The membership of the junior and senior bands combined, number about ninety boys. The drum and bugle corps is another of the musical units at the Institution. This group furnishes music for parades, and furnishes music preliminary to band concerts. They fre - quently compete with surrounding towns in drum and bugle corps contests. There has also been conducted for the last two years, a piano course in which boys, who are interested, learn to play the piano. In so far as possible, the Progressive music series has been used to help teach the boys their piano work. The vocal music consists of a choir with twenty-six mem - bers, which is vested with white robes and black neckties. This is the organization in which those boys with the best voices find expression. This group appears frequently before civic groups and church congregations, and on occasions has broadcast over KGFW radio station. One of the boys of this choir competed in the Central Nebraska High School music contest and was awarded a superior rating. In addition to the chior, the public school music given in the grades and high school, as well as impromptu cottage sing - ing, gives the boys ample opportunity for vocal expression. The normal boy likes to sing. These boys are encouraged to sing, for singing offers one of the best releases for emotional tension. In the grade school there is also organized a rythm band. From this simple device, we find the boys learning a great deal about music. 178 </seg>
         <seg id="p185">PHYSOLOGICAL AND EDUCATIONAL TESTING The administrative staff, after consultation with the teach - ing staff, selected approximately 18 per cent of the popula - tion to concentrate on vocational training for the individual boy's good. This 18 per cent carried fewer academic subjects ¦than the other students. There, were several reasons for this. One of which was the fact that they were not prepared to hand - le (intellectually) the full scope of an academic curriculm; another one was that vocational work.is very essential to the average young man, and all other students would benefit to a considerable extent having had it. In-any adequately planned rehabilitation program for boys it is essential that we proceed on an individual basis and at - tempt ir telligently to meet the needs of each according to his potentia ability and present skills and knowledge. There is only one way that those facts may be obtained with any degree of accuracy and that is by means of standardized objective tests ami measurements. There is no way to adequately mea - sure the youth's mental potentialities except by a standardized mental lest of either the individual or group type. To test the boy's atility in reading or mathematics or his knowledge of subject matter or skills, we must use standardized tests and measurements that are objective in nature. Having once determined the person's mental potentialities, and his achieve - ments and skills, we are in a position to plan a program for each which is constructive and directional. Though it was fihancia ly impossible to give all boys a complete set of tests, it was pnrt of the plan to give each boy at least ont group men - tal test, and in most cases where the results of the initial test were lo.v, to give at least one individual mental test as well. Henmor-Nelson group tests of mental ability were given first, followed in many cases by individual tests of either the verbal or performance type. In this way the low test scores on the group t :st were supplemented by the individual test results and the picture was made more complete.. Many progressive achievement tests were also given in order to determine the degree f retardation in school and also for diagnostic purposes. In some cases aptitude tests were given in orderi to better plan for the progress of an individual. 179 </seg>
         <seg id="p186"/>
         <seg id="p187"/>
         <seg id="p188">A total of 255 Henmon-Nelson group tests of mental abili - ty were given. The range of I.Q.s on those tests was from 51 to 124 with a median I.Q. of 89. This is eleven points of 10. lower than the median of a normal curve distribution but it is reasonable to suppose that a lack of reading ability had a tendency to lower this median because 45 cases of the 255 were given Stanford-Binet individual mental tests and the average I.Q. on the individual tests was seven points higher than nn the group tests. On the basis of one-sixth of the cases, tl-c-n it would seem that the median 1.0. would be only four points of I.Q. below the median of the normal curve. This would seem to show that the average layman's concep - tion that the juvenile delinquent is feeble-minded, is in error and needs to he challenged. Sixty of the- hoys tested with the group tests were test - ed with individual tests of mental ability, either verbal or of the performance type. One Hundred fifty-three of the boys were given both the Henmon-Xelson and the Otis group tests of mental ability. On these test results there was a high correlation, but it was observed that the average I.Q. was higher for the Otis than for the Henmon-Nelson. Many progressive achievement tests were given to com - pare the academic achievement with national averages, and it was found that in general the boys were badly retarded in their knowledge of subject matter and skills. This is not surprising, as delinquency frequently starts with truancy and many of the boys had been out of school for many months before being committed, as well as having had an intermit - tent attendance when they were carried on the rolls as being in school. One of the most interesting observations that might be made in connection with the testing program is that far from having no special abilities or potentialities on which to start a program that is constructive and of benefit to the boy, we have on the contrary a great amount of possibilities, and unless all possible use is made of these advantages the in-i 180 </seg>
         <seg id="p189">stitution becomes one for incarceration rather than one to improve the boy to the fullest "possible extent during his stay with the institution. The testing program was made with the guidance of Mr. H. G. Salter, Director of Education, Board of Control, Lincoln, Nebraska, and Dr. Warren R. Bailer, Assistant Professor, De - partmen: of Education and Psychology, University of Ne - braska, Lincoln, Nebraska. . Since the development of any personality is a many sided affair, oie of the things which the students of child psychology feel has its place in the development of the child is whole - some, directed recreational activity. It gives an outlet for excess physical energy, helps to relieve emotional tension, and if prope ly indulged in, builds up the body physically. The Industrial School has not overlooked the possibility' of read ing some of the boys in the institution, in the initial step at least, by means of their recreational program. The recreational program is under the guidance of a recreational director who is a member of the school staff. These recrea - tional activities, though seasonal in their program, are year around in their activities. Due to the fine gymnasium which we have ; it. is possible to maintain a full recreational program during the winter months. ; Teams have been organized among the boys themselves, so intrj mural sports are engaged in. In addition teams in football, basketball, etc., may compete with surrounding pub - lic high schools. The boys are interested in baseball, softball, football, basketball, horseshoes, socker, volleyball, ice-skating, archery, and other fo^rtns of recreational activity. During the winter months classes in archery, crafts, dramatics, and harmonica were organized under the super - vision c f capable WPA instructors. These classes occur in the eve ling and different groups have the benefit of these, in addit on to their athletic activities already mentioned. Amiteur programs held each] Sunday evening consisted of instrumental and vocal selections^ impersonations, skits, plays, 181 </seg>
         <seg id="p190">tap dancing, and marionette shows. A swing band composed of members of the regular hand furnishes music for these en - tertainments. Boys who showed special talent were given educational opportunity for being on programs - for Kearney civic organizations, and for some other nearby communities. Many of the boys enjoy boxing, and during the last year of the biennium, five boys entered in the Golden Glove tourna - ment, four won district championships in their representa - tive divisions. These four boys were sent to Omaha to com - pete with the other Nebraska Golden Glove district champions. All of the hoys sent to this State Tournament exhibited a fine degree of skill, and what is more important their sports - manship was above reproach. New baseball and football uniforms were furnished the boys during this biennium, and were certainly an incentive for the boys having such an interest in their recreation. Recreational moving pictures are shown each Wednesday evening during the winter months, and these provide an ex - cellent means of maintaining discipline, since disipline is larg - ely handled by denying privileges. In addition to these forms of recreation, boys during the summer months go fishing in the nearby canal, go on picnics, and have the use of a library in which there are many hundreds of volumes, in addition to a current list of magazines. The addition of the magazines to the reading list of the boys, is one of the valuable changes made during this biennium. Another of the phases of the recreational program which must not be overlooked, is the emphasis placed upon the pos - ture of the boys. This is one thing which needs correction in a good many of the boys sent to the institution. Lack of adequate supervision prior to their coming to the insti - tution has led to faulty habits, one of which is their carriage. Xo boy can go out to meet the world adequately, if he has a hang-dog bearing. 182 </seg>
         <seg id="p191">RELIGIOUS SERVICES The religious training of the boys in the State Industrial School is considered a vital part of the School's program. Chapel services are held every Sunday afternoon with clergy - men from the Kearney churches in charge. The clergymen are selected by members of their own profession, and rotate their services from week to week. In addition to these non - denomination protestant services held each Sunday afternoon, Catholic services are held twice a. month with the Reverend Francis J.Tschida of Saint Mary's Church in charge. In addition the Catholic priest has opportunities of meeting with individual boys at other times such as preparing boys for con - firmation. The boys welcome these religious activities and many of them have professed their faith, and with the consent of their parents have been given the privilege of attending church in the city of Kearney. Undue emphasis is not placed upon formalized religion. It is regarded as one of the prin - cipal activities of society, and is accepted as one of the normal activities of the institution. In some cases one of the first real conj acts these boys have with religious activities is after they.are committed to the institution. . HEALTH |-It lias been said that "The strength of-an army lies in its feet.'r In other words, if the physical well being were not looked after, the whole program was likely to fail. In the rehabilitation of any youth, the physical condition of the 1 oy must not be disregarded, for from this physical conditioi may come other hanicaps. No boy, for example, can do his best intellectually when he feels ill, and from the mental hygiene standpoint a disfigurement caused, by acne or poor teeth may lead to emotional disturbances which prevent the boy frori becoming rehabilitated to the extent that he might otherwise be. i Whe never necessary surgical treatment is used to correct such defects as tumors, verricuas, hernias, etc.; some of the 183 </seg>
         <seg id="p192">major operations of an emergency nature, are transferred to Kearney Hospitals. Where they are of chronic nature they are performed at the Orthopedic Hospital in Lincoln. In - juries of a small nature and lacerations are immediately attend - ed to at the Institution hospital. In order that the boy's health as well as that of the in - stitution may he thoroughly safe-guarded, every boy enter - ing the Institution is given prompt and thorough medical ex - aminations. Any difficulties found needing correction are im - mediately corrected or, at" least remedial procedures are started. The result of this initial physical examination is part of the hoy's case history, and is recorded for future reference, and for future additions or charges. The boy's weight change is recorded monthly, and the doctor's attention is called to any - appreciable loss of weight. The Institution has, as part of its physical plant, a nice hospital building, in which are located the clinic for treating not only those requiring services of the dentist but also those requiring medical attention. A registered nurse is employed on a full time basis to take care of small illnesses, and Dr. Harold B. Smith, grad - uate physician and surgeon, is employed as a part time staff member, to hold regular office hours at the Institution hos - pital every other day, in addition to being subject to call at any time. The following routine tests are given to every boy upon entering; the Wasserman test, which after six weeks is re - peated, diphtheria, toxoid, small pox vaccination, and tuber - culin skin test. All boys showing a positive mantoux test are x-rayed to discover any active cases of Tuberculosis, and we are pleased to say that no such active cases were dis - covered during the past biennium. Boys afflicted with any contagious diseases are immediately isolated and properly treated for the required time. With all the precautionary measures for prevention of di&gt;eases there is still a possibility of accidents which would be detrimental to the welfare of the boys. During the past bien - nium there was only one serious accident in the institution, 184 </seg>
         <seg id="p193">and two boys died at the institution during the same period. In general the whole situation in regard to the boys' general health he s been very good. One of the reasons for this, is the fact that sanitation and cleanliness is taught and actively super - vised throughout the entire institution during the entire time. Cleanlimss is not only next to Godliness, it is also the first step toward good health., ! In aonnection with the hospital building, it was mentioned that a dental clinic was added in-the building. This modern dental office was equipped during the biennium, and a part time dentist, Dr. W. P. Boggs spends one full day each week at the School. In addition he may be subject to call for emer - gency. Boys are given routine examination upon entrance and are given most of the necessary corrective treatments, although orthodontia treatment is not attempted. The boys are also given individual instruction by the dentist as to the proper care of teeth and gums, and in order to help the boys to carry out these instruction- tooth paste and tooth brushes have been purchased by the Institution and distributed to the boys, sc that the proper mouth hygiene is conducted. Marked improvement in the appearance of the boys teeth has been noticed, and there has been decided decrease in emergency treatment necessary. Before the boys leave the Institution a final check-up is given by dentist. . 185 </seg>

         <seg id="p201">HOSPITALS FOR THE MENTALLY ILL The three State Hospitals for the mentally ill in Nebraska are located at Norfolk, Lincoln and Hastings. They are now equipped-..with every facility | for the treatment and care of mental diseases just as general hospitals are prepared to treat physical ills. Well equipped laboratories and diagnostic facili - ties aid in the medical treatment. The competent staff of resident physicians, with the addition of a consultant medical staff of specialist provide adequate treatment. To these train - ed people nay be added the dentist, pathologist, and therapist, all of who ii play an important part in caring for the patients, while at the hospital, and in Helping to return them to society as quickly as possible. There has been continued emphasis on treatment facilities in the mental hospitals to the end that they no longer offer merely custodial care. Improvements in medical and nursing services have been brought about through the inceasing of the number of physicians, registered nurses, and attenc ants, and through the raising of qualifications of nurses and attendants. The hospitals are equipped to give shock and fever therapy, and the latest methods of shock treatment are used. This includes the use of metrazol and insulin. Tie occupational therapy work has been strengthened to facilitate the recovery of patients. Greater emphasis has been given to its correlation with other treatments of the patients. It is graded in difficulty from the simple tasks around the Wards for the patients who are the least able to do the more complicated work found in the occupational therapy rooms. Larger percentages of patients are found in activities around the institution which have therapeutics value. Mental hygiene clinics have been conducted in some instances, and these out-patient's departments have been developed to the limit of all available facilities. At these mental hygiene clinics, psychiatric and psychological examinations are made and treat - ment advised in order that the number of persons needing institutional care because of mental conditions may be les - sened, and that those who enter institutions may secure maxi- 193 </seg>
         <seg id="p202">mum benefits during their cure. Patients may be referred to this clinic by schools, private physicians, or social agencies, and they represent child guidance problems, social adjustment problem's, and cases of mental deficiencies, psycho-neurosis, neurosis, and psychosis. The objective of the three hospitals for the mentally ill has been to continue the transformation of "Insane Asylums", into modern hospitals tor curing mental diseases in order that as many mental patients as possible may be returned to the community under proper supervision and safeguard. There has also been the effort made to educate the general public on the importance of maintaining sound mental health, and. in case a person is in need of advice as to their mental condition, that they seek it with as little hesitation as they would if they were otherwise physically ill. No longer is the old idea main - tained that one of the hospitals for the mentally ill in Ne - braska is considered an institution for the incurables. The advancements in medical science have made this idea more obsolete, because new developments in medical science have produced cures in patients who were formerly thought to be incurable.

'.' ¦'.''• Other patients may be paroled to friends or relatives subject to a retvvn from parole in case the patient cannot make an adequate adjustment. There has been a great deal of misunderstanding about insanity, its causes, possibility of a cure, and other conditions relating to it. A person confined in a hospital for the mentally ill is regarded by the average person, who is uninformed, as an object of curiosity, to be laughed at and ridiculed. This is a condition which has an historical background. When those 195 </seg>
         <seg id="p204">of abnormal behavior were looked upon with suspicion, they were supposed to be inhabited by devils. Even yet some observers of the mentally ill feel that the patients are hardly human because their actions are abnormal and unusual. The layman may feel that the patient does not think or reason urdu any of the things that a normal being; might. It is unfortunate that such a wide-spread belief remains in a world which has made such advancements in science. The average person frequently conceives oi the patients in the hospital for the mentally ill as being violent and requiring- constant super - vision to prevent his taking the lives of others. Insanity after all is only a deviation from normal behavior caused by mental illness, and how far this deviation must go before a person is recognized as needing care in a hospital is a question not easily determined. Insanity is a legal term and a person be - comes insane because the law and its records say he is. The mental abnormality may exisc some time before such legal conditions are recognized. The average layman differentiates but little between feeble mindedness and insanity, and to them either class of individuals are known as "idiots". People coming into this world have certain mental potentialities. These potentialities may be reduced in many ways, and when one's mental development has started to recede from a previous level, you have in the commonly accepted idea, a case of in - sanity. Feeble mindeduess, on the other hand, simply means that the mental development of a person is arrested and does not reach its normal fulfillment. It is possible to have an insane, feeble minded person, but most people do not usually think of the situation. The feeble minded are known as "Life's Perpetual Children", because their mental development does not exceed that of a child. But an adult insane patient, on the other hand when cured of his malady, is not a child in mentality but an adult. In other words, his mental potentiality has been obscured temporarily because of the mental illness. 196 </seg>
         <seg id="p205">HASTINGS STATE HOSPITAL \ INGLESIDE, NEBRASKA The Hastings State Hospital for the mentally ill has made several in portant administrative changes, during the biennium, which have increased the efficiency and service of the institu - tion. In October. 1938 arrangements were made by the Has - tings Hospital and the Nursing Schools of the State to co - operate ir instituting a four months affiliation for psychiatric nursing i:i the Hastings Hospital. The Board of Directors of the Hastings State Hospital School of Psychiatric Nursing are as folows : Doctor Juul'C. Nielson, Superintendent, Hastings State Hospital. : V Maud E. A Tuquist, Member of the Board of Control. Miss Carol L.Martin, M.A., ELN., Director, Bureau of Education and Registration for Nurses, Nebraska. Dean F. E. Weyer, Hastings College, Hastings, Nebraska. Miss Leeta A. Holdrege; R.N., Executive Director, The Visiting Nurse Association of Omaha, Nebraska. Mrs. T. C. Young, Director of Recreation, Hastings, Nebraska. '¦...¦ \ . • Miss" Arta Lewis, R.N., Director of Nursing, Mary Lanning MemoriarHospiia!. Doctclr John H. Waterman, Assistant Clinical Director, Hastings State Hospital. Miss Lillian V. Salsman, M.A., R.N., Principal of School and Director of Nursing. Approximately thirty students are accomodated each four months' period, changing October 1, February 1, and June 1.1 Arrangement has also been completed for a one-year post graduate study in psychiatric nursing and at present eleven nurses, are. enrolled. It is/our opinion that this School of Nursing has stimulated the staff and the personnel of the hos - pital, that it has enabled them to give more individual atten - tion to the mentally and physically ill and has given them an opportunity to disseminate psychiatric knowledge to the nurs - ing profession, all with little, increase in expenditures. Mem - bers of the hospital staff gave up their quarters in order to make accommodations for the students. 197 </seg>
         <seg id="p206">The urganization of the hospital is considered to be ideal for this institution at this time. The Assistant Superintendent is also Assistant Clinical Director for the Medical work within the institution while another Assistant Clinical Director looks after the medical work outside the institution as it is forming itself in the Out-Patient Department and Child Psychiatry. One of the important developments is a more intimate contact between the steward's department, the occupational therapist, and the physician. In other words, an attempt has been made to have all the departments within the institution, and every employee within those departments, serve more efficiently for the one purpose for which the institution is created; namely, that of caring for mental patients and for adequately treating them so as to return to society the greatest possible number of socially adjusted individuals. It is now possible to place a patient in any department in the institution and receive a report from that department on the regular occupational therapy chart so that this patient's behavior, development and progress becomes a record and the occupational therapist and psychiatrist have more adequate control of the patient's treat - ment. It is therefore an attempt to more closely unite and integrate the various functional units of the hospital under the medical head. As will be seen from Table I, the population of the in - stitution has increased during the two-year period from 1521 to 1656. The increase was made possible by the opening of the new Psychiatric Hospital Unit on May 10, 1938. When additional space thus became available, the practice of having patients sleep on mattresses on the floor, was discontinued. The waiting list of the counties throughout the hospital dis - trict was absorbed as rapidly as possible. On June 20, 1939, the new Women's Continued Treatment Building was oc - cupied partially. When this occupation is completed, it will be possible to discontinue the wards on the fourth floor in the main building. It will also be seen from Table 1 that during this biennium there have been admitted 730 patients; and, al - though the number of discharges, 260, is greater than any preceeding biennium, the percentage, of course, is small when 198 </seg>
         <seg id="p207">compared with the admissions. At the beginning of the bien - nium, 146 patients were out on parole and at the close of the bienniutn this number had increased to 259. The pharmacological shock treatment utilizing insulin and metrazol had its beginning within this hospital in Jaunary 1937. Up to the present date there have been treated 125 cases of schizophrenia, 10 cases of manic depressive psychosis, 5 cases cf psychoneuroses, and 8 cases of involutional melan - cholia. The results obtained with this treatment were com - pared with a control series consisting of cases of the same age, sex, and diagnosis. From the following table it is readily seen that pharmacological shock is a valuable aid in state hospital xeatment. More patients recover, or show improve - ment, ar long the shock treated cases than among the con - trolled. Likewise, relapses are fewer in shock treated cases. Especially do we see the efficacy of this treatment in involu - tional melancholia where the recovery rate is nearly double that of the controlled cases. 199 </seg>

         <seg id="p209">From Table II it will be seen that the shock treated cases require oi the average of four months and four days less time in the hospital than the controlled and that the treatment of involution melancholia requires four months and 18 days less time in the hospital than the controlled group.

The ex - perience fit Hastings does not indicate that fractures are fre - quent complications in shock treatment. There was only one fracture in 2109 induced convulsions. During the biennium Hastings' Hospital staff has been permitted to work in conjunction with _£he/(jniversity of Ne - braska College of Medicine in a research problem utilizing the Kettering Hypertherm for the treatment of neurosyphilHs by artificial fever. Dr. A. E. Bennett of Omaha was instrumental in bringir g about this connection with the College of Medicine. A total cf 66 cases have completed treatment with gratifying results, [t is interesting to know that during the days when malarial fever was used in conjunction with chemotherapy in the treatment of neurosyphilHs that 42% showed sufficient improvement to be discharged from the institution, but since utilization of the Kettering Hypertherm, the percentage of discharges has increased to 64%:" 201 </seg>
         <seg id="p210">The Department of Pathology has functioned efficiently under the direction of Dr. S. Miles Bouton, and since his de - parture, under the direction of Dr. Schubert Knittel with the aid of a technician and two helpers. Considerable new equip - ment has been added so that this department is equipped to carry out all of the functions required of it, including limited research and teaching.

This department consists of the Assistant Clinical Director a Psychiatric Social Worker and a Resident in Psy - chiatry. Since this department is the first of its kind in a Nebraska State Hospital, and since it has successfully emerged from its infantile stage, a brief history is included in this re - port. The first out-patient was accepted at the Hastings State Hospital in November, 1933. There were four more out - patients accepted during the remainder of 1933, sixteen new out-patients accepted during the year 1934, eleven in 1935, and nineteen in 1936. Twenty-eight new out-patients were ac - cepted d iring the first half of 1937. During this period of four years, the out-patients were chiefly examined by the younger doctors and the cases to - gether with the history and examination; were gone over with the Superintendent in the presence of the Social Worker before the future course of action was decided upon. It was essentially a part-time clinic, Saturday mornings being chiefly devoted to this work. The first juvenile patient was seen in November. of 1934, and the number of children seen gradu - ally increased until by July; 1937 children constituted approx - imately of the total number of out-patients. By July of 1937 the Out-patient Department and Child Psychiatry Clinic had become a definite department of the hospital, and was handled by one physician and the social worker, who had, in addition, their regular work with adult patients in the hospital. ; The following are the statistics showing the number of patients handled during the biennium July 1, 1937 to June 30, 1939:;', . / '¦'¦' ; -.:: .- ¦¦.'.¦; . 1 '."

The Out-Patient Department and Child Psychiatry Clinic performs several distinct services. 1. It serves as a treatment center and follow-up ser - vice for patients who have been paroled from the hospital and who live within a reasonable distance of the hospital so that they can make visits to the clinic without too great an inconvenience. A large number of the out-patient visits were with parole patients returning for discussion of their problems after they had left the hospital. 2. The Out-Patient Department serves as a liaison de - partment between the hospital and the community. Patients are referred to the clinic, in order of the frequency of re - ferrals, by : A. County Assistance administrations. B. Private physicians. C. Near-by city school systems. D. Private relief agencies and institutions. E. Individuals who have been to the clinic themselves. 210 </seg>
         <seg id="p219">I In turn, the referring agencies are used to help the patients i| make adjustments in the community wherever this is needed. Through the out-patient staff's explanation of the problems which tie patient presents, the community comes to a better under sanding of the facilities the hospital has to offer, and, because of the out-patient work, the, hospital becomes better acquainted with the problems involving mental hygiene which appear baffling to the community. 3. The Out-Patient Department serves as a diagnostic center, often preventing the commitment of a patient who is merely feeble-minded and not mentally sick. Conversely, it often helps in bringing patients the advantage of hospital care by recommending committment of those patients who are seriously mentally sick, but not recognized as such by j the relatives or the referring agency. 4. 't serves in. an advisory capacity to the Juvenile Court in its handling of juvenile delinquents and in some instances to the County Courts in the disposition of adult offenders. . . : 5. ± serves as a treatment center for those patients j with nervous and mental disorders which are not serious enough to warrant hospitalization. Adult cases treated are usually psychoneuroses or organic nervous diseases. The Child Psychiatry Clinic treats mainly the minor behavior disorders of child en. All treatment is based on the principle of the treatment of the individual as a whole. There are complete histories, physical examinations, mental and psychometric ex - aminations, and complete laboratory work done in every case, Treatment of all physical difficulties, with the exception of the most minor ones, are referred to the patient's local phy - sician for treatment. : The Out-Patient Department and Child Psychiatry Clinic are a distinct advantage and saving to the people of the State of Nebmska because they help prevent the return of parole patients by helping them to avert subsequent attacks of mental illness; prevent unnecessary commitments; bring hospital treatment to those for whom it will do definite good; often prevent.. subsequent hospitalization by treatment of thpse 211 </seg>
         <seg id="p220">patients who might later develop a mental illness; assist in the prevention of possible future delinquency; and finally, help to bring about a better understanding of and attitude toward mental illness between the hospital and the com - munity. During the biennium, all members of the medical staff generously contributed to the information of the public as well as the medical profession of our state concerning the nature of mental disorders. Talks on various aspects of mental hygiene and psychiatry in general have been given to people ;md civic groups, and during the biennium all county medical meetings have been held regularly at the institution and once a year the district society has met here.

The Dietetic Department has made considerable progress under th; capable management of Miss Fujan, and, since her resignation, under Mrs. Hallie Cox. A well-balanced diet is served from the food products available from the farms, gar - dens and by purchase. The amounts and quality have been satisfactory and it has been made tasty and appetizing by the increased equipment for preparation as found in the new kitchen. It has been a. great aid in the management of the physical health of the patient population. Fronythe Steward's Report of the farm and garden, which follows the medical statistics, it will be seen that the expendi - tures in improvements such as wells and live stock have been very remunerative. The farm furnishes us our entire milk supply and a great proportion of our pork. ' The garden has furnished an abundance of vegetables during the summer season as well as a considerable amount for canning and at times the surplus has been sold to. other institutions. There has been considerable change in personnel during the past :wo yearsY This is largely due to the fact that em - ployees hive been able to find better positions in other States. During tie past two years 242 have left our services. This enormous turnover detracts from the efficiency of the care of our patieuits, and this situation should be remedied. Chan jes in the medical, staff are as follows; Dr. S. Miles Bouton, Dathologist, left our services on September 23, 1938 and was replaced by Dr. Schubert Knittel. Dr. D. A.

         <seg id="p231">. LINCOLN STATE HOSPITAL ¦¦ Lincoln, Nebraska The last part of the biennium saw considerable change in the policy and the administration of the Lincoln State Hos - pital after the resignation of Dr. Griffiths. The receiving ser - vice [and radiological department were reorganized. These will be discussed a little later in the report. The biennium was begun with an overcrowded condition on the wards, and there can be no improvement until the new building is completed, There is also a long waiting list of patients. At the beginning of the period there were 1220 patients in the hospital, 600 men and 620 women. There were 367 patients admitted, of which 248 were men and 119 were women. There were 346 patients discharged, of whom 314 were 1 considered improved and 32 unimproved, 102 were re - moved by death. At the end of the period 1243 patients re - mained in the hospital, 66 are on parole, and 3 are on escape. The general health of the patient population has been good! There were no epidemics or infectious diseases. At this time the entire patient population is being immunized for small po: t and typhoid fever. ! By means of physical examinations, laboratory procedures, and ie-ny studies, the active cases of tuberculosis have been detected and segregated to the greatest extent that our facili - ties will permit. Because of the overcrowded conditions ade - quate tieatment is not possible. One of the old receiving buildings can be easily remodeled at little expense and pro - vide treatment facilities. The receiving service has been reorganized. Physicians are assigned to either the men or .women's service and rotate for new cases. Each physician is! responsible for taking the history, giving the physical examination, prescribing, and pre - senting the case before the staff. Clinical conferences are held twice weekly where the hew cass are presented for con- 223 </seg>
         <seg id="p232">sideration of diagnosis and treatment. Cases on treatment .ire reviewed irom time to time, and cases eligible for parole ¦ire considered at these conferences. In addition to the con - ferences, staff meetings are held twice weekly for considera - tion of matters of medical administration. The use of shock therapy, both insulin and metrazol, is being continued in selected cases. However, in many cases the use of the shock treatment has not produced the result hoped for. Favorable cases of neurosyphilis are treated by means of combined fever therapy and chemotherapy. Until our own department is established the patients are temporarily trans - ferred to the Hastings State Hospital for the artificial fever treatments. The radiological department has been completely reor - ganized. The old x-ray equipment has been replaced by a new 200 M.A. shock-proof unit. A registered x-ray technician is employed, and we now have the services of a certified radiologist. The laboratory has been moved to larger quar - ters on the ground floor of the hospital building and new equipment is being added. With the services of a full-time dentist much has been accomplished along oral hygiene lines. The following is a condensed report of the activities of this department: From September 1, 1937, to July 1, 1939 Number of patients examined 565 Number of extractions 1570 Number of impacted teeth extracted 5 Fillings: porcelain, cement, alloy 262 New plates, full and partial 66 Repair plates 54 Relined plates 8 X-rays, partial 4 X-rays, full mouth 75 Reset inlays and bridges 13 Small growths removed 2 224 </seg>
         <seg id="p233">Split gums and scraped bones ....-." ' 2 Alveoiectomies ... 2 Treatments for sore mouth after extractions, injuries, etc. . 90 Sine: January, 1939, a part-time pharmacist has been em - ployed. By means of a requisition system an accurate account is kept on all drugs and supplies dispensed from this depart - ment. ';...; . ¦'¦.¦;.¦ ¦-¦¦¦.-¦¦., ¦•: ; Because of lack of facilities at the'hospital the number of post mortem examinations is quite low. The only cases that can be posted are those going to local undertaking par - lors. As soon as our post mortem room is completed and equip - ped the percentage of post mortem examinations should be much higher. . ; New sterilizers and other equipment have been installed in the surgical department and consequently we will be better prepared to perform the necessary surgery. The old hydrotherapy department has become inadequate for the present needs of the hospital. At this time the de - partment is being enlarged and new equipment is being in - stalled. We will then have an adequate hydrotherapy depart - ment for both sedative and tonic purposes. Consequently the use of seclusion and restraint will be kept at a minimum as well as requiring fewer sedative drugs/ There probably is no one thing that is any more effec - tive in preventing deteriorations than some form of activity. For mar y years the various institutional occupations have been used to a very good advantage. However, such occupa - tions are of value only to patients that are accessible. Such activities cannot be used for the stuporous, retarded, indif - ferent, or inaccessible patient. It is such cases that receive considerable benefit from. activities in an organized occupa - tional therapy department. Early in this year such a depart - ment was started under the direction of a trained occupational therapist assisted by two helpers. Because of lack of ade - quate space we are having classes for women patients only. 225 </seg>
         <seg id="p234">As patients improve they are dismissed from the hospital or are transferred to institutional occupations. Recreational therapy is combined with the occupational therapy depart - ment, and an organized program of recreation is carried out for both men and women patients in addition to the usual forms of entertainment, such as dances, picture shows, etc. Early in the biennium a beauty parlor was installed and the services of a cosmetologist were obtained. Facilities nec - essary for improving the personal appearance of the women are not only appreciated by them but in many instances }t may be regarded as an effective means of therapy.. As soon as adequate facilities are available, plans will be made to organize a consulting staff representing the major specialities. There is need for better follow-up of cases after leaving the hospital. Often considerable time and effort are spent in bringing about a recovery or an improvement, but after the patient leaves the hospital little effort is made to main - tain this improvement. There is little doubt that more cases could be paroled, and more cases out on parole could be kept out longer, with an adequate follow-up system through a psychiatric social service department. PERSONNEL CHANGES During the biennium there were several changes in the medical staff. Dr. Marie L. Grote' resigned November 30, 1937, because of ill health. Dr. George W. Russell was ap - pointed assistant physician February 3, 1938, and Dr. Edward R. Miller was appointed July 2, 1938. Dr. Fred T. Butz was appointed dental surgeon September 1, 1937. There have been several other changes in the personnel during the past two years. Mr. J. R. Helms, who had been steward for many years, passed away May 16, 1938, and Mr. E. J. Hall was appointed to succeed him. Mrs. Ola G. Hol - lingsworth resigned as matron following an injury on Novem - ber 28, 1938. On September 15, 1937, Mrs. Bertha Fuller was appointed dietitian. 226 </seg>

         <seg id="p247">: NORFOLK STATE HOSPITAL ' Norfolk, Nebraska -¦' ¦..¦¦'¦¦'••¦.".".'¦(¦¦ '¦¦¦¦-. The Norfolk State Host ital was established in the year 1885 fcr the purpose of treating those who were ill with mental diseases. This hospital is one of the eight state hos - pitals west of the Mississippi that is recognized as an accredited hospital for a residency in psychiatry. The Norfolk State Hospita is also on the approved list of the American Medical Association and American College of Surgeons. To be rep - resented on this list is possible only because representatives of the ;\vo organizations have inspected the hospital period - ically and have approved its equipment, personnel and medical practices. This recognition : by the two accrediting agencies mentiored is an honor that should be maintained, and yet to do so requires,!effort. To help make this possible more and better clinical work needs to be done, and additional re - search'work which would call for the addition of a patholo - gist, a psychologist, psychiatric workers, as well as more trained nurses and sufficient clerical help to maintain up-to - date ca;e histories on all patients. Advancements in medical science during the past thirty years probably surpassed the advancement of any other science during this period of time, and especially is this true inpsyciiatry. The advancement in the knowledge and under - standing of mental illness |as well as advancement in new treatments such as the shock and fever therapy have devel - oped so fast during the last j five or six years that it has been difficult to keep abreast of the latest developments and give the desired clinical services ito the patients. To keep abreast of these changing times it is essential that there be a well trained medical staff and that this staff be encouraged to keep up with their educational training. This can only be accomplished through outside study, post-graduate work and encouragement to attend all Psychiatric Association meetings possible. ' ¦¦[¦'. : 239 </seg>
         <seg id="p248">The general health of the population in the hospital has been unusually guild during the biennium. There have been no epidemics, major or minor, during the period. This con - dition of good general health in the institution can be traced directly to the employees who have given excellent cooperation in attempting to keep these epidemics at a minimum. There has been in addition to this the adoption of the policy that au\ employee who becomes ill must immediately notify one of the staff physicians. This has prevented the spread.of ill - ne&gt;se* of an intVcuious nature, especially of a respiratory nature. During the bieunium 105 patients died in the insti - tution, and autopsies were performed on 51% of these. This compares very favorably to state and private hospitals through - out the country. Of these 105. 43 were under 73 years of age : 18 were under 60 years, and 21 were under 50 years of age. This would make the average of deaths quite high in comparison oi the average age of death of those outside the institution. Thirty-five of these deaths were caused by heart disease, and thirty-six by pneumonia. Pneumonia in each case was the terminal condition, following some other illness, that lives up to the adage that "Pneumonia is kind to old people, as it furnishes a most comfortable way of passing from life." One oi the great helps in maintaining the general health has been the improvement in the pharmacy depart - ment, where through a compounding of a large percentage of the ointments, elixirs, and tonics used in the institution, the cost has been reduced to such an extent that an adequate amount has. been available. Also the increased efficiency in the laboratory department has been of great value in main - taining the general health. A marked improvement has been made in the various therapeutic departments and a decided change in philosophy - lias been adopted in regard to the occupational therapy. The attempt is being made to reinterpret the function of occupa - tional thereapy to include all occupations in which patients are engaged. With this idea in mind, the arts and crafts shop would resemble a kindergarten for those who are mentally ill. where they could first learn to occupy themselves gainfully 240 </seg>
         <seg id="p249">as a part. of. a group of people. And when this has been ac - complished, they could go on to other activities about the hospital making their readjustments as they progress, and each step leading toward return to society as a reoriented person. These different occupations would include such industries as the kitchen and field work, some of the general maintenance work, etc. The time is past when simply keeping the patients pacified and present in the institution is sufficient. The aim now is to see that these patients get back again into society zs quickly as possible after they have recovered their mental Health sufficiently. This means better supervision and greater effort at probably some increase in expense. This expense, however, would be more than offset by the shorten - ing of the period of time that the patient spent in the hos - pital, anc consequently a redtction in cost to the State. Many more pa ients have been received during this biennium than during the one which preceded it. &gt; The figures also show that there has been an .increase in deaths. At first glance, it might indicate that more came in because of the greater number of' deaths and the. increased room available. The increased deaths might also make it appear that the general health had been bac, and yet the actual health conditions are better than previous It-will be recalled, however, that in other deaths listed, n.any of them were in the upper age brackets, and age alore certainly, was a contributing factor. The increased admissions can be partially explainable by the fact that many of the patients who came in stayed for a short period of time, were returned home and then returned again. During the past two years the use of shop therapy has been quite extensive, and it is felt that its use of this method of treatment has enabled the Hospital to return home much more quickly, those patients who have not been ill for so long a [period oftime, and also enabled the Hospital to send home ijn larger numbers, those who are listed as improved. The use of the shop therapy has definite limitations and yet it has proved valuable in shortening the hospitalization period of the patient. This in itself would result in the possibility of admitting more patients into the Hospital and thus save the State considerable money. Since the use of shop therapy 241 </seg>
         <seg id="p250">seems to be more effective when it is applied soon after the patient becomes ill, it would seem that the State would be money ahead, if provisions could be made to take care of the sick patients soon after they become ill rather than mak - ing them wait to enter the Hospital as is now the case be - cause of the crowded conditions. In order that the public may become better acquainted with the nature of mental illness, its causes, treatment, and cure, an educational program has been conducted by the in - stitution among the general public. This extra institutional work has consisted of thirty-one public lectures to non-pro - fessional people, and three lectures to members of the medical ; profession. One of these latter lectures was given before a I physicians forum in Dus Moines, lowa in February, 1939; and another to the members of the Lutheran Hospital staff in Norfolk; and a third was read before the State Medical As - sociation at its State Meeting held in Grand Island, Nebraska in May, 1939. This is probably the first time that a repre - sentative of the staffs of the State Hospitals has appeared on a program of the State Medical Society. A member of the staff of the Norfolk State Hospital also gave the com - plete program at the meeting of the Madison, Six County Medical Society of 1938. These educational efforts are being rewarded by the fact that patients come to the Hospital at an earlier period for consultation and in sbme cases hospital - ization. A phase of this work which needs extension, is a consultation clinic, to be held in the County Seats of northern Nebraska at regular intervals so that the practicing physicians may bring in their patients to the clinics for consultation and guidance. This, of course, requires the services of a field worker to make appointments and carry on follow-up work. These clinics would undoubtedly be of untold value to the State from the standpoint of corrective measures. Another of the phases of educational activity, in order to better acquaint the public with the work of the institution and also of mental illness, has been the monthly radio pro - gram put on by the patients of the Norfolk State Hospital under the guidance of the recreational therapy department. 242 </seg>
         <seg id="p251">These pijograms are not only unusual because the talent con - sists entirely of patients from the Hospital, but also because of the fact that at most of the broadcasts, the Superintendent of the Hospital talks directly to the public in regard to mental illness and its nature. Through this medium he is able to reach thousands who would probably not learn of the work in any ether manner. These programs are also unique in that some of the musical instruments used in the programs are made by the patients in the Hospital. The recreational therapy department has been doing splendid work with the limited facilities available, and have added greatly to the morale of the institution by producing entertainments for the benefit of the entire institution and by supervising the recreational activi - ties thrcughout the institution. Recreation of the right type is just as c ssential to these people as it is to the normal person, and adds : m iterially in the rehabilitative process. Recreational activitie consist of weekly dances and talking moving pictures. And in addition there are, in season, hikes, outdoor amuse - ments, uch as croquet and soft ball, and indoor activities, such as card parties and dances. Religious services are held in the institution, each week, and those who are able to, and desire to, attend. . ; I The re have been a considerable number of improvements made in the type of services offered during the years 1937 to '39. OnY of these services has been the addition of a dietitian of the staff to look after the diet of the patients. Special attention has been paid, since! that time, to not only the kind of foods served, but also to the quality and the amounts. This has been obtained Martially by the careful checking and ex - amination of all incoming food supplies, with the subsequent rejection! of those whose standards fall below that stipulated on contracts. To it ake this program more effective, a small dietary kitchen has been established in one corner of the big general kitchen. Ir the kitchen itself, there has been added some equipment such as a meat slicer and a bread slicer, a meat grinder for ti^e electric mixer, a new tray cart, and other things to facilitate the handling of foods. Considerable can - ning of surplus commodities has been done in the general kitchen. A number of pieces of up-to-date kitchen equipment 243 </seg>
         <seg id="p252">are needed to make the handling of foods more efficient and adequate. A considerable number of improvements which have been made during the biennium are as follows: from funds appro - priated by the Legislature of 1937, a new Farm Ward building, Elevator for our Hospital building, equipment for two hydro - thcrapy rooms, and an increase in our water supply were made possible. During the first year of this biennium, after a number of tests were made, three wells were put down, which re - lieved the serious situation of our water supply,. In addition to these wells, two irrigation wells' were put down on a 55- Acre tract of land owned by the State of Nebraska which is located south and west of the Hospital. This tract of land is used for gardening, and this year, through the drouth, these two wells more than paid for themselves by the garden crops produced. Not all of this tract of land has been put under irrigation as yet. Considerable work has been done and it is hoped by next year there will be more leveling done and laterals run so that the greater part of this tract may be irrigated. The Board of Control very wisely used our apportionment of the building appropriation made by the Legislature, in procuring a PVVA project, with the result that we had suf - ficient money for two buildings instead of one; viz., a Farm Ward Building and an Employees Building. The Farm Ward Building is nearing completion, as is the Employees Building. These two buildings are well planned and are of splendid con - struction. We believe they will greatly aid in filling our long - standing need for more room. The elevator for the Hospital Building has been installed mil is now in use. The Hydrotherapy rooms are finished and the equipment is being installed. Every effort has been made to keep the entire physical institution in a state of good repair. It would be impossible 244 </seg>
         <seg id="p253">to enuirerate in detail all of the repairs made in an Institu - tion of this size. • Many improvements and alterations have been made during- this biennium, but only the more impor - tant are enumerated here. Extensive roof repairs have been made, aid in my judgment, bur roofs are now in better con - dition than they have been for many years. Extensive repairs have bejen made on the roofs of the Engine Room, West Wing, Ward 15 Building and the Laundry Building, and lesser repairs have been done on majny of the other buildings. Much painting has been done, both inside and outside. Painting has been a WPA project. Some of the more important paint - ing projects were painting of Wards S, 6, 7, 8, 9, U, 13 and 15, the Kitchen Building, and many outside doors. Some of the nun erous alterations and repairs are re-arrangement of the Denial Office; installation of power lines from the Engine Room t:&gt; the Hospital building for the elevator and x-ray; re-arranjement of the Medical and General Libraries; repairs of No. Spoiler; construction bf three-phase power line to the wells; ejxtension of the water mains; re-building brick fur - nace boners; set;and connecting fire pump engine; and num - erous other small repairs. \ 245 </seg>

         <seg id="p288">NEBRASKA INSTITUTION FOR FEEBLE MINDED Beatrice, Nebraska . The Nebraska Institution for the Feeble Minded was estab - lished for the purpose of "providing the custodial care and humane treatment for those who are feeble minded, to segre - gate them from society, to study to improve their condition, to classify them, and to furnish such training in industrial me - chanics, agricultural, and academic subjects as it is severally fitted 4 require." This statement is found in the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska 1929 edition, Chapter 83, and paragraph 403. There is nothing in this particular statement which limits in any way the age of those to be cared for on either the upper or lower age limits. Neither is anything said about the defin - ition of feeble mindedness. Instead of attempting to define the term feeble mindedness, the law says that the institution shall provide custodial care and humane treatment for those who are fee )le minded, and this condition of feeble mindedness is to be determined by action of the Board of Control, or by any Juvenii; court, or by any County court in the State of Nebras - ka. Tie courts, in making their decision, shall have the help of a legally qualified physician and others interested in the case. Aiter the court hearing, and, ife has been determined that the person is feeble minded, the court shall commit such person to the Nebraska Institution for he Feeble Minded and shall direct that he be detained therein until duly discharged. However feeble mindedness is defined by statute. The 1935 Session Laws, Chapter 143, section 4, page 534 says, "The words feeble minded person shall be construed to mean any person afflicted with any mental defectiveness from birth or early age, so pronounced that he is incapable of managing himself and his affairs and of subsisting by him own efforts, or being taught to do io, or that he requires supervision, control and care for his own welfare or for the welfare of others, or for the wel - fare olf the community, and who cannot be classified as an in - sane person." . 280 </seg>
         <seg id="p289">Chapter 83, paragraph 404 charges the Institution for re - ceiving of such feeble minded persons who are duly committed and to detain them in the institution and to arrest and return any who may escape therefrom, until duly discharged or trans - ferred in accordance with the provisions of law and the rules and regulations adopted with reference thereto by the Board of Control. And in case a person is an inmate of a state insti - tution the court may commit such person to the care and cus - tody of the State Board of Control, and the Board of Control may, in its discretion, transfer him to the Nebraska Institu - tion for the Feeble Minded. Thus it will be seen that a person may be sent to the Institution for the Feeble Minded through a commitment of the Juvenile court, or a commitment of the county court, or by tranfer by the Board of Control. Adults who are committed to the Institution for Feeble Minded at Beatrice may be detained there for life or they may - be discharged by the superintendent of the institution, or they may be paroled by the superintendent of the institution. A juvenile committed to the Institution for Feeble Minded, be - fore admission has his case history previewed by the Case Committee, and admittance is made on their recommendation, and he may be detained in the institution, indefinitely or upon recommendation of the Case Committee, which consists of the head of the instituion, a member of the Board of Control, the head of the Child Welfare Division, he may be placed out - side the Institution. He may be placed temporarily, depend - ing upon developments and if his adjustment is entirely satis - factory, he might be discharged by the institution. Until this discharge, however, the person is under the jurisdiction of the State and is subject to return to the institution upon recom - mendation of the Case Committee and withovit further court action. Individuals coming into the institution will be given a very complete physical examination and everything; is done that is possible to make any corrective treatments necessary by the medical staff in the institution. Juveniles having some chronic physical defectiveness may be taken to the Orthopedic Hospital in Lincoln for corrective treatment. Dental work is 281 </seg>
         <seg id="p290">taken care of by a part time dentist who spends one day each week in the institution. Those individuals who had sufficient mentality; are put in school for one-half of each day, where they ire taught the elementary subjects of the first six grades of school, and in addition the girls who are in school that are capable, and also those who are not in school that are capable are taught how to sew in the school sewing class. The aca - demic school consists of primary, first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth grades. A few who have some ability above the achievement level of the sixth grade are given individual work to the limit of their ability. Recreation is provided in the insti - ution by talking moving picture shows once a week, dances once * week, by out door games in season, and by library ma - terial « such as books and magazines. A recreational supervisor is, employed on a twelve month basis, whose duty it is to look after the physical education program. Religious services are held an Sunday morning and all who are able are asked to attend. ; — The condition of feeble mindedness is one of those things whicJ: is little understood by the layman. There has been a tendeicy in the past years to take a term which has a specific mean ng and apply it generally as a term of derision. It is a comm on practice, for example, to call a person who commits a crime, especially one of) a heinous nature, a moron. It also frequently happens that a person who is mentally dull is fre - quently referred to as an idiot. Psychologists are in quite general agreement that these terms have definite meanings in relationship to performance on intelligence test scales. The average layman conceives of feeble mindedness as being some - thing similar to a precipice, which up unto the point that you reach the edge of the precipice; you are not feeble minded, and the minute you step over the edge of the precipice you become feeble minded. The edge of this precipice in terms of an in - telligence quotient is usually taken to be seventy, or by some psychologists seventy-five. If it were this easy to determine who is feeble minded and who is not, the matter would be compiratively simple. As a matter of fact, the term feeble mindedness has been used to such an extent that it has had a tendency to fall into disrepute. To say that a person is sub- 282 </seg>
         <seg id="p291">normal mentally is probably much more accurate than to say that he is feeble minded, for a person may be sub-normal men - tally and still be able to be self-supporting economically. Or in time of economic good times such a person may be self - supporting, while in times of economic distress this sub-normal person may not be self-supporting. So the ability to take care of ones self is not an absolute criteria which can be set up to decide whether or not a person is feeble minded. Feeble mindedness is a condition, and all of the elements making up the condition must be taken into consideration be - fore a recommendation is made for institutionalization. There is a belief among some psychologists that a person's ability to adjust into normal society will lose effectiveness upon con - finement in an institution for the feeble minded. This is be - cause the background of the individual is such that he does not have to meet the challenge of higher levels of performance. So that it is better for those who are subnormal mentally, es - pecially on the upper levels, to attempt to make an adjustment in society rather than to thrust them into an institution where they may lose what little social experience they have had. Af - ter all, by far the biggest percentage of those who arc sub - normal mentally are not confined in state institutions, but are making some kind of adjustment in society. Chapter 83, paragraph 1502 of the 1929 Compiled Statutes of Nebraska "provides for the creation of a Board of Examiners of Defectives, whose duty it shall be to determine who shall be sterilized before being discharged or released on parole." And paragraph 1509 states, "that if the Board of Examiners fails to faithfully execute and force the provisions of paragraph 1501 it shall work a forfeiture of office of any or all members of the Board who may be immediately or directly responsible for such failure, and in addition thereto such member or mem - bers who may be immediately or directly responsible for such failure shall be fined in any sum not more than two thousand dollars or be confined in the county jail not less than three months nor more than six months in the discretion of the court." During the Biennium sixteen males and twenty-four females at the Institution for the Feeble Minded were steril - ized. 283 </seg>
         <seg id="p292">iA the 1935 Statutes of Nebraska, Chapter 143, page 533, provides for the creation of a State Commission for the control of feejble minded persons. It consists of the chairman of the Board of Control, the superintendent of the Nebraska Institu - tion for the Feeble Minded and the Attorney General. The superintendent of the Nebraska Institution of the Feeble Minded shall be chairman of the commission. The commission shall lave the power to employ a psychologist and any other personnel that they shall deem necessary for carrying out the provisions of this act. Any expenses incurred in the adminis - tratio: i of the act including compensation of employees and travel ng expenses including lodgings while away from home engag;d in the performance of their duties shall be paid out of the funds provided for the maintenance and support of the Ne - braskr Institution for the Feeble Minded youth. It is the pur - pose cf the act to provide that all Feeble Minded persons resi - dent ii the State, shall become wards of the state to the end that they shall not reproduce their kind. The Commission shall make a survey of all the state institutions and of the state generally to ascertain the persons whom they believe to be feeble minded, in order that the State Commission can make necessiry complaints to the County Commission. The words feeble minded person, under this act were construed to mean any p:rson afflicted with mental defectiveness from birth or from.an early age, so pronounced that he is incapable of man - aging himself and his affairs, and subsisting by his own efforts or being taught to do so, or that he requires supervision, con - trol, a id care for his own welfare or for the welfare of others or for the welfare of the community, and who cannot be classi - fied as an insane person. This Commission of the feeble minded shall lave authority in the State of Nebraska in all matters pertairing to the care, supervision, and control of all feeble mindec persons who are not confined within the Nebraska In - stitutun for the Feeble Minded people; One of the duties of the Q: mmission is to maintain a continuative census of the Feeble Minded in ¦ the:. State, and such records shall not be con - sidered public records and will only be subject to the use of the sail Board. The County Commissioners of insanity in each county shall constitute a subcommission of the State Commis- 284 </seg>
         <seg id="p293">sion and their respective counties and specific authority is here - by granted to such subcommission to apprehend, examine, and commit, establish guardianships, transport, and maintain cus - tody of any feeble minded person within their respective coun - ties. It has been impossible for this Commission to function to any marked extent because of lack of funds. During the biennium considerable improvement has been made around the institution. This improvement consists of a new dormitory for girls which will house three hundred. An - other was the construction of a large vegetable cave of one hundred by thirty feet in size. An extension to the water main, nine thousand feet in length was laid to connect with that of the City of Beatrice to insure an adequate amount of water. Other improvements have taken place in the kitchen, where an eighty quart mechanical mixer has been installed, and also in the power house where steam engines and gener - ators were installed for producing electricity in the institution.

         <seg id="p301">PENAL INSTITUTIONS In the Penal Group are included the State Penitentiary, the Reformatory for Boys, the Genoa State Farm, and the Re - formatory for Women. There are three distinct types of men in the prisons, first, those requiring the maximum security, second, those requir - ing medium security, and third, those requiring minimum security. If the authorities were able to readily determine into which class each man falls, the administration' problem of a prison would be much less difficult. There has been a great deal of theory and many volumes written on the "class - ification of prisoners," and no doubt much progress has been made in the past few years on this subject. However, each individual must be considered as such, and the best of authori - ties will err in their classification of prisoners. It has been the Board's policy to develop the physical plants so that this segregation can be accomplished. For ex - ample, the State Penitentiary should be the maximum security institution, the Reformatory for Men the medium security, and the Genoa State Farm the minimum. However, 'the matter of classification is not yet entirely controlled, although Nebraska has been very fortunate and outstanding among other states in the comparatively few escapes and riots. The judges of the District Court commit the men to the State Penitentiary or Reformatory, depending upon the age and type of crime committed. The Board of Control has authority to transfer the minimum security men from either of thesv institutions to the Genoa State Farm. The officers in the Penitentiary and the Reformatory select the men who are to be transferred to the Genoa State Farm, after getting a history from the County Attorney and from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. We believe the honor farm to be a very definite advance in the handling of men who have a good chance of returning to society and becoming useful 293 </seg>
         <seg id="p302">citizens. It. also serves a good purpose for men who are completing sentences, since it gives them an opportunity to spencj several months outside, without being subjected to the discipline that is necessary in the Penitentiary. They develop more self confidence and are able to do hard labor, so that when| they are released they are better fitted to become self supporting immediately. 294 </seg>
         <seg id="p303">GENOA STATE FARM The Genoa State Farm was established in 1937 by Leg - islative Enactment, and the provision for its founding is set forth in the 1937 Laws of Nebraska, Chapter 203. This au - thority states that the purpose of the Institution shall be the raising and processing of agricultural products to be dis - tributed to the other State Institutions under the Board of Control, ;ind as an outlet for labor for some of the trustee inmates of the Penitentiary and the Reformatory for Boys. The Board is given authority through the officers of the Penitentiary and the Reformatory for Boys to transfer in - mates whom they consider trustworthy, from the State Peni - tentiary and the Reformatory for Boys to the Genoa State Farm. Since the establishment of the Genoa State Farm as ;\n Institution of Minimum Security, the attempt has been made to raise garden products on a large scale to provide other institutions under the Board of Control with these com - modities. In addition because of the fact that some of these vegetables need to be processed, a canning factory was organ - ized to process vegetables for other institutions. Since the Institution is one of Minimum Security, no fences are maintained for the purpose of retaining the men, but there are certain areas within which the men have com - plete freedom, and beyond which they are not allowed to go. They do not have the privilege of going down town into the litv of Genoa, nor off the grounds of the Institution, and within the grounds themselves, there are certain areas where the men may not go without permission. There are no armed guards to keep the men from escaping, and in spite of this minimum of retainers, there have been very few escapes from the Institution. The friendly understanding that exists be - tween the employers &lt;'md the inmates has a great deal to do with bringing this condition about. The general conduct of the inmates has been very good, and only a small number have had to be returned to the Penitentiary or Reformatory for Hoys because of misconduct. 295 </seg>
         <seg id="p304">Tlie health of the inmates is provided for by a complete medical inspection before leaving the Penitentiary, and there - after any medical needs of a minor nature are taken care of by a part time local physician. Anything of a serious nature requiring extra care is taken care of at the Penitentiary where hospital and dental facilities are available. Recreational facilities are available to the men in the form of fishing and swiming in the canal; outdoor athletics such as baseball &amp; kittenball, reading materials, especially current newspapers and magazines, and once a week a talking moving picture is shown. Inmate labor has been used for general farming, poultry raising dairying, canning, carpenter work, painting, plumbing, black; mithing, welding, and also for doing the work in the green house, and boiler room. The major emphasis has been on fa rming activities and the processing of foods. The pro - cessing of meats has become one of the important activities during the biennium. This is made possible by the construc - tion of a packing plant where meats &lt; are processed for other institutions. This is one of the Prison Industry activities thougli the labor is supplied by the Genoa State Farm. A considerable number of improvements have been made during the biennium as funds' would allow. Crop conditions during the biennium have not been the best, consequently pro - duction has been reduced very materially. 296 </seg>

         <seg id="p311">NEBRASKA STATE PENITENTIARY LINCOLN, NEBRASKA The Nebraska State Penitentiary was established in 1869, and the average daily population has increased with con - tinuous uniformity from the date of organization until the present time. The average daily population for the biennium was 903, which, however, was slightly lower than the three preceding years. The Penitentiary is a Maximum Security institution for the purpose of confinement of male prisoners. There is no definite age limit, either maximum or minimum, established for the age of commitment. During the biennium one hoy, fourteen years of age was committed to the institu - tion for murder, and other prisoners have been committed as old as seventy years of age. Prisoners received at the Penitentiary are given a com - plete physical examination upon entrance, and their health from that time on is checked carefully by means of the prison medical staff. Soon after their entrance they are given a group intelligence test, the results of which are used primarily for statistical purposes. Men entering the prison are assigned to various work details some of which include maintenance work around the institution kitchen and laundry services, hos - pital duty, farm and garden work, and work in the Prison In - dustry shops. So far as possible, a man is assigned to a task which he is qualified to perform. The Prison Industries' shop activities are partly carried on within the prison, and these activities include furniture factories^ garment factories, and tobacco processing plant. Mattresses [and shoes are also made. For services in these Prison Industry shops, the inmates are paid a small amount each month. A school taught entirely by inmate instructors is held twelve months a year, in the mornings only. After a person has been in the institution ninety days, they may attend school and receive good time for such attendance, after having received permission from the Warden or his Deputy. Organized classes 303 </seg>
         <seg id="p312">in the school consist of subjects on .the elementary school level, a few, organized classes on the high school level, and in addition some work on the college level may be taken from the University extension division by correspondence. In conjunction with the school, visual education moving pictures are shown once a week through the cooperation of the WPA and the Lincoln city school system, who furnish the finis.: Rscreation for the inmates in the Penitentiary is furnished by a talking picture show once each week and recreational equipment and facilities in the Prison yard, where the men may exercise twice a day. In addition to this, a library of several thousand volumes is available within the institution, and in it are found a number of current periodicals which are provided by the State. Each cell in the Penitentiary is equipped with A radio connection so that the men, by wearing head phone:; may hear broadcasts controlled from a central radio unit. : Religious services are conducted within the institution regularly by protestant and catholic denominations. The disci - pline within the institution has been good during the biennium, and there has been little of an unusual nature during- the biennium. .' . . Some, important administrative changes were made. This is especially true with the reducing of the working hours of the guards on the walls from twelve to eight hours. Pre - viously the guards on the walls had worked twelve hours a day with two shifts. That was reduced to eight hours a day, and the shifts were increased to three. These guards have no contact with the inside of the prison at all, as they enter their stations from the outside and have no relationship to the activities inside the walls. Another change was in the installation of a communicator within the prison itself, which consists of twelve different stations all of which may be reached at one time, and answers may be received in the same manner&gt; thus providing for almost instantaneous contact with all portions of the prison. Other physical changes during the 304 </seg>
         <seg id="p313">biennium consist of the final removal of the old foundations of buildings in the yard. Considerable interior decorating was completed, a portion of the Warden's lawn was filled in, and a new road was graded and cindered o the dairy barn. Gas was piped into the inmates kitchen and to thei .guards.kitchen, and new gas ranges were installed. | 305 </seg>

         <seg id="p324">REFORMATORY FOR BOYS Lincoln, Nebraska The State Reformatory for Boys, located about four miles southwest of Lincoln and established in 1921, was designed for the purpose of "Establishing a reformatory for the confine - ment, discipline and instruction of male prisoners " according to, Chapter 83, section 1101 of the 1929 Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, while Chapter 83, section 1011 says, "The discipline of the Reformatory shall include instruction in the elementary school courses, and in pursuits in which the p-isoners may support themselves when released." It will b: seen from these last two sections that education was one phase of the activities which was meant to be stressed in the Reformatory for Boys. Every inmate of the Reformatory, unless he dies sooner, is, released and goes back into society as a citizen. With this idea ii mind and in consideration of the modern philosophy, more s needed than mere custodial care. The Board of Control has adopted the philosophy that wherever feasible the boy in the Reformatory shall engage in some line of endeavor which will tend to teach him a trade. To help that idea function there has been established within the institution several dif - ferent types of manufacturing procedures which are carried on under the auspices of the Prison Industries. One of these is the shoe shop; in which men's, women's and children's shoes, both work and dress types, were made for Prison Industries, who in turn sold them to other State Institutions. The inmates working in the shoe shop under the guidance of a naster shoe maker, who is a civilian employee, learn to make new shoes'iby hand. And in addition they learn how to repair shoes well. The boys are paid for their work in the shoe Ihop as apprentices at a flat rate, and later on when they become more efficient they are paid by the piece. This pro - gramjis not organized to the best advantage with the idea of teaching any one boy all of the essentials of shoe making, as 316 </seg>
         <seg id="p325">no course of study is followed, and there is a tendency for a boy to work at one operation for too long a period of time after he has learned it, because of the possibility of making money more rapidly. Another of the departments of considerable size in the institution is the license plate factory. Here are made license plates for the automobiles for the State of Nebraska, and during the past year, for the State of Wyoming. In addition there are made reflector road signs, hunting license badges, and other similar metal equipment. This activity again is one phase of the Prison Industry activity. The boys are being furnished work by the Reformatory and small wages paid to them. The largest activity carried on by the Reformatory for Boys at the present time is the farming- operation. In August 1938, the institution took over the Lincoln State Hospital west farm of 600 acres together with the farm cottage and build - ings upon it. Tv that particular farm were sent eighteen honor inmates to work the farm, under the direction of Mr. lilliott Davis, farm supervisor. These eighteen inmates live in the cottage where Mrs. Davis acts as matron. To this particular portion of the Reformatory farm were transferred all of the hogs and chickens, and at the main institution has been kept the dairy herd which produces milk to be sold to Prison In - dustries. This milk is then sold back to some of the State Institutions as indicated in another portion of the Board's biennial report. In connection with this dairy herd and its activities, there was installed a pasteurizing plant and cold storage facilities, and all milk produced is pasteurized before being sold to the Prison Industries. Another of the activities of the Reformatory for Boys is the vegetable cannery where are canned all the vegetables not used when fresh at the institution, and in addition some of the vegetables which may be produced by some of the other institutions. In connection with the institution there is also a wood working; shop of some size in which general repair activities 317 </seg>
         <seg id="p326">for the institution are carried on, and where special objects may be made such as hog houses, window screens, and things of a similar type. . An institution bakery; is maintained in which all of the baking for the institution is done; and this gives some train - ing tc the boys engaged in the activity. Nowhere in this program is there a cooridinated educational program. What is learned by the boys in practice, comes as a result of unor - ganized activity. Of course that in no way reduced what the bey already knew about the work, but it may mean that the bey was not learning' all of the phases, of any qne particu - lar operation, such as making of shoes, license plates or bak - ing, and it may also mean that the necessary supplementary text Hook materials were not being utilized. The educational program: during the past biennium has been somewhat super - ficial and attendance was desultory. The school was functioning in this fashion only about nine months of each year, and there was no attempt to coor - dinate class room training with the vocational activities al - ready mentioned such as the shoe shop, machine shop, etc. It is hoped at the next biennium to have a more comprehensive school program which meets the needs of those working in an activity and which offers a possibility of vocational train - ing- ;.,.-.; "..-¦¦¦' . ¦";•¦.¦ ¦¦¦ ".:' :¦"'.-¦. ¦ .¦'. i The general health of the inmates during the past bien - nium has been very good. A physical examination was given every inmate upon his' arrival at this institution by the phy - sician A diagnosis was made and correction and remedial ¦ treatrients were given in so far as the institution was able to do sc. All cases of venereal disease were segregated and underwent treatment. A north wing of the administration building is used as a hospital and sick ward, but inmates may be taken to the Or - thope lie Hospital for x-ray examination and special treatment. Then have also been some cases treated at the University Hospital in Omaha. In addition to the medical services dur - ing the past biennium there has been assigned for part time 318 </seg>
         <seg id="p327">dental service, Dr. F. T. Butz of the Lincoln State Hospital. Dr. Butz spends one and a half days a week in the Reform - atory, and is subject to call for emergency treatment. A special room at the Reformatory has been installed to ade - quately meet the needs of the institution. The recreational program in the Boys' Reformatory con - sists of a moving picture show in which sound pictures are shown once a week, and on Friday nights the adult education division of the city schools shows educational films which are silent. Besides these picture shows, base hall, soft ball, basket hall, football, dominoes and other forms of recreational ac - tivity take place out of doors in season. The institution has no gymnasium or other facility for an r indoor athletic program. Consequently the recreation out doors is limited to warm weather activity and indoors to such things as are physically possible. There have been organized during the biennium, an orches - tra, glee dub, harmonica band; and these have proven to be very interesting to the boys. Recreational activities provided a safety valve for release of physical vigor and emotional stress tor many of the boys, and are worth all of the cost they rep - resented. There is a library in the institution which was used a great deal, and which has had no new books added to it for a number of years. The books that are contained in it, be - cause of the large amount of use they received, were badly worn. The boys have had the use of a large number of cur - rent magazines, however, and those have been greatly apprec - iated by them. Religious services were held every Sunday afternoon on a non-sectarian basis. The ministers in charge came from the Lincoln city churches, and different ones were invited to come in on each Sunday. In addition to Sunday afternoon services, Catholic services were held every Sunday morning with Father Przudzik in charge. The First Church of Christ also holds morning services each Sunday, and Rev. H. Erck, the univer- 319 </seg>
         <seg id="p328">sity pzstor of the Lutheran Church, conducts a Bible class each ft onday evening during the school year. Tli c psychological service at the institution has been given '&gt;y Dr. W.R. Bailer of the educational psychology divi - sion o : the University, and in addition individual and group tests have been given under the direction of Mr. H. G. Salter, Director of Education for the Board of Control,-and also by ./graduate students of the University of Nebraska working under Dr. Bailer's direction. Three general types of tests have ljieen used, the Henmon-Nelson group test, the Army Alpha and Beta Revised, and some Individual Stanford-Binet Intelligence tests. -¦¦ ¦;¦¦;¦¦:v;. ¦'.. ' .'. ' ¦ v ¦ There have been some improvements to the physical plant during the biennium. These consisted, for the most part, of maintenance, and included redecorations inside, the addition of some jiew furniture for the hospital, and in the inmates kitchen new floors were added, and other improvements made. The. farm and garden products for the past biennium have been very disappointing due to drouth conditions and the grasshoppers. ! The total population at the end of the biennium was some - what reduced below that at the beginning. At the beginning of the biennium, there were 317' in the institution, and at the end there were 289. In general there has been a tendency for the numbers of inmates to decrease during the last few years. . '¦¦ ¦, ' - ¦ ¦ ' '¦'¦ :-.y ¦.;.;¦'•."•. V.V.; ';• .' , Oi c activity of the institution upon which considerable, emphasis has been laid, has been the planting of a nursery of 60,000 trees. This was started in 1937, when it became ap - parent that due to drouth conditions many replacements would be necessary to take the place of trees that have. died. There have been several thousand larger trees transplanted to the roadside surrounding the institution. 320 </seg>

In spite of the fact that this is called the Reformatory for Women, it corresponds to the State Penitentiary for Men. There is no institution in the State of Nebraska for women which corresponds to the Re - formatory for Boys. Chapter 83, section 1402 of the Compiled Statutes of Ne - braska. 1929, says, "The object of the State Reformatory for Women shall be to furnish a suitable home, proper care, educa - tion, ;md training in the industrial arts, to enable women con - victed of any crimes as hereinafter provided to fit themselves for useful lives and means of earning their own livelihood. And in this institution which corresponds to the Penitentiary for Men, the age of commitment, in its lower ranges, may b; very low. Chapter 83, section 1403 says, "a female of fifteen years and upwards convicted by any court or magistrate of petit lar - ceny, vagrancy, habitual drunkenness, of being a common pros - titute, or frequenting disorderly houses of prostitution, or other misdemeanor or convicted of any felony, who is not insane, nor mentally or physically incapable of being benefited by the discipline of such institution may within the discretion of the courts or magistrates and compatible and in accord with the indeterminate sentence law of this state, be sentenced and com - mitted to the Nebraska Reformatory for Women, ). Such commitment in case of misdemeanors shall not be made for tU-nnite term, but any such female may be paroled or dis - charged at any time after her commitment by the Board of Pardons. Provided, no such female shall be paroled while afflicted with venereal disease; " 331 </seg>
         <seg id="p340">From the above section of the statute, it will be seen that women may be sentenced to the Reformatory for Women for misdemeanors or felonies, and that such commitments for mis - demeanors are for an indefinite time; and also after being com - mitted, ithey may be held until any!venereal disease has been cured, ejven though, for other reasons, they njay be eligible for parole. !¦ Section 1402 of the statute already quoted says that the objects of the State Reformatory for Women shall be education and training in the industrial arts. The inmates of the Womens Reformatory at York do practically all of the work around the institution. This consists of farm work, caring for poultry, rais - ing quantities of vegetables, taking!care of the lawns, and all of the domestic duties in the dormitories. In the laundry department, in the kitchen, and in the sewing room, the inmates receive some training in industrial arts. No portion /of this work is organized on an educational basis, how - ever, arid is designed primarily to maintain the institution. In other words, there is no outlined course of study to follow and no teachers are hired for instructional purposes. ¦'• ..There has been conducted/intermittently, for the past bi - enniumj a class for teaching typewriting and shorthand. This has been under the supervision of the secretary in the institu - tion during her spare time. Typewriters and text book mater - ials have been scarce, and this has proven somewhat of a handi - cap to normal progress. '\ A One of the principal activities aside from the maintenance work in the institution at York, has been the making of sheets and pillow cases for the Prison Industries. Material is pur - chased directly by the Prison Industries, is made up at York, and a certain specified amount is'paid the institution at York for this work. This is provided for in Chapter 83, section 1406 of the 1929 Compiled Statutes, where it says, "The Board of Control! of State Institutions shall determine the kind of em - ployment for women committed thereto and shall provide for the necessary custody and superintendence. The provisions for the safe keeping and employment of such women shall be for 332 </seg>
         <seg id="p341">the purpose of teaching them a useful trade or profession and improve their physical, mental and moral condition. The gov - erning board may credit such women with reasonable compen - sation for the labor performed by them and may charge them with necessay expenses of the maintenance and discipline, not exceeding the sum of two dollars a week." During the past biennium many thousand sheets and other articles such as pillow cases, towels, napkins, handkerchiefs, and sleeping garments were made by the Reformatory for Wo - men for other institutions, and this has been one of the main sources of income to the institution at York. Another source of indirect income is the production of farm and garden pro - duce in such quantities as to provide a great deal of the food requirements for the institution. This materially reduces the, cost oi maintenance of the institution. Recreation for the women of the institution is provided foi| by talking moving pictures, a small library which consists of old books of fiction, largely donated, and current magazirjes, This is one of the phases of the institutional activity which is badly in need of improvement. Other recreational activities are vocal music, current events, and programs which are spon - sored by the inmates themselves. None of the personnel in the institution is hired directly for educational or recreational supervision. ) The religious needs of the inmates have been met largely by means of church services on Sunday and talks by persons who may be invited to come in from time to time. There is a resident Chaplain in the institution, and church services are conf ducted by Miss Maude Mann. ¦;. Health The general health of the inmates for the past biennium has been very satisfactory, and there has been added to the equipment for the curing of diseases, a fever-therapy cabinet. This was installed in November 1938, and has been of out - standing value in that it effects a quicker and more permanent relief than by the previously used treatments. The institution 333 </seg>
         <seg id="p342">physician, examines and recommends for treatment, \yith the fever therapy machine, those who are physically fit, and who are in need of it. A registered nurse, who is resident in the institution is in constant attendance during the treatments. There have been several operations performed in the hospi - tal unit, and in addition two babies were born to mothers in the institution during the biennium. These were born in a York City Hospital. \ . j '.. Sanitation has been one of the things which has been em - phasized strongly, and results are apparent in the small per - centage of sick cases had during the biennium. .. The general population during the biennium has been ra - ther low, and as a result, it has been possible to admit six Fed - eral prisoners. These prisoners are paid for by the Federal Government and have not caused any unusual discipline prob - lems. • v • • •.¦•':,-¦¦ ¦¦¦.¦.¦¦;'.' ¦. . v ¦-.'• i .- ¦ The institution has been very fortunate in its friendly rela - tions with the city of York, and^ is indeed grateful for the books, magazines and flowers that have been donated by the citizens of York. .! .'.'.', There have been several outstanding improvements made during jthe biennium, one of which consists of an irrigation well, which provides an ample supply of water, which is used to keep' the lawns in good shaped and also to irrigate many acres of garden. A new sewage disposal system has been installed which connects with the! city sewer of York. This was a W.P.A. project and seventy-five per cent of the cost was borne by them. In addition new curtains and paint have helped to improve the general appearance on the inside of the buildings. 334 </seg>

         <seg id="p348">SOLDIERS' AND SAILORS' HOME ; Grand Island, Nebraska "There shall be established and maintained by the State of Nebraska an: institution to be known as the Nebraska Soldiers' and Sailors' Home, the object of which shall be to provide homes and subsistence to all contract scouts, honorably discharged soldiers^ sailors and marines, and also hospital nurses who served in the United States army or nayy, or hospital^ during the war of the rebellion, or the Indian wars, or who were stationed at regular government forts for the purpose of suppressing Indian uprisings, or the 1 war with Spain, or during the Philippine insurrection, or during the world war, jwhp shall at the time of applica - tibii for admission to such I-home, have been an actual bojia fide resident of this state for two years, next preced - ing such application, and who have become disabled reYsdn of such service, old age or otherwise, from earning a livelihood, and would be dependent upon public or private charities, and also the wife of any such persons admitted to such home, who has attained the age of fifty years and who shall have been married to such occupant for at least ten years before such entrance into the home, and the wjdo'ws and mothers of such soldiers, sailors or marines who died while in the service of the United States, and the widows of such soldiers, sailors or marines who were honorably discharged from ; such service and have since died: Provided, such widows and mothers shall have been hona fide residents of this state for two years immediately preceding admission to such home and have attained the age of fifty years and are! unable to earn a livlihood and ai-e dependent upon public or private charities." Chapter \J2, page 627-628, Laws of Nebraska 1935. Since the Soldiers' and Sailors' Home is a domiciliary in - stitution and the inmates have, the privilege of leaving the Home for short periods at a time when they are physically fit, the recreational and religious activities are dependent for the most part upon the individuals themselves. There is main - tained' at the institution a central library which has had no new books added for several years,: and which does not contain 340 </seg>
         <seg id="p349">any current magazines. There are practically no recreational facilities around the grounds, and no religious services are held regularly. At the beginning of the second year of the biennium, Commandant Ivan S. Gallant, who had acted as Commandant to the institution for nearly ten years, died suddenly, and A. M. Salak as an adjutant of the institution was promoted to Commandant. Near the end of June 1939, provisions had to be made for the influx of population from the Soldiers' and Sailors' Home at Milford. This involved some reorganization within the in - stitution. No great improvements were made at the institution dur - ing the biennium, but with the aid of some WPA projects, some new cattle sheds were built and fences were erected. An NYA project was also set up within the institution which provided domestic service training for several girls and one or two boys. I Farm products were somewhat limited because of drouth conditions and hail. Many trees and shrubs around the grounds were replaced. Tables dealing with the movement of the population and other statistical material are found at the end of this report. ] 341 </seg>

         <seg id="p356">j SOLDIERS' AND SAILORS' HOME Milford, Nebraska On April 9, 1895 an act was passed to establish and main - tain a branch of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Home at Milford, Nebras ca, and. as such was maintained for the domiciliary care of honorably discharged veterans, and wives and widows, of Civil-wars, Indian war, Spanish-American war, and the World war.;. - ",.-'; :\ ;"_'.. : ¦¦ ¦; ¦:¦ - This branch of the Grand Island Soldiers' and Sailors' Home was discontinued for a two year period by Legislative Bill Number 460, Chapter 123 of the Laws of Nebraska for 1939. The closing date was June 30, 1939. , Since the Soldiers' and Sailors' Home. was organized as a domici iary. institution for the purpose of looking after the welfan: of the veterans, there has been very little activity of an ;ducational, recreational, or religious nature carried on. The residents at the institution: were free to come and go when physically able, and consequently the main recreational and religiois activities took place in the adjacent town of Milford. There was maintained in the institution a library for recreational reading, but this did not include any recent books or any current magazines; , In the basement of the main building, there was a small carpenter shop where veterans might pass some of their leisure hours with wood working; also there was a billiard table in the basement of the same building. There were several croquet courts and nearby was the Blue River where they might fish. ¦¦ :S" ¦ ¦ ' :-;. ¦¦" ¦'.¦¦ : |-." ' ¦..'¦¦"¦' The population at Milford and at Grand Island had been declining- for several years, and it was physically possible to house and adequately care for all of the residents of the two institutions in the main division at Grand Island; consequently, the legislature deemed it wise to close the institution at Mil - ford atj a saving to the state. So on June 30, 1939 all residents of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Home at Milford were transferred 348 </seg>
         <seg id="p357">to the Soldiers' and Sailors' Home at Grand Island, and the institution at Milford was closed with its equipment left intact.

         <seg id="p362">HOSPITAL FOR THE TUBERCULOUS Kearney, Nebraska ; The- Hospital for the Tuberculous, located in /Kearney, Nebraska, was established in-the iyear 1912. The primary pur - pose rf this Hospital was, according to Chapter 83, section 801 of the 1929 Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, "A Hospital for the ...indigent tuberculous per50n5........" From this state - ment t will be seen that it was designed primarily to take care of those who are unable to pay for their maintenance in a pri - vate iistitution, and more specific than that, it was for those who Yad tuberculosis and were not able to pay for their keep. However, Chapter 83, section 803 says, "Whenever the same can bi- done without limiting in any way the advantages of the -hospital or the patients for whom such hospital is primarily clesigi ed, the' Board may at their discretion admit, other tuberculous patients, on such terms and under such rules, those who ; re already an inmate of any county or state charity in - stitut on. In all three of the previously mentioned cases, pa - tients may be admitted on the condition that, whenever appli - cation for admission to said hospital is made, by or /on behalf of a patient, a full report as to such patient's condition and cir - cumstkhce shall be made in detail to the Board of Control, by a legiilly qualified practitioner of medicine in the) State of Nebraska. If the Board then regards such a patient as a proper subject for admission "to the hospital according to law, a permit for the patient's admission shall be issued upon the recommenda - tionif the superintendent of the hospital. Compiled Statutes of Nebraska 1929, Chapter 83, paragraph 802. . One of the reasons why the state has seen fit to establish a Hdspital for the Tuberculous, is in order to prevent the spreading of the disease. In times past tuberculosis'was much more [prevalent than it is at the present time, and it was not detected in its earlier stages. As a result, many were afflicted, and the disease had progressed to a considerable length before attention was paid to it. Thanks to the advancement of medical sciente, this condition is no longer necessary. The Mantpux 354 </seg>
         <seg id="p363">test is now used to test for tuberculosis infection. If this j reaction is positive, the usual procedure is to have an x-ray j taken of the chest in order to determine whether the cause of j the reaction is an active tubercular condition. By the wide-) spread use of this particular test, it is possible to detect tuber- j culosis in its early stages. This may prevent the spreading of the disease to others, and thereby reduce the hazard of tuberculosis appreciably. In addition, to the prevention of the spread of the disease through the detection of its presence by) the Mantoux test, there has also been the wide-spread eradi - cation of Bovine tuberculosis. This in itself should be a greatj help in reducing the number of cases of the disease. The Nebraska Hospital for the Tuberculous has made some improvement in the treatment of tuberculosis during the biennium. Besides the customary medical practices carried on previously, more Pneumo-thoraces have been given than pre - viously. Also a new colorimeter for the laboratory and a bronchoseope have been added to the x-ray machine. Many x-rays have been taken for patients who. came in for only that purpose, and in addition many written interpretations were made of x-ray plates sent for examination. Very little has taken place in either the occupational or recreational therapy activities, because of lack of funds. The NYA has contributed some time and effort in directing a recre - ational program, and this has proven to be of interest and value ; and the WPA has mended a number of library books for the Institution and made them available to readers. There have been very iew additions to the library books in recent years, and consequently it has not filled the need of the patients. as well as it should. Some monthly periodicals are subscribed for and many more are donated, and this helps to supplement other older reading material. Due to the physical condition of the patients, it is not possible for all patients to attend, but regular church services are held each Sunday at 3:00 p.m. These services are conducted by members of the ministerial association. For the children in the institution on the elementary school level, an eighth grade school, under the guidance of one teacher, 355 </seg>
         <seg id="p364">is mail tamed. This school follows the regular Nebraska course of stiK.y, and seventh and eighth grade students in the school take the regular county eighth grade examination, which en - titles them to free high school tiition. Tfere have been several changes in the staff during the biennium. Dr. John F.. Allen.^edical director of a hospital, was appointed on December 1, 1937 and continued in that capacity until February 1, 1939. Dr. H. A. Duey, the second assistant physician left his position on March 5, 1938, and Dr. J. R. l^ioper of Falls City, tookj his place. Also Miss Louise Seibel, who had been the head nurse for eight years, left in June :938, and Mrs. Frances L. Curry, of Albuquerque, New Mexico took her place, but she in turn left in August 1938. Mrs. Ona Dein then became head nurse, and resigned in favor of Mils Lillian Steele in May 1^39. Mrs. Florence Zulauf re - turned as institutional field worker in the spring of 1939, and still continues in that capacity. There have been two physical changes of importance dur - ing tHe biennium, one of which has been the building program, which' included an administration and a ward building, and in addition a boiler house is contemplated. The other consisted of eliminating the farm prograrh, and the leasing of the land to the Industrial School, who will crop it and in turn sell the produce to the Institution for the Tuberculous. This has been done In the interest of the efficiency and economy. The aver - age' caily population for the biennium has been 154 patients. This is about the same as it has been in previous bienniums. Since the fall of 1937, there ihas been kept the record of the per ckpita cost per meal, and it was found that the average cost ? er meal was less than 8c for the food, exclusive of the labor cost. ' ' There are two main kitchens in the institution. In the kitchen of the Hospital building there were several changes made. The old coal range was replaced with a two sectioned, heavy duty Vulcan gas range with a one burner attachment and contiguous double deck high shelf. A new gas stove was placed in the center of the room, bringing it much closer to the wall 356 </seg>
         <seg id="p365">cabinet and ice box. This saved many steps for the cooks and at the same time it gave room in the east end of the kitchen for the dining room girls to prepare vegetables, making it much lighter and more pleasant for them. Previously they were pre - paring vegetables in a hall with only artificial light. When a new Savory gas toaster with continuous operation was purchased, a new long zinc topped table was made for it. At the same time, the table which holds the Hobart electric mixer was lowered and moved to a more convenient place in the kitchen. In the East Sun building kitchen there was added a gas range and a toaster exactly like one in the Hospital building kitchen. A small table for the toaster was made here, and a new low table was made for the electric mixer and placed in a more convenient place. A large meat slicer in the East Sun kitchen was taken to the meat house and all bacon was sliced there where it is cold. Also in the last year there was added a new ten gallon alum - inum stock pot with lid, a new rive gallon alluniimim kettle a large aluminum roasting pan and an ice cream dipper to our equipment and replacements were made of any of the smaller equipment as was necessary. Also a room in the East Sun building in the basement was painted and fixed up with double sink, light, chairs, etc., so that the girls could prepare vegetables there. The two main kitchens, three diet kitchens, two serving rooms and four dining rooms have all been painted in the past two years. New curtains have been made where needed, dishes and linen replaced where worn or broken and from time to time suitable pictures have been framed in the carpenter shop and hung on the walls. In addition to adding gas ranges in the two main kitchens an old electric plate was replaced with a two burner gas plate in the patients' diet kitchen in the East Sun building. The electric plates in our other diet kitchens are nearly worn out and they should be replaced soon with gas plates. 357 </seg>
         <seg id="p366">In spite of the dry season and grasshoppers in 1937, there was canned 3,833 quarts of fruit and vegetables and in 1938, 3,041 quarts in addition to having what was needed for table use. '"lie,last summer, however,; nothing was canned except rhubarb, as the fresh vegetables were purchased from the State industrial School. ¦ ] This past winter and spring the hospital was fortunate in receiving many "Surplus Commodities," which included grapefruit and oranges. They weije of good quality and the patien :s enjoyed them very much. ' It ny of the patients were too ill to eat the regular diet so they are given a sort of liquid diet tray. The attempt was made at all times to see that they had the things that they should and c ild eat. S cea new building is being constructed for the men and anoth r as a hospital for both men and women, some extensive changes in kitchens, diet kitchens and dining rooms will no doubt be made within a year, bit definite plans have not been worked put as yet. The population including employees averaged 235 daily. The.lame menu is used for all, and an attempt was made to keep within the amount of food allowed. .1 hast February 1939, after a careful checkup, it was found that Sthe total amount of butter used daily for both kitchen and table was 326.93 oz. or 1.43 oz. p^r capita, total amount of milk used daily was 312 pints or 1.3276 pints per capita, total amount of cream used daily was 432 oz. or 1.838 oz. per capita, and total amount of eggs used daily was 261 or 1.11 per capita. A one meal serving in the hospital used about fourteen loaves of bread or four hundred ibiscuits, eighty pounds of meat to rlast, three pounds of coffee, six gallons of any prepared vegetables or fruits and eight gallons of ice cream at a meal when on the menu. ; 358 </seg>
         <seg id="p367">The attempt was made to have something different on our holiday menus. For many months the Kearney Girl Reserves have made favors at each holiday for all of our patients' trays. Turkey was served for Thanksgiving in 1937 and in 1938. Christmas is made a big day in the institution, and an outdoor picnic is had on July Fourth, and for the last two years it has been possible to have fried chicken for the picnic. 359 </seg>
