            <seg id="p002">Office of Secretary of State Lincoln, Nebraska To the Honorable, The Governor, Samuel R., McKelvie, State House, Lincoln, Nebraska. Mv dear Governor: Conforming to the statutes of the Commonwealth, I have the honor to present, herewith, my report as Secretary of State for the State of Nebraska, for the biennium ending November 30, 1920. This report contains an exhibit of the affairs of the office and the method of conducting the same during the term now closing. It further sets forth the amount of moneys appropriated for the maintenance of the different departments, a classified statement of all moneys received by the office as fees, a statement of the -necessary ex - penditures for operation of the office, salaries, etc., a statement of the number of corporations incorporating, qualifying, withdrawing or dis - solving, the registration and renewal of brands, issuing and cancelling notary public commissions, the granting of charters to chattel loan or - ganizations under the provisions of Chapter 204, Session Laws of 1915, a resume of the operation of the Motor Vehicle Department during the first three and one-half months of the biennium, and finally a statement concerning elections, referendums and the constitutional convention. In the interests of economy, we have abridged the report as much as possible, eliminating several features that have heretofore been em - bodied, which would increase the cost of publishing and are in them - selves, not of vital public interest. Respectfully submitted, DARIUS M. AMSBERRY, Secretary of Stato. December i, i 920 </seg>
