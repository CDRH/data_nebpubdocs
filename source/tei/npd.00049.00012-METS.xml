            <seg id="p003">STANDARD-BRED POULTRY PAYS F. B. Ml'SSKHI. AND H. M. WKLI.S It is easy to start with standard-bred chickens. Buy a few settings of eggs from a standard-bred flock or buy a dozen standard-bred hens and a cockerel and you have made a start, lint you are asking yourself, "Will it pay me to keep better stock of this kind?" This circular has some suggestions to help you answer this question. MORE EGGS FROM STANDARD -BRED CHICKENS Most strains of the popular standard-bred chickens have U*m selected for years for increased egg production. The ability to lay a good many eggs is an inherited quality and more atten - tion will be paid to breeding for this quality in the future. Standard-bred poultry breeders have realized the importance of good egg production and have selected their stock for constant improvement in this direction. The average egg production of 1,000 standard-bred chickens at the Storrs, Connecticut, egg - laying contest was 16:2 eggs per hen in one year, and that of 1,000 hens at the Vineland, New Jersey, egg-laying contest was 161 *'ggs per hen during the first laying year. Who knows of 1,000 scrub chickens that have averaged 16:2 eggs a year? A UNIFORM FLOCK LOOKS BEST No one will deny that a Hock of birds of a uniform size, type and color looks better than a flock of scrubs varying all the way from four to nine pounds in weight and with even greater variation in color. Standard-bred chickens do look letter and for that reason will get In'tter care. You will feel more like giving a flock of standard-bred chickens a little better care and no animal on the farm reacts to good care more promptly than does the hen. A letter looking flock. Wtter care and greater poultry profits follow each other closely. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 Xehraxhi Extension Sereict STANDARD BIRDS PRODUCE A STANDARD PRODUCT Eggs and market poultry produced by a flock of standard - bred chickens are more uniform in size, shape and quality, and are consequently worth more on the market. If your local market does not appreciate quality, ship to buyers in the larger cities. Eggs and market poultry can be shipped long distances very successfully if necessary, but a heart to heart talk with your local buyer will usually bring results. Nearly all market poultry and egg buyers are now buying on a quality basis. A case of good eggs of uniform color, aver - aging two ounces to the egg, clean, sound and fresh, produc • by a flock of standard-bred hens, is worth more than a case of mixed white and brown eggs of odd sizes and qualities, laid by odd chickens in a scrub flock. BREEDING STOCK AND EGGS FOR HATCHING The advantages of good standard-bred stock are being so rapidly recognized that there is a keen demand in every com - munity for breeding stock and hatching eggs from good stock. Any margin over market prices received for breeding stock is pure profit, and the demand especially for hatching eggs comes at a time when the egg baskets are easily filled. If you live on a main travelled road, the presence of a good healthy flock of standard -bred chickens, ranging on the farm - stead, is about the only advertising that will be necessary. Seasonable advertising in farm, poultry and local papers will bring even more business. An exhibit of a few of your best birds at the local poultry show or county fair also offers a splen - did opportunity to advertise your stock. BREED BETTER BIRDS The limit of improvement has not been reached, however, when a standard-bred flock has been acquired. We should aim to intensify the egg-laying habit, as well as the standard qual - ities, by careful breeding. Great emphasis should be placed on the selection of the most vigorous birds for breeders. This point cannot be over-empha- </seg>

            <seg id="p006">6 Xehraxka Extetution Service sized. Good layers and good standard birds are produced only from vigorous parent stock. The ability to lay a large number of eggs has been shown to be an inherited quality just as is size, vigor and color. Most rapid improvement in increasing egg production will be made by using males bred from high egg record hens to head the breeding pens. Selection for improvement along standard lines should be based on breed ideals as accepted by the American Poultry Association. The Standard of Perfection, published by this association, gives shape and color descriptions of all standard varieties. THE BEST BREED A wide choice of varieties differing in size, type, color and activity is offered us for selection. All of these have some things to commend them and a few varieties have nearly everything to commend them. It has often been said more rapid progress in poultry improvement would have been made if breeders had con - centrated on a few of the most practical varieties. Egg-laying ability is a strain rather than a variety charac - teristic. A glance at the report of the Vineland, New Jersey, egg-laying contest sheds much light in this direction. Eight pens of Barred Rocks were entered with a variation in the egg production of from 119 eggs per bird in one pen of ten hens to 196 eggs per bird in another j&gt;en of ten hens. Of the eight pens of Rhode Island Reds, one pen averaged 108 eggs per bird and another 197. Of 44 pens of White Leghorns there was a varia - tion of 111 eggs per bird in one pen to 221 eggs per bird in another. It is possible to breed egg-laying strains of any of our popular varieties, and this should be our aim. Since market poultry is also an important poultry product we should try to select a breed that produces a good marketable carcass. Your local poultry buyer will lie glad to inform you what the best markets demand in that respect. Birds of the general-purpose type, including Rhode Island Reds. Wyandottes. Plymouth Rocks and Orpingtons, are very well adapted to general conditions on the corn belt farms. Where egg production is a specialized business the Leghorn is very useful, tho the Leghorn </seg>

COMMUNITY BREEDING CENTERS The possibility of community cooperation in the selection of some one breed and of developing that breed so that the com - munity is recognized as a Barred Rock center, Hhode Island Red. 01 Wyandotte center, should also In* emphasized. Great improve - ment is always possible when many minds and many hands are busy at the same task. Guernsey. Jersey and Shorthorn cattle. Percheron horses and many other of the most popular breeds of live stock were develojxnl by community concentration on some one accepted type of animal. Poultry breeders will do well to profit by their experience. THE BEST TIME TO START The buying of hatching eggs or day-old chicks is usually the easiest and the cheajxist way to start. Most poultry breeders will not sell their very best stock but they are willing to sell eggs or baby chicks from their lH*st inatings. Mark the chicks with a toe punch so they can lx&gt; distinguished from others. Another very commendable way to start is to buy a dozen »ood yearling hens and a good egg-bred male. Two hundred and fifty standard chicks may easily lx- produced from a breeding |x'ii of this size the first year.

Use cockerels from high egg-laying hens for breeders. </seg>
