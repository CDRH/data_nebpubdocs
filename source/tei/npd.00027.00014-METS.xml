            <seg id="p008">SUPERINTENDENT'S BIENNIAL REPORT To His Excellency, Chester H. Aldrich, and Members of the State Board of Public Lands and Buildings: It is with pleasure that I comply with the Statute and sub - mit herewith the Sixteenth Biennial Report of the Nebraska State Industrial School for Boys. The pleasure comes because a retrospective view brings to mind two years of labor labor that has been arduous and exacting but which brings its reward in the satisfaction of knowing that results have been achieved. That we have not accomplished all that we wished to is very true but we feel that all has been done that could have been done under the conditions at the school. The work at the industrial school taxes to the limit the courage, the fortitude and energy of the superintendent and his assistants. The people of the state do not realize the marvelous possibilities of this school. Neither do they fully understand that the money invested in the training and development of these boys will bring the greatest returns of any money that is expended by the state in maintaining and car - ing for its wards. In the four years that we have been in charge of the school much progress has been made. The condition of the boys has considerably improved and the school has gained a higher plane in its development and is receiving from the people of the state, who know something of its work, the commendation that it de - serves. The school has changed from a penal institution to one where good fellowship and honor prevail and where all is done that is possible to stimulate the mind to an activity of higher During the past two years eighty-five boys have gone home on vacations from one to two weeks, and out of this number only two failed to return at the expiration of their leave of absence. The school band consisting of forty-five boys was taken to the State Fair at Lincoln last September and for one week these boys were given perfect freedom on the fair grounds and the people who visited the Fair can testify to the manly conduct of the boys. It is the first time during the history of the school that anything of this kind has been tried. The results prove that our methods of handling the boys have been successful. </seg>
            <seg id="p009">312 I From an attendance on December 1, 1910, of 139 the school increased until on August 15, 1912, we had 211 enrolled, number has been reduced on parolment until December 112, we have 173 boys on the roll. These figures demonstrate our judgment was right when in our last biennial report we d for a larger appropriation to meet the demands of the in - sed attendance. It is to be regretted that the honorable ibers of the last legislature could not be brought to see the ssity of a larger appropriation in order to avoid the deficiency is now fast growing. E Against our protest the Honorable Board of Public Lands Buildings has seen fit to draw warrants on our maintenance to pay for stokers and other repairs which we did not think . Thus our maintenance fund was depleted nearly $5,000, hat which should be considered permanent improvements. I The winter of 1911 '12 was the most severe for several s and our expenditure for coal increased from $15,972 for the ious biennium to $19,600 for the present biennium — an in - &gt;e of $3,728.00. I believe that this increase could have avoided had a better grade of coal been used and had our r house plant been repaired earlier or let alone entirely. Board should take the blame for crippling our heating plant t was done over our protest. It is to be regretted that we have had one man on the Board during the past four years who has been a constant hindrance in the progress of the school. This man is Mr. E. B. Cowles He is so wrapped up in his ideas of saving money that he losses sight of efficiency and progress. He cares more for the horses, cattle, hogs, chickens and produce of the farm than for the wel - fare of the boys. When he visits the school he never fails to look after the stock but seldom ever makes any inquiry concerning the boys. A number of things have been done which should be charged direct to this one man. For instance, we had an electric plant that had been installed by my predecessor costing the institution $4,800. Over our protest this man ordered the entire engine and dynamos to be sent to Beatrice. We received $1,637. - 08 for this equipment. We are now compelled to depend on the Electric Power Plant at Kearney for electric power and lights. Three times during the last year have we been without lights and the last time for a period of more than four hours. This caused </seg>

            <seg id="p012">INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL FOR BOYS, KKARNCY 313 more or less confusion and it is always a very dangerous con - dition. We always have a few boys that are very bad char - acters and in case the lights are all out it gives these fellov. opportunity to make serious trouble. The electric engineer protested against this equipment being taken away but without avail. We had previous to this time been to considerable expense connecting up with the electric power plant to give us twenty - four hour service of lights thus avoiding the necessity of night lamps. During the summer months when our steam plant was not in operation all the time this would have proven quite a sav - ing to the institution but when we are using our boilers for gen - erating steam and could use the exhaust steam from the engine for heating purposes, we could have produced the electric current much cheaper than we are buying it. II n June, 1911, the Board purchased one new boiler and three of stokers for our boiler house plant. This material was ved at the institution in August and nothing was done in the .llation of this material until December. At this late season 1 cold weather was upon us and against our protest, Mr. les instructed the workmen to install the stokers and boilers, action disabled one of the best boilers we had in the plant it was not used again. Three hundred dollars was simply »vn away to satisfy the stubborness of this one man. The E was then abandoned because of the severe cold until the next ■. We were then compelled to use two old low pressure ts that leaked all of the time. The report on coal consumed during the last biennium will show plainly what the action of this man has cost the state. I could furnish numerous occasions when he has shown his hos - tility to the management of the school and to the detriment of its progress. After the failure to rebuild the boiler plant in the winter the Board secured the services of a competent mechanical engineer. Plans were drawn and another boiler purchased and the heating plant has been thus rebuilt during the summer of 1912. The total cost of these improvements being nearly $15,000. The credit for this complete over-hauling of this heat - ins plant is largely due to the energy of Treasurer George, after the failure of the winter. In our estimate of this biennium we only contemplated minor repairs in the boiler house plant and our chief ericrineor eissur&amp;s us t licit our old oltin t could hiivt? bc^n rt?~ </seg>
            <seg id="p013">314 Eat small expense and would have rendered efficient service \ this biennium, thus avoiding going into debt. The in - g legislature could have then made an appropriation for the necessary improvements in the boiler house. The tunnel which conveys the heating and hot water Is is in very bad condition. About 1500 feet of this tunnel is ied with lumber. This is in the last stages of decay and us breaks and caveins may be expected at any time. It require an expenditure of from $1 to $4,000 to repair this el and put in the necessary new pipe and to purchase new ring for this piping thus putting the tunnel in first class con- (lit ion . Under the direction of State Architect, Mr. Bird F. Miller, the administration building and the five cottages or grade build - ings have been thoroughly overhauled. All the old plumbing has been removed and the buildings are now in splendid sanitary condition. We have confined our improvements to the interior of these buildings. It will require $2 or $3,000 to complete the outside repairs on these buildings. New porches are badly needed on each of the cottages and the administration building. As our funds were limited we did not deem it best to make these improvements at once but to the casual observer it would seem ■ it is an extreme necessity for these repairs to be made. We were unable to do anything with the shop building or Kstrial building because it will be a stupenduous task and will ire a great deal of money. The state architect says that it cost at least $40,000 to overhaul this building. I believe it Id be much better to tear it down and build a new one. $50,000 should be provided for this new building. Supported by the efforts of Treasurer George we have been able to rent 370 acres of irrigable land and the soundness of his judgment has been shown by the crops we have grown during the last two years. In 1911 we produced: 600 bushels of potatoes worth $6,000.00 Sugar beets sold . 2,761.55 3,500 bushels of corn worth 2,100.00 Other crops 1,000.00 $11,861.55 </seg>
            <seg id="p014">315 INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL FOR BOYS, KEARSKY I On December 1, 1910 we had cash on hand with the state urer, $1,035.77. We received from all sources up to Decem - ., 1911, $4,210.85. From December 1, 1912, $8,630.10 mak - i total of $13,876.72. Of this amount $1,987.08 was received sale of the engine and dynamos. There was drawn from the fund for permanent and general repairs, $4,258.77. We on hand with the state treasurer $1,954.93. We have spent our cash fund for maintenance $7,663.02. Farm Land Needed In this connection I wish to call your attention to the need of purchasing land. For thirty years the state has rented land for farming purposes and we have already paid out enough in rents to have paid for the land that we need. The section south of the school, every foot of which can be irrigated, has been re - cently put on the market. An appropriation sufficiently large should be made for the purchase of this tract of land. We have a lease on 373 acres of this land, for the next two years but I fear that this land will be sold unless the legislature makes pro - vision for purchasing it at this time. I am satisfied that if this land could be bought the production from our farm could be ma - terially increased and t*he institution made that mcuh nearer self-supporting. Hospital Building KWe need a hospital building and I would suggest that an opriation of not less than $4,000 be made for this purpose, ise of sickness or in event of contagious disease we have no in 1912 we produced: 4,000 bushels of potatoes worth 3,000 bushel of corn . $2,400.00 . 1,500.55 2,100 bushel of oats 840.00 Sugar beets sold 1,859.39 Sugar corn and tomatoes sold 403.10 50 tons of alfalfa and millet 400.00 500 bushel of onions 250.00 Other vegetables 600.00 8,256.49 Total $20,114.04 </seg>
            <seg id="p015">316 means of quarantine or isolating those affected. Neither have we any way of caring for those temporarily indisposed. Two years ago I made a request for such an appropriation. I have visited a number of similar institutions and find that all of them have a hospital of some kind. The lack of a convenient place for caring for our sick has been a constant source of trouble ever since the school has been established. Gymnasium I During the administration of Mr. Hayward he had built a ■ root house, the upper floor of which was designed as a gym - im. He was not able to complete this building and we have had sufficient funds at our command to complete the work, ill cost from $1,500 to $2,000 to complete the work, and equip gymnasium. All persons who are at all acquainted with boy ind development will see the need of proper attention being 1 to physical development. t[f the school could be properly equipped and liberally sup - d the results obtained would be beyond the most sanguine s of those now connected with the Juvenile work. But so as the dollar is put in the scale against the boys there is no ;e of obtaining better results than we are now getting. Need of Industrial Training My four years of experience and study has lead me to con - clude that we should greatly expand out occupational instruc - tion. No boy should be allowed to leave the school until he is properly trained in some line of work at which he can make a living. A boy when thus equipped has more than an even chance of success. In our up to date progressive public school of to - day we are putting in manual training commercial courses, domestic science and various other departments in an endeavor to fit the boys and girls for life occupations. If this is wise and good for the public school pupils how much more is it needed by the boys who have no homes or parents on whom to rely for support. One of the most common causes of failure of our boys to make good when releasd can be traced to the lack of proper training in the ways of earning a livelihood. It is seldom, in - deed, that a boy has any trouble if he has a trade by the persuit </seg>
            <seg id="p016">317 of which he can earn a living. Early in the biennium we were compelled by Mr. Cowles to close up our printing office although we had at that time twelve boys in this office learning the print - ing trade. In this way he saved a salary of $50.00 per month for an instructor in printing but deprived a number of boys of perfecting a trade by which they could have made a good living and become honored and useful citizens. If the object of the school is to detain the boys here, and maintain them just as cheaply as possible I would suggest that we discharge all the teachers and instructors in trades and that we hire a half dozen men to herd the boys. This would be the cheapest method possible to pursue. Of course, we could not expect to add any - thing toward the boys' development or do anything toward making him a better citizen but if saving money is the end to be sought we could reduce the expense of caring for the boys nearly one-half. But if on the other hand it is sought to make this institution what the name implies, an Industrial Training School for Boys, we should have the necessary equipment and help to fit the school for the work for which it was designed. During the biennium we have partly equipped our laundry with new machinery but there is need for even more than has been put in. We have bought a few new machines for the tailor shop and we have partly equipped the shoe shop with machinery and we have also purchased a few tools for the carpenter shop. These items cover about all that has been done in the purchasing of equipment for our trades department. Education We are making good advancement with the boys in an educa - tional way but I would suggest that the courses be extended and that the rules be so changed that before a boy is permitted to be paroled, he should have reached a certain stage of educational development, if within his mental powers so to do. I would also suggest that 'each boy should have at least completed a part of some useful occupation. If these two requirements were made, I believe that it would be of much benefit to the boys. In this connection I wish to speak of results secured in our musical department. Our band has proved to be one of the best departments for developing the boys. We now have equip - ment for about fifty boys in orchestra and band instruments. </seg>
            <seg id="p017">318 The band that was taken to the fair last September was a pleasure and surprise to the people of the state. We have found that the study of music requires close application and we can individualize the boys, to know what they are doing better than in any other department. We have proven beyond a doubt that the boy who studies music in the band is the best student in the school room for the reason that it teaches concentration of the mind and trains the boy to hold himself down to the task before him. We did not pick out the brightest boys for the band but we found that the boy who had the band training developed into the best student. The instruments that we now have here are necessarily of the cheapest make. These should be replaced by a better grade of instruments so that the band may become one of the permanent fixtures of the institution. Library I During the biennium we have received from the State Li - y' Commission about 200 volumes of splendid books. This isition has been a great advantage to the school, in giving boys good reading selected especially for them. This has vated a taste for good reading and will no doubt lead to the lopment of the best there is in the boys. We hope to see a ber of volumes added to our library during the next two years. OUR INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENTS Bakery and Kitchen We have two well equipped kitchens and one general bakery. The boys employed here are taught how to properly prepare food and serve it. In our bakery all of our bread and pastry is prepared and this department is well equipped. From our bakery and kitchens go forth boys trained to make a living as cooks and bakers and most of these boys make good in their accomplishments. Laundry KWe have a laundry in which all 'of the laundry work for the tution is done. During the early part of the biennium we put •me machinery which has greatly facilitated the work but </seg>
            <seg id="p018">INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL FOR BOYS. KEARNEY 319 • till need a new mangle and two or three other machines. When those are added we will have an up-to-date laundry. Tailor Shop tin the tailor shop we make all of the clothing for the hoys ie school; their uniforms, every day clothes, night clothes. We have recently added three new. machines which help )ing the work properly in this department. Shoe Shop I We take a great deal of pride in the work done in this de - cent. From this department have gone forth a number of led workmen who are making good in the practice of this trade, make an every day shoe for the boys that is as good or better 1 the ordinary man's working shoe. Then we make a shoe for Sunday or going home that is as neat as any of the shoes put on the market. Within the last eight months have added to this department machinery costing the state ut $700. We are now able to teach the boys to repair and :e the shoes using the machinery that is now in use through - the country. Carpenter Shop I We do not have a manual training department here where boys are taught the Sloyd system of wood work, drawing and orth. But we do instruct in practical carpentering where x&gt;ys are given instruction in practical work. This work con - of the necessary repairs about the institution. This depart - t is under a practical mechanic who is getting good results this department should be enlarged so that more boys could lught the use of tools. Engineering Since our boiler house and heating plant has been thoroughly overhauled we have at the present time a splendidly equipped plant but it is to be regretted that the engine and dynamos were removed from this department as we were teaching a number of boys the trade of an engineer. We cannot now go as far with this work as we did before and neither is the instruction as </seg>
            <seg id="p019">320 vantageous for the boys for the reason that with a mechanically fired boiler there is nothing to do but shovel coal and with a head man to watch the water in the boilers and the steam pres - sure the boy does not get much practical knowledge of things. It is to be hoped that in the near future the Board of Control will see the necessity of establishing an electric lighting plant in connection with this boiler plant to furnish electric power for the school. I would suggest that by an investment of $2,000 for extension of lines we could supply the power and lights for the Tubercular Hospital and the State Normal School thus main - taining a generating plant up to its full capacity and manufactur - ing current at the lowest possible cost. Green House During the biennium we have rebuilt our green house and now have a good building. We have not had a practical green house man because the Board did not think we could afford to pay wages sufficient to hire a qualified man. This department has been cared for by our gardener and while it is not all that we could wish it to be it is now in condition so that in the future it can be made what it should be. Farming I As stated here before our farming in the past two years been very successful and as I there said I urge that an appro - tion be made for the purchasing of more land for farming :h would become the source of considerable revenue besides ng the needed instruction in agriculture. Dairying I This department should be extended. New stock should )urchased and if this was done much better results could be lined. We have a small herd of Holstein cattle and the Board lid lose no time in purchasing a thoroughbred male and thus ease the quality and number of cattle in this herd. It would only furnish the institution with milk that it requires but we id sell to the public thoroughbred animals at a good price, should have a new hog house built for the purpose of breeding caring for our herd of hogs. At the present time we have </seg>

In Conclusion I When the people of Nebraska awake to the fact that there been entirely too much attention paid to rewarding some men political service rendered rather than selection of men for heads of institutions for their known ability, we will begin nake progress. No man can do his best work who does not w what the future has in store for him. With the tenure of e based on qualifications and results secured, a man would that he could afford to make a life work of this branch of ! life and he could certainly get better results than the novice, man who has served four or six years as superintendent of institution is certainly better qualified than any politician se only desire is a salaried job.

Dear Sir: In making final report of the State Industrial School for Boys, at Kearney, Nebraska, I took charge of the work on February 1, 1911 and I wish to recommend that there be a hospital building that in case of sickness they could be isolated, either from contagious or noncontagious disease, as there is nothing of the kind where proper care can be given out - side of the dormitories. II have during my attendance found the best of care that could libly have been given, considering the disadvantages of not ing hospital facilities. There has been but one death during attendance. The first year, February 1, 1911 to January 31, I, I made 220 visits and saw 672 patients. From February 912 to November 31, 1912 I made 172 visits and saw 372 ents. See report of the various diseases and accidents. The s have been surrounded with every care possible — good &gt;lesome food — so much so that the prevailing complaint has i indigestion from over eating. The sanitary conditions have been first class, especially since the new plumbing has been completed. The boys are surrounded with every comfort, and, as many of them have told me, better than they have had when at home. Respectfully yours, F. A. Packard. </seg>
