            <seg id="p005">SUMMARY 1. In determining the effect of competition between single-row test plats as a source of experimental error in crop yield tests, the relative yields of two crops planted in blocks containing several rows have been regarded as the true relative values for the crops tested. In ascertaining some of these true values, the outer rows of the plats have been discarded in order to eliminate almost entirely plat com - petition. Plats were sufficiently replicated to secure quite reliable relative yields for the conditions under which they were grown. In plat competition tests in 1913 with two rates of plant - ing Turkey Red wheat, the thin rate yielded 68 per cent as much as the thick rate when grown in single alternating rows, while in five-row blocks the thin rate yielded 90 per cent as much as the thick rate. Competition in rows with a thicker rate of planting caused the thin rate to yield rela - tively 24.4 per cent too low. In a similar test in 1914 the thin rate yielded relatively 56.8 per cent too low. 2. In 1913, competition between alternating rows of two rates of planting with Kherson oats caused the thin rate to yield relatively 20 per cent too low. In 1914, similar single - row competition caused the thin rate to yield relatively 34.3 per cent too low. 3. In 1914, competition between alternating single-row plats of Turkey Red wheat sown at two rates reduced the relative number of stools per plant approximately 37 per cent for the thin rate. There was a similar reduction of 20 per cent for Kherson oats, due to plat competition. 4. The relative competitive effect of varieties varies in different years, due to difference in adaptation to the seasonal conditions. In 1913, competition with Turkey Red winter wheat in single rows caused Big Frame winter wheat to yield rela - tively 10.3 per cent too high. In similar competition in 1914 Big Frame yielded relatively 12.4 per cent too low. In 1913 there was practically no competitive effect be - tween alternating rows of Turkey Red and Nebraska No. 28 winter wheat varieties. This was due to abnormal climatic conditions. However, in 1914 under rather normal condi - tions competition between single-row plats caused the Ne - braska No. 28 to yield relatively 25.9 per cent too low. </seg>
            <seg id="p006">6 Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 13 5. In 1913 in alternating single-row test plats of Burt and Kherson oats, the Burt yielded relatively 16 per cent too high, while in 1914 the yield was relatively 37.6 per cent too high, due to plat competition. In 1913, competition with Kherson oats in alternating one - row plats caused Swedish Select oats to yield relatively 7 per cent too high, while in 1914 its yield was relatively 4.3 per cent too low. 6. When large and small seeds of wheat were planted in competition in the same row, the small seed, as a result of competition, yielded relatively 15 per cent too little grain, 20 per cent too little straw, and made 18 per cent too small total yield. Similar competition was found between varieties of wheat planted in the same row. 7. In a single-row test of 80 strains of Turkey Red wheat grown in the same order each of four years, there are evidences of plat competition between strains. As an aver - age for four years, the poorest strain, No. 75, grew between strains No. 74 and No. 76, ranking one and five. A special test of these three strains in 1915 and 1916 disclosed that strains No. 74 and No. 76 were favored 20 and 15 per cent respectively thru competition with a less vigorous strain. 8. In a rate-of-planting test with Nebraska White Prize corn, — in which two rates of planting, namely two and four plants per hill, were compared in alternating single row plats, — the thin rate yielded relatively 29.3 per cent too low in 1914 because of plat competition. In 1915 the thin rate yielded 9 per cent too low because of plat competition. In 1916 such competition caused the thin rate to yield relatively 16.1 per cent too low. 9. A large, medium, and small variety of corn were grown in plat competition studies during 1912 and 1914. These varieties were Hogue's Yellow Dent, University No. 3, and Pride of the North, respectively. In 1912, Pride of the North yielded 85 per cent as much as Hogue's Yellow Dent in alternating three-row plats, while it yielded 66 per cent as much in alternating single rows. When compared in the same hill by the intra-hill method, the Pride of the North yielded only 47 per cent as much as Hogue's Yellow Dent. Due to competition, the Pride of the North yielded relatively 44.7 per cent too low when compared in the same hill, and 22 per cent too low in alternating one-row plats. </seg>
            <seg id="p007">Experimental Error in Crop Tests 7 10. In 1914, due to plat competition, Pride of the North corn yielded relatively 51 per cent too low when compared with Hogue's Yellow Dent in the same hill, while in alter - nating single-row plats it yielded relatively 28.3 per cent too low. In a comparison of University No. 3 with Hogue's Yellow Dent, the University No. 3 yielded relatively eight per cent too low in single-row plats, and within the hill it yielded relatively one per cent too high. The lack of competition within the hill in this case may have been due to there being only two plants of a rather similar type in a hill. When all three varieties were compared in the same hill, the relative yields for Hogue's Yellow Dent, University No. 3, and Pride of the North were respectively 100, 96, and 28, as compared with 100, 98, and 53 in the center row of three-row plats and 100, 98, and 38 in single rows. 11. In 1916, inbred Hogue's Yellow Dent corn which had been greatly reduced in vigor by five years of self-fertiliza - tion was compared with the more vigorous first generation hybrid of two such pure lines, in blocks, rows, and hills. Be - cause of competition with the larger plants in the same hill, the inbred corn yielded relatively 44 per cent too low, while in alternating single rows, it yielded relatively 16 per cent too low. 12. Studies with oats, wheat, and corn suggest that the yield of the border rows of narrow, adjacent test plats may be materially affected by plat competition. 13. When surrounded by corn hills having a full stand of three plants, two-plant hills and three-plant hills respec - tively yielded 10.5 per cent and 35 per cent more than a one - plant hill in 1914. In a similar test in 1917, two-plant hills and three-plant hills respectively yielded 67 and 102 per cent more than a one-plant hill. 14. The average grain yield of a three-plant corn hill sur - rounded by a full normal stand of three plants per hill was 465.8 grams in 1914. This yield per hill was increased 2.7, 5.3, 13.1, and 43.1 per cent by the presence, respectively, of (1) one adjacent hill with two plants, (2) one adjacent hill with one plant, (3) one adjacent blank hill, and (4) two adjacent blank hills. In 1917 corresponding adjacent imper - fect hills increased the grain yield of three-plant hills, other - wise surrounded by a full stand, respectively 2, 9, 15, and 25 per cent. </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 13 15. Regarding three plants per hill as a perfect stand, the reduction in yield of corn was not proportional to a reduc - tion in stand. With single-row plats, stands averaging 92.8, 87.2, 82.7, 77.8, 73.1, 66.6, and 43.0 per cent yielded respec - tively 85.5, 88.1, 83.5, 82.2, 77.9, 74.8, and 56.7 bushels per acre. 16. Satisfactory yield correction for corn based upon per cent of stand cannot be made, because the effect upon yield depends upon the distribution of the missing plants and because the effect upon yield is not proportional to the per cent stand. Comparable yield tests of similar varieties or strains of corn may be secured by basing the yield upon a counted number of hills containing a uniform number of plants and surrounded by a full stand. 17. Corn varieties or types differing markedly in growth characteristics should be tested at several rates of planting, because the optimum rate for one is not necessarily that for another. Thus, as an average for two years, Pride of the North and Calico produced their maximum yield when grown at the rate of five plants per hill, while Mammonth White Peari' yielded best at the three-rate. In 1914, Pride of the North yielded most at the five-rate, University No. 3 did equally well at the two and three-rate, while Hogue's Yellow Dent produced best at the two-rate. 18. The removal of suckers affects the yield of varieties differently, and for this reason suckers should for no reason be removed in comparative variety tests. 19. In comparative yield tests where it is not conven - ient to harvest and thresh the entire plats, fairly reliable results may be obtained by harvesting and averaging a large number of systematically distributed small fractional areas or quadrates from each plat. The necessary number of quadrates to be representative will vary with the size of the plats. Twenty 32-inch quadrates harvested from thirtieth-acre wheat plats gave fairly reliable results. Less than 20 proved likely to be unrepresentative of the plats. Very satisfactory results were obtained by having 40 quadrates represent one - fifteenth acre of wheat. 20. Two hundred and seven thirtieth-acre plats were grown to a uniform crop of Kherson oats for the purpose of studying various phases of experimental error. Calcula - tions have been made from them to show: (1) The use and </seg>
            <seg id="p009">Experimental Error in Crop Tests 9 effectiveness of check plats for reducing test plats to com - parable yields; (2) the reduction of error by the replication of plats; (3) the relative reliability of plats of various sizes and shapes; and (4) the significance of the "probable error" as a measure of confidence which may be placed in mean results. When the odd and even numbered plats of these 207 are regarded as check plats and test plats respectively and the grain yield of each test plat is corrected by the mean of the two adjacent check plats, the coefficient of variability for the actual yields of these test plats is reduced from 7.85 per cent for the actual yields to 7.01 per cent for the corrected yields. Assuming every third plat to be a check, and correcting the intervening plats by the one adjacent check plat, the coef - ficient of variability was reduced from 7.79 per cent to 7.35 per cent. With every third plat regarded as a check plat, and the intervening plats corrected progressively by the two near - est checks, the coefficient of variability is reduced from 7.87 to 6.57 per cent. Thus it is seen that none of the three methods of check plat correction have been very effective. The yield of systematically distributed check plats can - not be regarded as a reliable measure for correcting and es - tablishing correct theoretical or normal yields for the inter - vening plats. 21. Systematic replication of plats is the most effective and satisfactory means for reducing error caused by soil or other environmental variations. When 200 thirtieth-acre plats were planted to a uniform crop of Kherson oats, the coefficients of variability for the grain yields of single plats and for the mean yields of two, four, and eight plats were 6.30, 4.59, 2.91, and 2.13 per cent respectively. The extreme variation between yields was also reduced from 20.7 bushels for single plats to 7.5 bushels for the means of eight plats. Reduction of error by averaging adjacent plats (which is equivalent to increasing the size of the plat) was far less effective than systematic replication. The coefficients of vari - ability for single plats and for the mean yields of two, four and eight adjacent plats were 6.30, 5.46, 5.28, and 4.78 per cent. Variation between long, narrow plats was less marked than for short, wide plats of the same area. The coefficient of variability for tenth-acre oats plats 48 rods by 5.50 feet was </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 13 3.84 per cent as compared with 5.18 per cent for plats 16 rods by 16.5 feet. 22. Two hundred uniformly planted thirtieth-acre Kher - son oats plats were arranged in 50 groups of four adjacent plats each, and also in 50 groups of four systematically dis - tributed plats. For both methods of grouping, the "prob - able error" has been calculated for the mean yield of each group of four plats. The results indicate that a small prob - able error cannot be regarded as sufficient reason for con - fidence in the reliability of data. Because of chance groupings of either large or small variations where relatively small numbers are used, a mean may be either more or less accurate than an application of the probable error would indicate. 23. In four comparative rate-planting yield tests with small grains in alternating single-row plats the probable error was less than 2 per cent in all cases, and yet there existed an average actual error of 34 per cent in relative yields due to plat competition. Similar results are indicated for variety tests with small grains. 24. An application of the probable error to tests made in 1916 concerning the relative water requirement for grain production of Hogue's Yellow Dent corn and Turkey Red winter wheat may result in greatly misplaced confidence. We may be confident from one test that Hogue's Yellow Dent corn uses considerably less water per pound of grain than does Turkey Red wheat, and from another test we may be equally confident that the corn uses more than twice as much water for grain production as does the wheat. The second comparative figures are unreliable because the soil was rela - tively overcropped by the corn. 25. Crop tests are subject to such a multitude of local environmental influences that errors in them cannot be regarded as occurring according to the formulas or rules of chance calculated mathematically from purely mechanical observations. The probable error may apply where only accidental variations occur but not where systematic varia - tions exist. Crop tests are subject to systematic variations. 26. In view of the precautions necessary to guard against the invalidating influences of various sources of experimental error, greater and better facilities should be provided experi - ment stations for the conduct of crop investigations. </seg>
            <seg id="p011">Experimental Error in Crop Tests 11 27. In crop breeding experiments improvement in yield over the original can only be measured accurately by grow - ing each year some of the original unselected seed for com - parison. The method of comparing the results of one period of years with those of another is unreliable. For example, Hogue's Yellow Dent corn which has undergone continuous ear-to-row breeding since 1902 yielded 39 per cent less during the seven-year period 1907-1913 than during the preceding seven years. However, a seven-year comparison with the orig - inal seed which has been grown as a check indicates that the inherent yielding power of the ear-to-row and the original corn are almost identical. 28. Soil limitation may ba a serious source of error in pot experiments. The relative total moisture-free yields for individual corn plants grown in pots of six sizes in 1914 were, in order from the smallest to the largest, 100, 211, 324.1, 453.6, 643.8, and 747. The corresponding yields of ear corn were 100, 632.5, 1082.3, 2417, 2990, and 4046.7. A uniform application of 1.75 pound of sheep manure per plant (or per pot) increased the yields of total dry matter for the six sizes, in order from the smallest to the largest, 176.4, 95.3, 69.3, 26.1, 12.7, and 7.2 per cent. The corresponding increases in yield of ear corn caused by the manure were 722.5, 193.6, 149.2, 18.9, 14.1, and 2.9 per cent. In 1915 the relative yields of total dry matter from the six sizes of pots, progressing from the smallest to the largest, were 100, 150, 229.6, 355.6, 586, and 578.7 per cent. The corresponding relative yields of ear corn were 100, 276.2, 819, 1647.5, 2771.3, and 2667. Applying manure in amounts proportional to the quan - tity of soil contained, in 1915 had far less striking effect upon the pot yields for the different sizes than when equal quantities were applied in 1914, regardless of the quantity of soil contained. 29. When two, four, or six corn plants were grown in pots of the proper size for growing one normal corn plant, the individual plant yields of total dry matter were respec - tively 50.8, 26.7, and 16.6 per cent as large as for the one-rate, while the corresponding yields of ear corn were respectively 39\7, 15.9, and 2.8 per cent as large. 30.

Such a statement is desirable in order that one may judge regarding the reliability of the results and the degree of confidence which the data merit. </seg>
            <seg id="p013">STUDIES CONCERNING THE ELIMINATION OF EXPERIMENTAL ERROR IN COMPARA - TIVE CROP TESTS It is apparent that many sources of error have uncon - sciously entered into comparative crop yield tests. The very important matter of overcoming variation in soil conditions as a source of experimental error has been quite extensively studied and reported by various investigators during the past decade. The means suggested for reducing such error have been (1) repetition of plats and (2) correction of yields according to check plats planted to a uniform variety or treatment at stated intervals. Both methods have proved of value and a combination of both may often be used advan - tageously. Some danger always exists of error occurring in the check plats and that correcting according to them may introduce new errors in the yields of crops compared. The method should, for this reason, be used with caution. Studies in experimental error conducted at this Experi - ment Station prior to 1911 have been published by Prof. E. G. Montgomery, now of Cornell University, in Bulletin No. 269, of the Bureau of Plant Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture, and in the Twenty-sixth Annual Report of the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station. These pub - lished results concern primarily the general problems of repe - tition and size of nursery small grain plats, and the use of check plats. The object of the following investigations was to secure further information regarding the elimination of error in comparative yield tests. Shortage of facilities for carrying on this character of work in addition to the regular crop investigations of the Experiment Station has in some case-? necessitated intermittent experiments. The duration of some of the tests has for the same reason been shorter than would have been desired. Acknowledgment is gratefully made to Professor J. A. Ratcliff and Pro - fessor C. A. Helm nir valuable assistance in Held supervision and in keeping records during much of the time these experiments were in progress. Messrs. H. O. Gould, B. H. Ewinn, H. E. Holland and H. B.

            <seg id="p014">14 Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 13 KltltOIt Dl'K TO COMPETITION ItKTWKKN AIMACKVT PLATS It is a well known principle in ecology that a keen com - petition for soil moisture and nutrients may exist between plants which differ in growth habit, when grown in close proximity. Competition between adjacent rows of different varieties, selections, or rates of planting, had suggested itself as a possible source of error in crop tests. An inves - tigation was planned in 1912 to determine the relative merits of rows and blocks for making comparative yield tests in the small grain nursery and in corn experiments. The question was: Will two varieties give the same com - parative yields when planted in alternating rows as when planted in alternating blocks consisting of a number of rows? It was reasonable to assume that there would be less plat - competition between varieties planted in blocks than when planted in single rows. It has been a common practice in crop breeding experi - ments to compare the selected strains in adjacent one- row plats for a number of years. Many other comparative tests have also been made in single row plats. AIMAf.'KST HOWS On the right-hand side of Fig. 1 is shown a crop of Tur - key Red winter wheat planted in the fall of 1912. To the south of this was planted Scotch Fife spring wheat in the spring of 1913. The first row of spring wheat, spaced ten inches from the winter wheat, is seen to have grown only about four inches tall with no grain production. The sec - ond row of spring wheat made an almost normal growth, while the third row was entirely normal. The complete fail - ure of the first row of spring wheat may be accounted for by the shortage of both moisture and available plant food material, due to the more rapid and luxuriant growth of the adjacent winter wheat. While this is an extreme example of competition between adjacent rows, it illustrates a principle commonly applying in crop yield tests. l inil'KTITIIlV BRTWKKX AIMA( K\T HOW* OF » M 41 I i.H %l\ The plan of the experiment was to plant two crops under comparison in alternating one-row plats and alternating five - row plats.

Due to competition with the winter wheat, the first row of spring wheat grew only four inches tall with no grain production. The second row was nearly normal and the third row entirely normal. to eliminate the accidental mechanical and physical errors due to variation in soil, exposure, stand, etc. These nursery raws were spaced 10 inches apart. The relative yields in either the entire five-row block or the three inner rows, as indicated, were regarded as the correct relative yields for the season. A difference in the relative yields when tested in alternating rows, as compared with the relative yields in blocks, is chiefly due to, and measures, the competition be - tween the crops compared in rows. In part of the tests the blocks were harvested as individual rows, which permitted a study of the effect of plat competition upon the border rows of five-row plats. The straw yields as well as the grain yields were also secured in a portion of the tests.

Competition in rows with a thicker rate of planting caused the thin rate to yield relatively 24.4 per cent too low. (This percentage effect of competition is determined by dividing the difference between 68 per cent and 90 per cent, or 22, by 90.) In 1914 the thin rate in rows yielded 35 per cent as much as the thick rate, while in the center three rows of five-row plats it yielded 81 per cent as much as the thick rate. Due to competition, the thin rate yielded 56.8 per cent too low.

From these data and other similar data it may be concluded that the outside rows of nursery test plats should be discarded. The straw yields for the 1914 rate-of-planting tests with wheat substantiate the same principles of competition as were brought out in the relative grain yields. In alternating rows, the ratio of thick to thin straw yield was 100:39. For the center three rows of five-row blocks, the ratio was 100:82. The ratio was 100:74 where all five rows were averaged, while it was 100 :63 for the two outside rows. Oats — The relative yields of two rates of planting oats in alternating rows as compared with alternating five-row plats are shown in Table 2. In 1913 the thin rate in rows yielded 64 per cent as much as the thick rate, while in five - row blocks the thin rate yielded 80 per cent as much as the thick rate. Competition in rows with a thicker rate of plant - ing caused the thin rate to yield relatively 20 per cent too low. In 1914 the thin rate in alternating rows yielded 67 per cent as much as the thick rate, while when compared in the three inner rows of five-row plats the thin rate yielded 2 per cent more than the thick rate. Competition in rows with the thicker rate caused the thin rate of planting to yield rela - tively 34.3 per cent too low. If the yields of the entire five - row blocks are taken, the ratio of thick to thin is found to have been 100:98 as compared with 100:102 for the three inside rows, while the ratios of thick to thin for the two out - side rows was 100:96. Similar results were obtained from the straw yields in 1914. In alternating single rows the ratio of thick to thin straw yields was 100:69. For the center three rows of five - row blocks the ratio was 100:102. Where all five rows were averaged the ratio was 100:101, while for the two outside rows it was 100 :99. RELATIVE STOOLJNG OF TWO RATES OF PLANTING WHEN COM - PARED IN ALTERNATING ROWS AND ALTERNATING BLOCKS In 1914, counts were made to determine the effect of com - petition between alternating rows of two rates of planting wheat and oats upon the relative stooling in the two rates.

Turkey Red is the standard bearded hard winter variety for normal Nebraska conditions, while Big Frame is one of the best beardless varieties of rather similar growth habits. The Nebraska No. 28 is an early wheat ripening about ten days before Turkey Red, and is normally six inches shorter. The relative growths of these varieties differ somewhat in different years according to their response to varying cli - matic conditions. This will account for one variety outyield - ing in one season, and another variety in a different season. For example, in 1913 the Nebraska No. 28 wheat grew fully as tall as Turkey Red, because it had attained its maximum height before dry weather set in, which somewhat stunted the more slowly developing Turkey Red wheat. The season of 1914 was more favorable for the Turkey Red wheat, which produced a normal, relatively greater vegetative growth. Table 4 gives the two years' results with Turkey Red and Big Frame wheat. When grown in alternating single rows in 1913, the Big Frame yielded 7 per cent more grain than the Turkey Red wheat, while in alternating five-row plats, the Big Frame yielded 3 per cent less than the Tur - key Red. Due to competition, the Big Frame yielded rela - tively 10.3 per cent too high in single-row plats. In 1914, the Big Frame yielded 85 per cent as much grain as Turkey Red when compared in alternating one-row plats, while it yielded 97 per cent as much in five-row plats. Competition in rows with Turkey Red caused the Big Frame to yield relatively 12.4 per cent too low. The straw yields for 1914 give results similar to those for grain. In alternating rows the ratio of Turkey Red to Big Frame straw yields was 100:90. In five-row plats this ratio was 100:97. Table 5 gives the relative yields of Turkey Red and Ne - braska No. 28 wheat during 1913 and 1914. The ratio of Turkey Red to Nebraska No. 28 grain yield was 100:107 in 1913, both when grown in alternating single-row plats and alternating five-row plats. The growth of the two varieties this year was so similar that competition appears to have been a negligible factor. In 1914 the Nebraska No. 28 yielded 63 per cent as much as the Turkey Red when compared in alternating single-row plats, while it yielded 85 per cent as much in alternating </seg>

In this test the Nebraska No. 28 five-row plats were harvested as separate rows. The center three rows, free from competition with the ranker growing Turkey Red variety, yielded 21.0 per cent more per row than did the two outside rows. The three inside rows also yielded 7.7 per cent more per row than did the entire five-row plat. The straw yields for 1914 indicate similar effect of com - petition. Compared in alternating single-row plats, the ratio of Turkey Red to Nebraska No. 28 straw yields was 100 :53, while in five-row plats this ratio was 100:80. The center three rows yielded 19.1 per cent more straw per row than did the two outer rows, which were obliged to compete with Turkey Red. The center three rows also yielded relatively 6.9 per cent more straw per row than did the entire five - row plat with the two outside rows included. Oats — Both Burt and Swedish Select oats varieties were compared during 1913 and 1914 with Kherson oats in alter - nating single-row and alternating five-row plats. Kherson oats is the standard early variety grown at the Nebraska Experiment Station. Burt oats is rather similar in growth habit to the Kherson, ripening at about the same time. The Swedish Select is a somewhat taller variety, ripen - ing about ten days later. Table 6 gives the two years' results with Kherson and Burt oats. In 1913 the Burt outyielded the Kherson 30 per cent when planted in alternating single rows and 12 per cent in alternating five-row plats. Due to competition the Burt yielded relatively 16 per cent too high in single-row plats. In 1914 the Burt yielded 39 per cent more than the Kher - son in alternating single row plats, while it yielded 1 per cent more in the three center rows of alternating five-row plats. Competition in rows with Kherson oats caused the Burt to yield relatively 37.6 per cent too high. If the yields of the entire five-row plats are taken, the ratio of Kherson to Burt oats is 100:109 as compared with 100:101 for the three inside rows, and 100:120 for the two outside rows. The straw yields which were obtained for 1914 gave very similar results. In alternating single rows the ratio of Kherson to Burt straw yields was 100:139. For the three inside rows of alternating five-row plats the ratio was 100:109. For the entire five-row plats the ratio was 100:117. For the two outside rows it was 100 :129. </seg>

EVIDENCE OF PLAT COMPETITION IN A WHEAT-BREEDING NURSERY During the four years, 1910, 1911, 1912 and 1914, 80 strains of Turkey Red wheat were tested at the ordinary field rate of seeding in identically the same order each year, in single 16-foot rows ten inches apart. The entire series has been replicated ten times each year. It is probable that many of the yields have been subject to the effect of row com - petition. Table 8 contains a concrete example of competition be - tween strains in such a wheat-breeding nursery. In the four - year row test of 80 strains, strain No. 75 ranked 80, while strains No. 74 and No. 76 on either side ranked 1 and 5. Strain No. 75 is a slightly shorter and thinner stooling type. To determine whether the relative rankings of these strains might have been influenced by competition, they were com - pared in both rows and blocks for two years, 1915-1916.

Two varieties were used and reciprocated so that the results in Table 9 represent the mean of two varieties for each grade. This reciprocation eliminates largely the varietal effects in the summary. It was necessary to use two distinct varieties (a bearded and a beardless) so that the plants from each grade might be separated at harvest. The same grades were also compared separately in nursery blocks to establish the relative yields when free from competition. As an average for two varieties each of winter and spring wheat for two years, the small seed in competition yielded relatively 15 per cent too little grain, 20 per cent too little straw, and made 18 per cent too small total yield. Table 10 — Relative yields at the normal field rate of planting, of two varieties when grown alone in blocks, and when grown in competition by alternation in the same row* The results for different years should not be averaged in this variety teat, since varieties do nol have the same relative competitive qualities in different years. We are interested here in what may happen any one year and not in an average of years. In similar manner, competition between two varieties planted within the same row was determined.

KltltOR In corn variety tests, corn breeding experiments, and various other corn yield tests the crops under comparison have customarily been planted in adjacent plats containing one, two, three, or four rows. The single-row plat is used almost universally in corn breeding experiments. In several instances where only three or four kinds of corn were to be compared, these have all been planted in the same hill, giving each kind of corn a definite position in the hill. This intra - hill method has been employed by Hartley, Brown, Kyle, and Zook (1912) and by Collins (1914).* Fig. t&gt; — Planting experimental corn plats where accuracy is required.

These were also compared for yield by growing one plant of each variety in the same hill. For this reason the variety yields per acre in the hill method are on a different basis than in case of the rows and blocks, but nevertheless they are com - parable.

Due to competition, the University No. 3 yielded relatively 8.0 per cent too low, in single rows and within the same hill it yielded 1 per cent too high. The ap - parent lack of competition within the hill in this case may have been due to there being only two plants of rather similar type in a hill. When all three varieties were compared in the same hill the relative yields for the Hogue's Yellow Dent, University No. 3, and Pride of the North were respectively 100, 96, and 28, as compared with 100, 98, and 53 in the center rows of three-row plats, and 100, 90, and 38 in single-row plats. In the three-row plats (Table 16), the yields indicate that competition affects the outer rows to such an extent that they should be discarded in all yield tests of corns which dif - fer in growth habit. Single-row plats are unreliable for a comparative test of corn differing in growth habit or rate of planting.

KIMUARY Of 1M.AT COMI'KTITIO!* MTL'DIKN The effects of single row plat competition upon compara - tive grain yields, are summarized for wheat, oats, and corn, in Tables 18 and 19. These data are taken from Tables 1 to 7 and 11 to 17. The ratios given for the comparative yields in blocks are for the middle row or middle three rows of either three-row plats or five-row plats, except in 1913, when the block-rows were not harvested separately. VARIATION OK STAND AS A SOl'ICt'K OK ERROR IN YIELD TESTS WITH CX)RN In order to secure information regarding the effect of variation in stand upon the accuracy of comparative corn tests, 2,000 hills of corn were planted in 1914 and 8,500 hills in 1917, in which were methodically distributed two, one and no-plant hills among hills with a full stand of three plants. Each hill was harvested separately. The results are contained in Tables 20 and 21. In 1914 (Table 20), when surrounded by hills having a full stand of three plants, the respective relative grain yields of three-plant, two-plant and one-plant hills were 100, 82, and 74. In 1917 the corresponding relative yields were 100, 83, and 50. In 1914 (Table 21), when three-plant corn hills, other - wise surrounded by a full stand of three plants per hill, were adjacent to (1) one hill with two plants, (2) one hill with one plant, (3) one blank hill, (4) two blank hills, the respec - tive grain yields per hill were 3 per cent, 5 per cent, 13 per cent and 43 per cent greater than when surrounded entirely by three-plant hills. </seg>
            <seg id="p042">Nebraska Agi intltnral Exp. Station, Research Bui. 1J 42 In 1917 corresponding hills with missing plants increased the grain yields of three-plant hills respectively 2 per cent, 9 per cent, 15 per cent and 25 per cent over the yield of three-plant hills entirely surrounded by three-plant hills. The data indicate that irregularity of stand in corn yield tests may cause inaccurate yields and should be avoided. Error duo to variation in stand of com may be largely overcome by planting the corn thick and thinning to a uni - form stand soon after coming up. If grown in hills, the seed may be space-planted in the hill so that the actual number of plants may be readily counted at harvest with - out suckors being mistaken for separate plants. It is desir - able, just before husking, to count out a given number of hills having a full stand and surrounded by a normal stand, upon which to base the yield per acre. This may be facili - tated by planting an additional number of hills to permit dis - carding. Space-planting in the hill for experimental yield tests may be accomplished by first marking off the field cross - wise with a sled marker and then making threo separate spaced plantings in each intersection by means of a hand corn planter adapted for the purpose. Where three plants are grown par hill, the marker runners should be double so that all three plantings may be made in a runner mark, thus insuring uniform planting conditions for all three plants. There are exceptional kinds of com experiments in which planting thick and thinning to insure a perfect stand would conflict with the object of the investigation.

            <seg id="p045">Experimental Error in Crop Tests 45 ence in yield for the groups may be assigned primarily to the difference in stand. During the four years, consid - ering three plants per hill a 100 per cent stand, stands aver - aging 92.8, 87.2, 82.7, 77.8, 73.1, 66.6, and 43.0 per cent yielded respectively 85.5, 88.1, 83.5, 82.2, 77.9, 74.8, and 56.7 bushels per acre. It appears from these results that what was regarded a perfect stand, namely three plants per hill, was too thick for a maximum yield with this variety, since an 87.2 per cent stand outyielded a 92.8 per cent stand. The yield by no means decreased in proportion to the stand. An average stand of 43 per cent yielded 66.3 per cent as much as a 92.8 per cent stand. It would appear unreliable to correct yields upon a basis of stand. The yield of an individual row plat planted at a given rate will vary greatly according to the stand in adjacent rows. For this reason the data in Table 22 must not be regarded as necessarily indicating the true relative yields, during the years tested, for the different stands as would be obtained in a proper rate-of -planting test. Because of the chance variations in stand of single-row plats, no reliable formulas can be established for the correc - tion of yields according to the per cent stand. For example, very different results may be expected from a row with 75 per cent stand, according to whether it falls between rows having a 50 per cent or a 100 per cent stand. This is borne out by the rate-of-planting tests in rows and blocks during the three years 1914-1916 (Tables 11, 12, and 13). COMBINATION OF KATE-PI&lt;AXTIN« AND VARIETY YIEIJ&gt; TESTS It has been a rather common practice in variety yield tests to plant all varieties at one arbitrary "standard" rate, regardless of their growth habits. During 1907 and 1908, three varieties were tested at five different rates of planting. The Pride of the North and Calico, which are respectively small and medium-sized vari - eties, increased regularly in yield with the rate of planting, and produced their maximum at the rate of five plants per hill. On the other hand, Mammoth White Pearl, which is $. large late corn, yielded its maximum at the three-rate and then fell off sharply. </seg>
            <seg id="p046">46 Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 13 In 1914, three varieties, differing distinctly in size and length of growing season, were planted at five different rates. Pride of the North produced its maximum yield at the rate of five plants per hill. University No. 3 produced identical and maximum yields at both the two and the three-rate and then fell off sharply. Hogue's Yellow Dent produced its max - imum yield at the two-rate and then fell off sharply. The data in both Tables 23 and Table 24 indicate that the relative yielding power of varieties differing in growth habit can only be determined by planting at several rates. Different varieties have a different optimum rate of planting.

In order to secure information relative to the reliability of such a method the following test was made in 1917 : Duplicate thirtieth-acre field plats of each of seven differ - ent varieties or selections of winter wheat were chosen from among a large number of plats for this study. These plats measured 16 rods by 66 inches and contained eight rows. Twenty systematically distributed fractional areas or quadrates were harvested from each plat. These were 32 inches square, contained four rows of wheat, and were .0001632 acre in area. Quadrates were located 10 feet from each end and at intervals of 14 feet on alternate sides of the plat, as indicated in the following diagram.

A rectangular frame is more reliable than a round one where the grain is planted in rows. Because of severe and variable winterkilling the 14 plats differed markedly in the percentage of plants surviving, and in yield. There was also much greater variation between the quadrates within a single plat than would normally be expected. Opportunity was provided to compare the mean results of 5, 10, and 20 systematically distributed quadrates with the entire plat from which they were harvested. In making four groups of five quadrates each, group (a) contained quad - rates Nos. 1, 6, 9, 14, and 17; group (b) contained Nos. 3, 8, 11, 16, and 19; group (c) contained Nos. 2, 5, 10, 13, and 18; and group (d) Nos. 4, 7, 12, 15, and 20. For two groups of 10 quadrates each, group (a) contained Nos. 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 16, 17, and 20, and group (b) contained Nos. 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, 18, and 19. The results of these various groupings are shown in Table 26 in comparison with the yields of the entire respective plats. The average yield determined from 20 quadrates deviated 1.4 bushels from the average plat yield. For individual plats the 20-quadrate yield estimation varied from 0.2 to 3.2 bushels per acre. Smce each kind of wheat was grown in duplicate plats the mean of 40 quadrates can be compared with the mean of two field plats. In this comparison the average of these </seg>

When the quadrates from each plat were grouped into sets of five and ten each, there was considerable variation in yield between the separate groups, which suggests that not less than 20 quadrates should be harvested from compara - tive plats of this character. It appears that the results from 20 systematically dis - tributed quadrates may be fairly safely substituted for the yield of the entire plat from which they are taken. KXPKIMMKXTAL KHHORS CAl'SKD IJY SOIL VARIATION The lack of uniformly productive land for comparative crop tests has given rise to a number of methods frequently used for ascertaining and overcoming the resultant experi - mental error. Chief among these methods are : ( 1 ) The use of frequent, systematically distributed check plats planted to a uniform crop for the purpose of (a) indicating the degree Fig. 13 — A relatively uniform field containing 207 thirtieth-acre plats sown for a method study to a uniform crop of Kherson oats (1916) </seg>

(2) Replication of plats and bas - ing the conclusions upon the mean yield. (3) Use of long, narrow rather than short, wide plats. (4) Calculating the probable error for the mean results of replicated plats, to indicate the degree of confidence which may be placed in the results. The results from 207 thirtieth-acre Kherson oats plats, grown in 1916, illustrate each of the four p-actices mentioned above. These plats were planted to a uniform crop upon a seemingly uniform field for the purpose of studying varia - tion in plat yields as a source of experimental error. The Fig. 14 — Two hundred and seven thirtieth-acre Kherson oats plats planted to a uniform crop for studying experimental error in 1916 entire field had been cropped uniformly to silage corn for a period of eight years. It had been plowed each year and was also plowed in preparation for the oats in 1916. The oats were drilled during two successive days in plats 16 rods by 66 inches, which equaled one drill width. The plats were separated by a space of 16 inches between outside drill rows. A wide discard border of oats was grown around the outer edge of the field, so that all plats should have a similar expo - sure. General views of this field are shown in Figures 13 and 14. </seg>
            <seg id="p053">Experimental Error in Crop Tests 53 ISK OF CIIKCK PLATS During the past 15 years it has become the general prac - tice in crop investigations to plant check plats at regular stated intervals. These plats are planted to a uniform crop and should yield alike except for various environmental sources of experimental error. The use of check plats may be twofold: (1) To indicate the error caused by variation in normal plat yields. The variation in the check plats is regarded as indicative of the error in the test plats. (2) Check plats are more commonly used to calculate the normal or theoretical yield of all plats in the field. All crops or treatments are then compared directly with each other by their increased or decreased yield above or below the calculated normal yield for the plats upon which they grew. This difference is best expressed in percentage of the normal plat yield. Comparative yields per acre may then be calculated for each crop, variety, or treatment by adding (or subtracting) the difference between it and the normal yield for the plat to (or from) the mean yield for all check plats in the field. This recalculation of yields is usually spoken of as correction according to check plats. The check plats may be variously distributed in the field according to the manner in which the corrections are to be made. Three methods of correction are in common use: (1) The normal o* theoretical yield of the test plat is determined by, and is equivalent to, the average of two adjacent check plats. (Alternating plats are check plats.) (2) The normal or theoretical yield of the test plat is determined by, and is equivalent to, the yield of a single adjacent check plat. (Two test plats are planted between checks.) (3) The soil between two or more check plats is regarded as varying gradually from one check plat to the other and a progressive correction is used to establish the normal or theoretical yields of the intervening test plats. Thus, if two test plats lie between checks which yield 51 and 60 bushels respectively, the nor - mal yields assigned to the two test plats by this progressive method would be 54 and 57 bushels. Progressing from the lower to the higher yielding check the normal yield of the first test plat is greater than the poorer check by one-third of the difference, while the normal yield of the second test plat is greater than the poorer check by two-thirds of the difference. The proportion of the difference added to each successive test plat will depend upon the number of plats be - tween checks. </seg>

Certain plats have been designated as check plats according to each of the above three methods, and the intervening plats have been treated as test plats. The test plats have been corrected in yield according to the check plats. If such correction had been effective, the coefficient of variability for the corrected yields would have been ma - terially reduced below the coefficient of variability for the actual yields. On the contrary, however, the coefficients of variability were reduced less than l'per cent, being 7.8 per cent for the actual yields and 7.0 per cent for the corrected yields, as an average for the three methods of correction. Table 30 gives the coefficients of variability for the actual and corrected yields of the test plats indicated in Tables 27, 28, and 29.

These groupings have been arranged for both adjacent and systematically dis - tributed plats. The results are given in Table 31. It is clearly shown that replication greatly reduces the extreme variation and coefficient of variability in the yield of field plats. A given number of replications are also much more effective when systematically distributed than when adjacent plats are averaged. Fig. 15 — Harvesting thirtieth-acre plats of Kherson oats. The binder has a gasoline engine attached which cuts and binds the grain. This facilitates cleaning out the binder quickly at the end of each plat. Note the narrow bare spaces between plats. If the plats are tangled by lodging, they are separated by hand before being cut. This shape of plat is very convenient, since it is one drill in width and may be harvested by one swath of the binder </seg>

The mean for eight groups of 25 single plats each gives an extreme difference between single plats of 20.7 bushels per acre. When two, four, and eight systematically distributed plats are averaged, the extreme differences in yield are respectively 14.9, 8.9, and 7.8 bushels. When two, four, and eight adjacent plats are averaged, these extreme differences are 19, 16.7, and 15 bushels. For sys - tematically distributed plats the coefficients of variability for one, two, four, and eight plats in a group are 6.30, 4.5D, 2.91, and 2.18 per cent. For adjacent plats the coefficients of variability for one, two, four, and eight plats in a group are 6.30, 5.46, 5.28, and 4.78 per cent.

(In the 1x9 grouping, three groups were necessarily irregu - lar in shape since 9 is not a multiple of 69.) The results are included in Table 31. Long, narrow plats are indicated to be more reliable than short wide plats of the same area. Increasing the size of the plat is less effec - tive in overcoming experimental error than the systematic distribution of plats equal in combined area. SIGX1KICANCK OK THE "PKOHAIihK KltltOK" The "probable error" calculation is being used somewhat by field crop experimenters. Its use is rather inviting since a small "probable error" is customarily regarded as indicat - ing accuracy in the results. Davenport's interpretation is generally accepted, namely: "It (the probable error) indi - cates the degree of confidence which we should place in results obtained by statistical methods." Where plats are replicated two or more times, the prob - able error of the mean is based upon the standard deviation, and is determined by the following formula : standard deviation Probable error of mean ± 0.6745 , , - . . I number of variates &lt;T which is also stated E m — ± 0.6745 ~ l " The probable error is regarded as an upper and lower limit of divergence for which the chance is even that the true mean does not lie outside of these limits. Commenting upon the likelihood of the true mean lying outside of the limits set by the probable error, Davenport (1907) states: "Of course the error in a determination has also an even chance of lying outside the limits set by the probable error (E), but the following table will show that it is very unlikely that the error is many times as great as E. Thus the chances that the true value lies within the range set by ± E, -± 2E, etc., are as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p066">Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 13 66 ± E the chances are even ±2 E the chances are 4.5 to 1 ±3 E the chances are 21 to 1 ±4 E the chances are 142 to 1 ±5 E the chances are 1310 to 1 ±6 E the chances are 19,200 to 1 ±7 E the chances are 420,000 to 1 ±8 E the chances are 17,000,000 to 1 =t9 E the chances are about 1,000,000,000 to 1 "It is extremely improbable, therefore, that an error will be many times as large as the probable error. For instance, it is practically certain that the error is not as large as 9 E, since the table shows that the chances are about a billion to one in favor of its being smaller than 9 E. "Thus by giving, along with any result, the calculated probable error, the reader may know what degree of con - fidence is to be placed in the results." In common usage, it is stated that the actual difference in the yield of two plats must be three times the probable error before the difference in yield is significant. It should be agreed at the outset that the probable error of a mean yield has significance only when the variations entering into the mean are purely accidental rather than sys - tematic. This distinction is understood by biometricians who universally attach importance to the probable error cal - culation when used in a legitimate manner. There appear to be strong possibilities of misusing the probable error and overestimating its value in agronomic studies. This need not be regarded as any defect in the probable error formula, but rather as a misapplication thereof to experimental results possessing either visible or invisible systematic errors. Field crop investigators consider it good technique to repli - cate test plats. It has been proposed that, in such tests, small probable errors for the mean yields of the various varieties or treatments would indicate reliability and justify con - fidence in the comparative yields. For the purpose of studying the significance of the prob - able error in field crop tests, the first 200 consecutive thir - tieth-acre Kherson oats plats described on pp. 52 to 64 have been grouped in 50 sets of four adjacent plats and also 50 sets of four systematically distributed plats, and the prob - able error calculated for the mean yield of each group of four plats. </seg>
            <seg id="p067">Experimental Error in Crop Tests 67 IMIOBABLK F.HIIOK FOR FIFTY GROUPS OF FOUR ADJACENT T1IIHTIKTII-A&lt; UK PL.AT8 OF KHERSON OAT8 That the probable error cannot apply to the mean yields of adjacent duplicate plats in a variety test is brought out by the following data : In Table 32 are given the mean yields for 50 groups of four adjacent plats, together with the average deviation, standard deviation, and probable error for each group. The average deviation of each group from the mean yield for the entire 200 plats is also indicated and in the last column of the table is given the ratio of this deviation to the probable error. If it is permissible to assume that one group of four dupli - cate plats is comparable with another group of four plats in the same field, then it would also seem permissible to assume that in the present instances, the mean yield for the entire 200 similarly treated oats plats should represent the correct yield or true value of any or all of the individual groups within the field. If this assumption be made with the adja - cent duplicate; plats (Table 32), the actual error of these group means exceeded their probable error approximately 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 15 times respectively in 9, 5, 7, 7, 8, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, and 1 groups. (See Col. 11, Table 32). This is very inconsistent with the table of probabilities quoted from Davenport on page 66, and shows that a uniform ap - pearing field may be so heterogeneous in soil conditions that its mean yield cannot be regarded as correctly representing the true value of its various parts. Since all the plats were treated and planted alike any dif - ference in the yields of the groups represents experimental error, either in mechanical operations or in soil variation. Among the 50 groups of adjacent plats, one group yielded 14.2 bushels less and another group 7.3 bushels more per acre than the 200-plat mean. These extremes represent an experi - mental error of 21.5 bushels since both should have yielded alike if the method of comparison were reliable. Should we presume that groups No. 30 and No. 50 (Table 32) are distinct varieties in a comparative variety test, we would have a difference in yield of 21.5 bushels per acre. After multiplying the probable error of each mean by three, there remains a net difference of 11.63 bushels between the probable error ranges.

How - ever, we know in this case that both groups should have yielded alike since they were planted to the same crop. The probable error would give us confidence in very inaccurate results. Slightly different results are obtained when the above ex - ample is calculated by the following prescribed formula : "The probable error of the difference of two means each affected with a probable error, is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the probable errors." By this formula the difference in mean yield of groups Nos. 30 and 50 equals 21.5 ±2.55 bushels. Three times the probable error is 7.65 bushels which leaves a net difference of 13.85 bushels. nillH Mll.i: KH1IOH OK KIKTY CillOlPS OK FOUR SYSTEMATICALLY 1)1^ I It Illl I I II I II 111 11 1: III- \l UK I'LATS OF KIIKUSOK OATS Table 33 contains results with the same 200 Kherson Oats plats as compiled in Table 32, except that systematically dis - tributed plats rather than adjacent plats are averaged in groups of four each. If the mean yield of the entire 200 plats is here regarded as the true value of the various group means, the actual error of these group means exceeded their prob - able error 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 times in 10, 25, 10, 1, and 4 groups (See Col 11). This is a marked reduction in actual error as compared with similar data for adjacent plats and indi - cates a great advantage for systematic distribution. An ap - plication of the probable error to these systematically distrib - uted plats would seem fairly reasonable altho it cannot be applied absolutely. Because of chance groupings of either large or small varia - tions where relatively small numbers are used, the actual error of a mean may be greater than three times its probable error, or it may be smaller than the probable error. Data may be either more or less accurate than an application of the probable error would indicate.

Corresponding </seg>
            <seg id="p073">Experimental Error in Crop Tests 73 tests were also made in five-row plats relatively free from plat competition and subject primarily only to soil variations. In Table 1 (1913) the yields of the thick and thin planted wheat rows were, respectively, 389 ±5.3 and 264 ±3.8 grams. Altho the probable error for each yield is less than 2 per cent, the actual error of the relative yields due to competition is 24.4 per cent. In 1914 the yields of the thick and thin planted wheat rows were respectively 327±6.66 and 115±3.6 grams. Altho the probable error for each yield is only 2 per cent, the actual error of the relative yields, due to competition, is 56.8 per cent. In 1913 (Table 2) the probable errors for the mean yields of thick and thin planted oats rows were less than 2 per cent, but the actual error in relative yields, due to competi - tion, was 20 per cent. In 1914 the probable errors for simi - lar yields were also below 2 per cent, while the actual error in relative yields, due to competition, was 34.3 per cent. Similar examples are seen in variety tests in Tables 3 to 7. We would have great confidence in these single-row tests were we to judge them by their low "probable errors." How - ever, it is evident that this confidence would be badly mis - placed. Crop tests are subject to such a multitude of local environ - mental influences that errors in them cannot be regarded as occurring according to the formulas or rules of chance cal - culated from purely mechanical observations. The probable error calculation may apply, for example, to the chance draw - ing of black and white marbles from a bag at a given ratio to each other. But variations in crop yields are no such sim - ple matter, and the probable error not only may have little significance but may be misleading. Water Requirements of Com and Wheat — As further illus - tration of the limitation of the probable error, the following simple data from our 1916 water requirements of crop studies may be cited. The object was to make a comparative test of the relative water requirements for grain production of a standard variety of both corn and winter wheat. Potometers, 16 by 36 inches in size and containing 250 pounds of well-manured moist - ure-free soil, were used. (The method of testing is de - scribed in detail in Nebraska Research Bulletin No. 6.) Previous experiments had indicated that these potometers would grow one corn plant in a normal manner. The ratio </seg>
            <seg id="p074">74 Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. IS of 100 seeds of wheat to one of corn is normal in planting under field conditions in this region. Accordingly in com - paring corn and wheat in potometers they were planted re - spectively at the rates of one plant and 100 plants per pot. Under these conditions the respective water requirements for grain production of the corn and wheat were 743 ±48 and 1017 ±60. However, when the corn was grown at the rate of six plants per potometer these relative water require - ments were 3481 ±389 and 1017±60. Applying the general rule of "three times the probable error," we may be fairly confident from the one comparison that Hogue's Yellow Dent corn uses considerably less water than Turkey Red winter wheat, and from the other compari - son we may be equally confident that corn uses more than double the amount of water for grain production than the wheat. In the first comparison the degree of cropping for this quantity of soil corresponded well with normal field conditions for each crop. In the second test, however, the corn was planted relatively much too thick, and for this reason the ratio of grain to vegetative growth was greatly reduced. As a result the water requirement for grain production was in - creased. EFFECT OK CHANGE IN METHODS ON AGRONOMIC EQUIPMENT Replacing the single-row nursery test plat planted in du - plicate with five-row test plats replicated 10 times increases the land requirement 25 times for such nursery testing. In testing hoed crops the substitution of three-row plats, repli - cated five times, for single duplicated rows requires 15 rows rather than two rows. The replication of small grain field plats five times, rather than twice, greatly increases the land requirement. Fertilizer and tillage experiments which frequently are conducted in unduplicated plats should probably be at least triplicated. Reduction of error by replication is more effec - tive than the use of check plats alone. The introduction of check plats every fifth plat in itself occupies one-fifth of the land. The more refined methods of securing comparable stands of corn upon which to base the yields at harvest require much greater labor expenditure than formerly. </seg>
            <seg id="p075">Experimental Error in Crop Tests 75 The proper conduct of experimental work in crop produc - tion in light of our present knowledge requires either a large extension in land area and labor facilities or else a marked restriction in the amount of investigation carried on. MKASIHINC; 1MI-KOVKMKNT IN YIELD THRU BREEDING Comparing the yield of corn for one period of years with the yield of another period is an unreliable method for not - ing improvement thru corn breeding. An illustration of this method is found in a circular of the United States Depart - ment of Agriculture Office of Corn Investigations, August 20, 1914.

The increase in yield of ear corn as weighed at husking time was 10.4 per cent. The measure of improvement by breeding was the average in - creased yield during a seven year period, 1907-1913, over the previous seven-year period. A comparison of the yields in Table 35 during these same two periods for the state of Ohio as compiled from the United States Yearbook indicates a similar increase in yield for the state in general. During the last period of seven years, the Ohio state yield was 11.4 per cent higher than during the previous seven years.

The yield of continuous ear-to-row breeding strains during the seven-year period 1907-1913 was 61 per cent as .great as during the preceding seven years. It would appear that the corn yield had been reduced 39 par cent by ear-to-row breeding during the last seven years. However, a comparison of yields in Lancaster County, in which the Station is located, shows a decreased yield of 30 per cent, and the State as a whole a decreased yiela of 17.3 per cent for the same two periods. Further, the yield of the original unselected Hogue's Yellow Dent corn showed a decreased yield of 35 per cent at the Experiment Station during the second seven-year period. All indications are that the reduced yield of ear-to-row corn at the Experiment Station was due to climatic conditions and not to the breeding. An actual comparison of the ear-to-row corn during the last period of seven years with the original corn of the same variety planted each year as a check indicates an actual increased yield of 5.4 per cent due to breeding, whereas the other method of comparison indicated a decreased yield of 39 per cent. 34.4 38.3 28.7 31.4 </seg>

In order to measure progress in the improvement of corn thru breeding, it is necessary to compare the results each year with the original unselected corn. SOIL LIMITATION AS A KOCRCK OK KRROR IN POT EXPERIMKNT8 The past discussions in this bulletin have dealt entirely with field experiments. Extensive use has also been made of pots filled with soil for comparing the yields of various crops and soil types, and for determining the fertilizer needs of dif - ferent soils and the water requirement of crops. A review of the literature indicates a marked lack of uniformity in the size of pots and rate of planting in them. Tables 37 to 47 contain the results from experiments con - ducted during three years, 1913-1915, bearing upon the effect of the size and rate of planting as sources of experimental error in pot tests. Galvanized iron pots were used, having a constant water supply from jars connected at the bottom. Rain was excluded by means of a closefitting cover about the stalk, and surface evaporation was reduced by means of a three-inch layer of gravel. All pots were planted each year from the same ear of Hogue's Yellow Dent corn. Suckers were removed as soon 'ABLE I upi 17 — Summary showing th m the growth of corn.

With - out a statement of methods, the reader is obliged to assume that reliable methods were employed. Such an assumption is not warranted, since many methods used are known to be faulty. Not only the experiment station worker but the farmer as well should be given an opportunity to know in detail how the tests were made. Increased experimentation by farmers has led many of them to be interested in methods. The following brief summary table indicates the extent to which experiment station bulletins dealing with crop tests and published in the United States during the years 1900 - 1914 report details as to methods. A mere statement of re - sults is incomplete and does not carry conviction.
