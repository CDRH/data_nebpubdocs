Introduction The State Department of Public Instruction respectfully submits this report to His Excellency, the Governor of the State of Nebraska, the members of the Legislature, and the school patrons of this state. We are making an effort in this report to give a fair knowledge, a sort of bird's-eye view as' it were, of the field of. education here in Ne - braska. We believe that careful reading of the pages which follow will be of interest to all who are interested in Nebraska'* state-wide program of public education. Whatever success the department has had during the two years Is due to the earnest cooperation of the department heads and their able corps of assistants. The State Superintendent assumes full responsi - bility for. mistakes which the department has made. ■ Any credit really belongs to the directors who have worked for the state unceasingly. The men and women acting as division directors have given unstint - ingly of their service to the work of their several divisions. The re - ports under the division headings represent primarily tho best thought of the division directors with the criticism, approval, and suggestions of the State Superintendent himself.. The State of Nebraska has always accepted Its responsibility and obligation to the rising generation. This responsibility of the state for the education of its citizens in general has always been reflected In the high type of educational thinking found in Nebraska's Constitu - tional Conventions and Legislatures of former years. These statesmen have always attacked the educational problems of the state from a non-political viewpoint. Special credit and praise are due to the very fine personnel that has always made up the committee on education In both- the Senate and the House of Representatives. The very life of a democracy depends upon the universal and equi - table education of each generation of youths as they come upon the </seg>
            <seg id="p010">REPORT OP STATE SUPERINTENDENT scene of action. As will be seen elsewhere in this report, the State of Nebraska has a right to be proud of the fact that she has been giving generous support to her schools. Cooperative Enterprises There exist in Nebraska today large numbers of fraternal organ-' izations and clubs that are Interested in civic life and in civic better - ment. Nearly all of these groups have a definite interest in education. Few people have yet dreamed of the possibilities that could be realized for the improvement of education in general if these organizations could be harmonized and correlated with the work of the schools throughout the state. They are all to be congratulated and encouraged for their interest in education. ' The educational program demands a cooperative endeavor of both the taxpayer, and those who are paid by the taxpayers. As educational administrators and teachers we must not disregard the. expressed sen - timents of those whom w.e serve, and those who represent the lay mind of the community. It is thus that any substantial progress will be forthcoming. President Glenn Frank has expressed it after this manner: "First, he is a taxpayer, and as a stockholder in a vast en-, terprlse which requires millions of dollars, he is naturally inter - ested in the efficiency of the enterprise. ■ . ■ "Second, he is a parent. He has a right to a.°k whether the schools are training his sons and daughters for a static world which no longer exists, or for a changing world in which their for - tunes will be cast. ... "Third, he is a business or professional man, and has the right to ask whether the schools are turning out young men and young women who will help or handicap the various business ac - tivities and professions. "Fourth, he is a patriot, and has a right to ask whether the schools are graduating young men and women who will make the country better or worse because of their participation in its affairs." . ..■•.. We recognize and hold in high esteem the various units of educa - tional administration, supervision and teaching — meaning by this the elementary, secondary and higher schools of our commonwealth. We are not unmindful of the fact that we must work with and through these various units as they actually exist, not forgetting that even here change is inevitable and that while we' hope for and expect a better synchronization, we must not let our educational idealism or professional zeal and our enthusiasm for these new conditions get too far ahead of what not only we as professional leaders but what the lay mind also might call practical common 'sense. This means, of course, that first things must come first. If the teaching profession is to oc- </seg>
            <seg id="p011">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION cupy the place In society that it rightly deserves it must continue to give proof of the fact that it is working, first, last and always in the interests of boys and girls, the young men and young women whom we would instruct and inspire, forgetting our purely selfish interests as members of the profession. Those outside of the profession will fol - low our .leadership much more quickly and much more certainly if they are convinced that we are engaged in a single, common task and that we have no ulterior motives or purposes as such. Close adherence to these two types of cooperative endeavor will, we believe, serve the best interests of the profession. Character Education Section 79-2131 provides as follows: Section 1. "It shall be the duty of each and every teacher employed to give instruction in the regular course of the first twelve grades of any public, private, parochial or denominational school in the State of Nebraska to so arrange and present his or her instruction as to give special emphasis to common honesty morality, courtesy, obedience to law, respect for the National Flag, the Constitution of the United States, and the Constitution of the State of Nebraska, respect for parents and the home, the dignity and necessity of honest labor and other lessons of a steadying influence, which tend to promote and develop an ud - right and desirable citizenry." Section 2. "For the purpose of this act the State Superin - tendent of Public Instruction shall prepare by September 1, 1927, an outline with suggestions such as in his judgment will best accomplish the. purpose set forth In section one, and shall incorporate the same in the regular course of study for the first twelve grades of all schools of the State of Nebraska." Very definite progress has been made in the state during the last biennium in the matter of emphasizing character values in the whole realm of. school activities and experiences. Nearly all teachers In the state are responding to the requirements of the Character Education Law which makes It their duty to emphasize in their teaching and man - agement of their pupils common honesty, morality, courtesy, obedience to the laws, respect for the national flag and for the Constitution of the United States and of Nebraska, respect for their parents and home, and the dignity and necessity of honest labor. The department has lost no opportunity to further work of this type in all the schools of the state under the mandate of the law. A course of study with a supplement was printed and put into the hands of every teacher in the state. Public opinion is wide awake in its de - mand for more attention on the part of the schools to this important matter. The State Superintendent realizes better than anyone else that the Department, has accomplished too little in this line. The problem of citizenship training towers like an overpowering need In </seg>
            <seg id="p012">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT . these present times of disorganization, carrying along as they do Ideas of social and economic overturn. Splendid work in character education is being done by organiza - tions independent of the schools, such as: Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Camp fire Girls, Citizenship Clubs, Junior Red Cross, Girl Reserves, Knighthood of Youth, Y. M. C. A., Y. W. C. A., 4-H Clubs and many other fine organizations of this type. This office has been continuously in search of vitalized .material to put in the teachers' hands to better enable them to give instruction in character education in the harmful effects of alcoholic drinks. The following is quoted from an article by the .writer, UNITING THE HOME AND THE SCHOOL FOR CHARACTER EDUCATION, published in the Bulletin of the Department of Elementary School Principals in July, 1932. "The unprecedented difficulties arising from the present worldwide economic i depression, the apparently rapid increase in juvenile delinquency, and the many distressing cxamp.es of dishonesty in public service and commercial busi - ness activity within the past few years have all contributed to bringing about a feeling of pessimism regarding our present-day standards of ethical and moral conduct. It is certain that these factors just mentioned do present a very definite challenge hot only to the schools of America but to the homes and to all classes of men and women interested in public life and public aftairs. "It is to be seriously doubted that the United States is suffering at the present time from any want of highly developed intellectual or. brain skills as such. We believe, that the schools of our country have and are producing a large company of intellectually trained individuals every *y *■'•»!'• But can the United Statt-s justify its system of education on the. basis of a scientific, voca - tional, mechanical smartness alone? We cannot close our cars to the plead - ings of the professional people, of our business and commercial interests, and of our leading citizens.- -These groups are calling upon the schools not only to continue their program of training the intellect hut to combine with this im - portant objective that other equally important objective, the development of those moral and ethical qualities of leadership which are so essential in this complex age in which we arc now living. "The supreme challenge and demand of the political, social, economic, and moral realm seem to be that of building a finer type of real American citizen - ship — a citizenship ready- to stand by and remain * ruc to t ' losc high ideals of manhood and womanhood which prompt right individual conduct in a highly and complexly organized social realm. Will sufficient moral and ethical poise for this desired citizenry evolve directly out of a purely mental and intellec - tual procedure of the classroom or must it come about by some other means? If the school can devise some means of accomplishing this training in part at least, can it hope to succeed without the cooperation of the home and the com - munity so that all these environmental factors influencing the life of the -child will be working toward and contributing to. a common goal? "Dangers surrounding the American youth- of today are not ignorance, superstition, hick of opportunity, or lack of education. They arc surrounded by dangers far more subtle than these — dangers in the realm of morals and ethics. While our youth may have as much assistance, guidance and counsel through the efforts of the parents and the mature experience of business and professional men and women of the communities in which they reside, we arc none the; less finding them infinitely .more susceptible to the influence of the equally immature associates with whom they arc so much in contact. If we were to point to the one special danger to the morals and ethics of youth today we would spot the problem at this point: the youth of today get a far I greater proportion of their ideals and standards of conduct from- young, im - mature .individuals like themselves than did the youth of previous generations. That we have ample proof of this " statement goes without saying. -Studies of a more or less scientific nature definitely point to the importance of the influence of the group upon its members. </seg>
            <seg id="p013">OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION "There- are plenty of philosophers and psychologists in the field of educa - tion who are willing to pick flaws with any proposed plan of character educa - tion, and to criticize it negatively because scientifically it cannot be proved to be thus and so. When, however, the Nebraska Legislature passed a law making it the duty of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction to pre - scribe a course of study for the schools of the state looking toward the de - vf3opn?,ent, .»« character, it. was manifestly impossible for. this individual to officially hide behind any theory of the philosophy or psychology of character education as justifying himself to continue a course of inaction. It, therefore became necessary to do something constructive, positive, and operative The state, department wanted something, that would be specific and that would definitely hold in securing the cooperation of home and community. "As a preliminary step the department set about very early to give encour - agement by every means at its disposal, to the many fine character training organizations in the field, most of which did and still have their control out - side of and independent of the regular school machinery. We refer to such organizations as Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Y. M. C. A. and Y. W C A Junior Red Cross, 4-II Chilis, and others of like nature. r "Then the state department encouraged the' formation of citizenship clubs and other clubs within the schools themselves as a means of beginning, at least, in a small way the socializing process. "Meanwhile a manual for teachers was carefully prepared attempting to cover the whole question of character education. The manual was also used in the high school normal training classes of the state (234) where the de - partment has charge of the training of approximately two thousand (2000) teachers a year for service in the rural schools of the state. "Our observation of the Knighthood of Youth in New York City schools led us to a study of its qualities. The Knighthood of Youth is a plan spon - sored by the National Child Welfare Association of New York City a non - commercial organization, devoting its energies to the problems of uharactcr education. "While the Knighthood of Youth is primarily a citizenship club it offers to both pupils and teachers much more help in'character education than is found in the ordinary citizenship, club. "A person must be interested to achieve any marked success. The greater toe interest and enthusiasm that can be thrown into school work the better pupils will succeed. The idea of "adventure" helps to increase this interest and enthusiasm not only in the character developing activities of the club but in all school work whicii, of course, is essential to character education. . " Tne t . c , rm 'Knighthood' itself represents an ideal— that of service. Each child considers himself a modern knight, ready to serve at all times wherever he may be, at school, at home, or as a member of his community. He also learns as a part of his clubwork that in order to render the best service he must develop himself to tile highest degree of which he is capable. "The program emphasizes the. necessity of home and school cooperation if character education is to be successful. The Club sets before the child four pos».il] e ways of improving his own personality, which become to him his individual adventures. In three of these it is very essential that the home understand the program being carried on at school and cooperate with the child in his undertaking. "Each child is encouraged to overcome his bad habits, replacing these with good habits. This may include the forming of health habits and the improv - "\ g - u • P erson . alltv , traits, such as trying to be more cheerful, doing that which is supposed to be done without being told, or avoiding the use of slant - or vulgar language. " "Ways of encouraging this individual improvement are presented at Club meeting times by the various committees. Thus the chairman of the Health Committee may make general suggestions for improvement in health. A part of the Club philosophy is that no child be reprimanded before the group for failure. Committee chairmen may call out the names of those who succeed in activities but not those who fail. Commendation is given at Club meeting time to individual pupils who form desirable habits. Parents and community members are asked to send to school commendations of desirable home and community habits. Thus the strong incentive to do right is the approval of the social gallery which, through the Club, includes the school, home, and community. ■'.*■■ l </seg>
            <seg id="p014">12 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT :. "The Club encourages Icisurc-timc interests as an individual ■ adventure. Each child is asked to present before the group any spare-time accomplish - 1 ment. The city schools supply this incentive (or leisure time through their various clubs such as dramatic, kodakry, and nature. The rural schools can - not have these numerous organizations, but a part of each Knighthood meet - ing is given over to a report of leisure-time accomplishments. This gives the child who may be 'scIkkjI dull but life bright* ail opp &gt;rtunity to present to his Cluli that which he can do efficiently. "Parents and teachers arc a.sked to believe that each child has the ability to do something and to €lo that something well. The knowledge on the part of the teacher of the child's leisure-time interests is one of the best ways of helping her to understand and guard that child's personality. Parents also learn more about the interests of their children and through the Club are encouraged to help them find something worthwhile to do in their spare time. The Club encourages as leisure-time interests such things as the reading of books, the study of music and art, making nature and other collections, any kind of construction work. I "Through this added incentive much greater interest is taken in the regular school subjects and many special reports and exhibits for various classroom subjects are prepared by the pupils as leisure-time adventure*. This is par - ticularly -valuable to the rural school where keeping pupils occupied is a problem. . ... "The third adventure for the child is the choosing of home responsibilities and carrying these out successfully without having to.be reminded of his responsibilities. Some such home adventures for the children are helping with the home chores, such as washing dishes, making the beds, feeding the " chickens, milking the cows, putting away their own clothes, keeping their own room clean and orderly, caring for their pets, and such home interests as practising *hc various health rules, being courteous at home, attending some church service regularly. "Through Club discussions,' stories and plays, pupils are led to see that | taking their share of the home dunes is after all just an -adventure. 1 The C.uli encourages parents to commend their children for assuming and suc - cessfully carrying out these home responsibilities. "Service to others is encouraged through the Club plans. So that this will not be forgotten, a part of each meeting is given over to commendations; a vote of thanks is extended by the club to any individual who has done some - thing worthy of commendation. Committee work gives opportunity for many of these services which develop poiyer, initiative,' social and economic useful - ness. Many committees have been found helpful. "A Decoration Committee provides an opportunity for those boys and girls with special art ability to develop that ability and at the same time render service to their group. A Building Committee permits the older boys to make use ol their constructive ability. Ways of improving in courtesy are studied by the Courtesy Committee and presented to the group by them instead of by their teacher. Playground Committees have been found most helpful in de - veloping leadership and in organizing the pupils during intermission. Better health is encouraged by the Health Committee. Through the work of Library Committees reading tables, bookcases, and magazine racks have been made from orange crates; the llpmes have become interested in lending books and magazines to the school library and an increased interest in reading has been' i brought about. Civic Guard Committees emphasize the importance of pro - , tcctmg public property. A greater interest in birds has been developed through the efforts of a •Kindness to Birds' Committee and a keener appreciation of nature through a 'March of the Flowers' Committee. Thrift Committees have brought about a greater desire to make the best use possible of time and material. Other committees proving useful are Better English, Service, fcntertainmcnt. Museum, Safety, Order, Flag; and Scholarship. "Each pupil is permitted to keep on the 'stones' of an outline castle a record of his successful adveriturcs, in forming good habits, completing Icisurc - time activities, carrying out home responsibilities, and rendering service. Ihese are written on the stones by the pupil or a committee and the stone IS signed by the teacher, parent, or community worker. Each castle contains J3 stones so that the pupil may have an average of a recording once a week. "A large castle outline is kept on the schoolroom wall so that a record may be made of successful group adventures. In the working out of these grout) adventures problems arise which the pupils discuss and try to decide wha? is right and what is. wrong. Hypothetical cases are presented also so that ■ </seg>

"If desired, each child may have a badge' of memliership in the Club iicKinmn|f as a Page and advancing in rank as he completes each individual After careful consideration we decided to introduce the Knighthood ; of Youth into the state in a few counties on an experimental basis. The National Child Welfare Association offered to loan to Nebraska, Miss Daisy Simons, Assistant in Education for that Association, to in - troduce and supervise the experiment in the state. Many county superintendents volunteered to assist in introducing the plan into their respective counties. Miss Simons came into the state March 1, 1931, and between then and the close of the school year the program was introduced in Lancaster, Fillmore, Cherry,. Dawes, Sheridan, Scottsbluff, Deuel, Morrill, Garden, Keith, Gage and Pawnee counties. In each county special teachers' meetings were called and the program explained. The work was not compulsory, only those teachers who wished to do so introduced the program. Visits were made by Miss Simons to individual schools so that she might study the work of the pupils and teachers in the schools. At the close of the school year reports were called for from the teachers and superintendents of these experimental counties. The re - ports indicatd so clearly the helpfulness of the program in the problem of character education that the department decided to recommend it on a state-wide basis. Teachers need specific help in character education as well as in academic subjects. The department secured permission from the Na - tional Child Welfare Association to publish and distribute a Nebraska edition of the three Knighthood pamphlets which give this specific help, namely: A GUIDE FOR TEACHERS, KNIGHTHOOD OF YOUTH CLUB GUIDE, and THE PARENTS' PART IN THE KNIGHT - HOOD OF YOUTH. During the summer of 1931 these bulletins were edited in our de - partment, being planned particularly for our rural and village school conditions, using the results of our experiments in the several counties. With the opening of schqol in th« fall these bulletins were ready for distribution to all elementary teachers of the state. The county superintendents were informed in the fall of 1931 that the services of Miss Simons would be available to present the Knight - hood of Youth to the teachers and give whatever assistance seemed necessary. The response was most encouraging and showed the earn - est desire on the part of teachers for help in the teaching of character. During the year 1931-1932 Miss Simons was able to visit 4G counties. Meetings were held with teachers, pupils, parents and com - munity club organizations. The program was presented at the Ne- </seg>
            <seg id="p016">REPORT OP STATE SUPERINTENDENT braska State Teachers' Association meetings; the annual meeting of the Nebraska Congress of Parents and Teachers, and during the sum - mer of 1932 a short course of one week was given at each of the state teacher-training institutions.. With the Opening of the 1932-1933 school year a number of county superintendents not visited during 1931-1932 requested that the pro - gram be presented in- their' counties and those superintendents who had worked with the program for a year or more were eager to have help to more firmly establish the , work. Between the opening of school this current year and November 15, Miss Simons has visited 35 counties, thirteen of which are new counties not visited previously. The program has been presented again this fall at the meetings of the Nebraska State Teachers' Association, the annual meeting of the Ne - braska Congress of Parents and Teachers and the Nebraska Council of Religious Education. We have found that the Knighthood of Youth does not add a burden to the already overcrowded program of the rural and village teacher. Instead, the teacher is saved much time and worry because the Club program correlates with every subject. The Club adventure may be neatness and so neatness is stressed in each piece of written work. Having lessons prepared on time is encouraged by the Club choosing that problem as an adventure. Much special work for vari - ous subjects is done as leisure-time adventures. Thus interest in reg - ular subjects is increased. The Club provides an organization for class - room order, discipline, and pupil activities — children assuming many of the responsibilities formerly assumed by the teacher. It is a means of securing the cooperation of the home and the community so essen - tial to the success of the school. It is especially helpful to rural school teachers since the emphasis placed on both individual and group ad - ventures make it applicable in any size group from 2 pupils to 32 or more. Better cooperation with the home and community has been secured in our state and interest has been aroused by the Knighthood of Youth section in the weekly county newspaper. Each week a newspaper re - lease is supplied by the State Department. This is sent to the county superintendents who in turn distribute a copy to each of their county newspapers. Some papers devote space to reports from each club in the county. There is no charge for this service and the papers are willing and eager to cooperate with the schools in this way as they realize the importance of encouraging that which is socially desirable. A man in one of our Nebraska towns sent word to the school that he would like to award each group a stone in its castle because not one boy or girl had run across his lawn or molested his flowers during the school year, and in appreciation he sent a bouquet of lilacs to the school for each room. Thus, not only the school, but the home and </seg>
            <seg id="p017">OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION the community become the social group which sanctions that which is desirable. " . The following statements from a few superintendents, teachers and parents help to give an idea of the general attitude as expressed throughout the state as a whole: "In both rural and city schools the Knighthood of Youth is highly successful. It creates a fine Interest, has wonderful disciplinary power and is a splendid training in citizenship." — A county superintendent. "In supervising a character education plan in our schools I found our greatest problem was the lack of training of the teachers for definite work and the lack of a definite plan of procedure, one that was natural and not in the order of preaching. To my mind the Knight - hood of Youth Club when properly functioning is helping to correct the unnatural setting in our elementary schools. It places the teacher in the role of a guide and helper who directs the activities of the school room. It places children in life situations where they learn indepen - dence and self-reliance but at the same time consideration for the rights and feelings of others. Law observance and law enforcement become a habit of every day living. I feel this club has done more to bring cooperation between the home and the school than anything I have ever tried." — A county superintendent. "I can truthfully say that I feel a big change in my results in Character Education through the Knighthood of Youth club. The girls and boys really do the things about which I seemed to only talk before I introduced the club."— A rural teacher. "The Knighthood of Youth is the best character education plan I have ever seen. It appeals to the child. He learns through practice what he formerly was taught theoretically." — A grade teacher. "The Knighthood of Youth club has been a wonderful thing for our children and has changed the whole atmosphere of our home. The children are interested in everything, willing to do their share without complaints and the quarreling has practically ceased." — A parent. To help maintain interest from year to year the three Knighthood bulletins are used as a part of the character education course for the normal training high schools. This means that each year new teachers going into the field will have been trained in the methods and pro - cedure of the character education program in use in the rural and vil - lage schools of the state. The schools of Nebraska are trying to- face the problem of building character at this time of real stress and strain. They are recognizing the need for more directly emphasizing the building of ethical and moral qualities into our future citizenship. They are trying to do their part to constructively meet the pessimistic critics of our present day social conditions and help in setting at rest any feeling of doubt as to the effectiveness of our modern educational program. </seg>

            <seg id="p020">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Scientific Temperance Instruction Section 79-1409 of the Nebraska Statutes provides as follows: "Provision shall be made by the proper local school authori - ties for instructing the pupils in all schools supported by public money or under state control, in physiology and hygiene with special reference to the effects of alcoholic drinks and other stimulants and narcotics upon the human system." It is very clearly evident that this office has a very distinct func - tion to perform with respect to the proper enforcement of this statu - tory provision. This office has no apology whatever to offer for Its acceptance of this responsibility; neither does it apologize for what it has been able to do. In connection with the normal training bulletin dealing with physi - ology and hygiene, a great deal of material dealing with the teaching of harmful effects of narcotics was included, In compliance with the provision of the law quoted above. ' • The public schools have a responsibility in connection with the matter of scientific temperance instruction, first, because the law pro - vides that teachers must present lessons dealing with the harmful effects of alcohol and other stimulants and narcotics, and, second', be - cause teachers have a responsibility for the moral well-being and the . health of those who are, during the formative years of their lives, entrusted to their care. : With this thought in mind, the bulletins dealing with the teaching of the harmful effects of narcotics are being revised. May we express the hope that the splendid work which has been done by the teachers of Nebraska may be carried on with renewed vigor. Physical Education and Health The laws of Nebraska require that school children must receive a physical examination, either by the teacher or a physician, at least once each year.. If it is worth while to have our children examined in order to discover their physical defects, certainly it is vital that we sot up the most desirable program possible to the end that they may be kept healthy and free from defects. Our "Character Education" program is under way and already, tangible results may be' observed. The setting up of certain desir - able objectives in the field of Physical Education should prove a most valuable supplement in the development of the proper attitudes and ideals which form the basis for approved conduct on the part ot the ■'school child. Let our effort look toward a wholesome opportunity for physical activity for every boy and girl. There is a distinct economic' loss in developing a man or woman morally and intellectually with the physical side neglected, . so that they must labor, under a constant handicap. . </seg>
            <seg id="p021">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION There exists some difference of opinion among leaders In the Physi - cal Education field as to whether "health" Is an objective of Physical Education. We do not care to enter Into an extended discussion of this question, since, regardless of our opinion and in spite of these different points of view, the activities recommended by the different schools of thought are much the same. In any event, wholesome play activities and physical exercises properly directed and supervised most certainly do have a relation to health. Health may not be the chief objective but the fact remains that it Is very ltkely to be one of the results. Fortunately this office has been able to publish a most excellent bulletin on the subject of Physical Education. This bulletin which is one of the courses of study for normal training high schools is avail - able to county superintendents, to all persons responsible for the de - velopment of a program of physical education and health in the public schools, and to all normal training classes. Rural Education We have been working to interest people in the needs of rural education and equal educational advantages for the rural child. We are taking the rural school as it is and we are putting forth every effort to make it the best school that can be made. The teacher in the smallest rural school must appreciate that her task Is very im - portant and worthwhile. We must realize that we are dealing with the future citizens of a great commonwealth. We cannot wait for conditions that, if realized in the far distant future, may seem Ideal. We must deal with problems that we have to meet now. Today's work for the rural schools must be the best that we can make it. There seem to be abroad three or four erroneous Ideas with re - gard to rural education. First, there seems to be some sort of an idea that rural people are inferior to urban and city folks. Even the rural people sometimes appear to have developed an inferiority complex. Second, the Idea seems to prevail that rural life is lacking in rich - ness, pleasure, profit and social values; that the rural people are totally unable to help solve even their own problems; and that somehow the poor rurallst must be uplifted by a race of overwlse superior beings living, of course. In the towns and cities. Third, that the ruralist is a sort of social and economic outcast who is not even vitally interested in his own welfare. And, finally, that the rural schools are uniformly Inferior as com - pared with the schools of the urban and city centers. </seg>
            <seg id="p022">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Rural life, because of Its universality and geographical' spread, Is naturally much less coherent and self-conscious than any other section of American life. It should not be considered as separate and apart from urban and city life, but really as an important part of, or closely related to, the rest of the body politic. That the rural regions have always been a huge reservoir of labor, industry, genius and talent, from which business and commerce have recruited many of their brightest minds should be common knowledge to all. Every city in the land, every industry is honeycombed with posts manned by individuals who have had their beginnings, their education and their character formation" in the rural regions of the country. A very superficial observation of actual rural conditions in any part of the big state of Nebraska will show convincing proofs of a rural status of living, rich in all sorts of social, economic and cultural values. It is most unfortunate that a state of mind has come into existence, apparently common to many classes of society, that places the ruralist with his problems separate and apart from other groups of our social and economic life. Instead of this, the ruralist should be thought of not as an individual, separate and apart from the rest of the com - munity, but as an important part of the whole group with all his interests closely tied in and related to the interests of the other sub - divisions of the whole. The rural school along with other so-called rural problems has suffered in the development of this state of mind. That many deplor - ably weak rural schooW are to be found in the country today no one will deny; but it would be difficult to flnd rural schools any place worse than can be found in almost any city of the land. Urban and city schools have often assumed vast superiority as compared with rural schools. On the other hand, large numbers of rural schools can be found equal to the best that any city can produce. The large number of fine, up-to-date rural school buildings "now coming into existence are eloquent proof of that statement. The predominant factor in any situation is the teaching element. Given a finely trained, conscientious and enthusiastic teacher, whether she is working in a one-room sani - tary wooden schoolhouse or in some of the marble palaces of the city, you will find the results in the lives and the characters of the young - sters to be approximately equal. Nebraska is recognizing the import - ance of superior rural school teaching by presenting standards for better school teaching and awarding recognition cards to those teachers who show outstanding merit in the rural field. There has undoubtedly developed in the last twenty-five years a tendency to judge the value and worth of schools by the large salaries of the administrative officers and by the material out of which the buildings are built rather than by </seg>
            <seg id="p023">. OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION that fine and delicately poised relationship that exists between tha individual teacher and her little family of boys and girls. Some ol these times the rural mind is going to rebel and cast off this inferiority complex regarding rural schools and rural life in general and assert itself in politics, in business and industry, as well as in education. Agriculture, and that means rural life, is and always will be the basic industry upon which all the prosperity of this country rests. Self-consciousness and self-assertiveness of the rural mind when once aroused will speedily, put to rout the economic and business vul - tures of the country who may be, seemingly, perfectly willing to strangle the life out of any industry, agriculture included, in order to reap profit and larger dividends on money invested. in stocks and bonds. Present day conditions will convince the most skeptical of this need. Bird's-Eye Statistical View of Nebraska's One-Room Rural School Districts ii&lt; the Fall of 1032 The following tabulation shows the average assessed valuation, average mill levy for general purposes, and average mill levy for free high school tuition in nearly every county of the state. The grand average of these figures shows that the 1932 average assessed valua - tion for the one-room rural school district in Nebraska is slightly more than $222,000. The average levy for general school purposes is 4.36 mills during. the current school year (1932-33). The average levy for free high school tuition is 2.02 mills.

            <seg id="p026">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Rural Parent-Teacher Associations If our hypothesis, that the standard of the American school is based upon and has grown out of public opinion, has any merit, then the best way to improve schools is to cultivate, promote and vitalize public opinion relative to the schools in any particular community. The rural school is no exception to this principle. It is the Judgment of this department that the organization of rural Parent-Teacher Asso - ciations, officered and manned by the rural people themselves, is the proper place to begin to work for the betterment of the rural schools, in so far as they need betterment. We often hear of "the rural school problem." It is to be doubted whether or not there is any one rural school problem separate and apart from other school problems. Here, again, we have the inferiority complex at work. Proper stimulation of public opinion related to rural schools within the rural districts themselves will ultimately prove the solution of whatever rural school problem may exist. This is the procedure that has always worked in the city schools, and there is no reason why it will not work with equal success in the rural districts. . During the present biennium the department has done everything it could in cooperating with the state and national group of parents and teachers to promote rural parent-teacher association work. A specific report of this phase will be found later on in the Division of Rural Education. It is our belief that the schools of any community will rise no higher than the public opinion of the community demands. Child Welfare We mentioned above the department's attitude with regard to the organization of Parent-Teacher Associations. Briefly speaking, the National Congress of Parents and Teachers, whether city or rural in its application, is built around the idea of child welfare. The child - hood of the nation must be conserved, preserved, protected and edu - cated if future generations are going to do for humanity what we have a right to expect of them. Xorimil Training The State of Nebraska has, for twenty-five years, been committed to the program of providing in its high school normal training classes for the specific preparation of teachers for the rural schools. During these twenty-five years, the program has very definitely provided for a goodly percentage of the outstanding teachers in not only our rural schools but, in later years, for many of the best teachers found in our elementary graded schools. The high school normal training program has been a most salient influence in the raising of the standards of our teaching profession. </seg>
            <seg id="p027">OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION The position set forth with respect to the high school normal training program is one upon which the department has been absolute - ly willing to rely. The arguments favorable to the program as it has operated have been sound in every particular. This department has been untiring in its efforts to provide a program that has very definite - ly safeguarded the best interests of, the rural schools, themselves. It is- the thought of this department that we cannot at present bring about a revolution in our program of teacher training for the rural schools. The economic situation is such that our rural people, who have thus far been least considered in the teacher-training programs of our higher institutions of learning, have a right to expect and demand that the one and only program now provided and which does minister directly to their own best interests in the matter of education will be continued — at least, until such time as our ' higher institutions of learning have definitely reorganized their curricula and have pointed their work, as well as their faculty mind, towards the important task of preparing teachers for our rural schools. As has been so frequently stated by this office, it is not a question of high school normal train - ing or college training for the rural profession so much as it is a question of high school normal training or no training at all. We feel that- the ideal solution of the program lies very definitely in the direction of tapering off the program in the high schools, giving such time as is necessary to our higher institutions of learning to definitely organize and put into operation a distinct program of rural teacher training. As rapidly as this burden is assumed and as rapidly as we have justification for believing that our teacher-training institutions are specifically interesting themselves in a definite program for train - ing the rural teacher, just so rapidly, can we afford to lessen the pro - gram in our secondary schools. This statement must not be con - sidered in any way a criticism of the management of our state insti - tutions of higher learning. Their neglect to prepare teachers for the rural schools may be exactly the policy for them to pursue. We are not interested in a discussion of that point here. The material referred to in the special study on pages to very definitely Bhows that the high school normal training program has been a very positive factor in gradually raising the level of teacher preparation. In fact, the median or average preparation of our rural teacher is constantly tending to become higher. High school normal training has been an important factor' in this regard. We refer the reader to the facts and information supporting the argument for nor - mal training as indicated above. The argument that there is a surplus of teachers and that there are hundreds of persons waiting to. fill positions in our rural schools and that, for this reason, we can discontinue the program does not necessarily hold. Of the many hundreds of persons who would like to teach, even though it be in the rural schools, the greater percentage </seg>
            <seg id="p028">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT ot them are concerned with teaching in the rural schools only until such a time as they can find it possible to get into the graded urban elementary and secondary schools. These persons are neither, from the standpoint of specific training nor from the standpoint of their own personal attitude ready to enter upon rural school teaching. The people in our rural areas have as much right to expect a specifically trained teacher for the rural school as do our urban school districts. This department takes the position along side those other authorities in the field of rural education in stating that special training for the field of rural education is absolutely essential. In the interest, therefore, of the rural schools, themselves, we will con- ' tinue to support the high school normal training program for the preparation of rural teachers. Adult Immigrant Education The law making provision for the division of adult immigrant edu - cation in the office of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction was enacted in 1927, in response to a widespread demand which he - came insistent following the World War. That the educational advantages which were thus made available have been appreciated is evidenced by the response made by adult groups wherever and whenever conditions have made it possible to operate these special schools. . Very few of the schools have been maintained entirely by state funds. The funds available are not sufficient to set up a large num - ber of schools. However, the available funds when supplemented by appropriations from local boards of education and from various social welfare, patriotic and church groups do make it possible to establish schools which will contact a relatively large number of our adult Im - migrant population. Reference to the table which appears elsewhere in this report indicates that there is. a surprisingly large number ot foreign born within the state. Naturally, the biggest problem is to be found in the larger centers of population. However, there are many points throughout the state where there is a definite need for a pro - gram of adult education. State Institutions of Higher liearaing The unprecedented growth of attendance in the state supported In - stitutions of higher education in Nebraska has occasioned a very real problem for those in charge of their administration and supervision. The University of Nebraska at Lincoln and the four state teachers' colleges and normal schools located at Chadron, Kearney, Peru, and Wayne represent the state's interest in higher education. All ot these institutions have labored under many difficulties in recent years. These institutions have suffered because of inadequate physical plants and equipments. They have suffered too because of their in - ability to hold strong men and women in their faculties. </seg>
            <seg id="p029">OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Cooperation among the- higher institutions of learning and those agencies responsible for the state program of education it would seem is tantamount to the safeguarding of higher education. Church Schools The Department acknowledges the splendid cooperation which has been given by the officials in charge of private and church schools during the blennlum. It is our purpose to render every assistance possible to private and church school officials in making their schools the best of the kind that can be made, whether they be of elementary, secondary or collegiate rank. In the Nebraska Educational Directory, published by the State De - partment of Public Instruction each year, is found a tabulated report showing the accreditment, grades taught, number of teachers, pupils, daily attendance and other information, concerning the church schools of elementary and secondary rank. This directory also includes a list of the denominational colleges. The Junior College Law The board of education of the City of McCook, in 1926, was first in the state to set up upon its own prerogative a junior college pro - gram. In September of that year, the Junior college was opened for the purpose of extending to the high school graduates in and around McCook an opportunity to complete two years of college education un - der home influences and parental direction and, furthermore, an op - portunity for a larger number of young people to complete at least two years of college education that otherwise would have been impossible. The curricula and the administrative set-up very definitely provided for this aim. The courses offered were of a college rather than a high school level. The administrative and supervisory plans provided for a distinct faculty selected upon the basis of qualifications generally recognized as adequate for college Instruction. Two years later, the City of Norfolk made .similar provision for the establishment of a .Junior college. . Until the enactment of the Junior college law, passed in 1931, neither of these schools was operating with anything like a legal basis. About the only thing which insured the continuous operation of these institutions was the public opinion engendered in the communities, themselves. While it was true that there were many persons opposed to the measure, yet these did not, for the time being, do anything to embarrass the boards of education in these communities, being content to await legislative enactments. The opposition to the establishment of the Junior colleges based their position largely upon the fact that the state was already supporting adequate educational institutions In its university and teachers colleges and that these were well supple - mented by the efforts of the denominational colleges scattered through- </seg>
            <seg id="p030">REPORT OP STATE SUPERINTENDENT out the state. One of the chief objections to the final enactment of the law was that many persons felt that the Inauguration of a junior col - lege program would merely mean the saddling of additional taxes upon the people of the state to bring higher education nearer home. The first bill introduced in the legislature of 1929, authorizing the establishment of Junior colleges in certain qualifying school districts where the same were approved by the legally constituted voters, failed of passage. In 1931, however, a second bill was introduced authoriz - ing the establishment of junior colleges and providing for the organ - ization and the administration of the same. This bill was signed by the Governor of Nebraska on March 26, 1931. It was pointed out in an article "The Junior College Law in Ne - braska" by Mr. Charles Lindsay, now deceased and formerly the Dean of the Norfolk Junior College, that the law enacted exhibits conserv - ative tendencies. It provided, in Us sixteen sections, for authorization, organization, control, curriculum, finances, accreditment, matricula - tion, graduation, student reports, and the like. It provided definitely that any organization of a junior college must start with a petition from qualified electors as well as another from the local board of education, both of which are presented to the County Superintendent of Schools who, .having verified the signatures, submits the same to the State Superintendent of Public Instruction for his approval. The petitions having been approved by the State Superintendent, the Coun - ty Superintendent is authorized to call a special election in which the question of establishing a junior college is submitted to the voters for final action. The law further provides that sixty per cent of the votes cast must be favorable to the establishment of the junior college district. . ' Control is vested in a junior college board identical in membership and term of office with the board of education of the school district in which the junior college is established. A supervisory power is vested in the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, he being authorized to receive and examine certain reports and to set up cer - tain standards and regulations for the accreditment of such institu - tions. The law very specifically provides that the financing of the junior college program must lie entirely within the province of the local school district in which, the junior college is established, financial support being provided from both tuition and local school taxes. The tuition fee is not to exceed $108 per year per student. Whether or not the junior college law in its present form will properly safeguard the interest of the junior college program remains to be seen. It is too early yet to make any prophecy respecting the future of this type of higher institution of learning in Nebraska. Mr. Lindsay has pointed out thai whatever difficulties there might be in the law as enacted, it at least has the merit of lucidity. He stated </seg>
            <seg id="p031">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION further that the junior college organization is clearly possible under the law. He pointed out that in every step from district organization to suspension responsibility is lodged where authority is exercised. He held that the junior college district system adopted by the law appears to fit well into Nebraska's scheme of education. Under the present workings of the law, there are very few communities of suf - ficient size and wealth to fulfill the conditions of the law. These communities will, as quickly as circumstances permit, no doubt en - deavor to avail themselves of the advantages of this law. In conformity with the law as enacted, the cities of Scottsblufl and McCook have now taken all the step's necessary to the legalizing of their junior colleges. Each community has set up a program that is operating in accordance with the law. Norfolk and Grand Island have attempted to satisfy the legal requirements but have not yet been able to see their programs carried out. • Junior College Standards Under the authority of the law, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction has uet up the statement of standards for accreditment of junior colleges. The statement of standards which follows represents the results or very careful study. It also represents very serious ef - fort to create standards comparable to the standards of the several regional accrediting agencies and of such a nature as to commend them to other higher institutions of learning to which students from the junior colleges may go in later years for more advanced instruction. I. Definition A standard junior college shall be interpreted as being an institu - tion of higher education providing a collegiate curriculum covering two years above that of the secondary school curriculum (at least sixty [60] semester hours,, or the equivalent in year, term, or quarter credit). For its first year a junior college may be accredited with In - struction offered to the first-year students only. A semester hour is defined as one period of classroom work in leuture or recitation extend - ing through not less than fifty (50) minutes net, or their equivalent per week, for a period of eighteen (18) weeks, two periods of labora - tory work being counted as the equivalent of one hour of lecture or recitation. II. Admission ' - The junior colleges shall admit thereto the graduates of any ac - credited high schools in Nebraska or of other high schools recognized by a standard accrediting agency. Graduates of all other high schools and such other candidates seeking admission to junior colleges may be admitted by the president of the junior college upon the successful passing of proper entrance examinations as tet by- a committee on college entrance. </seg>
            <seg id="p032">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT The colleges shall require for admission at least fifteen (15) units, or their equivalent, of secondary work as defined by the Nebraska High School Manual, representing graduation from a four-year high school, or eleven (11) to twelve (12) units, or their equivalent, of secondary work earned in a senior high school or in grades ten' to twelve inclu - sive. These units must represent work done in a secondary school ap - proved by recognized accrediting agencies or by the result of proper' examinations. The major portion of the units accepted for admission must be definitely correlated with the curricula to which the student is admitted. Conditional admission may be authorized in the case of students who do not lack more than one unit as defined above. III. Organization • Junior colleges should provide, in accordance with the law, courses of instruction designed' to prepare students for higher institutions of learning; courses of Instruction designed to prepare for agricultural, industrial, commercial, home-making, and other vocations; and su,ch other courses of instruction as may be deemed necessary to provide for the civic and the liberal education of the citizens of the community. In all junior colleges the organization of the curricula should be such as to give evidence of the recognition not only of the preparatory function of these institutions but also of their popularizing, terminal, vocational, and guidance functions. The curricula of the junior college must recognize definite require - ments as regards the' sequence of courses. Coherent and progressive lines of study leading to specific achievement within definite fields must be characteristic of the junior college curricula. All junior col - leges shall adopt some system of numbering courses which will defi - nitely and clearly indicate the organization of subject-matter, the se - quence of courses, and the year in which each of these courses is given. The work of the junior college shall be organized on a college, as distinguished from a high-school, basis, so as to secure equivalency in prerequisites, as well as scope and thoroughness, of the work done in the first two years of a. standard four-year college in Nebraska, as recognized by the State Department of Public Instruction. Curricula should be so organized that students, upon the completion of the same, may, if they so choose, enter upon further professional or technical collegiate work in other higher institutions of learning. IV. Faculty The minimum scholastic requirement of all teachers of classes in a junior college shah be graduation from a college accredited to the University of Nebraska or other regional accrediting agencies, or the equivalent, and in addition thereto a Master's degree earned in a uni - versity or college recognized and accredited by a regional accrediting </seg>
            <seg id="p033">OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION agency, such work to be in the field of the subjects which they teach. All faculty members in the junior college should also show evidence of successful experience or efficiency in teaching. Scholarly achieve - ment and successful experience on the part of the instructional staff should be a factor in accrediting a junior college. . It is recommended that new teachers appointed to the staff of a Junior college should have included in their preparation at least thirty (30) semester hours of graduate work in the field, or fields, of their teaching Interests and for which they have made major or minor preparation including courses in education. All members of the junior college staff should include in their preparation such courses in edu - cation to the end that they may not only be specialists in their particu - lar fields of teaching but that they may also have a comprehensive view of the significance of the junior college in the whole scheme of American education. V. Teaching Load ■ . The teaching schedule of all instructors, including classes for part-time students, shall not exceed eighteen (18) hours a week. Fifteen (15) hours are recommended as the maximum. VI. Student Load Students registered in the junior college should normally not be permitted -to carry more than sixteen (16) credit hours of work per week, or its equivalent. Exceptions to this general statement may be permitted only upon the recommendations of the faculty. In no case shall a student be permitted to register for more than eighteen (18) hours per week: VII. Registration No junior college shall be accredited unless it has at least forty (40) students regularly registered in accordance with these standards. Of those enrolled, at least one-third should be in the second year. VIII. Graduation a) The minimum requirement for graduation from any accredited junior college shall be at least sixty (60) credit hours of work, as defined above, the grade and quality of which shall be equivalent to the work given in the freshman and sophomore years of any standard four-year college or university In this state. b) Graduation shall be evidenced not by a degree but by a diplo - ma or a certificate indicating the completion of a specific junior col - lege curriculum. IX. Libraries and Laboratories a) Each junior college should provide for a live, well-distributed and efficiently administered library of approximately three thousand </seg>
            <seg id="p034">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT (3,000) volumes exclusive of public documents and bound periodicals. In computing the number of volumes in the library, not more than fifteen (15) per cent should be allowed for duplication. For purposes ofi guidance, a distribution of books among the various classifications in approximately the following percentage is suggested: Class Subject Percentage 000 General, Library Economy Bound Periodicals 7.5 '100 Philosophy and Psychology 5 0 200 Religion \SZ""'~.'.'".".". 2.6 300 Sociology and Education 20.0 400 Language and i Philology .-. 2.5 500 Science 7 5 600 Useful Arts ; ."."~!."."!."L3!..."".... 7^5 700 Fine Arts ; """".I 5.0 800 Literature "!!:!"!

Each junior college should provide adequate facilities in the way of current periodicals appropriate to the academic, cultural, and pro - fessional needs of the institution. I b) There should be a definite annual appropriation for the pur - chase of current books and periodicals. Such appropriation should ap - proximate not less than three (3) per cent of the entire college budget for current expenses exclusive of capital outlay and such supplementary business operations as dormitories, cafeterias, and book stores. ■ I c) The library should be housed so as to provide reasonable safety from fire to the stacks; adequate provision for reading, reference work, and use of periodicals; accessions, cataloguing, and work rooms; librarians' quarters; reserve book and loan desk service; library methods classroom; and equipment necessary for efficient service In all departments of the library. 1 Laboratory and Shop Equipment.— Suitable laboratories, shops, and shop equipment for instructional purposes for each course offered shall be provided. X. Locution, Construction, and Sanitation or Buildings The location and construction of buildings, the lighting, heating and ventilation of the rooms, the nature of the lavatories, corridors, closets, water supply, school furniture, apparatus, and method of clean - ing shall be such as to insure hygienic conditions for students and teachers. </seg>
            <seg id="p035">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION XI. Records A system of permanent records showing clearly not only the secon - dary but the college credits of each student shall be adequately and carefully administered. All original credentials filed in the junior col - leges and received from other institutions as evidences of work already completed shall be retained in the files of the junior college. XII. Kxtrn-Currirulur Activities There should be provision for extra-curricular activities and abun - dant opportunity for development of leadership and initiative. These activities should at all times be properly administered by or with the approval of the faculty and administrative officers. Such activities should not occupy an undue place in the life of the junior college. XIII. Scjmrntion or College mill High-School Classes Students of the college, shall be taught in classes to which high - school students are not admitted whenever a senior high school, or a four-year high school, and a junior college are maintained together under one board of control and under a single administrative staff. XIV. Inspection The State Superintendent of Public Instruction or his authorized representative, or representatives (the state board of examiners), shall inspect not less than once each year each junior college seeking to be accredited. It shall be the duty of the president of the junior college to make under oath an annual report to the State Superinten - dent of Public Instruction upon such blanks as may be furnished from time to time by this official. Supplemental reports may, from time to time, be required. The State Superintendent of Public Instruction shall prepare and publish such standards and regulations as, in his judgment, seem necessary to the proper accrediting of junior colleges. All reports of inspections of junior colleges shall be made to the proper administrative officers and shall include recommendations as to the accrediting or courses of study offered by the junior colleges as may meet the standards and regulations as determined. XV. Term of Accreditation All junior colleges will be accredited annually and only when the evidences are such as to lead to the belief that the standards hereto - fore set up are being met. Under no conditions can a junior college be established under the provisions of the law as enacted by the legisla - ture meeting in 1931 prior to the academic year 1932-33. Preliminary steps leading to organization of junior colleges, as contemplated under provisions of Senate File No. 1, may Jje initiated at any time following ninety days after the adjournment of the legislature. </seg>
            <seg id="p036">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT XVI. Relations to Higher Institutions A junior college to be accredited by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction shall effect the necessary arrangements with recog - nized degree-granting colleges and universities of this state for the admission of its students and graduates to advanced standing in these higher institutions. Facts regarding such established relationships will be canvassed by the board of examiners in considering the application of each junior college for accreditment by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. Correlation of Educational Activities | A very short survey would show that there are at least seven or jight important lines of state and federal control of educational ac - tivities going on in the state. ' Each of these lines has its own separate governing board, its own overhead organization and expense. Some day citizens of Nebraska will awaken to the need of correlating these activities more nearly under a central and unifying control. Much Overlapping and contradictional work can be saved on the one hand, and much more definite and systematic progress on. the other. What js needed from the standpoint of business efficiency and. economy in state education is one centralized board of education having in control ind direction all of the state-supported educational agencies in the itate. Time may not yet be ripe for such a movement. f Dignity and Democracy of Iiabor j It is just possible that many parents in the past have been ambi - tious for their children tq have the opportunities of an education in order that the children might not have to work as hard as the parents have worked. The Department of Public Instruction does not take that attitude toward the whole problem of education. In a democracy like ours, the whole mass of people should be trained and educated for useful work and service to the social group as a whole. All of the material on curriculum and management that goes from this office will be predicated upon this purpose of education rnot to train the rising generation away from work, but to train them toward it. Work for everybody, with a high standard of living; but industry, work, and a busy life are the greatest blessings that can happen to any man or woman. Supreme Court Decisions Within the past few years several important decisions have been handed down by the State Supreme Court dealing with school problems. Without exception, these decisions have been in harmony with the general welfare of Che school system of the state. Among these decisions are the following: </seg>
            <seg id="p037">OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 110 Nebr. 459: "The taxing power of a school district is statutory and must be exercised within the terms of the legislative grant." 111 Nebr. 114: "The qualified electors of a school district have no power to change a schoolhouse site at any annual or special meeting of the electors of such district, unless notice shall have been given that such subject will be considered. • "The county superintendent may determine the location of school site only when no site can be selected by the electors of the district." 111 Nebr. 757: "It is competent for two or more adjoining common school dis - tricts, which are not able, or do not deem it expedient, to maintain a school oi more than eight grades, to unite for the purpose of form - ing one rural high school district, .notwithstanding the fact that such common school -districts comprise a part of a county hieh school district." 112 Nebr. 72J: "There is no authority to adjourn an annual school district elec - tion. "The power to accept resignation of a school board officer and to appoint his successor vests in the board of trustees after date of election." * Hi Nebr. 202: "After a school district has exercised the franchises and privileges thereof for the period of one year, its legal organization will be con - clusively presumed, whatever may have been the defects and ir - regularities in the formation or organization of such district. "The school system of our state recognizes the- vitally important fact that education is for all persons within such school age as has been fixed by the legislature. Obviously this priceless boon cannot be regulated by the number of pupils who may attend the district school. And if by chance there should be but one pupil of school age in any school district of this state, that pupil is entitled to the benefit of the school privileges which the law guarantees for the education of all the school children of the state." p. 205. 117 Nebr. 102: "A rural high school district annual tax levy, based upon an estimate adopted by school electors at a iriecting on the second Mon - day instead ol on the first Monday of June, as required by section 79-805, Compiled Statutes 1929, held void." 118 Nebr.

"False representation as to the term of his certificate held ground for recission of a school teacher's contract of employment. A school district need not show monetary damage to avoid a teacher 8 contract of employment if induced by teacher's fraud." 121 Nebr. 153: "The statute authorizes a county superintendent to transfer chil - dren to an adjoining district only on compliance with prescribed conditions. "Application for transfer of children to adjoining district held insufficient because not attested by a majority of the school board. 1 'Attest' in statute relating to transfer of children to another school district, means to certify to or vouch for the truth of state - ments in the application." 121 Nebr. 862: "A taxpayer may prosecute proceedings on behalf of a school district to have a deposit in an insolvent bank declared a preferred claim, where the district officers refuse to- act." </seg>
            <seg id="p038">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 122 Nebr. 454: "The state superintendent will not be required by mandamus to recognize a school district as a public school district entitled to share state trust funds created for secular public school purposes, if the only school in the district is sectarian, though organized and certified as a public school district. "This is an application for a peremptory writ of mandamus com - manding the state superintendent of public instruction to recognize the school in School District Number 6, Cedar County, relator, as an accredited high school and as a public school entitled to share by apportionment moneys belonging to the Nebraska school funds. "Relator averred that it was regularly organized as a public " school district many years ago and that it has ever since functioned as such ; that it shared state public school funds until respondent interferred with its right thereto; that the superintendent of public Instruction of Cedar county. duly certified to respondent data show - ing that relator is entitled to its share of the state public school funds. The application alleges facts sufficient to entitle relator to the writ, if School District Number 6, Cedar county, is conducting a 'common or public school/ within the meaning of those words as used in the Constitution and statutes relating to schools and school funds. "Respondent admitted the organization of relator as a public school district, but resisted the application for mandamus on the ground that relator is not conducting therein a public or common school. In substance,, respondent pleads in his answer that relator is conducting a religious, parochial and sectarian school to which state public or common school funds cannot legally be diverted or ap - portioned. "Evidence was adduced on both sides at considerable length. The district court found the issues in favor of respondent and de - nied a peremptory writ. Relator appealed. "Counsel for relator called attention to the facts that district number 6, Cedar county, is regularly organized as a public school district and that data entitling it to share state public school funds were certified by the county superintendent of public instruction of Cedar county to respondent. In this connection it was earnesty argued that the state superintendent of public instruction had under the law no alternative but to recognize relator as an accredited public school district and to make for its benefit the necessary apportion - ment of public school funds. It was argued that any use of the school or school building for sectarian instruction or religious ex - - - ercises inconsistent with a public school maintained at public ex - pense should be prevented by public authority without destroying the school district or depriving the pupils therein of their constitu - tional right to a public school education. "The nature of the school and the character of the funds which a peremptory writ ot mandamus would compel respondent to appor - tion to rclator for school purposes, are material inquiries. The high moral character, qualifications, courtesy, culture and refinement of. the teachers were recognized by respondent and by the witnesses who testified in his behalf on those subjects. Moreover, the build - ing in which the school is conducted is a commodious* substantial stone and brick structure admirably adapted to school purposes. "The school building is situated in a rural community six or seven miles from the post office at Fordyce -on a tract of approxi - mately 13 acres of land belonging to St. Boniface Parish of the Roman Catholic Church. In front, across a .highway, is a Catholic church. Not more than 150 feet away there is a parish house oc - cupied by the parish priest who has the care of the three buildings of the group — all church property. There is no other building near. Cut in stone, over the entrance to the school building, on top of which is a cross, is the name 'St. Boniface School.* "Relator, School District Number 6, Cedar County, docs not own a schoolhouse but leases from St. Boniface parish three rooms in its school building, 'two on the first floor and one- on the second, where pupils study, receive instruction and recite. Three teachers occupy living and sleeping rooms in the same building. In the base - ment there are a chapel and a kitchen. During the winter months the chapel is used for religious services conducted by the parish priest, where all pupils are permitted to attend. On the altar in the chapel there are statues and other emblems of the Catholic religion. As a custom, during the greater part of the school year the priest of the parish says mass in the chapel at 8 o'clock' in the morning. Before school opens for the day, pupils, while in the care of the school, march from schoolrooms to the chapel and there attend ritualistic services conducted according to Catholic faith and tenets. </seg>

Corrective Ijegislation Needed A study of the reports of the various division directors may reveal the need for some major school legislation. The discussion that will immediately follow, however, will involve minor changes of a correc - tive nature to enable existing Statutes to better carry out their true purposes. In each instance the number of the section refers to the Compiled Statutes of 1929. Correction No. 1: Section 79-205 should be amended so that the voter's oath will provide for two requirements that' are already speci - fied in Section 79-204; namely, the oath should state that " you are a citizen of the United States and that you or your spouse </seg>
            <seg id="p040">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT owns real property in the district or personal property in the district or personal property which was assessed in your or your spouse's name ". • • Correction No. 2: Section 79-213, passed by the 1921 Legisla - ture, automatically changed the "10 mills" and "10 per cent" in Sec - tions 79-216, 79-604, and 79-811 to "2 mills" and "2 per cent," and the "30 per cent," referred to in Section 11-904 to "6 per cent." Much difficulty would be avoided if these changes were made in the present sections. Correction No. 3: A study of the chapter in this report entitled "State Aid to Weak Districts" would Indicate that there are many worthy weak districts in the state whjlch do not meet all the require - ments outlined in Section 79-222. This matter deserves much study and consideration. Correction No. 4 : This office receives many inquiries as . to whether or not an officer of the district board may serve as Janitor or truck driver. Section- 79-310 should, perhaps, be amended to in - clude all employees of the school district as well as the teacher. Correction No. 5: Section 79-411 is so worded that in a good many rural districts of the state it is impossible to hire a teacher for the following year until after the annual meeting. Such a procedure, in part, accounts for the fact that there is a large teacher turnover in the rural districts of the state. A good many district officers move from one district to another during the -school year, usually around March 1, and this necessitates .an appointment of someone to fill the vacancy. Section 79-411 requires that the contract must be signed by "all members of the district board or by two members . . . whose terms of office extend beyond the date of the term of school contracted for." Correction No. 6: Since the county certificates were eliminated by House Roll No. 353 of the 1925' Session Laws, Section 79-1416 has become a dead letter and at present there is, apparently, no penalty for refusal to attend institute for teachers who hold certificates other than those issued to graduates of the elementary course of the .State Normals. There is room for constructive legislation as regards the whole institute problem. Sections 79-1411 to 79-14.16 should be re - vised to meet changed conditions. Correction No. 7: In many' small high schools in this state boards of education proceeded to contract with a high school teacher or teachers before the date of the annual meeting In 1932. At the annual meeting it developed that a majority of the school patrons did not wish to maintain a high school for the coming year. . However, it ap - peared that the district was liable for the teacher's contract even though the majority of the patrons did not wish, the high school to </seg>
            <seg id="p041">OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION continue. We believe the Legislature should make some provision for a petition in Article III and Article VI school districts that -would pre - vent the board of education making contracts which the district does not desire to fulfill, or planning a twelve year high school program When only a fen year high school program is feasible in the eyes of the annual meeting. NO DISTRICT IN THE STATE IS COMPELLED TO MAINTAIN A HIGH SCHOOL UNLESS IT WISHES. WE BELIEVE THE BOARD OF EDUCATION SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO AT - TEMPT TO DETERMINE THE WISHES OF THE LEGAL VOTERS OP THE DISTRICT IN THIS REGARD. Correction No. 8: The seventh portion of Section 79-104 should be amended to read "eighty thousand dollars" Instead of "fifteen thousand dollars." This "fifteen thousand dollars" became a part of the Statutes when assessments were made on the basis of one-fifth valuation. Correction No. 9: Section 79-123 should be amended so that the county superintendent would automatically become a "de facto" officer of any district where for any reason persons elected fail or refuse to qualify and the office is left vacant by the resignation of the old member or -his removal from the district. This emergency often arises and seems necessary in order to expedite business in many dis - tricts which can not be classed as "depopulated." Correction No. 10: Section 79-303 holds the record for causing more disputes than any other section of the school laws. The county superintendent almost invariably supplies the district director with Acceptance of Office blanks which it is expected the director will de^ liver to the person elected at the annual meting. In far too many cases it happens that when the dlrectbr is displeased with the choice, of the annual meeting he fails to hand the acceptance blank to the newly elected officer. Not one in ten' newly elected officers who have never before served on a district board is familiar with the requirement that the acceptance must be filed within ten days. We recommend that Section 79-303 be modified so that entering upon the duties of the of - fice will constitute acceptance of the office or so that the newly elected officer will not be required to file his acceptance unless the director has handed him the necessary blanks for that purpose. . Correction No. 11: It would seem that Section 79-311 should be sufficient on the subject of disputed accounts. However, it happens far too often in rural districts that the minority member attempts to clog the machinery by refusing to sign the warrant to pay the teacher's salary when the teacher elected was approved by the other two mem - bers but not by himself. Consideration should be given to some cor - rection here that will expedite business according to the will of the majority without the necessity of a lawsuit. </seg>
            <seg id="p042">REPORT OP STATE SUPERINTENDENT Correction No. 12: No district in Nebraska is compelled to main - tain a high school. There are five or six outstanding cases in the state ■where school district's are approaching bankruptcy because they are maintaining a much more extensive program of secondary education than good common sense would warrant. This office believes in the largest possible measure of local control in school affairs but in a few cases the elementary school program is jeopardized to such an extent that some sort of receivership should be 'set up by the Legislature to take entire control of the district's affairs until 'the local district gives evidence of its ability to manage itself. We suggest that under certain conditions three or five county officials should be designated as re - qeivers to act in lieu of the district board with instructions to forget about secondary education and maintain elementary education only until the district gets on its feet financially. Correction No. 13: In far too many cases local boards of educa - tion are voting salaries to themselves without the consent of the an - nual meeting. This is usually hot discovered until many months after the board members have received their salary warrants. Some sort of penalty should be provided for such action when the board usurps the authority of the annual meeting. Divisions In the succeeding chapters of this biennial report an attempt has been made by the various division heads to set forth the latest facts and information which it is felt not only the Chief Executive of the state but the Legislature and the school patrons need to have before them. Only those things which are of fundamental importance have been included. We have constantly sought to eliminate the unimpor - tant and irrelevant. As State Superintendent of Public Instruction we desire to express our appreciation to all those associated with us in carrying out the program for this department. More especially would we express our appreciation to the Deputy State Superintendent for the manner in which he has sought to carry out in a careful and conscientious man - ner our wishes respecting the administration and supervision of the state's program of education. We are particularly proud of the fact that the members of the staff are all persons of outstanding ability, unusual training, and of un - questioned character. The general efficiency and professional skill of our staff and many, assistants is exceptionally high. Whatever de - gree of success the office has achieved during the biennium Just clos - ing must be shared by the entire staff in this office. We are happy to have them share with us in our successes. . .' </seg>

            <seg id="p045">: OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION On November 4, 1931, this office directed the following letter to the holders of the registered warrants of these five districts. Ladies and Gentlemen: . . &lt;I ? &lt;: . SP*™*} Session of the Legislature, on June 20, 1931, passed House Roll No 5 which included a special item of $10,000 in the appropriation of the State Department of Public Instruction, with the following wording, which happens to be the only law bearing on the subject: •* ■ "Fixed Charges, Aid to Schools $110 000 00 Provided, however, that $10,000.00 shall be used to pay the debts of ' weak districts containing less than twelve sections, of land and having an assessed valuation of less than one hundred thousand dollars on condition that said district or districts present satisfactory evidence that the entire territory of same has been permanently attached to a neighboring district or districts; amounts of said debts to be as of July 1, 1931." ' ■ \ou will note that there is.no method of administration or procedure indicated nor is there to be found in the Statutes any sort of law directly bearing on the sub - the belt 'of r its r&lt; abnit Om&lt;:S th&lt;! dl " y ° f th ' S ° ffiCe tO administcr the appropriation to Various county superintendents and county treasurers- have been contacted by this office. We wish to express our appreciation of their fine courtesy in helping us get various data necessary in the problem. "raping us .u According to information received from them and from the records in this office, the districts listed on page 4 are the ones most eligible in the facts of financial struci ture and time of complying with provisions of the law, to be considered in this ap - propriation. Careful investigation and study of the situation shows the facts re - garding t tnene school districts, as given on page 4. ' It will therefore be seen that: 1. $10,000 will not cover either the principal or the principal and interest com - oinca. 2. It is practically impossible to choose between these districts in such a way as to bring to a point within the appropriation either the principal or the principal and interest combined. According to our calculations, these five districts have a total registered warrant indebtedness of $10,227.04. . ■ a' Ther ? is , no source from which we can get money to add to the $10,000 A question for each one of you warrant holders, individually, to answer to this olnce at once, is whether or not you are willing to surrender your warrants on the basis of approximately 97.78% of their face value or principal' (without interest) thereby making it possible to break up these district, and enabling the." territory to be annexed with the other districts willing to receive them • . We - a c no word of , crit i c , ism , 'or th ese districts. They have fought a noble fight in their effort to comply with the law and give their children some sort of school privileges. I think we will all agree, however, that the financial set-up herein in - dicated does not constitute good business procedure as a long-run policy for a school district with such low valuation. In making this appropriation, the Legislature un - doubtedly wanted to do something constructive to help these districts out of their financial difficulties. No one is to blame for the fact that there is not enough money to go around and pay off these obligations in full with interest. As a matter of fact there ate other districts in the state that could and would qualify in time if sufficient money were available. Any warrant holder in any one of the districts can hold up the procedure for the whole district. Surrender of these warrants on this proposed basis is purely a vol - untary matter on the part of each individual warrant holder. This office cannot legally pay out any money to any warrant holder in any district until satisfied that all warrant holders in that district are willing to surrender the warrants In case any warrant holders in any district should be unwilling to surrender their warrants, it will then become necessary for this office to arbitrarily put out of the picture one or possibly two of these districts, which will mean that the warrant hold - "■» l !L r C dlstricts i vlU no' receive any money from the state on this plan, and will therefore have to depend upon the district itself to liquidate the indebtedness. Judging from a very superficial observation of the table given on page 4 which shows the .financial structure of these districts, it would apparently be a goodly num - ber of years before the owners of these warrants would receive any appreciable concerned m °" ey °" the warrants as . '« as the efforts of the districts themselves are We have a State Supreme Court Decision in Nebraska which indicates that holders of warrants may not demand .the liquid proceeds of the school year by year to the £&amp;£?* o' hindering the operation of the school. The case we refer to is State, ex rel William P. Collins. Relator, vs. O. W. Gardner, Treasurer, et al.. Respondents Ne - reads^s follow,- "' PaBe IM- The Part ° f the d ««ion. bearing on the point "Mandamus will not compel school district officers to appropriate and set apart the entire revenue of the district for general purposes to the payment of reg - istered warrants, if the effect will be to close the schools and deprive the chil - dren of the district of a common school education, but will require such officers </seg>
            <seg id="p046">REPORT OP STATE SUPERINTENDENT to set apart so much of said fund as is necessary to maintain a common school for the shortest time provided by law and at the least possible expense, and use the remainder of the fund in payment of such warrants in the order of their registration." It is evident that there would be very little money left in these districts after providing for minimum school privileges. " ■ This office, therefore, is pleading with each and every warrant holder for com - plete cooperation. We dislike very much to be put in a position where we are com - pelled to even suggest the acceptance of any amont less than the total amount of the indebtedness. Our hands, however, are very definitely tied by the limitations of the situation over which the office has no control and for which it can assume no responsibility other than a faithful administration of the matter within the limits of the possibilities of the situation. If you, as a warrant holder, are willing to surrender the warrants which you hold, at approximately 97.78% of- their face value, kindly execute the inclosed statement and forward it to this office at your earliest convenience. This office will move as rapidly as possible under the circumstances, considering the amount of detail involved in the procedure and the number of officials and individuals concerned. We arc inclosing herewith a list of the names and addresses of the warrant hold - ers in the five districts involved. Very respectfully yours, CHARLES W. TAYLOR, Estate Superintendent. After a long series of correspondence with the individual warrant holders, the debts were paid- in accordance with the provisions of the above ' letter. The five districts referred to ceased to exist. The county superintendents concerned all reported that this was a godsend to the individual districts concerned which alone made it possible for the children in these districts to receive the privileges of a common school education during the school year 1931-32. The neighboring dis - tricts would never have accepted them while they were in debt. Ton of the Weakest School Districts in Nebraska The districts listed below may not be the ten weakest districts In the state, but a hurried survey by this office indicates that they are. If the children of these districts are to continue to receive the privi - leges of a free common school education, which the Constitution re - quires, either these districts must be joined with neighboring districts or else they must receive state aid annually. Wherever possible It Is best to close up the affairs of the districts permanently, rather than to allow them to continue year after year. They cannot unite while they are so badly in debt, and their area is too small to receive state aid under the present law.

Provisions of the Present St«U&gt; Aid Ijnw . The principle of distributing- state aid to weak districts has been accepted by the Nebraska legislature since 1907 when Sections 79-222, 79-223, and .79-224 were enacted. These three sections of the statutes recognize on a small scale the principle of equalization of educational opportunity. ' ■ The statutes referred to above specify that in order to be eligible' to share in the state aid appropriation a district must (1) have an area of at least 12 sections of land for each school maintained in the district, and, ( 2 ) must have Voted a levy of 8' mills or more. . Districts meeting the above and other minor requirements are entitled to receive aid on the following basis: . The amount produced by an 8 mill levy plus the estimated ap - portionment due the district (provided it is entitled to share) plus the amount of money on hand constitutes the estimated available funds. The estimated available funds shall be deducted from the esti - mated current expenses for the district, and the district shall be entitled to receive the difference between the two. If the estimated available funds exceed the estimated current ex - penses, the district is not entitled to receive state aid. The maximum estimated expenses cannot exceed: - $1,000 in districts with 10 or more children between the ages of 7 and 16; $700 in districts with from 5 to 10 children between the ages of 7 and 16; or $120 per child in districts with less than 5 children between the ages of 7 and 16. As seen by the essential features of the law outlined above. It. is specified that the districts "which receive this aid are in sparsely settled parts of the state where assessed valuations are very low. The 1932 assessed valuations of the 227 districts in 27 counties which received this aid in December, 1932, average $57,532. Of the 227 districts receiving this aid in December, 1932, 163 dis - tricts have a current net debt. These 163 districts had a net average of $635 each in outstanding warrants on June 30, 1932. </seg>
            <seg id="p049">OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION ■ . . Recommendation No. 1 While it is true that all districts receiving state aid have a current mill levy of 8 mills or more, some of the above 163 districts which are In debt are not making a sufficient levy to pay off these outstanding warrants. Even though they receive state aid, the aid plus the amount produced by an 8 mill levy goes to pay current expenses only. This office recommends that the state aid law be modified to re - quire districts which are in debt to levy a reasonable amount above the 8 mills in order to retire tliis indebtedness. When the indebtness is retired no current expenses are necessary for the payment of interest on outstanding warrants. The amount of state aid would therefore be reduced. Recommendation No. 2 The present state aid law allows districts to estimate current ex - penses as high as $1,000 if they have 10 or more pupils. In a few outstanding examples, certain districts which have been and are now receiving state aid hire a teacher at a salary much higher than the average salary paid in the same county by districts which are entirely self-supporting. An investigation of one or two of these cases has shown that the teacher receiving this salary is a relative of one of the board members who had evidently influenced the other board members: into paying a higher salary because the state aid fund would have to foot the bill. This office therefore recommends that the estimated ex - penditure for teacher's salary for each individual district applying for state aid shall in no case exceed the average salary paid by self-sup - porting one-rooin rural districts in that county during the preceding, school year. • Recommendation No. 3 The reasoning under Recommendation No. 2 leads us to further recommend that the estimated expenditures for purposes other than teacher's salary shall in no case be higher than the average amount expended for such purposes by self-supporting districts of that county during the previous year. If the present state aid law were modified according to the three recommendations above, a material saving would be made in the amount expended to. weak districts. The money saved by these three recommendations would be sufficient to provide for Recommendations No. 4 and No. 5 which foUow: Recommendation No. 4 In the fall of 1932 the "Deputy State Superintendent in company with County Superintendent Catharine Tunberg visited Rural School </seg>
            <seg id="p050">REPORT OP STATE SUPERINTENDENT District No. 153 of Knox County. On the date of this visit 22 of the 23 pupils enrolled were in attendance. The district Is best described by County Superintendent Tunberg's letter of October 3, 1932, which reads as follows: "I am writing you in regard to- a very weak district in my county. This is District 15J of Knox County. There are SJ-i sections in the district. The valuation is approximately $47,430. At the last annual meeting they voted a levy of 14 mills. "This district is paying their teacher *a salary of $60 per month for a 9 months' term. I do not think that they will have to buy. much fuel as the people will no doubt donate their work toward getting a supply of wood. At any rate the best they can do will be to run their school on something over $600 for this year. "The teacher has been having a very difficult time getting her' warrants cashed. She has had to discount them considerably and now it is. almost im - possible to sell them -even at a big. discount as no one cares to buy warrants from a district that is so deeply . in debt. (Note — Annual Report shows $2, - 122.67 in outstanding warrants on June 30 t 1932.) "This schoolhouse is well situated in a very .nice place. It has a good spring for water supply. The enrollment is large-, about twenty-three pupils, so it would be impossible for them to join with any other district. All of the surrounding districts have large enrollments also so it would not be practical to add to their enrollments. There are several other reasons why dissolving the district would not be practical. One reason is that the land in this district is very hilly with an abundance of cliffs, ravines and streams so the roads do not follow the section lines but must be built wherever it is possible to build them. For this reason some of the children would have an unreasonable dis - tance to travel to school. "In view of these facts I see no way in which they can remedy their con - dition or lower their debt, which is now about $2,200, unless the state will see fit to give them some state aid." An actual visit to this district and several other districts by the Deputy State Superintendent in the fall of 1932 convinces this office that under such conditions it is necessary to" maintain a school in a district which has such low valuation even though it has only five and one-half sections of land. Transportation elsewhere is impossible and prohibitive in cost. For a child to go to school in a neighboring dis - trict^ would require many miles of travel in some cases. It is impos - sible for a child to travel "as the crow flies." A long, circuitous path would be necessary. In the particular situation described above, the enrollment In neighboring districts is so large that union would hardly be advisable. The State Superintendent's Office believes that School District 163, Knox County, is as morally deserving of state aid as the average dis - trict which was granted state aid in 1932 under the present law. It does not qualify under the present law because it lias less than 12 .sections of land. Similar situations are described by County Superintendent Harry "Weekly of Custer County in his letter of October 6 to this office, which reads as follows: "My- chief criticism of Sections 79-222, 223, and 224 of the school law is* the clause requiring 12 sections of land in order to qualify as a weak district. The ' -. law thus defeats its own purpose (aid to weak districts) in our hill country -where the canyons are long and deep with a 'hogback* between them. </seg>
            <seg id="p051">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION "Take 12 sections of such land and flatten it out and it would no longer qualify as a weak district because it would then become valuable farm land. In 12 sections of such country, people on opposite corners have often never heard of each other. They might as well be SO miles apart. We have some of this kind of country in Custer County. It is good for hay and grazing and furnishes home for many good people but its valuation is too low to support the kind of schools these people deserve. "On account of the lay of the land, the roads generally run north and south for long distancts with no crossroads. Hence the districts must be small and the valuations correspondingly low. These are weak districts in every sense of the word but not of sufficient area to qualify for state aid under existing laws. "Perhaps as good, examples as any of this condition in Custer County are our Districts 175 and 261 located side by side in this type of country. Each has bVi sections of land. The former district has a valuation of $47,800 and the latter $63,400. The 2 schoolhouses are located 2Vi miles apart on an east and west line, yet they are W/a miles apart by open travelled road. Since it would cost thousands of dollars to put roads through this kind of hills, district union is not feasible. "Other examples of such contiguous districts are our Districts 168 and 247, with 8 and 9 sections of land and valuations of $69,000 and $75,700 respectively. Although these districts are slightly larger there is no hope for union. The schoolhouses are only 3 miles apart on an east and, west line across deep canyons but they are \TA miles apart by open travelled road." The State Superintendent recommends that the present state aid law be modified so that, the school districts described above 'would qualify even though they have fewer than twelve sections of kind. The money saved by Recommendations 1, 2, and 3 would be sufficient to carry out this recommendation. Recommendation No. S . . Another situation not adequately met by the present state aid law is found in several districts, most of which contain more than 12 sec - tions of land, but do not qualify for state aid because too few pupils are enrolled. (The present state aid law will allow a maximum esti - mate of expenditures of only $120 per pupil in districts with less than 5 children between the ages of 7 and 16.) Because of the contour of the land it is often mandatory to main - tain a school for only one or two pupils. Transportation to neighbor - ing districts would cost more than the hiring of a teacher in the home district. This situation is better described by a letter from Mrs. Rose D. North, County Superintendent of Lincoln County, who wrote to this office on October 17, 1932, as follows: , "District 113 is composed of 10 sections of land with a valuation of $45,145. There are .13 children on the' census with 6 of compulsory school age. The levy this year is 14 mills general; plus 3.5 free high school. The country is sand hill and canyon country so cannot be joined to other districts. Under the pres - ent law the district cannot receive state aid because it is a district composed of less than 12 sections. They could not receive much even if this clause were changed because they would not be expected to have expenses over $700. "District No. 100 is composed of 22 sections with a valuation of only $50,865. There* are 6 children on the census with only 2 of compulsory school age. The levy is 12 general, and 3.5 free high school. While this district is large enough to draw state aid, it is not supposed to need more than $120 per pupil or $240. These children are . at least 6 miles from the nearest school in a neighboring district, and to reach the same they would have to travel part of the way in the sand hills and part of the time along the bank of the Birdwood Creek — a trip which is possible only during part of the year; </seg>
            <seg id="p052">REPORT OP STATE SUPERINTENDENT "District No. 116 is another case similar to the above. The area is 24 sec - tions, all in the sand hills, with a valuation of only $53,500. The levy this year totals 16.5 mills with* 8 children on the census and 4 of compulsory school age. This district could not disband nor could it transport its pupils. " "District No. 91, a sand hill district, has an area of 30 sections, valuation of $53,565, levy 19.5 mills, census 9, with 8 children of compulsory school age. This district cannot receive state aid because with only 8 pupils between the ages of 7 and 16 their estimated expense is not supposed to be more than $700." The State Superintendent recommends that the present state aid law be modified to better provide for districts which must maintain a school even though there are less than five children in attendance. The money saved by Recommendations 1, 2, and 8 would be sufficient to carry out this recommendation. . • " .-'.'•■ Further Opinions of County Superintendents Relative to Recommendations 4 and 5 In addition to the three letters quoted above as arguments for Recommendations 4 and 5, we quote the following letter from County Superintendent Paul R. Carpenter of Rock County, written under date of October 7, 1932. ■ _ . • ' . . ■ ■ "We have 3 or 4 districts in Rock County which are badly in debt and are still too small in area to be eligible for receiving state aid. These districts are un regrettably possessed of many children of school age, necessitating -the maintaining of the minimum of school, but they are unfortunately possessed of very little taxable property. I will review the problems encountered in two of these districts : "District 53, Rock County, has only 9 sections, of land, 3 sections short of qualifying for state aid. The 1932 school census shows 17 children between the ages- of 5 and 21, living in _ the district. Eleven of these are of the com - pulsory school age. The law says that this district must have 9 months of school each year if such can be maintained by an 8 mill levy. The district has striven to maintain the standard required by law and has consistently voted tax levies during -the last 7' years ranging from 8 to. 14 mills but in no case less than 8 mills. ■ "The total valuation of all taxable property in the district was $34,565 for 1931. Since then the values have depreciated, quite in keeping with the de - preciation .elsewhere, until the valuation for the present year is only $27,150. Eight mills spread upon that amount of property will raise only $217.20 pro - viding all taxes are paid, and not all of the taxes will be paid this year for over 50% of the taxes for the past two years remain unpaid and the same condi - tions still exist. It is not likely that more than $100 in school tax money will be paid during this school year on the present school year levy. "This $217.20, or as much of it as is available, must perform a miracle. It must pay a teacher for her services in teaching; jt must buy coal for heat - ing the schoolhouse; it must .pay for needed supplies, repairs, and insurance; and it must retire a registered warrant occasionally which has run an average of 5 years and which has interest added thereto in the amount of 30% of the principal value. This is what the $217.20 must do in order to start getting the district out of debt. "Since the funds available for maintenance purposes are less than the cost of maintenance, the district has been running behind more and more each year. The present indebtedness is $2,745, 10% of the district's total assessed valuation. The indebtedness is now $113 greater than a year ago. If money for current expenses could be raised, and the registered -warrants neglected for the time being, the interest on these outstanding warrants would fetter the district at the rate of $164.70 per year. </seg>
            <seg id="p053">OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION "Suppose the people of the district were to tax themselves the maximum allowedby law, 20 mills, what could -then be accomplished? This would be a tax oi Z% of the value of the property upon the property, a tax greater than the returns upon the investment in any of the lands of the district. The land is ""natur "" ' an&lt;t ' The taX would be little " hort of «=onfiscatory "We will continue to suppose that the 20 mills was levied and that all of the tax money was paid. How fast will the district fly out of debt? The treasury would be temporarily $543 richer. We can add to this amount «0 derived from state^apportionment, making the total sum $603'. Suppose they ply their teacher $45 per month. A 9 months' term will cost $405 for teacher - hire. To this we must add $50 for fuel and at least $30 for books, repairs in - surance, and- supplies, making a total of $485. There will be! $118 remaining with which to pay registered warrants and accumulated interest. However, run behind at the rate of $46.70 per year. It could cut down the school term to i 8 months, and break even or it could cut down to 6 and save $100 with wluc-h to pay indebtedness.

            <seg id="p054">REPORT OP STATE SUPERINTENDENT "District 16, Rock County, has an area of 10J4 sections or V/» sections too few to be eligible for receiving state aid. Its valuation 6 years ago was $37,295. The valuation has shrunken year after year until it is $24,955 for the present year. The shrinkage from 1931 to 1932 was nearly 20%. While the value of the taxable property in the district ' has been steadily shrinking, the number of pupils and the cost of .maintaining school has been steadily increasing. There were 7 pupils and no debt 8 years ago; there are now 13 pupils and a debt of $861.08. ■ "When it became apparent a year ago that the district could no longer run even with the boards, it concluded to dissolve and unite with it neighbors. The two or three districts .to whom parcels were offered refused on the grounds that they had very little or no debt and did not care to shoulder District 16* s debt, and also that remuneration fur transportation would eat up all that they might receive in taxes from the acquired territory. "District 16 has valiantly gone ahead to employ a teacher and to make the best of a bad situation. It became apparent after a run of dry years and crop failures and a shrinkage of crop prices that the people could not meet the habitual levy of 12 mills and accordingly they voted for 10 mills last spring. However they failed to post notice of their intention to vote more than 8 mills and the county board was forced to levy -only 8 mills. This mill levy spread upon a valuation of $24 1 955 will raise, only $199.64 if all of the taxes arc paid in, but not more than half of this amount is likely to be paid. Let us add $70 which is the probable amount of the apportionment, and we have $270 available for use. Paying a teacher $45 a month for 7 months will take $315. Other expenses will increase the requirement to $400. It is now apparent that the district will have to go at least $200 further in debt before the end of -the fiscal year. The total indebtedness will mount beyond $l t 000 and the neighbors will lose still more interest in the division of its territory. "While District 16 has invited dissolution, it has done so as a second choice. If it were not for the debt and the general dificulty of making ends meet when out of debt, the district would prefer to remain a single district. The district is compact, the schoolhousc is centrally located, the teacher .has a moderate group, and no one has far to go to reach the schoolhousc. "Whatever will solve the problem of District 53 will probably also solve the problem of District 16, but one district will need as much assistance as the other. A lowering of the area required to qualify districts to receive state aid would help both districts. Placing the minimum at 12 sections may have been to encourage consolidation, but consolidation .into very large districts is im - practical with us. Our roads arc too pour and too few, our land is too arid and lacking in tax value, and our territory is too sparsely populated, but we have the. children to be educated and something worthy should be done." We quote the following from a letter of September 16, 1932 written by County Superintendent Edward F. Sime of Garfield County: "District 3, Garfield County, has always been the source of ray greatest worry. This district is not large, .having an area of only 7% sections. For six years I have attempted to secure at least 4)$ sections from the three neighbor - ing districts to enable District 3 to secure state aid but so far I have not been successful. "The latest assessed valuation is only $37,015. Because of the depression, the levy was reduced from 14 to 8 mills which means that the entire district will raise less than $3C0 for the maintenance of the school. "At the present time their indebtedness is $900. Last year it was $1800 but the district was able to cut this amount in half. The district was benefitted in the amount of .$900 by the county audit of last year. The treasurer had embezzled this amount during a 10 year period. "The present enrollment is 8 but the number of pupils usually ranges from 15 to 20. "Up to the present time it has been difficult for the teacher to sell her warrants as it meant a four-year period from the date of issuance to the date of payment. "Union with neighboring districts is not feasible as this would mean too . Rrcat a distance to the various schools* nor do any of these other districts wish such a union since the cost of mileage to these districts would be far more than the levy would bring from such added territory.

Final Conclusions of this Office A careful study of the situations described above, together with similar situations, brings this office to the conclusion that any dis - trict which is willing to levy 8 mills to support a one-room rural school is Just as entitled to receive state aid as the districts which have more than ten pupils and more than 12 sections of land. If they can trans - port their children to a neighboring district by levying less than 8 mills, they will be glad to do so, if this is possible and practicable. </seg>

            <seg id="p079">OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Aid Under the Muller.r Act (Section 70-810, 70-2400) In 1927, the difference of $1,176.00 between the $50,000 appro - priated and the amount of state aid to weak districts gave the Mallery Act schools only about 9% of the $13,050 to which they were entitled under Sections 79-810 and 79-2409. In 1929, 1930 and 1931, the $50,000 appropriated was not suffi - cient to give all of the districts qualifying for state aid the full amount In 1932, $367.00 remains to be distributed among the Mallery Act schools. We presume that they are entitled to the same amount as shown by the table on page 79. The reason that there is a little" money for the Mallery Act schools this year is due to the fact that the state aid needed by the school districts of Garfleld County was much less than in former years, due to the recovery of some school dis - trict money from the surety company which had bonded the county treasurer, who was in default. We are informed by the county super - ntendent of Garfleld County that his application this year is much less than in former years, and much less than can be expected in the future. Back in 1921-23 the legislature appropriated $75,000 for Aid to Weak School Districts, that is, the one-room rural schools, and $30 000 for the Mallery Act schools. The legislature next following lumped these two appropriations together and increased the amount to $110,000 under one item. This was really a misnomer The weak one-room rural schobls in the sandhill. region present one kind of edu - cational problem, and the Mallery Act schools, another. The desire of the state to encourage Home Economics and Agricultural work in con - solidated rural schools, which is the idea of the Mallery Act, is quite another sort of educational problem. From the legislative session of 1923 to the present time, the one appropriation, Aid to Schools, has been supposed to take care of the Mallery Act schools also As a matter of fact, the wording of the law is such that the Attorney Gen - eral has advised us to spend all of that appropriation for Aid to Weak School Districts as long as it was demanded for such schools with the idea of dividing what might be left among the Mallery Act schools For three years now we have been unable to distribute any funds to the Mallery Act Schools and we have not even had enough money in this fund to take care of the weak rural schools. In our opinion the state has a moral obligation either to appropri - ate money for these Mallery Act schools or to repeal the law These schools- have made the capital outlay investment as required by Sec - tions 79-810 and 79-2409 and have spent other money in good faith expecting to receive the reimbursement from the state which the Statutes promised them. </seg>

However, within the past few years, there have been several lawsuits In which the decision hinged upon whether or not the official form was used. The list of official forms which follows is in no sense a complete list of all the forms that are needed for the transaction of school busi - ness in the state of Nebraska. However, it is a complete list of all the forms which this office has adopted as official. We shall add to this list from time to time. Legislative enactments and court decisions may cause us to make changes from time to time. . . In some cases there are printed forms in existence which serve the purpose as well as those listed as official. This is perhaps true in all cases until the matter gets into court. If a court question at issue should hinge upon whether or not the official form was used in the transaction, it would be fortunate for a litigant to be able to testify that he had used the official form, or one substantially the same as the official form. This office is open to suggestions for. changes in these official forms, whether they come from school officials, lawyers, or other school patrons. They were compiled by Fuller L. Austin, Deputy State Superintendent of Public Instruction, who acknowledges many excel - lent suggestions from a variety of sources. Special recognition is due George W. Ayres, Assistant Attorney-General, Mr. Ralph Lawrence, State Bond Examiner, and County Superintendent W. T. Poucher of Burt County. - i Until further notice the following are hereby .adopted as "Official Forms" by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, this first day of December, 1932. Whenever it becomes necessary to make alterations or additions to this list, county superintendents will be at once notified of the same. CHARLES W. TAYLOR, . State Superintendent of Public Instruction. December 1, 1932. </seg>

Citizens of Nebraska have provided educational privileges to the childhood of the state. The rural school problems, objectives, and achievements in Nebraska are not only of vital, interest to the rural sections of our state but affect all of Nebraska whose basic occupation is agriculture. The importance of the rural schools in Nebraska may well be appreciated when the number of rural school pupils is considered. There are 100,539 pupils enrolled in 6,136 one-teacher rural schools in Nebraska. In addition, there are 9,099 pupils in the elementary grades of the approved non-accredited high schools and 3,582 pupils in the high school grades of the approved non-accredited high schools (1931 and 1932 reports). In addition to the enrollment listed above, there is a large enrollment of rural pupils in consolidated schools in the open country and small villages. A. report of these rural pupils in accredited schools will be included under the Division of. Secondary Education. The Division, of Rural Education contributes to the work of the pupils and teachers of the elementary grades in the accredited schools by the Course of Study for Elementary Schools of Nebraska. OBJECTIVES For the past six years a continuous program has been carried out consistently in the rural schools and the State Department, county superintendents, school officers, and other agencies have made un earn - est cooperative attempt to improve each objective each year. The work of the Division of Rural Education is to give particular help to county superintendents, school officers, and teachers in formulating and developing county-wide progressive school programs that will result in improvement of rural schools, more efficient teaching, standard and superior rural schools,- improved equipment, and greater cooperation of home and school for better schools. The field work in part consists of school visitation or inspection of the approved non-accredited high </seg>
            <seg id="p151">OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION schools for the purpose of approving them so that they may collect free high school tuition and be exempt from their share of the county - wide high school tax levy. One hundred and twenty-three addresses have been given at county, district, and state teachers' associations, Parent-Teacher Associations, school board associations, community meetings, and over the radio. The work of this particular division cannot, however, be measured merely in terms of inspection or statistical data concerning buildings and grounds, libraries, equipment, and personnel. It is our desire to realize with the cooperation of the home, school, and the church the richest dividends for the Nebraska boys and girls, dividends in achiev - ing permanent interest in inspirational and recreational reading in the developing of good habits of study, in the appreciation of good music, and in the acquisition of qualities of good citizenship. Shall we not guarantee to every child the opportunity to grow and develop so that he may be able to 'fill his place as a citizen of our great state? In 1928, there were reported 172 state department staff members assigned to rural education in 38 states. The work of the State Di - rectors of Rural Education in other states as in Nebraska is concerned chiefly with promoting state policies of rural education, administrative supervision, supervision of instruction, research, and Inspection. Pro - fessional leadership gives encouragement of initiative and creative ability. ; It stimulates systematic professional growth. It gives help - ful suggestions, new ideas, inspiration, and higher professional ideas to the teachers. The efforts of the Division of Rural Education have been directed toward improvement of instruction and administrative supervision. I. Improvement of instruction by 1. More thorough work in the fundamental subjects with partic - ular emphasis on. reading this year. 2. Emphasis on character, health, and safety education. 3. Standards for better rural school teaching and recognition of better rural school teaching. 4. Revision of Elementary Course of Study. 5. Preparation and organization of eighth grade examinations. 6.

Supervision and inspection of approved non-accredited high schools. . ■ • PLAN OF PROCEDURE ' I. Conferences with county superintendents. ' Conferences with county superintendents were held at Lincoln on January 20, 21, and 22, 1931, and February 16, i7, and 18, 1932, in order to present the educational program of the State Superintendent's office to the county superintend - ents, and to assist them in organizing the routine work and admin - istrative duties of their offices. . Methods for improvement of instruc - tion in music, reading, and scientific temperance in the rural schools were presented. Discussions by county superintendents were conducted on the following topics: Normal training problems, compulsory edu - cation, contests and exhibits, county-wide testing programs, teachers' meetings, county superintendents', visits; specific plans for the im - provement of rural schools by standardization, health education . ac - tivities, libraries, character education clubs, supervisory helps, and eighth grade examinations. The conferences brought to county su - perintendents their opportunity to be community as well as educational leaders in their counties. The themes of the conferences were "Our Immediate Objectives in Rural Education," "High School Normal Training," and "Character Education." The immediate objectives set forth for Nebraska at the County Superintendents' Conference were more thorough work in the fundamental subjects, improved rural school teaching, .enriched library service, 1,000 standard and superior rural schools, continued emphasis on character- building, health edu - cation, a better understanding between home and school, a state rural school chorus, and a rural school chorus in every Nebraska county. In 1930, there were 945 rural school supervisors reported in 516' counties in 30 states, in addition to the county .superintendents. In three states (Wisconsin, Delaware, and Maryland), rural school supervision is state- wide. In three states (California with 166 rural school super - visors, New Jersey, and Connecticut), it is practically state-wide. Each state, however, must take the personnel and available means' of super - vision that it has and work to bring about better conditions. We can - not wait for conditions that, if realized in the far distant future, may seem ideal. We must deal with the problems of the rural school as' they are now. Today's work must be the best that we can make It for the individual boy and girl. </seg>
            <seg id="p153">OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION ' II. Improvement of Instruction. 1. More thorough work in the fundamental subjects with particu - lar emphasis on reading. In order to improve the reading throughout the state, a . reading program including three dis - tinct phases is offered, viz.: a. The diagnostic or testing phase. b. The remedial instruction as listed in the diagnostic chart in the reading course of study. c. Reading demonstration day. The slogan throughout the state is "Every Child a Better Reader." The teaching of reading is being presented at the teachers' meetings and county superintendents are devoting a part of their visits to the improvement of reading. The pupils' deficiencies in reading should be pointed out on the diagnostic chart in the course of study, and teachers will consider with the children how they can best remedy their reading defects. Twenty-five counties report that successful reading demonstra - tion days were held during the past year (Table No. 3). Many addi - tional counties are planning to hold reading demonstration day this year. On this day every pupil will have the opportunity to read. At these reading demonstrations the teachers will demonstrate their best methods. The cooperation of every parent is enlisted in the realization of the slogan "Every Child a Better Reader." An eleven-page bulletin on the topic "Every Child a Better Reader" has been prepared by the Director of Rural Education. 3. Emphasis on character, health, and safety education. a. Character education — Forty-four pages in the Elementary Course of Study are devoted to the course of study in char - acter education. Pour additional bulletins have been is - sued by the department for the promotion of work in char - acter building. (See report on Knighthood of Youth.) b. Health education. (1) Physical examination of pupils (required by Section 79-2113, Nebraska School Laws). (2) Organization and supervision of play periods and pro - ■ . vision of playground equipment. ( 3 ) Encouragement of hot lunch. (4) Personal health habits emphasized, (see health edu - cation section, Nebraska Elementary Courses ol Study). (5) Nursing service. The seal sale of the Nebraska Tuber - culosis Association has created a fund for health work in many counties since one-halt of the proceeds Is kept by the county for health work. In 1928, the fol - lowing counties were visited and the service paid for from the proceeds of the Christmas seals, viz.: Otoe, </seg>
            <seg id="p154">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 4 weeks; Dodge, 2 weeks; Johnson, 6 weeks; Jef - ferson, 7 weeks; Gage, 8 weeks. Inspection was re - ceived by 4,308 children. In 1929, 2,475 children . were inspected in Cass, Jefferson, and Lancaster Counties, and in Lexington. In 1930, 7,100 pupils were inspected in Lancaster, Dodge, and Kearney Counties, and in Lexington and Bellevue. Burt County had a tuberculosis clinic and a nurse for one month to prepare for the clinic and do the follow-up work, paid for by seal money. In 1931, Dodge and Lancaster Counties and Oakland had nursing service. Custer County is having a three months' service this fall and Dodge County is having a one month service. We do not have a report of the nursing service car - ried on by the Red Cross. c. Safety education — It is hoped that we will be able to com - plete the safety course of study by the end of the school year. In accordance with Section 79-1202, Nebraska School Laws, a course of study in lire prevention of 92 pages has been prepared and distributed to all teachers in rural and city schools in Nebraska. The following expressions illus - trate unsolicited comments that have been received: "I have just now bad an opportunity to read your Fire Prevention Manual. The arrangement of the booklet and the valuable information contained therein are worthy of commendation. The study of Fire Prevention in this form should be a pleasure for both teachers and pupils. "Congratulations are due you and your associates for the wonderful work now being undertaken in your state to promote fire prevention. Your efforts will, without question, directly and indirectly, eventually result in the saving of many lives and thousands of dollars in property value. Keep up the good work."— Branch Manager of Fire Protection Engineering of General ln s pection Bureau in Minnesota. North Dakota, and South Dakota. "You have gotten out one of the best Fire Prevention Manuals I have seen. It makes a good text book on that subject." — Alson Sccor, Successful Farming. 3. Standards for better rural school teaching. The most impor - tant factor In any school is the teacher. If you have a highly trained, conscientious, and enthusiastic teacher working either in a one-teacher, sanitary, frame schoolhouse or in one of the finest equipped school - houses in the city, the results in the lives and characters of the pupils may be approximately equal. "A3 the teacher, so is the school." The influence and efforts of a good teacher cannot be sufficiently rewarded. We cannot measure the harm effected by a poor teacher. Rural school teaching demands an efficient teacher. The problems of successful organization and instruction are varied and difficult; the range of sub - ject matter is wide. Supervision presents many doubtful questions. There are many opportunities for the teacher to be of service in the rural communities. The teacher who is in sympathy with her work and knows how to do it is the greatest force for regular attendance on the part of pupils and is far more effective than compulsory attendance. </seg>
            <seg id="p155">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION In order to enthuse teachers with the desire to do more efficient teaching, this division Is inspiring superior rural school teaching by an - nouncing standards for better rural school teaching. Certificates 'Recognition of Better Rural School Teaching" have been issued by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction at the close of the past two school years to 208 deserving teachers. The standards of better rural school teaching consider the. program and classification of the school, classroom instruction, schoolroom routine, supervision of play - ground, housekeeping, .community activities, the pupil's attitude re - sults as evidenced by the work the child is able to do, and the char - acter, traits, and professional spirit of the teacher.

This Course of Study has been used conscientiously by the teachers for three years. County 3 upailn - teudents constantly remind the teachers to refer to the Course of Study. The nature and the amount of subject matter to be covered In each subject throughout, the eight years of work are clearly and definitely Btated in the Course of Study. The methods of procedure for teaching the required units of subject matter are also Included The objectives listed and the standards of achievement for promotion are definite goals to be attained by pupils. The State Course of Study not only takes into consideration the rural environment but it has been made expressly for the rural schools and their needs and is rural in setting and in content. It is motivating and vitalizing the school work throughout Nebraska. Patrons will be interested in making a study of the entire course. Pride in Nebraska as an agricultural state is expressed throughout the Course of Study by means of the activities listed in the course relating to 4-H Club work, the farm accounting course, the farm marketing problems, measuring of fields, cost of paint - ing of buildings, cost of fencing, the making of graphs for the purpose of comparing rainfall, graphs of the changes in prices, crop surveys cost of growing and feeding livestock, suggested correlations of agril culture with English, the enriched course in practical agriculture and the use of the agricultural bulletins. </seg>
            <seg id="p156">REPORT OP STATE SUPERINTENDENT Many teachers have remarked "I could not get along without that Course of Study." For example, the following unsolicited comments indicate the appreciation of the teachers: "We have received our new Course of Study and I want to express my appreciation of it. The detailed outline especially of beginning work, I am sure, ought to be very helpful to the new teachers. 1 wish I had had such help when I started out in my work." "I feel you have done a wonderful piece of work in compiling Jhis 1929 course." The Nebraska alternation plan in the Course of Study does not consist of a complete alternation and combination of classes. Lack of time and the short recitation period previous to the adoption of the al - ternation plan were great handicaps to efficient school work in the rural schools. The law "requires that the eighth grade pupils pass in fourteen subjects. If the grades were not combined in any subject, the teacher who has all eight grades In school would have not less than forty-two to forty-eight classes a day. The alternation plan as given in the bulletin "Organization o£ the One-Teacher School" is offered to the rural schools. The success of the alternation plan in Nebraska is due to the fact that the system as outlined may be adjusted to fit the chiid and at no time is the plan permitted to be a "lock-step" system. The individual child is given consideration at all times. One of the teacher's greatest responsibilities is to help each individual child de - velop to his great03t capacity. . Favorable comments offered by county superintendents, on file In the State Superintendent's Office, are testimonials that there is greater interest and more efficient work in the school on account of the larger classes. The following comments illustrate the sentiment: "The advantages of the alternation plan far exceed the minor disadvantages found. In our small schools, a few disadvantages such as moving from a town school to a rural school have been quite adequately met through the teacher s special planning for thai pupil or pupils."— Banner County. "Advantages— saves teacher's time, adds interest by larger classes, makes it possible for teacher to teach all required subjects, gives lunger recitation pe - riods, creates no problem when pupils transfer. No marked disadvantages. — Iloyd County. "The alternation plan is a timesaver. All children receive more help and acquire more general knowledge of the subject in hand. There is more time for supervised study and more individual attention given to students. — Morrill County. "The new alternation plan has worked well with modification. Moving from one school to another has been made very easy, as our rural schools are prac - tically uniform and the majority of moving is from one rural school to an - other."—Madison County. "More time, more thorough explanation and discussion, more opportunity for pupils to recite. Classes larger, more competition, ideas of individual pupils helpful to others. Classes seldom, if ever, need to be omitted on account ot lack of time, as was often the case previously."— Howard County. . "In large schools it is a decided timesaver. In small schools it avoids the too small group. By the use of the flexible assignments a teacher can minimize the disadvantages of overworking a slow pupil. I think the alternation has ceased to be on trial. It is here to stay."— Sarpy County. </seg>
            <seg id="p157">OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION ■ "Plan is O. K. Gives more time for recitation. Teacher has opportunity to really teach something. I see no disadvantage. Have no suggestion." — Saumlcrs County. "By separating classes in arithmetic for fifth and sixth grades and English for seventh and eighth grades, part of disadvantage was removed. Pupils who attend school regularly and are average students make good progress and the advantage of larger groups and keener competition outweighs the disadvantage. Effort needed to prevent a teacher from promoting children two grades oc - casionally." — Nance- County. ' ■ 5. Eighth grade examinations. The completion of the courses of study and passing satisfactorily the final eighth grade examinations under the direction of the county superintendent entitle the pupils to the privileges of the free high school law in Nebraska. _, "Section 79-901. Free High School Education, High School Grade Defined. Course of Study, Rules of Admission. Provision is hereby made for four years of free public high school education for all the youth of this state whose parents or guardians, live in public school districts which maintain less than a four year high school course of study, on the following conditions, to- wit: "First. For the purposes of this article all grades above the eighth grade in any public school district of this state shall be deemed high school grades. The course of study for the first eight grades in common schools shall be com - posed of the following subjects: Agriculture, bookkeeping, civics, drawing, arithmetic, English composition, geography, grammar, history, mental arith - metic, orthography, penmanship, physiology, reading. The State Superintend - ent with these subjects for a foundation shall lay out a feasible course of study adapted to rural school conditions keeping in view the good of a thorough education for the child in these branches rather than to the completion of the course in a given number of years.

The course of study for the high school grades shall be the Nebraska HiRh School Manual issued jointly by the University of Nebraska and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction." In compliance with the law, the eighth grade examinations have been prepared by the Division of Rural Education and sent out to the county superintendents. Examinations have been conducted by the county superintendents on specified dates in January, April, and May. The January examination is a "special" examination In a few subjects, designed to enable pupils to do better work by taking a few of the minor examinations in January. This plan makes It possible for the pupils to devote more time to the remaining major subjects. The purpose of the final eighth grade examinations is to determine the eligibility of pupils to receive free high school tuition from the county for high school instruction in public approved high schools. </seg>
            <seg id="p158">REPORT OP STATE SUPERINTENDENT. According to the. law, all eighth grade pupils, public, private, parochial, town, city, or rural, regardless of the school they are attending, must pass these examinations in order to be entitled to privileges under the free high school law, namely, free high- school tuition. The questions arc based upon the Elementary Course of Study. A conscientious ef - fort is put forth in order that these examinations may be a fair and a reasonable test of the pupil's ability to satisfactorily do high school work. These. examinations conform with the standards for promotion as listed in the Elementary Course of Study. The examinations also serve for the purpose of diagnosing deficiencies in the pupils' work and are helpful to the teachers in suggesting remedial measures. The following comments by two county superintendents Illustrate the reactions expressed: ■ "Permit me to say the 1932 eighth grade examination questions . were the --. . . . fairest ever put out as reflected in the returned manuscripts." "I was very much pleased with the questions hoth for the April and the May examinations.* They, were simple yet they tested the ability ai the -pupil • • concerning the work covered. The first question, in which you directed the pupils to . follow directions, to be careful of their punctuation, writing, and spelling in all examinations, etc., was very good and had a wholesome in - fluence upon tlu- pupils. We feel that we have the finest set of examination answers, well written, neat and correctly punctuated that we have ever had;" G. Teachers' meetings. Addresses on the following topics have been given at teachers' meetings by the Director of Rural Education: "The Reading Course of Study and Character Development," "Helping the Child to Succeed," "Character Building through the Teaching of Arithmetic," "Good Study Habits for Every Student," "Sensible Seat Work," "Objectives in Rural Education in Nebraska," "Development of Desirable Ideals, Traits, and Habits," "Investments in Education," "Organization of the Rural School," "Character Education," "Better Everyday English," "Enrichment of the.

The school exhibit at the State Pair held under the direction of the State Pair Board,' Is very creditable For several years, the county superintendents have been using the county fairs as a means of acquainting the public with the progress of educa - tion. The exhibit of achievement maps of many of the counties at the State Pair portrayed a very ambitious program of rural school achievements. m. Standard and superior rural schools. Standardization of rural schools is a voluntary procedure on the part of the school districts themselves. No right of self-control Is affected by standardization. Satisfactory physical environment Is considered very important to the school life, health, and progress of children and has led to definite standards in buildings, grounds, and working equipment. We purpose to secure the beBt one-teacher rural schools possibla by establishing definite, standards which are conducive to greater care In providing healthful educational advantages for rural children. Poor schools are due largely to the lack of personal interest and support. We should guarantee to every boy and girl a school that Is safe from hazards, sanitary, well equipped, well lighted, and well ven - .tilated. Improved school buildings, better equipment, better teaching, and definite community cooperation are being realized for the schools by the efforts put forth in standardization. A neighboring state ap - propriates one hundred thousand dollars per year to rural schools meeting certain standards prescribed by the statute. Nebraska school </seg>
            <seg id="p160">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT boards, patrons, and teachers have shown great Interest in standardi - zation without the incentive of state aid. As a result, there are many splendid one-teacher buildings, libraries, supplementary reading ma - terial, good equipment for instructional and playground purposes, an excellent teacher, and all that goes to make boys and girls happy while they are being trained for good citizenship. In some schools wo find running water, electric lights, telephone, radio, hot lunch equipment, manual training equipment, and kindergarten table and chairs.

(See list of standard rural schools on pages 91 to 98, Inclusive, of the 1931 Rural School Standards Bulletin.) Fifteen thousand copies of a' 64' page bulletin on Standards for Rural Schools were printed and distributed in 1927. In 1929 and 1930, 10,000 copies of a 76 page revised edition were distributed. In 1931, 10,000 copies of a 110 page revised edition of the Rural School Standards Bulletin were distributed. This bulletin contains the mini - mum requirements for standardization, the official score card for standard and superior rural schools, a general explanation of the Ne - braska rural school standards, floor plans suitable for one and two - teacher rural schools, the law regarding our flag and flag pole, flag code, playground equipment, hot lunch equipment, library books for pupils, music helps and records, standards for recognition of better rural school- teaching, and a list of Nebraska standard schools.

            <seg id="p162">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT "We appreciate very much the bulletin on rural school standards which you recently sent us. It is one of the best and most suggestive bulletins for the rural teachers that we have seen. "We are especially interested in the physical features of the school plant which you discuss. .* " When a school reaches the minimum requirements, the teacher or school officers score the school, and request the county superintend - ent or State Department to Inspect and score the school. If a school justifies a score of 75 points, it is classed as a standard school and a standard plate for the school Is sent by the State Department to the county superintendent. Legislation should be enacted, when expedient, whereby the plans of a new rural schoolhouse may be approved by a school architect, working under the direction of the State Superintendent. This department is not interested in dictating kinds of material, the type of roof, the size of the building, thickness of walls, and similar details that should be left to the decision of the local group but this department is interested in regard to the school building complying with the requirements ol health and sanitation and Is willing to say that a check should be made relative to new buildings meeting health requirements. Some of the specific benefits of the standardization of rural schools are: 1. It gives the county superintendent, the school officers, and patrons a common interest. It develops school and community pride and cooperation. 2. It gives school officers an understanding of school needs for the health and education of the children and guides them in the wise and economical expenditures of funds. It arouses general interest in school improvement. 3. It secures improvements in 'buildings and playground. It encourages better care of. the school plant and the cleaning up of the school grounds. 4. It helps the county superintendent to make a close survey of his schools and thus become familiar with conditions. 5. It secures needed teaching equipment. 6. It encourages- the employment of better prepared teachers. 7. It encourages the organization of Parent-Teacher Associations and school and home community organizations. 8. It is an excellent community project for every rural district to score its school in order to determine its efficiency and reveal Its needs and achievements. </seg>
            <seg id="p163">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION In order that progress may continue when a school has reached tne f till requirements for a standard school, a superior school rating has been established (see pages 10 and 11 ot the Rural School Standards Bulletin). Douglas, Keith, and Butler Counties are requesting inspection of three schools aspiring to become superior. The following schools have been recognized as superior schools.

A survey of 28 counties revealed in 1930 that out of 1,924 schools who reported, 1,363 districts listed the library books in their respective schools. It was found that 490 reports did not list any library books while reports from 71 districts stated definitely that there were no library books in their respective schools. On the library reports from 1,363 districts, 37,672 books were listed for an enrollment of 25,545 pupils. This means that each pupil in these 1,363 districts averaged 1.47 books It will be conceded that this is decidedly Inadequate. This survey of the rural school library demonstrates the importance of the 1929 llbra-ry law. This law provides for the enrichment and enlargement of the school library. 3SSESS3 r^¥-vv^ i?«SSS ?n vested it i hook, nthi ?h °.l Td ° r S , chco1 trustecs of »«eh district annually s"An be «. iti?.l f ir 'JV" 1 .* 1 " T Z eu } a ' tcxt 1iooks ' which books so Provided snail De suitable for the district school library." " V. The rural school chorus. We wish to express our sincere appre - ciation to county superintendents for the splendid results that are being secured in the rural school chorus. Last year 5,000 rural boys and girls received the Nebraska rural school chorus certificates signed by the State Superintendent and were eligible to sing in the rural school chorus at the State Fair. These rural boys and girls had pre - viously sung at the eighth grade promotion exercises and at the county rural school choruses. Fathers, mothers, and teachers have been de - lighted to listen to the beautiful tone quality that has been developed in. the singing of the boys and girls by this method. A most appreciative and attentive audience greeted the two appear - ances of the rural school chorus on Sunday, September 6, 1931, and Sunday, September 4, 1932. Reports from over the state indicate continued growth and development in rural school chorus work. This </seg>
            <seg id="p164">REPORT OP STATE SUPERINTENDENT work is being promoted by our division, in order tbat the boys and girls of the rural school may share in the Joys of self-expression and appreciation that only good music can bring. Table Number 3 gives a report of the districts- having rural school choruses in the various counties. VI. Greater cooperation of home and school. 1. Home and school organizations. Creating interest in a better rural school program may be accomplished by community organiza - tions and patrons' organizations discussing freely and working on a program of child welfare and school improvement. We have found that the most effective means of advancing rural education is through local leadership. Although developing sentiment takes time, it makes for growth, satisfaction, and permanence in the end, and is in accord - ance with the guiding principles followed by Horace Mann, viz.: "Edu - cation can never be attained in a republic without the consent of the whole people. All improvements in the school suppose and require a corresponding and simultaneous improvement in public sentiment." Every effort is being made on the part of the State Department and county superintendents to stimulate within our state a public senti - ment and desire for better schools. With the public's .good will, a school system can do almost anything. Without it, little can be ac - complished. The vision, ideals, and interests of its citizens are a measure of the progressive spirit of the community. Our experience shows that the rural people of the various communities are glad and willing, in the great majority of cases,, to "improve their schools as far as economic factors make it reasonably possible for them to do so. Therefore, we urge and encourage the forming of Parent-Teacher As - sociations, community centers, and kindred organizations that are in - terested in the home and school. Discussion material for these or - ganizations has been prepared by the Director of Rural Education for the purpose of contributing to discussions on children's reading, health, safety, character education, preventing fires on the farm, thrift, and standards for rural schools. Table Number 2 gives a report of the number of districts participating in Parent-Teacher Associations and community organizations. 2. School officers' conventions. A county school board associ - ation is one of the very best agencies for developing an active Interest in the improvement of school conditions throughout the county and for inspiring a more united and cooperative program of work. Since the improvement of a school is so dependent on the school board and community, this department is interested in school officers' meetings being held in order that school officers may become better Informed as to the needs of the school, educational progress and policies, plans for modern school buildings, and financing of schools. Some states re - quire county school officers' meetings. </seg>

HHP NlH ■ I HARBINE APPROVED NON-ACCREDITED HIGH SCHOOIj A TWO-TEACHER SCHOOL ERECTED IN 1932 VII. Approved non-accredited high schools. Many of the smaller high schools of the state are unable to meet the standards of high school accredltment established by the University of Nebraska. Many districts are unable to maintain more than nine, ten, or eleven grades of work. In order that all of the youth of the state may have the advantage of high school privileges, the State Department of Public Instruction has established reasonable standards that may be attained in these schools, which will give to the boys and girls an opportunity to secure a high school education. These approved high schools have brought about marked educational progress in many communities. School districts complying with these standards may collect high school tuition for non-resident pupils. They are also exempt from the pay - ment of the county-wide high school tax as provided in Section 79-902, Nebraska School Laws. The local district determines whether or not a high school shall be maintained. ....•• Approval of high schools under the authority of Section 79-902, Nebraska School Laws, is a responsibility of the State Department of Public Instruction and is for the purpose of providing high school privileges to boys and girls. Certain problems of approval are exemp - tion from the county-wide high school tax on one hand and collection of free high school tuition for non-resident students on the other. The quality of academic work, qualifications of teachers, equipment, .and ability to support such a program are factors to be considered before a </seg>
            <seg id="p177">OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION school is approved. The 1931 Rural and Village High School Bulletin sets forth the requirements for high school approval in regard to the course of study; suggested programs of study; number and certification of teachers; library and reference materials; laboratory equipment and supplies; nature and size of classrooms; required healthful con - ditions; detailed courses in high school subjects; correspondence study; suggestions for better study habits; achievement tests; and work books. In presenting these standards for approved non-accredited high schools, it has been the aim of the department to almost equal the same general standards of accredited schools in order that the students may be more readily accepted in the accredited schools without the taking of entrance examinations and in order that the edu - cational interests of the students may be safeguarded. Certain provisions of the law relative to high school approval follow: ■ . . • "Section 79-902. Free High School Education, Free High School Tuition, • Tax Levy, Collection, Fund. The county superintendent of each county where a county high school is not maintained shall within thirty (30) days alter the annual meeting certify to the county board of supervisors or commissioners the number of qualified pupils as provided in Section 6385, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, (79-901), whose parents or guardians have applied to the county superintendent for free high school tuition privileges, the amount nec - essary to pay the high school tuition of said pupils for the ensuing school year at. the rate of Three Dollars ($3.(10) per week or fraction thereof, and a list of school districts which have been approved by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction as schools qualified to grant free public high school education to non-resident pupils under the provisions of this Act. Upon re - ceipt of said certificate, the said, county board shall levy on all taxable prop - erty in the said county a sufficient tax to pay said high school tuition as certified by the county superintendent: Provided said board shall exclude from said levy all the actual valuation on all of the .taxable property of any district in which is maintained an approved four year high school, shall ex - clude from said levy three-fourths of the actual valuation of the taxable prop - erty of any district in which is maintained an approved three year high school, shall exclude from said levy one-half of the actual valuation of the taxable property of any district in which is maintained an approved two year high school, and shall exclude from said levy one-fourth of the actual valuation of the taxable property of any district in which is maintained an approved one year high school !• . 1. Application for hijrji school approval. In carrying out the pro - visions of the above law, this office supplied the county superintend - ents of. the state with proper. application blanks in July. These ap - plication blanks were forwarded by the county superintendent to the directors of all those school districts desiring approval of their high school work. Each of these school districts filed its application for approval in the office of the co'unty superintendent. This official, after verifying the facts and approving the application, signed the same and forwarded it to the Office of the State Superintendent not later than the 20th of September when the high school In Its various grades had been actually organized and in full operation. Final approval of schools is not given until June 1st of each year by the State Department of Public Instruction, at which time county superintendents, county clerks, and county treasurers are notified of the approved schools in their respective counties. A school or added </seg>
            <seg id="p178">REPORT OP STATE SUPERINTENDENT grades must be in actual operation before it receives the consideration of this office for approval. Exemption from the tax levy or any part of the high school tax levy depends upon the approval as reported by the State Superintendent for the year just past. This seems to. be the most logical course of procedure under the law as it exists in the statute books at the present time. a. Classes of high schools. For the purposes of approval, public high schools are divided into two classes: (1) Accredited high schools and minor accredited high schools. Refer to report of Division of Secondary Education. ' ■ I (2) Approved non-accredited high schools. In addition lo those schools accredited to the University of Nebraska, there are a number of smaller schools ottering one, two, three, or four years of high school work. The schools that meet the requirements of the State Depart - ment of Public Instruction are approved as one year, two year, three year, or four year high schools, and are eligible to collect free high school tuition for non-resident pupils. Refer to. the list of approved non-accredited high schools.. 2. Inspection of approved high schools, conferences, and circular and personal letters to. teachers of approved high schools. The purpose of inspection is to encourage progress in education and the carrying out of regulations and requirements. The visits made by this division are not only for the purpose of determining whether or not schools should be approved for exemption of tax levy and collection of tuition for non - resident high school pupils, but also for encouragement and help to teacher and pupils in accordance with the helps sent out in the 1931 Rural and Village High School Bulletin, the Rural School Standards Bulletin, the Nebraska High School Manual, circulars, and bulletins. Conferences of the teachers of the approved non-accredited high schools have been held In many of the counties with the hope of promoting progress in the schools. • 3. Achievements of approved non-accredited high schools. Last year there were 292 approved non-accredited high schools in Nebraska. During the pasti five years, 34 approved non-accredited high schools have steadily progressed and are now minor, accredited schools. During this time, 15 of the approved non-accredited high schools have added to their equipment, raised their teachers' qualifications, con - tinued to improve, and have reached their goal of full accreditment to the University of Nebraska. This means then that 49 of our approved non-accredited schools have become accredited within the past ■ five years. a. Standard achievement tests.. One hundred and two of the 190 schools reporting gave " standard achievement testa during the </seg>
            <seg id="p179">OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION school year 1931-32. Two hundred and twenty-eight standard achieve - ment tests in the high school subjects were given in the 102 approved non-accredited high schools. b. Helps in high school subjects. In 151 approved non-accredited high schools, 332 sets of work books in the various high school sub - jects were used last year. Quite generally, English helps were used in the teaching of the classics. For example, 69. schools secured the assignments and lesson plans from the University of Nebraska for the teaching of "Silas Marner," and Gl schools used the assignments and lesson plans for the teaching of the "Lady of the Lake." A similar report could be given of the other classics. c. Better study habits. The teachers of the approved non-accredited high schools are emphasizing the fact that study is one of the most important functions of the school. Real study means thinking. In 119 schools, excellent progress has been made in improving study habits of pupils. d. Community activities. Thirty-seven of these schools reported that they had Parent-Teacher Associations, 21 schools had community and dramatic clubs, two schools reported a W. C. T. U., three schools reported women's clubs, 49 schools have given plays during the year, 45 schools reported athletic contests in baseball, basketball, and track, seven schools reported bands, five had orchestras, and 30 Four-H Clubs were reported. Other activities reported by the . 190 schools are Christmas programs, commencement programs, Washington bicenten - nial programs, mother's day programs. Boy Scout organization, Camp - fire Girls, Girl Scouts, girl reserves, glee clubs, manual training clubs, Hi-Y-'s, Pep club, home beautiflcation club, Latin club, English club, and mother and daughter and father and son banquets. County scholastic contests are held annually in Burt and Valley Counties. e. Patrons' day and school demonstration day. One-third of the approved high schools have sent in splendid reports in regard to their patrons' days and school demonstration days. These have proved so popular that one school held four patrons' days and demonstration days, two schools each held three, and seven schools each held two demonstration days during the year. Eleven schools reported increased interest on the part of the parents in visiting school on the regular school days. Some school improvements and the adding of equip - ment during the year were reported in 155 approved non-accredited high schools. The above Incomplete report Indicates the type of achievements In pur rural and village approved non-accredited schools. The teachers and leaders of the various communities are to be commended for par - ticipating In many of these worth while activities. Leadership is being steadily developed and strengthened. </seg>

Introduction The reader will recall that in our two previous Biennial Reports we have discussed a number ot matters germane to the development of the program of secondary education and teacher training in Ne - braska. In the Thirtieth Biennial Report (1927-28) there was pre - sented a brief statement ot the historical development of the division, together with a statement of the function of that division. In brief, it was pointed out that our responsibility is more than that of a mere inspection of public schools for accreditment purposes' only. More than that, this division has sought to share jointly with the University of Nebraska the responsibility of preparing courses of study and cur - ricula deemed necessary to the continued improvement of the high school program. It was stated in this particular report that this office must ever be a student of the many significant and far-reaching changes taking place in the reorganization and the redirection of the secondary school. ' •. . ' • The director of this division was asked by the National Association of High School Supervisors to address that body at their last meeting in Washington, D. C, upon the subject of, "The Most Effective Dis - tribution of Our Services as- High School Inspectors and Supervisors''. From the conclusions he makes the following summary: 1. Provision should be made for insuring time to the supervisors for purposes of holding local, regional or evfcn state conferences with secondary school leaders. It is inconceivable that any extensive state - wide program can be developed that does not take into account the very important and altogether essential influences that grow out of these regional conferences. 2. Provision should be made for carrying on experimental studies in certain schools of either the typical or atypical type, the results to be written up and made available to all. 3. Opportunity should be provided whereby supervisors may con - fer with boards of education, faculty groups or administrative officers and supervisors of the local schools in order to clear up -misunder - standings and difficulties, to advise with these groups concerning cur - ricula, reorganization . programs, physical plant, equipments and the like. ■ 4. Supervisors should be given opportunity for frequent contacts with groups of persons in communities outside of the profession, to the end that the policies of public education may be brought to the attention of the citizens, that the information conveyed may truly stimulate citizens to the setting up of desirable programs. </seg>
            <seg id="p187">OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 5. Opportunity should be provided whereby the superiors ot secondary education may make timely contacts with university and college leaders, sitting in their classes and counseling with them and giving as much time as is possible to the study of problems in the field of secondary education, that they may be properly informed as to their ideals and purposes, translating these into the working schemes of the secondary schools. Nothing can so vitalize the theory of the classroom as an opportunity for presenting the instructional materials by one who has been definitely spending time in the field and bucking up against real honest-to-goodness problems existing out on the fir - ing-lines. Finally, it must be recognized that "Leadership in education must be assumed as the most important function of the state. The best leadership does not depend upon legislative authority, but upon the advice, understanding, sympathy and co-operation of those who in an administrative, executive and supervisory capacity promote the state's educational objectives." This office will continue to assume this larger function to the end that there may result a state program of secondary education wholly commensurate with the needs and altogether within the reasonable abilities of the several communities to provide. In the Thirty-first Biennial Report of this office (1929-30) there was set forth the challenge of secondary education, as well as a state - ment concerning the apparent reorganization of secondary education, as well as a statement of the educational outcomes, to which the reader's attention is called. ■ The National Survey Outstanding among the many investigations in the field of second - ary education none is of greater significance than the recently com - pleted National Survey of Secondary Education authorized by Con - gress in 1929. Pour major phases, or aspects, of secondary education were considered in this survey: (1) Organization, ( 2 ) school popu - lation, (3) administration and supervision, and (4) curriculum. During the past three years data have been collected from every kind of school in the land. Many Individual schools were visited and studied. Committees were set up for Investigating special types of schools, as well as for analyzing the many curricula now provided for. The result of all of this investigation is being made available through some twenty-eight monographs, totaling more than three .thousand pages, all of which are available or will be available during the aca - demic year 1932-33. Dr. Leonard V. Koos, as the associate director of this survey, re - ported recently before a meeting of the North Central Association </seg>
            <seg id="p188">REPORT OP STATE SUPERINTENDENT some of the outstanding discoveries which, in the judgment of this office, are of such significance as to warrant their being brought to attention. We turn to this discussion: A. The Growth of Secondary Education. In 1890 the high school population of the United States represented about 4 per cent of the total population of the nation's youth, aged fourteen to eighteen. In 1930 this percentage had grown to at least 60. per cent of the youth of the age indicated. In many cities and states this percentage was found to be very much greater, being as much as 80 per cent and in some instances even 90 per cent. This increased enrollment in our public high schools since 1890 represents slightly less than 4000 per cent in the United States at large. Certainly, such figures as these constitute an exceedingly significant fact as regards the faith of the American people in their program of secondary education and their belief in the necessity for more extensive as well as intensive prepa - ration of youth to assume a greater degree of responsibility in the affairs of life. ' It should certainly guarantee a more informed elec - torate. • . Again we are reminded by Dr. Koos that this "popularization" of secondary education has presented a further difficult problem— -that is, the setting up of a broadened curriculum adapted to the individual needs and the diversified interests of this larger body of students B. Organization. Many new types of schools havo come Into being as a direct outcome of this "popularization" of secondary edu - cation — the general, or comprehensive, type- of high school, as well as the special types of high schools, such as the commercial, technical, vocational and trade schools, part-time cooperative schools, evening high schools and continuation high schools. The one unequivocal generalization that it is safe to laake from this particular phase of the study, we are reminded, is that the changes in the organization of our high schools and the extension of the various programs offered has very definitely resulted in the "democratization of secondary education". Our high schools can' no longer be con - sidered as "curricular institutions" to which the privileged few are admitted and In which only those of unusual intellectual capacity and proven ability are enrolled. Rather, there has come into being what' Dr. Edmondson, Dean of the School of Education of the University of Michigan, has termed "the newer philosophy", which "demands that secondary education be open to all the children of adolescent age". This newer philosophy "implies that the secondary school must provide types of education as varied as may be demanded by the interests of secondary school pupils in order that each pupil may have the oppor - tunity to progress as rapidly as he can or as slowly as he must." In Btill another respect there has been revealed by this survey a very pronounced' tendency to reorganize the schools for better admin- </seg>
            <seg id="p189">OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION istrative and supervisory efficiency. The readar is reminded that in our Biennial Report of 1929-30 we discussed rather briefly the trends in this reorganization. Supplementing that by the findings of this survey, we are prepared to state that the most significant reorganization has been that resulting in the so-called junior high school, sometimes termed the intermediate school, or that unit generally comprising grades seven, eight and nine. This type of school, the survey reveals, had its rise approximately twenty years ago and has so developed that at the present time there are more than 6600 such schools, or about one - fourth of the entire number of public high schools in the United States.- These- numbers are exclusive of schools organized for the colored children. Most authorities are agreed that the Junior high school movement has resulted in the creation of schools very superior to those organized under the older plan, such as that represented by the so-called 8-4 scheme. Not all schools thus reorganized follow the more common plan of six elementary grades, three junior high school and three senior high school grades. Some are organized on the 7-5 plan, the 6-5 plan, the 6-2-4 plan or the 6-6 plan. The survey reveals that schools under 2000 enrollments when organized as a single six-year unit have advantages over the. separate three year junior and three year senior high schools. The study further reveals that the size of enrollment is a more im - portant factor of differences between schools than the type of or - ganization, itself. Again, the survey reveals the tendency toward organizing the junior colleges as extensions upward of the secondary school system. While this movement is comparatively recent — even more recent than the development of the junior high school — it has been a most rapid one. In 1930 there were 175 such junior colleges in the United States, having a total enrollment of about 50,000 students. At the present time this number is no doubt somewhat larger. In addition to the public junior colleges, there are many private institutions, the com - bined enrollments of which will In all probability equal those of the public junior colleges. This office is in agreement with the survey commission in saying that it is quite probable that a further reorganization of our secondary schools is imminent. The exact nature of this reorganization is, of course, problematical. Many students hold that the more likely re - organization plan will provide for the setting up of either a 6-3-3-2 or * 6-4-4 plan. A few are of the opinion that the fourteen year period here represented is likely to be shortened one if not two years. C. Administration and Supervision. Under this heading the sur - vey commission attempted to analyze a number of problems, such as provisions tor meeting and caring for individual differences, the pro - viding of adequate library facilities, the organization and control of </seg>
            <seg id="p190">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT guidance programs, student registration and schedule making, health programs and athletics. The survey reveals that many types of pro - visions are being made to care for individual differences. . Roughly, these have been classified under three maiu heads, those providing for homogeneous grouping, those' making provision for the care of atypical groups and those organized on the basis of the unit-assign - ment plan. Under this last named group, the survey commission has made a rather detailed study of a considerable number o£ the special - ized types of school organization, such as that suggested by the "Dalton", "Winnetka", "Morrison", "Contract" and "Laboratory" plans. Similarly, the commission has studied the "long unit assignment", the problem or project method and the various types of "individualized instruction" and "supervised study" techniques. It has been dis - covered, according to Dr. Koos, that many schools, while apparently following one or the other of the first mentioned plans above, have deviated very considerably from the original so far as tho latter group of techniques is concerned — that is, those techniques for individualiz - ing instruction. They differ largely in name. The practices being fol - lowed are to all practical purposes quite Identical. Well has the com - mission asked the question, "Why all the terminology?" . Dr. Koos suggests, in the interests of education, the advisability of discarding much of the "jargon". With reference to the library, it is prophesied by the commission that it will become very distinctly one of tho central features of the modern secondary school, serving one of the two major functions, the enrichment of the curriculum through an enlarged amount of reference materials to supplement the textbooks, and further, through an in - creased amount of library materials to meet tho need for more whole - some recreational reading activities. The enlarged program of the library will, of course, necessitate the employment of trained library personnel and the furnishing of much more adequate library quarters. The director of this division, in 1929, as one ol the conclusions to his investigation, of library facilities ' of teacher training institutions, stated that, "One is forced to conclude from the evidences prepared that as yet neither the administrative heads of the libraries nor the administrative executives of teachers, colleges have given to the library budget and its making the thought and consideration that It should receive, if the library is to render its full share of responsibility In the training of teachers." (') The director . further held that the "college library was generally admitted to be the sine qua non of scholarship, both academic and pro - fessional, and that If teaching is to he Interesting, virile and command - ing there will have to be a very complete supplementing' of Its ac - (') Rosenlof, G.

            <seg id="p191">OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION tivities by a live and growing library, properly selected, classified and administered." "If the final test of education." he held, "is to be measured in terms of general intelligence, efficiency and high ideals of citizenship, then, there is a real place and function for the library in EVERY SCHOOL, no matter what may bf&gt; that school's purpose or the type of student it seeks to train." This office is pleased to note that the survey commission has in its findings so completely accorded with this position. D. The Curriculum. Amdng the major findings of the survey were the many tendencies to bring about changes in the curriculum of the secondary schools. Curriculum revision has been a common experience of many people in many schools throughout the land. Many very significant changes as to the minimum requirements to be set up were discovered. Aside from the discoveries of the survey com - mission, we would point to a statement by Dr. Judd of the University of Chicago, recently, in which he called attention to the fact that, whereas in 1890' there were but nine courses of study found in the secondary schools, there are in some of the schools in the United States at the present time as many as 250 courses being offered. One might well comment, if space permitted, upon the necessity for such extensive offerings. The survey revealed very clearly that the number of courses offered had increased since 1910 from 63 to more than 300, the average number of courses offered having doubled, increasing from 24 to 48. Dr. Koos stated that "the dominant shifts tn subjects required of all pupils have been (1) away from foreign language and mathematics and (2) toward the social subjects and physical education". Within the subjects, themselves, and the subject matter groups there were discovered many evidences of modification, the Junior high school movement being in large part responsible for many of these changes. Dr. Koos concluded from these discoveries of curricular change that they were in large part actuated by two influences, one ot which was the desire to meet individual differences and the other the effect of attempting to satisfy changing conceptions of the function of secondary education. To conclude this brief statement, this office would hold that it is obviously too . early to in anywise evaluate the final worth of this investigation. Certain it is that much of its value will depend upon the extent to which the facts revealed will b? capable of utilization in making modifications in our present program of secondary education. Even after the facts, themselves, have thus been utilized, will we have to await the results of the affects of the changed program upon the efficiency of the youth, themselves, who will receive their secondary education under the changed and changing conditions. It is certain, however, that these facts are more acceptable and more reliable as </seg>
            <seg id="p192">REPORT OP STATE SUPERINTENDENT bases upon which to proceed than have been many of the "guesses" and "supposed ideas" of those who have sought to do things but have lacked the necessary information. The Nebraska Situation According to the Nebraska school census figures of June, 1932, there were 422,928 pupils ranging in age from five to twenty-one. - There were enrolled in .the schools 324,241 pupils, of whom 150,447 were in the graded elementary schools, 100,539 in the one-room rural schools and 73,255 in the public high 'schools. Upon the basis of these figures we are perfectly safe In estimating that better than 60 per cent of the boys and girls aged fourteen to eighteen years of age are ac - tually enrolled in our high schools. With the data available it is dif - ficult to make any more specific statement than this. In addition to those aged fourteen to eighteen in our high schools, there are in all probability a large number now in attendance upon our higher insti - tutions of learning. In 1886, it has been lound, there were all told 5404 students enrolled in the high schools in existence at that time. There were but ten schools fully accredited by the University faculty. Sixteen other schools had been recognized to the extent that their graduates were admitted to the second year of the Latin (preparatory) school of the University. Graduates from the high schools in 1888 numbered 424. In 1895 there were in Nebraska 71 three-year high schools and 18 four-year high schools. In 1900 there were 82 high schools fully accredited to the University. The number has continu - ously increased from that time until the present. According to the 1932 figures there were 546 high schools, the graduates of which numbered 14,2 t 40. A comparison of the data from the ten-year period 1923 to 1932 will show that the total high school enrollments have Increased about 37% per cent. The number of accredited high schools has increased 33 per cent; the teaching personnel, 26 per cent; and the number of graduates 80 per cent. It is very evident thr.t the holding power of the Nebraska high schools has more than kept pace with the increased enrollments. Another evidence of the holding power of the secondary schools is revealed by the fact . that, while high school enrollments have increased :!7% per cent, the enrollments in the grades have grown from 323,746 to but 324,241— a difference of only 495, or less than 2 per cent. Another interesting fact with respect to the high school enroll - ments in Nebraska is that the attendance of non-resident students has made some very unusual gains, having increased from 14,529 in 1923 to 22,371 in 1932, or a gain of about 54 per cent. Another interesting comparison is revealed by the fact that, whereas there were 5404 students enrolled in our high schools in 1888, there were more than 13 times as many in 1932; and that, whereas </seg>

            <seg id="p195">OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Nebraska has in its organization of secondary schools kept pace with the growing concept of secondary education. Chief among the evidences of this fact may be mentioned the organization of the Omaha Technical High School, one of the outstanding examples of the special type of high school now in operation in the United States. A number of other communities throughout the state have set up trade schools, under the stimulus of the Smith-Hughes act, the latest figures reveal - ing the fact that there are at the present time 70 communities offer - ing a program of vocational agriculture and an equal number offering a program of vocational home economics. In a number of Nebraska communities, particularly Omaha and, Lincoln, there have been set up evening, or continuation school, programs and trade school activities for adult studies. The Nebraska legislature a number of years ago made provision for the development of adult immigrant education, with the result that Nebraska Tanks among the foremost states in the union in providing for such a program. A complete report of this work is to be found elsewhere. See pages 206 to 221. In still another respect there are many evidences of reorganization of schools and better administrative and supervisory efficiency. The most significant reorganization has been that resulting in the so-called "Junior-senior high school" program. Among the notable instances of such reorganization may be included those which have taken place in Lincoln, Grand Island, Hastings, Fremont, Scoltsbluff, Kearney, North Platte, Beatrice and Norfolk. Nebraska has also taken forward steps in setting up and legalizing the public junior college. Thus far but two communities, McCook and Scottsbluff, have complied with the legal requirements. Informa - tion concerning the enactment of the junior college bill, as well as the statement of standards governing junior colleges, will be found in preceding pages of this report. The Nebraska schools have not lagged In the matter of developing better library facilities. Complete data are not available, however, as to just what has taken place; excepting some information collected by the Nebraska Commission of the North Central Association. These data reveal that Nebraska, according to the reports, expended a total of $32,027.00 in some 125 high schools. This represents an expenditure of about 85c per pupil. Fifty schools spent less than $200.00 for the library. Twenty-six schools spent less than 75c per pupil. Twenty-one schools in Nebraska maintain full-time librarians; 63 high schools reported part-time-teacher librarians; and 40 schools re - ported no librarians at all. Of the 21 full-time librarians, 9 had had no training in the field of library science; 2 reported from 12 to 17 semester hours of library science training; and 10 reported more than </seg>
            <seg id="p196">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 24 semester hours. Of the part-time-teacher librarians, 43 had no training; 13 had from 1 to 5 semester hours of training; 4 had from 6 to 11 semester hours; and 3 were reported as having more than 12 semester hours. By way of comparison, Nebraska's 85c per pupil is somewhat low. For the year 1931-32 the average per pupil was $1.03; in 1930-31 it was $1.29; in 1929-30 it. was $1.10. It is less in 1931-32 than it was in any of the four years preceding. ■ It may be of interest to know that in the schools having 400 to 1000 pupils, of which there are 10 in Nebraska accredited to the North Central Association, it is shown that the per pupil expenditure was 59c, as against an average for the entire group of schools in the North Cen - tral Association states of $1.10 for that particular group. Four of the 10 schools spent less than 75c per pupil. In these 10 schools there are 5 full-time librarians, 3 part-time librarians; 2 of them maintain - ing no librarian at all. Three of these 10 persons had no training, whereas 2 had had more than 4 semester hours. The schools enroll - ing from 200 to 500 pupils expended 93c per pupil for library purposes. This reports books, periodicals, etc., and . not necessarily, the salaries. _. Schools of less than 200 pupils, of which there are 71 in the state,' expended $1.19 per pupil. When one considers that there are but eight communities of more than ten thousand population in the state and but seventeen of more than five thousand population, one can readily understand that the meeting of individual needs through some particular plan of individ - ualized instructional technique is perhaps not so great as has been the case in those states where areas of denser .population exist. Nebraska . high schools are relatively smaller as to enrollments and individual teaching is, therefore, not so serious a problem; at least, it has not been such a problem as to occasion any unusual programs of reorgani - zation for purposes of better adapting instruction to specialized needs. It is fair to state that in all of the larger schools of the state various provisions comprehending those suggested in the National Survey have been provided for. The administrative and supervisory devices utilized in connection with individualized instruction have largely been of the sort cared for by the classroom instructors, themselves, and have rarely occasioned the setting up of any unique organization with all of its personnel and specialized features. There are many evidences throughout the state that classroom teachers have recognized the need for and are conscious of their prob - lem of providing individualized instruction. The rank and the' file of our teachers are giving this problem their attention and, under the leadership of their superintendents and principals, have been meeting </seg>
            <seg id="p197">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION the demands In this regard in a most commendable manner. Not only in Omaha and Lincoln, but in many of the smaller communities, there have been provided many facilities for individualized instruction and thore has also been provided opportunity for educational and vocational guidance comparing very favorably with the best programs to be found anywhere in the country. Revisions in the.curricula of our secondary schools have been made in harmony with the best thought of leaders in education. Changes are being made constantly and will continue to be made in the years immediately ahead of us. A most significant contribution, to the subject matter dealing with curriculum revisions has been the recently published pamphlet by Dr. Knute O. Broady and his associates at the University of Ne - braska, "Practical Procedures for Enriching the Curriculums of Small High Schools." This particular monograph has proven itself to be a most valuable contribution and one which this office is happy to commend to all school leaders. Further revision of the curricula and the development of more de - tailed materials of instruction for use In Nebraska high schools is being contemplated. The committee of seven on revision of the High School Manual has been set up as a continuous body and, with but one or two. changes in the personnel, remains tho same as it was when set up prior to the revision of the High School Manual in 1929. It is expected that during the summer of 1933 a further revision of the High School Manual will be provided for. High School Accreditmeiit The University or Nebraska maintains a list of accredited schools, tho graduates of which are admitted to the University (and to nearly all of the colleges and universities of the United States) without en - trance examinations in any subjects that have been properly certified as completed within these schools. Unless a graduate of an accredited school, the candidate for admission must be prepared to take an ex - amination in those subjects in which entrance credits are desired; provided, that graduates from non-accredited four-year high schools may be excused from taking the academic examinations by passing an intelligence test with a standing- that shows ability to do the work of a college freshman. Accredited schools are such as are found to meet the standards of accreditment, these standards being set forth in de - tail in the High School Manual. There is now but one list of schools fully accredited to the Univer - sity of Nebraska. For the convenience of the smaller communities, however, the University of Nebraska has established a list of minor accredited schools, the graduates of which may receive fourteen units </seg>
            <seg id="p198">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT on credentials, giving them conditional admission to the college. Ad - ditional credit can be secured by examination or by completing satis - factorily thirty college hours of work. By an arrangement entered Into by this department and the Uni - versity of Nebraska, the University Committee on Accredited Schools receives from and accepts reports of school visitation made by the of - ficials of the.

The object of the Association is one of establishing closer relation - ships between the secondary schools and institutions of higher learning within the group of states in the North Central areas as well as such other areas of the United States as the Association elects to recognize. Membership is purely voluntary. There is and- can be no com - pulsion. Any school choosing to become a member of the Association may make application therefor and having been examined by those authorized to make such examination and having been found to meet the standards as set up will be recommended for approval. To quote from the Constitution, "All decisions of the Association bearing on the policy and management of higher and secondary insti - tutions are understood to be advisory in their character." In general the standards for accreditmenl are in all respects higher than those now being set up and maintained by the University of Ne - braska.

The Status of the. Rural Toucher And the High School Normal Training Program 1 School Year 1031-32 In February of 1930, this office presented .at the annual meeting of j the Department of Rural Education of the N. E. A. an address on the subject, "Rural Teacher Preparation in the Agricultural Mid- West", which later appeared as a part of our Thirty-first Biennial Report. (See pages 112 to 119 of that report.) I In 1924, there were practically 6500 rural schools taught by 7255 rural teachers, the enrollments in these schools being reported as al - most 134,000. In 1929, there were 284 less rural schools, 873 less rural teachers and approximately 27,000 less pupils. Our Annual Re - port to the Governor for January, 1932, showed that there were 7255 rural schools taught by 6310 rural teachers, with an enrollment in the 0) Taken from a report presented to the county superintendents in session at Lincoln in January, 1932. </seg>
            <seg id="p207">OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION one-room rural schools of 102,125 pupils. This, however, does not include the pupils enrolled in the two-teacher and open-country con - solidated schools, for which data are not available. "Whilo the figures show a decrease in each of these items, in the number of districts as well as teachers and pupils, the amount of the decrease is. not very pronounced. As was indicated in our former investigation, industrialization and its attendant tendency to urbanization, together with improved high - ways and better means of transportation, are important factors in the elimination of these one- and two-room rural schools. The lessened number of children of elementary school age found in the rural areas has also been an important factor. Conditions two years ago were shown to have been very materially stabilized in Nebraska, and our most recent figures Just cited would seem to indicate that we have reached a plateau, so to speak, in the descriptive curve of growth and development. - There is no gainsaying the fact, as we formerly indicated, that the training of so large a number of teachers for our rural schools has constituted a very serious problem in Nebraska. Just now in the midst .of economic difficulties and the clamor being heard on every side for reductions in the cost of public education, we are more than ever constrained to believe that our problem is one of exceeding im - portance. ■ To the end that we might have data that are characteristic of the present situation and that may be used for comparative' purposes with the data secured in 1929-30, our office sent out a second inquiry blank to county superintendents calling for aomewhat identical information to that requested two years earlier. The response to this second in - quiry has been most satisfying, and with the exception of two every county superintendent sent to this office the information we were wanting. '■ May we direct attention to the figures? Kxpcrience Eighty-six of the 93 counties whose reports were used in this in - vestigation showed that of the 5756 teachers in the one-room rural schools, 24.1 per cent of the entire number, or 1385 teachers, were new, inexperienced teachers who had done no teaching other than prac - tice teaching prior to the present academic year. In other words, prac - tically 25 per cent, or one-fourth of the teachers, in the one-room rural schools were new to the profession. Add to this number 1217 per - sons who had but one year of experience prior to this year and we find that 46.2 per cent of the teachers in the rural schools were new to the teaching profession. Approximately 26.3 per cent of the teachers in the one-room rural schools had taught four years or more. The figures show that some improvement has been made during the two years In </seg>
            <seg id="p208">REPORT OP STATE SUPERINTENDENT the matter of retaining teachers in the profession. Two years earlier, the number of inexperienced teachers was a trifle less than 30 per cent, whereas for the number having had one year of experience prior to the year for which the investigation was made the percentage was shown to be 21.1 per cent. The improvement amounts to about 6 per cent. That is to say, 5 per cent more of the. teachers remained in the profession than was true two yearB before. We were, however, still faced with the task of supplying about 1500 teachers for the one - room rural schools each year. That this number will in all probability be less for next year is undoubted. The extent to which the economic situation tended to compel teachers to remain in tho one-room rural schools cannot be safely asserted. That it has had its effect is, ; without doubt, true. In the two-teacher rural schools, 11.3 per cent of the teachers were new and inexperienced and 14.6 per cent had had one year of exper - ience. On the other hand, almost 50 per cent had had four or more years of experience. In a' similar manner in the open-country con - solidated schools the number with no previous experience remained practically the same, whereas those with one year of previous experi - ence dropped five points and those with two years of previous experi - ence dropped almost 11 points. On the other hand, the number with more than five years experience practically doubled, representing a change from 18.9 per cent to 36 per cent. To sum up the situation, it would 3eem, therefore, that the com - plexion of the rural teaching forces of tho state is, slightly improved so far as experience is concerned. Teacher Tenure and Turnover Two years earlier, it was shown that 61.7 per cent of the teachers for whom we had reports were new to their positions, either having come in as new teachers in the profession or as having moved from one school to another. This year the number of teachers new to their present positions dropped to 53.5 per cent, a reduction of 8.2 per cent. The number teaching their second year in the same position two years ago was shown to represent 24.8 per cent. This year it is shown to be 29 per cent. The number teaching their third year in the same position two years ago was 7.5 per cent. At the time of this report it is 11 per cent. Two years ago, 86.5 per cent of the teachers moved from one position to another in the course of two years: In 1931-32 the percentage is shown to be 82.6 per cent, showing a slight change in favor of a longer tenure. Again we account for these changes, in some measure because of our present economic situation. Training Whereas in 1929-30, 35.5 per cent of the teachers in the one-room rural schools had high school normal training only, we find that In 1931-32 the percentage has dropped to 27.8 per cent, or 7.7 per cent </seg>
            <seg id="p209">...,. ; . OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION decrease. Add to this percentage of 27.8 the percentage ol those who have had from six to eighteen weeks of college but not a full year of such training and you find that 63.2 per cent of the teachers In the one-room rural schools did not meet what many students of education have said Is a minimum of training e33ential to teaching in the one - room rural schools, that is, one year of college. By the same token, however, we can say that at least 36 to 37 per cent, or slightly more than one-third of all of the teachers in the one-room rural schools had from one year to four years of college training. In fact, 34 per cent of them had one or two years of college. These figures show very definitely an improvement over the earlier figures. At that time the number who had had less than one year of college was shown to be equal to slightly more than 70 per cent in tho entire teaching personnel In the one-room rural school. An improvement of at least 10 per cent in this regard has been made In the past two years Salaries Two years ago, a slightly different scale of distribution was used, grouping the teachers In six classifications with a range of salaries within each classification somewhat larger and not always uniform. For example, we found that approximately 7 per cent of the teachers received less than $75 per month and that 17.8 per cent received $76 to $79 per month and that 34.6 per cent received $80 to $89 per month. And 24.6 per cent received $80 to $99 per month, 12.9 per cent received $100 to $109, and 3 per cent received more than $110 per month. In our later study we made the distribu - tions range from $50 to $59, $60 to $69, etc., with the result that we can report that one-tenth of 1 per cent received less than $50, 1.2 per cent from $50 to $69, 10.5 per cent from $60 to $69, 31.6 per cent from $70 to $79, 31.5 per cent from $80 to $89, 16 per cent from $90 to $99, 7.1 per cent from $100 to $109, 1.9 per cent from $110 to $119, and .6 per cent received $120 or more. The median salary was $82.27 per month, or $740.43 per year. Fifty per cent of the teachers re - ceived salaries ranging from $74.03 per month to $90.39 per month. Twenty-five per cent of the teachers received more than $90 per month, whereas the other 25 per cent received less than $74 per month. County Wide Variations From the standpoint of the several counties, there Is very little uniformity as to the data presented. (a) Taking experience first, we find that Keith County reported that but 9.1 per cent of its teachers were new and Inexperienced. Logan County reported 11.7 per cent. Dawes County reported 12 per cent and Banner County reported 12.6 per cent. At the other extreme, Loup County reported 50 per cent of Its teachers new and Inexperi - enced; Sarpy County, 40.7 per cent; McPherson, 35.7 per cent; Blaine, Dakota and Harlan each had 33.3 per cent new and Inexperienced </seg>
            <seg id="p210">REPORT OP STATE SUPERINTENDENT teachers. Box Butte County reported but 21.9 per cent of its teachers as new to the profession during the past two years. Next in rank was Thomas County with 23.1 per cent; Banner County, 29.2 per cent; Logan, 27.4 per cent; and Custer County, 29.6 per cent. " But what of the other extreme? Wheeler County, for example, showed that 69 per cent of its entire teaching force in the one-room rural schools were new to their profession last year or this year. Thayer County's report in - dicated that 62.1 per cent were new either last year or this year. Saline reported 59.8 per cent; Sherman, 58.8 per cent; and Loup, 67.2 per cent. . Nemaha County showed that 55.7 per cent of its teachers were new either this year or last. . (b) Turning to teacher tenure and turnover, we find that in Grant County, 88.9 per cent of the teachers in the one-room rural schools are new to their, positions this year. That is to say, they are in their present teaching positions fOT the first year. Eighty-two per cent of the teachers in McPherson County arc new to their present positions. Eighty per cent of the teachers in. Arthur County and Scotts Bluffs County are new to their positions. At the other extreme we find Saline County with 24.5 per cent and Colfax County with 28 per cent; Douglas County with 29 per cent. Obviously, these are the counties in which moving from one school to another is less pro - nounced. (c) In the matter of training, we find that in Douglas County there was not a teacher in the one-room rural schools but that had had sAme college training. As a matter of fact, the lowest preparation reported in Douglas County for one-room rural teachers is eighteen weeks of college work, there being six teachers with that as the mini - mum preparation. Fifteen teachers, on the other hand, are shown to have had one year, and seventeen teachers have had two years or more. Other counties rating high in regard to the number of teachers with high school normal training only which we might mention were Grant County with 2.2 per cent, Banner County with 4.1 per cent. Hooker with 5 per cent, Burt County with .5.4 per cent, Saunders County with 5.4 per cent, Cass County with 6 per cent, Dawes with 6.1 per cent, and Scotts Bluff with 6.7 per cent. At the other extreme, Hamilton reported 70.8 per. cent; Sherman, 61 per cent; Greeley, 55.2 per cent; Polk, 53.5 per cont; Keya Paha, 50 per cent; Loup, 50 per cent. There are many who hold, as has already been indicated, that the minimum of preparation of rural teachers should be one year of col - lege training, the present ideal being set at two years of college train- Ing above the high school level. Grant County, for example, reported 1.1 per cent of its teachers with one year or better. On the other hand, it reported only 2.2 per cent of its teachers to be graduates of high school normal training departments. A large part of its teach - </seg>

Hayes County reported 4.4 per cent of one year or better of college training; Butler County, 6.2 per cent; Gosper, 7.1 per cent; Keya Palm, 8 per cent. At the other extreme, Douglas County reported 8.4.2 per cent of its teachers in the one-room rural schools with one year or more of college training. Wayne County reported 83.6 per cent; Saunders, 71.6 per cent; Dawes County, 71.2 per cent; Merrick County, 68 per cent. For the state at large, 27.8 per cent of the 5604 teachers for whom reports were received were high school normal training graduates only. Twenty-two and nine-tenths (22.9) per cent had one year of college training; 11.3 per cent had two years of college training; 1.9 per cent had three years of college training and .7 per cent had four years of college training. One teacher with a Master's degree was teaching in a one-room rural school in Wayne County. All told, 36.8 per cent of the 5604 teachers in the one-room rural' schools, or 2609 teachers, had one year of college training, or better. Two years earlier we re - ported that 29.3 per cent of the 4727 teachers in the one-room rural schools, which per cent represents a total of 1388 teachers, had one year or more of college. One can very quickly see from these figures that a considerable improvement has been made. (d) And, finally, what of the salary schedules in the various counties? You will observe that Douglas County ranks first with a median •salary schedule of $106.92. At the far we3tern end of the state was Kimball County with a median of $100.67 per month. Box Butte County reports a median of $99.20. Scott? Bluff reports $97.00; Thurston, $95.31; Arthur, $93.12; Deuel, $93.57. Again, Thayer County's median salary was $70.88; Wheeler County, $71.15; Gar - field County, $72.00; Keya Paha, $72.27; Rock, $73.09. . . 1 . Summary Such are the statistical items in this report. Statistics, however, are not in and of themselves of the most significance, unless we attempt something of an interpretation of these statistics and make known what in our minds are their implications. , . ■ ! '; ' In the. first place, there is no gainsaying the fact that the status of the teacher in the one-room rural school as regards experience has been materially improved. Whereas the typical teacher two years earlier than the date of this report was shown to have had two years of experience, the typical teacher at this time seems to have had slightly less than two and one-half years of experience. In 1929-1930 the typical teacher as regards tenure and turnover was new to her position, 6 2 out of every 100 being thus classed. At the time of this </seg>
            <seg id="p212">REPORT OP STATE SUPERINTENDENT report, 53 out of each 100 were new to their positions. In the matter of training, whereas the typical teacher had approximately ten. weeks of college work beyond the high school level, the typical teacher in 1931-1932 had practically thirteen weeks; and in the matter of salaries, whereas the typical teacher in 1929-1931 received an average of $95.00 per month, or $855.00 per year, the teachers two years later were receiving somewhat less than this. In fact, the average salary is approximately $83.00, the median salary being $82.27. One-fourth of our teachers received less than $75.00 a month. Another one-fourth received more than $90.00 per month. The general reduction indicates that teachers received from $10.00 to $16.00 a month less than was true in 1929-1931. Conclusions What are the conclusions to be drawn from these figures? Briefly stated they are these: First, the continuance of the high school normal training program has not, so far as we have been able to study our data, in anywise interfered with the normal improvement of the status of our teachers from the standpoint of experience, tenure, or training. We do not believe that its continuance is at all a factor responsible for the rather large decrease in salaries paid. 'We are not unmindful of the fact that the present economic crisis has been responsible for teachers re - maining in their positions longer than would be the case were times more nearly normal. We do believe that the reduction in salaries Is - very largely, if not altogether, chargeable to the economic- conditions of the times and will be during the coming year or two. Second, it is not true that the high school normal training classes, have been furnishing an ever-increasing flood of teachers for rural school positions. As a matter of fact, there has been a rather whole - some decrease in the number of students registering for high school normal training and In the number actually certificated. The number of schools offering normal training has slightly but gradually been decreasing. We prophesy a larger difference in the future. In fact, there were five less schools in 1931-1932 than for the year preceding. The number of students enrolled in 1930-1931 was 227 less than the year before and 486 less than in 1928. The number of senior normal' trainers reported to have been recognized as graduates, not neces - sarily certificated, has decreased at least 7 per cent. For the year closing December 1, 1931, 1131 Third Grade Elementary Certificates - were issued. Of this 1131, 800 represent certificates issued to high school normal trainers. For the two years preceding, 2770 such cer - tificates were issued, or approximately 1400 each year. You will note - here a very considerable decrease in the number of certificates of the? Third Grade Elementary type. </seg>
            <seg id="p213">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Third, we are still of the opinion that tho high school normal train - ing program can justifiedly be continued on the basis of its haying laid the groundwork of professional training that has been most effective in our rural schools. We are still of the opinion that this program is distinctly cultural and has stimulated in a most remarkable degree the desires of students to continue .their college training as rapidly as possible. The students graduating from these high school normal training classes' have almost invariably represented the best students in our high schools, and represent individuals whose achievements as college students have been outstanding. As indicated heretofore, the fact that there were 1580 new teachers and the -further fact that there were only 1670 reporting no college training, one is forced to conclude that high school normal training has and does stimulate college training. Fourth, not only on the basis of the statistics prepared above, but on the basis of Mr. Cushing's reports concerning certification, we must conclude that our high school normal training classes are still fur - nishing the bulk of the teachers for the one-room rural schools. Mr. Cushing's report made on January 1, 1932, indicates that during the year of December 1, 1930 to December 1, 1931, three of the state teachers colleges- reported the issuance of 327 General Elementary certificates. Two schools reported tho Issuance of S3 Elementary Rural Certificates. Of the other incorporated schools authorized to issue certificates, and we refer here to the University as well as to the private, denominational schools of the state, there were an addi - tional 103 General Elementary Certificates it-sued. Mr. Cushing fur - ther reported that there were registered in these same colleges 195 persons who were applicants for the General Elementary Certificate. It must be borne in mind that the General Elementary Certificate is not issued, necessarily, to individuals who are being specifically trained for the rural field. Aside from the four 3tate teachers colleges, no spe - cific divisions of rural teacher training have been set up. The four state teachers colleges have each developed certain courses uniquely adaptable to rural conditions and intended to fit persons for teaching in rural positions. The Elementary Rural Certificates, for example, of which there were only 83 issued by the four, schools, are issued primarily to' those persons who' have completed at least one year of college work and have completed certain specific courses. The Gen - eral Elementary Certificate, on the other - hand, does not, necessarily, imply that one has made specific training for teaching in tbe rural field. We do' not believe that our state teacher training institutions have as yet sufficiently organized departments of rural education, nor have they as yet made these departments sufficiently attractive, to en - courage larger numbers of persons to enter upon the courses and com - plete the prescribed curricula which are intended fo prepare them for teaching in the rural schools. This is a characteristic condition not typical of Nebraska alone but quite typical of many of the teachers colleges in our mid-western agricultural states. </seg>
            <seg id="p214">REPORT OP STATE SUPERINTENDENT Fifth, we are of the opinion that high school normal training is definitely a necessary program and that it will be so for several years to come. That being the case, this office will continue to very defi - nitely perfect the program, to more completely organize and supervise the work in these high school normal training classes in order that the product from these classes may continue to improve. Sixth, the institution of a course in rural sociology and economics has provided very definitely a means of acquainting our young people with rural community life, social, moral and economic. These young people have a much more sympathetic attitude toward rural life and rural conditions and have in a very real way stimulated the commun - ities in which they have been serving to carry on in a much finer way. Agriculture, as we have said before, is very distinctly a "mode of life", and we are exceedingly hopeful that this new course in rural sociology and economics will provide better means and v.-ill stimulate our young people to more effectively raise the standards of living in our rural communities. Seventh, we are definitely of the opinion, as revealed from the many statistics which were made available to us during the last session of the legislature, that the communities now offering high school nor - mal training are 90 per cent strong for ita continuance, so long as there is an apparent demand upon the part of the young people for such training and so long as any portion of these young people can be definitely located in rural teaching positions. On the other hand, we must definitely conclude that where there is not a sufficient number of desirable students willing and anxious to take a high school normal training course and where there is any ap - preciable degree of difficulty in these persons securing a teaching position, then, it becomes the duty and the responsibility of the local communities to most carefully investigate the situation and to take the initiative in making a decision as to whether the course shall or shall not be continued. We are definitely of the opinion that In a number of counties there do exist at the present time too many nor - mal training classes. If each county superintendent, in conference with her normal training school leaders, will sit down and study their situation from the standpoint of the demand for the training and the opportunity for securing positions after having been trained, they can in a co - operative manner decide upon a desirable solution. This office wel - comes the opportunity to advise with the county superintendent and the local school authorities involved to the end that proper steps may be taken to adapt the program to the needs of the communities concerned. Eighth, there is no gainsaying the fact that the weight of evidence a Tear ago as shown by the reports from the county superintendents,. </seg>
            <seg id="p215">OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION themselves, was preponderantly favorable to the high school normal training program. This office sincerely appreciates the many com - mendatory expressions of the county superintendents relating to the effectiveness of the program and the apparent efficiency of the high school normal training seniors, as evidenced in their success as teachers in the rural schools. Ninth, in a very real sense the present economic crisis does of itself justify the continuance of the program. There is no doubt at all but that many hundreds of young people now being trained in our high school normal training classes could not possibly afford to secure their training in one of our teacher training institutions beyond the high school level. Their inability to secura such training, by reason of the expense involved- and that other factor of decreased salaries, would so operate as to deprive the schools ol many, young persons thoroughly imbued with the life and the spirit of the rural community and completely in sympathy with the task ot rural school teaching. Tenth, whether the next step in the training of rural teachers is the setting up of a fifth year program we are not in a position to say at this time. A number of' states are experimenting with this pro - cedure just now and are establishing so-called county training school programs for the training of rural teachers. We refer to Michigan and Mlnnesota as two of the outstanding states now trying out this plan. There is a considerable difference of opinion as to -the justification of the fifth year idea, some holding that it is definitely invading the field of college training and to that extent not justified. Some are looking upon the junior college program as the organization that can most ef - fectively handle this problem. And, of course, we must maintain that the ideal plan "is to limit all teacher training to our teacher training institutions organized on the college level. We would conclude by saying that, in our judgment, we cannot completely overturn the pro - gram of teacher, training for the rural 3chools. We are still of the opinion that until we have had an adequate and careful analysis of the whole program of teacher training within the state, covering every phase of that program, we should not do anything that is in any sense revolutionary. Our whole basis for this statement is the fact that we must, after all, consider first the welfare of the rural schools, them - selves, and to do anything that will result in lowering the efficiency of our teachers in these schools would be detrimental to the develop - ment of education in Nebraska. At no time have we ever insisted, nor do we now insist, that high school normal training is an ideal pro - gram. Ideally speaking, our rural teachers should come from our higher institutions of learning. We must continue to look upon high school normal- training as a practical expedient and as representing In a fair way a solution of a practical and pressing problem. We will continue to look forward, however, to the time when the practical solution becomes the ideal — when the ideal program becomes practicable. </seg>

Veterans of Foreign Wars Address delivered by the Honorable R. A. Kirkpatrick, President of the National Americanism . Congress at the Americanization Meeting. "Chairman Judge Dineen, honorable judges, members of the patriotic organizations of the city of Omaha, ladies and gen - tlemen: ■ . . "We are assembled here this evening for the purpose of wit - nessing the transition of this splendid group of men and- women, who have until now been aliens in this land of ours, into Ameri - can citizens. I desire to dwell, briefly upon the reasons for their desire to become American citizens. I think that I can best do this by citing the application to their and our lives of some of the modes, the principles and the ideals of our national life. "A few years ago on a cold, rainy morning I saw a consid - erable body of men and women, Omaha's citizens, stand bare - headed in the rain in one of our down-town streets in respect and reverence for the splendid symbol of American liberty, the old Liberty Bell from Independence Hall. There is no magic, no peculiar construction, no entrancing beauty in the old Liberty Bell that would call these people forth, shivering in discomfort, to pay homage or reverence to it. These people were there be - cause of the things that the old Liberty Bell stands for, the pa - triotic desire, the ideals and the inspiration that has been asso - ciated with it. These were the things that drew our men and women from their homes and places of business on this occasion. The same desires, the precious sentiments and the high ideals of our national life that have been entwined by history around the old Liberty Bell are the same that have motivated the hearts of this group of men and women in their desire to become Ameri - can citizens. Let us see what some of these conditions are. You will recall that during the winter of 1776 and 1777, after the Declaration of Independence had been signed a great military drive was inaugurated by the British forces to annihi - late and destroy an American. army. You will recall how early in the year of 1777 Washington and his little army was caught in a bend of the Delaware River near Trenton a river swollen and turbulent; filled with great cakes of floating ice. making it impossible to carry his army in safety to the opposite shore by a greatly superior force which under Cornwallis' direction took the strategic formation of a half -moon thus completing a great circle about the little Continental array's camp. You will also recall how a considerable number of troops was placed at Princeton, 30 miles in the rear of the British line to be used as shock troops, should Washington in desperation fight his way through the British lines. Picture in your minds the little group of men calling themselves the American army completely sur - rounded by a greatly superior force on one side and an impas - sable river on the other. See the little council of war called in Washington's tent for the purpose of discussing the terms of their surrender. As you stand grouped about the conference table you feel the wind change and a great chilly blanket of </seg>

While the dis - cussion is still being carried on this blanket of fog completely envelops the little camp. Washington senses the opportunity to escape. He. hurriedly orders a huge bonfire builded.

Then, while the British pickets were laughing at the feeble efforts of the Ameri - can soldiers to keep themselves warm (as they supposed) by one single little bon-flre, Washington and his men with only such equipment as they could carry upon their backs stole silently down the river and past the Southern end of the great half moon and were saved. You remember how in the early hours EL?™ n aW * n&gt; ftor northing all through the. night, weary and Hungry and cold, they approached the little city of Princeton and ran face to face with this body of shock troops which Corn - wallis Had left there.

The fate of American liberty hung m the balance Undaunted by overwhelming oddt and the liscouragement of his own men Washington sprang to his saddle and rode his horse to within 30 yarfls— 90 feet— of the British line and stayed there while they fired volley after volley His horse feir beneath him.

These few scattered, crawling away through the tall grass on their hands and knees and then lay In wait for the dawn when they were to march against the outposts of the Confederate army at the -foot of the mountain. Every man of them knew that this meant death, yet in all the long hours of the night while they lay hidden In this grass watching for the first glow of the coming dawn not a man wavered, not a man re - treated, not a man deserted. Just before dawn they gathered to - gether in a little group to discuss the best way of carrying out their part of the plan and as the morning light came stealing down the mountain sides they saw Old Glory at the head of the Federal Army swinging up the sides of the mountain. General Grant, not knowing that his plan had failed, had ordered the general attack. The little group of men catching sight of their flag moving steadily forward felt that the time of their sacri - fice had arrived and springing up they started for the enemy's lines at the southern end of the mountain. A terrific cross fira again mowed them down. Not a man was left. "The thought comes to me as I look into the faces of this class tonight that they too have a responsibility, in many in - stances equal to that of the men who so nobly laid down their lives at Missionary Ridge. That these men and women also have duties to perform, that they have responsibilities in civic affairs in community life, in business contacts that as American citi - zens they cannot fail to assume. "Other men and women have at various times assembled in this court room for the purpose that has brought us together here tonight. I recall little Guiseppo Benedito, the school boy that Mrs. Christiancy, principal of the Mason school, discovered among her pupils. I assisted on the occasion that this boy's mother was given her citizenship papers in this very room I also assisted on thi occasion when the boy himself became 'an American citizen in this room. Many of us will recall the great struggle the little Guiseppo Benedito had in the world. Many of us know that today he ranks as America's greatest lyric tenor, that his voice is charming millions of admirers throughout the land. I have no doubt that much of the inspiration that has driven him forward against the discouragements of poverty arose from his loyalty to the American flag. "I recall also Gabriel Shada, the little Arab boy, born in a camel skin tent that had been dragged over the weary miles of desert of Arabia and finally halted some 25 miles from Bethle - hem where Christ was born for the birth of Gabriel. Gabriel Shada a few year ago marched down this aisle to receive his citizenship papers. He has educated himself, a gradu - ate of law at Creighton University, admitted to the bar In the State of Nebraska and now holds a responsible position with the Union Pacific Railroad Company. "I recall the little Jewish boy Irvin Stahlmaster. who came here from Russia, who has educated himself, was given his nat - "f* If*" 8 «»; this very room, who was for a while Dis - trict Judge in Douglas County and now is Assistant Attorney General of this great commonwealth. </seg>

            <seg id="p228">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT "I also recall Benjamin Lightner who became an American citizen before the war, who served voluntarily during the war, sacrificing both legs and one arm for the flag he had sworn to protect. . . "I might continue enumerating similar cases but it is not necessary for me to do so. . "I desire very much, however, to call attention to a group of five women who last year were chosen as the best home-makers in the State of Nebraska. Three of these women were born of fathers and mothers who came to America from foreign soil. Last year the Agricultural Department of our State University chose the ten "Master Farmers" of the" State of Nebraska. Seven of these men were born of fathers and mothers who came to Amer - ica from foreign lands. "Now you men and women who are tonight becoming citizens of our country will not, all of you, be chosen as the best home - makers or the "Master Farmers" of our state. You will not, all of you, become Guiseppo Beneditos, Gabriel Shadas, Irvin Stahl - masters or Benjamin Ligthners but you can do so if you wish. The possibility of your equalling their record lies wholly within yourself. They had ho better brains or blood than you. Amer - ica offers you an opportunity and my heart thrills with pride when I dwell upon the fact that I live in a country where men and women are able to do what these men and women have done. "One more word and then I'm through. People do as they see others do. I recently spoke to a group of Chinese business - ' men in San Francisco. The Chinese people cannot become citi - zens of this country yet I was asked to speak to them on the subject of American citizenship. None of them understood the English language so I spoke to them through an interpreter. A rather amusing incident occurred. You remember how the Chin - ese people sing their sentences when they talk. Well, I would speak a few words and the interpreter would sing them to the audience. We got along splendidly for a little while and then I caught myself singing my speech just as the interpreter was sing - ing it except that I was singing in English. The point I wish to bring out is this: Other people are going to do as they see you doing. It is therefore important that you do things rightly, that you think cleanly, that you live true lives as American citi - zens. I thank you." The following chart gives the illiteracy statistics as presented by counties in "Table 13" of the "Population Bulletin for Nebraska, 15th Census of the United States, 1930." The Census definition of literacy is ability to read and write in any language, not necessarily English. Individuals 10 years old and over not having this ability are classified as illiterate.

Agricultural Education (a) Evening Agricultural Classes Evening classes, giving systematic instruction in agriculture to adults who have already entered the vocation of farming, are prac - ticable wherever there is a department of Vocational Agriculture. Methods of farming are changing constantly with the developments in machinery, discovery of new facts and the consumer's demands and standards of living. Progress depends upon the rapidity with which the farmer changes his thinking and operations to meet new condi - tions. His adjustment will be in direct proportion to new knowledge gained. The Evening Class in agriculture offers an opportunity for the farmer to obtain this new knowledge. A local school maintaining a de - partment of Vocational Agriculture may through Evening Classes ex - tend its Influence and usefulness in the community. The classes are organized and taught by the regular all-day agri - culture instructor. The number of such classes is Increasing. The amount of State and Federal aid is based upon the number of classes and their duration. </seg>

(c) Part-Time Agricultural Schools Part-time schools are feasible in many districts in which Day Vo - cational Agriculture Schools are maintained. They offer suitable schooling to the large group of boys between the ages of 14 and 21 who are not regularly enrolled in high school, many of whom have dropped out because the courses did not seem to meet their needs. In the Part-time School these boys may receive Instruction in agri - culture and related subjects during the farmer's "slack season." The work is largely concerned with "doing things" rather than book atudy. Laboratory and shop work constitute a large part of the course. The Part-time School may so Interest many Doys that they ■will return to complete, the high school course for graduation. The Part-time School should be considered by school districts in - terested in the out-of-school group of farm boys. « </seg>

(a) Evening Trade and Industrial Classes i With the inevitable shift of the balance of population towards ci - ties, trade and industrial pursuits are becoming more important in Nebraska. To prepare ambitious men and women in these fields for lives of greater service and promotion the public schools are offering evening classes giving specific trade extension instruction — that is instruction directly related to their daily callings. These classes are conducted in schools, shops or industrial plants with practical men and women as instructors. They are offering instruction to persons over sixteen years of age now obliged to be self-supporting and entitled to such schooling. Courses were offered in such subjects as nurses' chemistry, nurses' bacteriology, nurses' psychology, blue print reading, practical tele - phony, locomotive operation, electricity, ox-welding, A. R. A. rules, car air, acetylene welding, electric welding, garage welding, industrial welding, steam fitters' welding, .metallography for welders, engineers' welding, radio, radio repair, essentials of telephone electricity, tele - phone cable and exchange work, I.

(&lt;•) Part-time General Continuation Schools Under the laws of Nebraska, the board of education in any school district having fifteen or more children between the ages of fourteen and sixteen who hola employment permits which are in force must establish part-time classes giving Instruction to such permit holders for eight hours per week. When part-time classes are- established permit holders are required to attend, while the classes are open upon a vol - untary basis for all others between 14 and 16. At the present time, Omaha is the only city having a large enough number of employed boys aud girls to warrant, organizing a separate part-time school. The schedule of instruction in the part-time school is not fixed, as the pupils enrolled are of varying ages and scholastic attainment. They are employed In a variety of jobs and their experiences are those of workers rather than chilcren. Consequently, to make the school best serve their need, it is organized on an opportunity school basis to give , the pupil the things he needs and can profit by most. Courses were, offered in such subjects as English, mathematics, civics, drawing, shop, home economics and hygiene. Federal and School State Aid Omaha $ 2,819.45 </seg>

III. HOME ECONOMICS EDUCATION (a) Adult Home Making Classes A vocational homemaking department has not attained its maxi - mum service in a community unless it extends its service to the home - makers as well as to the students In the high school. It is not neces - sary however that a day school program be maintained in order to have homemaking classes organized for homemakers. The majority of the classes meet in the afternoon. Many of them meet in the morning. Only a few meet at night. They are organized in short units of six to ten lessons in any phase of homemaking where a sufficient number of homemakers desire the work and a teacher can be secured. ■ ■ Classes in home management, child care, nutrition, parent educa - tion, mental hygiene, art in home and clothing and clothing selection are discussion classes. Cooking classes," supper classes, sewing, dress - making and home health are laboratory classes. As the homemakers complete one unit they are offered the . opportunity to enroll in ad - vanced unit courses. Parent education classes, nutrition classes and mental hygiene classes have been organized for both men and women. The classes are taught by the home economics instructor or some other person selected by the superintendent of schools. Detailed information on adult homemaking education is given in Bulletin No. 26, published by the State Board for' Vocational Educa - tion. "•"■■. </seg>

(b) Part-Time Home Economics Schools Part-time schools for rural girls may be organized to give train - ing to the girls who must remain at home to help with the farm and house work. Schools which are equipped to teach Home Economics can offer part-time work to girls in their own district and to tuition students at a small expense. A special teacher is needed to conduct the work. A course may be from six weeks to four months in length. (c) All-Day Home Economics Schools Home Economics training is an essential part of the general edu - cation of every girl. Courses in the day schools are at least two years in length. They are planned to give the girls training in the home - making responsibilities they should be carrying at present, and to lay a foundation for a continued development in homemaking. Each year's work includes units in social and family relationships; personal hygiene; food preparation on the meal basis; clothing selection, con - struction and care; and child care and development. The subject mat - ter in each unit is selected and organized, by the home economics teacher so it will be most practical for each community. Home projects are a part of each year's work. In addition to units in home economics, the course includes in - struction in art applied to clothing, house furnishings and decorating problems; science related to home problems; and physiology. </seg>

Rehabilitation Division The Need for Rehabilitation of Disabled Persons . The vocational adjustment of persons disabled by .disease, acci - dent or ether wise has always presented a difficult economic problem. The mechanization and speeding up of industrial and agricultural pro - duction bringing about more stringent physical requirements of work - ers has increased its seriousness. Concurrent with the increasing use of machines and faster produc - tion methods in industry and agriculture and with the introduction of the motor vehicle and greater speed In modes of travel has come a tre - mendous increase in the number of those disabled by accidents. An accident survey conducted for a period of two and one-half years by the Rehabilitation Division in cooperation with The Nebraska Press Association showed that 10,000 people are being severely injured by accidents in Nebraska each year and of this number at least 500 will be permanently disabled. </seg>
            <seg id="p246">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Surveys conducted during the past three years by the Rehabilita - tion Division in cooperation with the Crippled Children Committee of the State Elks Association and the State Department of Public Wel - fare show that there are at. least 5,000 crippled children in Nebraska. Ten clinics for the examination of crippled children conducted by thir - ty-eight County Medical Societies in cooperation with the Rehabilita - tion Division and the State Elks Association, during the past two years, indicate that at least 60% or 3000 of these crippled children have never had but can be benefited by orthopedic corrections. The dependent condition of many of these people creates an econ - omic load which "vocational rehabilitation of disabled persons," sup - ported by joint State and . Federal appropriations, is designed to re - lieve by assisting physically handicapped persons to prepare them - selves to engage In occupations whereby they may become self-sup - porting citizens. How It Is Conducted Through the accident reporting system which analyzes accident re - ports appearing in all issues of Nebraska's weekly and daily news - papers and through maintenance of close contact with the State De - partment of Compensation, Crippled Children Clinics and large cen - tral hospitals, the names of persons handicapped by accidents and disabling diseases are reported to this oftice. Many people reported are too badly disabled to warrant any at - tempt to prepare them for new occupations. Those, however, who are eligible for Buch assistance as the division can give and who can rea - sonably be expected to succeed in some, new (Vocation, are assisted in the selection of new lines of work- and provided special training in shops, in factories, in businesses- or in either public or private schools. The training courses are made to fit the requirements of each indivi - dual. After disabled persons are properly prepared for occupations in which their physical disabilities will not prevent them from earning a livelihood, officers of the rehabilitation Division assist them to find employment where they will be given a chance to make good. Those Who Have Been Aided Since the Rehabilitation Division was established eleven years ago, more than 550 Nebraska citizens, who were disabled by accidents In industry, in agriculture, In public or home life, by disease or from con - genital causes, have been placed in occupations by which they are suc - cessfully earning a livelihood. Many of these people were high school students with no previous vocational experience. - - </seg>
            <seg id="p247">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Other physically handicapped persons who have been rehabilitated are adults most of whom were workers with dependent families at the time they were disabled by accidents or disease. During the last three years, 2464 new reports of disabled persons have been received. 1479 persons were reported through the accident survey; 765 crippled children were reported through the crippled chil - dren survey and examined in the ten crippled children clinics; and 220 additional reports were received from other sources. In eleven years, it has cost J245.376.56 to rehabilitate more than 550 disabled persons. The Federal government has paid half of this cost. The average total cost per person was 1446.14. The yearly earn - ings of a rehabilitated person average *900.00. The total earnings of _____ the persons rehabilitated in Nebraska by the eleven-year program of the Rehabilitation Division are almost a half million dollars a year.

            <seg id="p249">. OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION NEBRASKA PUBLIC LIBRARY COMMISSION Nellie 31. Carey, Secretary, Nebraska Public Library Commission " (Introduction by State Superintendent) The State Superintendent of Public Instruction is an ex-offlcio mem - ber of the Nebraska Public Library Commission. While the Commission has been handicapped by lack of funds dur - ing the past biennium in rendering the service which the public ex - pected, yet we have been very much impressed with the amount and value of work which the Library Commission has been doing and par - ticularly with the outstanding service which It has been rendering to the schools of the state. Its service to the rural schools and schools in smaller towns and villages has been the only library service those schools have had. While many of the cities of the state have library services available to the schools of the local community, the fact re - mains that the seven thousand rural schools of the state have no library service, except that given by their own inadequate supply of library books. This is also true for many of the smaller towns and villages Added library service is very much needed for the schools of the state outside of the larger cities. We- are happy to include herewith a short resume of the work done by the Library Commission. The Increasing demands and requests for the services of the Commission speak eloquently of the need of this edu - cational factor in the progress of our state. The few pages following only high point the work of the Commission. For a more detailed re - port refer to the formal report of the Commission itself. Annie C. Kramph, North Platte President E. A. Burnett, Chancellor, University of Nebraska Gilbert H. Doane, Librarian, University of Nebraska George H. Turner, State Librarian C. W. Taylor, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Nellie M. Carey, Secretary and Supervisor of Institutional Libraries Dorothy Woodrow, Reference Librarian Harriett Hotze Hawn, Assistant in charge of Traveling Libraries ORGANIZATION The legislature of 1901 established this commission, and designated as its members the state librarian, state superintendent of public In - struction, chancellor and librarian of the University of Nebraska and one person appointed by the governor for a term of five years. These members act In an advisory capacity. </seg>
            <seg id="p250">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT ■ '.' AH but four of the states now have library extension agencies doing: work similar to that done by the Nebraska Public Library Commission. ACTIVITIES The Nebraska Public Library Commission is required by law to "encourage the establishment of libraries where none exist and the im - provement of those already established." This is done through field work when possible and by correspondence. . A second activity is the loaning of books and a third, the supervision of the libraries in the penal 'and charitable institutions, the legislature having appropriated money for this purpose since 1911. LOANS The loaning of books is perhaps the activity by which the Library Commission is best known over the state. There are now over 40,000 volumes in the Commission library. During this biennium books have been sent to every county in the state. . Books are loaned according to two general plans.- Traveling libraries consisting either of all adult books or all children's books, or of collections made up of both adult and children's books are loaned for three months. The number of books sent out depends largely upon ■ the number of people to be served, and the number of books avail - able when the request is received. For a traveling library" an applica - tion card signed by three tax payers is required. ■ . Smaller groups of books or magazines are sent out for one month in response to individual requests. The only expense to the borrower in either case is the transportation charges. The larger collections are sent by freight, smaller ones by parcel post: ■ One trained librarian is kept busy filling reference requests and looking up material in books, magazines, pamphlets, or newspaper clippings. Information is wanted on a variety of topics, such as immi - gration, child study, taxation, authors, ' Nebraska, Russia's five year plan, customs in various countries, early American history, etc. Unless the question involves a good deal of research, the available material is sent out the same day the request is received. There has been a noticeable increase this biennium in the number of requests received for loans to schools, not only for high schools, but for elementary grades and rural schools. Only one library may be sent to a school at a time, but this may include books for as many grades as wish to be served. Unless the teacher asks for specific titles, the collection is made up of titles found on lists recommended for . school use. Requests are filled in the order in which they are received, but because of the large number who desire the same type of material, and the limited number of duplicate copies which it is possible to buy with limited funds, it is often necessary to have a long waiting list. </seg>
            <seg id="p251">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION INCREASE IN USE OF LIBRARIES Reports from all over the United States show that during a period of economic depression and unemployment many people who have never used the library before turn to it for help, either informational or rec - reational. The annual reports of the public libraries in Nebraska for the year ending May 31. 1932, show more than a normal increase in circulation, the increase in many cases ranging from 20 to 50%. • "The message of. books was never more needed, not only for en - lightenment and strengthening of the miud, but for spiritual susten - ance and inspiration, to awaken faith and courage, the will to live and achieve", says Mr. M. P. Gallagher, chairman of the trustees section of the American Library Association. Librarians . have accepted the, challenge to give a maximum of service on reduced budgets. People are so eager for books that in spite of the economic situa - tion many new libraries are being Btarted, the original book collection consisting largely of donations and a traveling library sent out by the Library Commission. . COUNTY LIBRARIES County libraries seem to offer the best solution to the problem of providing the people of Nebraska with adequate library service. Ne - braska has no county libraries, although the law permits their estab - lishment. Among the organizations which have endorsed the county library plan is the Nebraska Congress of Parents and Teachers. There are at present seventeen counties in Nebraska without any tax sup - ported libraries, and many of the so-called tax supported libraries in other counties receive such a small income that they are not able to give adequate service. A combination of resources and a larger tax area would give better service. CLASSIFIED STATISTICS .
