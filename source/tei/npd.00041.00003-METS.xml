            <seg id="p023">ANNUAL MEETING The Forty-sixth Annual Meeting of the Nebraska State Hortici; K Society was called ko order, 1, Lincoln, Nebraska on Tue 1915. in the Banquet Room of the Linikll day morning, at 10 o'clock, January BThe first forenoon's session iety, and was called together nd. was devoted to the State Floris iy the President Ed Williams, Gra Mr. Williams said: Gentlemen of the Florists Society, an auxil - iary of the State Horticultural Society, we will now come to order. 1 am very sorry we have not a larger attendance here this morning, and more members present, but we cannot help it. The florists are pretty well represented, and I believe what few papers we have to come before us, will be of lateral to all. As president of this society, the last two years, I can see that since the florists organized them - selves as an auxiliary of the Horticultural Society, that the Florists are taking a better hold of the work, and I feel safe in saying that another year will see us still better organized. Every organization '■.»■&gt; to have a beginning, and mt are having ours now, so all it takes is just a little better nerve, all work together, and we will get what we are striving for. The past year has not been a very profitable year in most lines of business, and 1 believe that we as florists, suffer along with the rest of the Commercial world. Still I believe I can safely say that in proportion the florists have got their share "i what business was done. When you consider the war, and the finan - cial distress that this country has gone through, and the reports that have been coming out through our state papers we can consider our - selves very fortunate that we are living in the United States. And I hope that the conditions across the pond will cease very shortly, and that we will get down to solid work again. Our papers this morn - ing are not very numerous, and not very long, but what we have will be of interest to all of you I assure you. The first thing we will have the secretary's report, by Mr. Henderson, and if you will give Mr. Henderson your attention for a few minutes he will read it to you. Mr. Henderson reads his report. Report approved. Mr. Henderson reads the treasurer's report Kr. Williams: A motion to refer this to the trustees will be in r. Kr. Hess: I move that the report be accepted, and that the tees go over it. Seconded and Carried. "2 </seg>
            <seg id="p024">23 Mr. Williams : I would like to see the time when every florist in the State of Nebraska could show the button of the S. A. F. Mr. H«M is deeply interested in this matter, and I believe after he gets through reading his paper to you, that if there is any of the florists here that do not belong, they should step up and giv« Mr. Hess their application, and I do not believe they will ever regret it. We will no wlisten to a paper or address upon the subject, "Advan - ;s of Co-operation Between the State Florist's Society and Society Mr. Hess: Every florist of Nebraska should be now or else become a member of the Society of American Florists and Orna mental Horticulturists. At the Minneapolis Convention in August, 1913, the Board of Directors made the following recommendations: "That the fee for lbers of any regular florists club or florists society who wish to. the S. A. F. and O. H. as a body will be reduced to three dollar* the first vear, and the annual dues thereafter to be two dollar* per year for each member thereof. These dues must be paid to the S. A. F. and O. H. and we further recommend that our constitution and by-laws be amended to comply with this recommendation." At the Board of Directors meeting held in Boston March 17-18, 1914, the affiliation was thoroughly discussed, and it was the unani - mous opinion of all present, that the above recommendation was not clear and definite enough in its meaning. The chair was instructed to appoint a committee to report back to the Board before the con - vention. The Committee, consisting of Geo. Asmus, Chicago, III. W. F. Kastings, Buffalo, N. Y., and J. J. Hess, Omaha, Neb., have met and now recommend that the Board of Directors submit and recommend for adoption the following amendment of our constitution and by-laws* viz "1. That clubs or kindred organizations of professional florist*, gardners and horticulturists, having a paid up membership of 100 cr more members in the S. A. F. and O. H., shall be entitled to one representative on the Board of Directors of the S. A. F. and O. H. "2. Such representative shall be the President of such organization and must be a member of the S. A. F. and O. H. "3. The elective officers and appointed directors of the S. A. '•*. shall not be considered a representative of such organization. "4. When the president of any such organization is already director, the vice president shall take his place. "5. Any organization applying for representation shall submit to the Secretary of the S. A. F. and O. H., a complete list of their membership. It shall be the Secretary's duty to confirm same and submit to the president for final confirmation. Such lists shall lie in the hands of the Secretary by December first of each year. American Florists," by J. J. Hess of Omaha. </seg>
            <seg id="p025">24 Announcement of such director shall be made by President elec on January first of each year The S. A. F. and 0. H. voted on the affiliation amendment August in Boston, and ninety per cent of all the votes cast w for the amendment. The result so far has been the American K Society, The American Chrysanthemum Society, The American C nation Society, The Florists Telegraph Delivery. These are section of the S. A. F. and 0. H. having over 100 members each. 'They nov have a director in the S. A. F. and O. H. The Boston Florists Of! and the Now York Florist Club also have each a director on Board of Directors in the S. A. F. and O. H. Now, if the westc florists want to be represented in the S. A. F., they will have form a society of perhaps two or more states: Iowa, Nebraska perhaps Colorado. The three states could form one society and call in the Middles West Florist Society, and this would guarantee to u all time to come a director on the Board of Directors in the S. A. I to get 100 members together, and that is why we should form \vh Iowa and if we can't pet enough in the two states we could take in Colorado. Therefore, I would recommend that the president of this society appoint a committee, one from Des Moines and one from Council Bluffs, and one from Sioux City, and one from Lincoln and one from Omaha, in conjunction with the president, and find out whether Nebraska and Iowa can work together, and form a society, and we then might organize, and the expense would not be more than three dollars a year for each member. We would give two dollars to the S. A. F. and one dollar to the society, and that would be very reasonable because the S. A. F. is doing an awful lot of work, directly for the florists. They get the benefit of this work they are doing. The S. A. F. is financially in good condition, having from $25,000 to $30,000 in their treasury, and when you consider that thirty years ago, they were just about like us fellows, commencing to creep along with a few men, it shows what they have done, and what can be done. Now and O. H. I also would recommend for all florists doing business in ; of 3000 inhabitants or More, to JOM the Florists Telegraph Del It will further the florist- business interest all over the countr will create more business tor the florists, also. It will be a satisfaction to the public, leclini; assured that any order they place to any florist, will be carried out properly. The S. A. F. and O. H. will meet in San Francisco, Cal., Aiv ist and the florists of the Pacific Coast promise to make th« vention one of the best, if not the best, conventions the S. A. I O. H. have ever held. No doubt no other state in the United ! is able to make any better (bow to the florists and the public at and I wish all florists in this part of the country who can affc ■ this great convention will go there and show their appreciati Now then I say get 100 members 1 do not think Nebraska i </seg>
            <seg id="p026">25 up to you to do something. If you think that the two states of wa and Nebraska could do it together, you can leave Colorado out, cause Colorado is too far away from here. Now we can take this p and discuss it, or put any question to me, and I will answer it or ry tc Discussion. Mr. Williams: What action do you wish to take on this matter, entlemen? Mr. Wilson: I think this paper of Mr. Hess' deserves a grcit al of thought, and should have a wide discussion. It is very impor- nt. His idea is very good, in regard to forming the two states gether. The two associations combined I believe would make the 100 •nembers. We have in Des Moines thirty or forty members, and uo ioubt we could reach 50 easy enough by pushing a little, and I have hesitancy in saying that I could guarantee 50 from Iowa, anyway, join the Nebraska boys. I did not have a clear understanding ot .. until after this paper was read, regarding the association. Now &gt; dollars for the S. A. F. and a dollar for the home society is way it is mentioned here, and that is very reasonable, and an see no reason why any florist would object to coming in that basis, and becoming a member of the society under those con- tions. As Mr. Hess states, all those fellows who are staying out I the S. A. F. are staying on the outside, and receiving the benefit f our work, and it costs them nothing. I had a florist tell me last ear whom I wanted him to go to the meeting, say in response, "What ood does it do me? I stay home and read all your reports, and what good does it do me." And I said, "Yes," you stay home end never contribute a nickel, and get all the benefits."

Mr. Henderson: Mr. President, I take great pride in the S. A.

Then they would have a chance to become members of the Florists telegraph Delivery.

In this stage of progress we must be wide awake. Put on your bill head that you belong the this organization, and people will appreciate these things, and they will hand you an order.

Mr. Williams: We have with us today one of the most influential iatl in the state of Iowa, but his paper was prepared to be read &gt;re the Horticultural Society, and it will be omitted this fore - n. But we will hear from Oscar Enslow of Lincoln, on the subject. "THE FLOWER STORE." By Oscar Enslow, Lincoln. Mr. Knslow: In order to conduct a flower store successfully, first f all you must have good stuff to sell. We have three classes of trade to deal with, wholesale customers to whom we ship, we must have fresh Bower ■ imm they will have to stand shipping and rehandling and reselling. Second, the class of customers who buy for parties aid sick rooms who must have first class flowers to stand the heat of the rooms in which they are likely to be used. Third, people who only want wide open flowers for immediate use. We have a few customers who buy only full blown flowers to send to friends, as they consider the first impression the one that counts most. There should be a very little waste in a flower store, as the broken flowers, short stuff, and culls could all be used in designs. One of the main things is to </seg>

The use of baskets pot covers and jardiniers add much to their appearance. In our business, we don't meet much of the trade who come in just to shop, look around and ftt samples. People who come in usually come to buy, so that a flower salesman ilm&gt;n't need to be a spieler necessarily. He must be courteous know liis stock and till orders promptly and satisfactorily. In a place the size of Lincoln, where success depend* on regular trade one cannot afford to make promises to customers which cannot be kept, or in other words don't promise a delivery for 10 o'clock and get it there at 12. after the customer has telephoned once or twice for it. K Another essential feature is to know the trade, their individual es, likes and dislikes. Often a customer gives such an order as : "Send Mrs. So anil So a nice bouquet." It is quite necessary Mr. Henderson: I wish to say that is a very good talk, right down to the point and just the way we hnd it. »Mr. Williams: The next tthing on the program is by Mr. Lewis derson of Omaha, on the subject "Modest Floral Decorations for Home." "MODEST FLORAL DECORATIONS FOR THE HOME." KTo decorate or to make a home attractive, inviting, and pleasing the eye, is an art. In honor of certain occasions, guest recep - is, or weddings, are times when this art may be exercised, and I I try in a few words to suggest a few points to you upon this ject. There is nothing that is more inviting, inspiring and pleasing than a few natural flowers, nature's emblems of the \&gt;rimc of life. First, your By Lewis Henderson, Omaha, Iw whether a mixed luxjuet or one color bunch of flowers or t!-e I of flowers the customer would be beat pleased with, would urer the purpose, so that it is a very food thing to remember preference if the salesman can do Decoration Day. Mother's Day, Easter, Thanksgiving, Christinas, r Years and Valentine Day are the busy days in the flower store, it is necessary to manage the stock so that the -upply meets tiie a demand M tlKMC occasions. At these times sliort season staff is put on the market, as for instance at Easter time. Lilies and all hulb stuff are brought in. while at Thanksgiving, the chysanthemums are put on the market. The prices are higher on these days and the florist must make his money then to tide over the less busy times when out door flowers are plentiful. Discussion. </seg>

You can easily obtain roc florist and then grow them on yourself. This, I permanent decorations. But there are always times a ivant occasional decorations, and to do this there is always a isiily extravagant decorations; but I shall conhne myself lecoration. A table decoration can be done in various a ways. A fern dish or fernery, filled with small ferns is a good per - manent decoration for the table. Then it you want a more attractive decoration, as for a birthday, place a boquet in the center of the table, with some festooning of smilax or asparagus plumosus around the center or make a center piece of some seasonable flowers. Take a flat tray, fill with damp moss, cover with green flowers or roses on some sticks to make them stand up gracefully into a mound, either round or oblong ing to your table u can add to this by placing a corsage boquet or a bountonniere h plate, consisting of seasonable flowers, such as sweet peas, lets, roses, or carnations, with a pin attached to pin it on with. If you want to decorate you room a little more, festoon your chande - lier fixtures with smilax or plumonosus strings. Even your arch doors can be decorated with the same kind of greens. Of course, a nice palm or fern or a blooming plant standing about is always attractive, placed where they will not be in the road. Always place your decorations in such a way that when entering the room, the first impression you get of the scene is pleasing. You then mastered the art Then we have other seasonable decorations, such as Christmas, which time you can hang a holly wreath in the window or on the ir. as well as placing holly and mistletoe at various places about the house. Also have some blooming plants, such as azaleas, cyclamens begonias, poinsettas, or any other plant in season, the pots of which may be decorated with fancy paper and ribbon. Then comes Easter when we use Easter lilies, and many other seasonable flowers. Ai.d later on comes the June Wedding with a home decoration, a brioal table, either for service or one for ornament. This is decorated with flowers, and greens and Cancloborias and a place left for the wedding cakes only. If for service, decorate the same as for a banquet, the same as I first described. If the wedding ceremony is to be in the home, place a few tall palms and ferns as a background, a tall vase of flowers on each side with some plants, or arrange a canopy of greens of Smilax, or asparagus above the bridal party. Always remember that a flower placed here and there in honor of some friends of yours, as well as for your own pleasure, and benefit, no matter how simple, is far more inspiring than we realize. Thus, from Childhood's sunny morning to the mellow light of ripe old age. </seg>

Mr. Williams: It is now very late, and there are still two more papers, but we will try and get them in some place else during the rest of the meeting of the Horticultural Society. So in as much as it is now 12:30 we will adjourn this session, and the Society will meet again at 2 o'clock this afternoon. 2 o'clock P. M. January 19th, 1915, the Nebraska State Horticultural Society met pursuant to adjournment, and the following proci-cc'.iii^s were had and done. Mr. President: The time has arrived for us to begin our afternoon program, and I would suggest that those of you who are pretty well back, if you will please move up towarJ front, it will be better for the speakers. We have a very nice program tliis afternoon, and MMK very nice papers. You will all he interested in our papers this afternoon. President's Address. The President : I see that our vice president, Mr. Poll here and in as much as the next number on the program is ; by myself, I will say that from my connection with a nunilie organizations in various capacities, I have found that when t make addresses, they are usually received more cheerfully, i noted for their brevity My address to you will be rather I; think you will appreciate it for that rea It is a great pleasure for me to come before you today as I of this splendid organization to address you. It is a good tin sionally to take a retrospective view in order to find out hov w far w have come and what progress we have made nr oryanizat Forty-six years ago last fall, this society was organized at Nebraska City by a small enthusiastic band of pioneers. No one present today was at that meeting. We know but little of what was done at t'nat time except that we are very sure all those present were deeply interested in all that pertained to Horticulture in a new country, for you must remember that little or nothing was known then as to what varieties of fruit would succeed; the hardiness and adaptability to the climate were unknown. A great many mistakes were made in the early plantings in Nebraska, because no one was informed on these vital subjects. But our pioneer horticultural members laid a foundation upon which has been built a splendid organization that has arrived at a. practical working basis from which all those who wish to plant may get substantial and reliable information. In the early days of Nebraska it was believed that only the southeast part of the state would be adapted to successful fruit growing but as the years have passed by, the line has gradually been Invocation by Kiv.

Teams night be seen hauling apples to the railroad stations to be sent lo ant cities and states. Who would have believed thirty years ago that this prairie state ild he -ending carloads, and even trainloads of fruit to distant w arkets? What has brought about these results? The climate has it materially changed since the early days; our rainfall has varied ■little; physical conditions have changed but slightly. I will answer above qscttioa l&gt;y saying that the results above mentioned have wrought out by taking advantage of the many experiments that been tried, by using better methods than formerly, and by a ireful study of varieties that are adapted to our soil and climate. Sometimes we lament that our progress is slow. We are impatient &gt; increase the membership of our society. We feel that our effort* re not fully appreciated, but when you come to think of it. we have MM a long way from the early days, up to this time, and have made wonderful progress. In the older ports of this state the experimental stage in fruit growing has been passed. We now have a fund of u-rtul information for the free guidance of planters that has been gleaned from the combined experience and observation of our membeis. We have our annual meetings here each year in January, and our ience i- composed of enthusiastic orchardists, fruit growers, florist*. ardeners and foresters. We have splendid programs, topics of absoro - ng interest are discussed by experts, the scientific phases of these ubjects are taken up. practical orchardists with fat bank accounts re here to tell us how to plant, spray, prune and market the crop. Nurserymen are here to tell us all about propagation the time to plant, the best varieties, whether we should plant in fall or spring. The Forester will tell us what to plant for wind breaks, for orchard protection, for posts, for wood, for lumber. The Landscape man will tell us what vines to plant, and where; where to plant roses and shrubs and will design our landscape gardening. The Florist will tell us how to care for our plants, how to multiply them, how to beautify the home. The Market Gardner will tell us how to grow twelve big potatoes in a hill instead of two small ones. In fact we have here a valuable scorce of information on all of these allied subjects. The thing I regret more than anything else in connection with ur meetings is the fact that our audience that usually participates in our deliberations is so small and that so very few comparatively are benefited as a result of our meetings. I am sure that there are literally thousands of people in Nebraska today, this very minute that a commercial way. </seg>
            <seg id="p034">34 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY are hungry for just such information as we are capable of supplying What we need is more publicity. If the audience will pardon me, I will tell you how my attention I accidentally directed to fruit growing. Twenty years ago thb ter I went to the Post Office in Fremont for my mail. The P. said he would give me a book that had not been called for. It red to be the 1894 Nebr. Horticultural Report. I read this book &gt;ugh many times and studied it as a child would study a text book, an almost repeat now verbatim an article Peter Youngers had ten on his experience in apple orcharding. I planted an orchard spring with this report as my guide and as a direct inspiration n that and subsequent volumns I have grown and sold thousands of ars worth of fruit and have been able to assist others somewhat he same line. I The point 1 have been leading up to is this: the field of usefulness &gt;ur society is too limited. We cannot briny the people to our tings and we cannot go to them, but we owe it to them all over state to tell them what we are doing and to give them guidance information along the lines of our work. My plan is that ou' ety shall secure more publicity. It is not sufficient that we have annual meetings and that we have an exhibit at the State Fair i year and that we print 5000 annual reports and that we have little Horticultural publication that only reaches a few hundred icribers. tMy recommendation therefore is, that in view of the importance mr work that we must reach a greater number of people and the ■ way this can be done is to secure a greater appropriation from Legislature so that we may through the public press have timolv :les appear, together with our recommended list for the fruit ricts of the state, practical articles on pruning, planting, spraying, keting and kindred subjects. I hope therefore that all of you will your influence to this end as our motive is entirely unselfish and n.led only for the betterment of the state and its citizens. I have been deeply and sadly impressed this winter to note the large number of unemployed, worthy people within our state; net only in the large cities but in the small towns, and this fact only emphasizes again more forcibly than ever, that we have an economic problem to face in the future. In Horticultural pursuits we find the true solutions of this problem. The east third of Nebraska is capable of comfortably supporting five times its present population. There are thousands of acres of land that could be made to produce enormous returns in small fruits an-! vegetables until apples, cherries and other tree fruits could be brought into bearing. I have contended for a long time that five acres in fruit with poultry as an adjunct would support a family and leave some money to put in the bank. Within the next fifty years a great trans - formation will be worked out in this state. The land will be sub- </seg>

I will repeat again that the pursuit Horticulture is the chief solution of the problem of the unemployed The President : Now we have about four topics this afternoon k, and you will notice that after each subject we have discussion, say 10 or 15 minutes, and I hope that all f you who are here will feel free to ask any questions that you wish to upon these various subjects, as we have found out fro-n past experience that some of the best things we learn is in the dis- at our meeting We had a very good florists session this morning, and I am glad ;ee some of them here this afternoon, and I notice the next on the program is a prominent florists here in the city who will talk to you on the subject, 'How to Beautify the Country Home at a Small Expense,"' Irwin F. Frey "HOW TO BEAUTIFY THE COUNTRY HOME AT A SMALL COST." By Irwin F. Frey, Lincoln. When this subject was handed to me, my first thought was I know ut as much about farms, as the average farmer does about Green- es, and with this in mind I have carefully kept away from the an!, the buildings, and in fact everything except the immediate home vard As we travel along the country roads of Nebraska, or any of c Western States, we cannot help but notice especially in some distrtris the small amount of time or thought the average farmer gives 1 1 Ratifying the immediate surroundings of his home.

And, as we think of the small llired to make these farm homes more attractive, tno xper to us that this a subject to which the average farmer ug paid little or no attention. It certainly is not a lack of thrift our most successful farmers are sometimes the most negli&gt;;&gt;.: t up their home yards. There are two places, some 10 miles north of Lincoln that arr a utter passing from either side for several miles and seeing 'V imes with perhaps a few trees inside of fenced in yards. (These fences by the way must be to keep in the owners dog or keep out his with a few weeds in the corner.) At these two homes, there is a lawn, perhaps ISO feet across at each one. The grass is kept mowed as neatly as any town yard and in the center of one of the yards is a canna bed, perhap* sis feet across, which cost. $2.00 or $3.00 to buy plants for. In the other yard, there is a geranium bed, about the same size at the same cost. Three </seg>
            <seg id="p036">36 or four shade trees are on either side of the yard, and as these homes face to the east, two orMhree trees are growing in the back yard, these giving shade from the hot afternoon sun. There is no fence to obstruct the view from the road, and a lasting impression is, that these people get more pleasure at home, than their neighbors, possibly, can get. The cost of beautifying a country home is practically nothing, com - pared to the pleasure derived. To be sure a certain amount of labor must be done, but this work should be a pleasure, and be done in the same spirit with which the man in town, plants his garden in the spring. A well kept lawn, even though of limited size is recessary and this should be prepared in the early winter. Vines itioulj be planted, where possible, to hide any unsightly out buildings. These vines can be obtained from seed for a few cents, if Morning Glori-'S, Cinamon Vine, Scarlet Climber of Moonvines will answer your purpose, and will only need protection by chicken wire until they get a good start. Or if something is wanted, which will be permanent, try Clem - atis Paniculata or some of the fast growing climbing roses, such as Dorothy Perkins. White Perkins or .the Red Excelsa. The cost of these is nothing compared with their beauty after the first year. For the porches around the house there is nothing that 1 know of, as satis - factory as Clematis, and the varieties of roses mentioned, as they are not subject to mildew, as are the Crimson and other ramblers. If there are any corners, plant a few Hardy Phlox, Peonies or Iris, keeping each kind in groups, and if something is desired along the t fence use Spireas. Hydrangeas and Syringas, between which Hocks or Larkspur may be planted. These blooming later the shrubs mentioned. I do not want it to be taken, as my view, that the varieties mentioned are all which can be planted, and from whic' pleasure can be derived. But I do think that every farmer, tha* vill in with a well kept lawn, with a very limited number of flowers or shrubs will increase his plantings every year, as he notes their beauty. Thus he will steadily increase the value of his home as well as his influence for further good along the same line* MMMfl hi&gt; ■ligl^ori. How often we hear of the beautiful farms in this or that county spoken of. Why is this? Is it not because some farmer has seen beyond his fields, beyond to the immediate surroundings of his home, and beautified his yard. Only to be followed by his neighbors and they by their neighbors, and finally we have a community spoken of as beautiful. Discussion. The President: Although Mr. Frey has made his paper pretty short, there are some mighty good suggestions in it, and I am sure that there are some here who would like to discuss it briefly, and we will be very glad to hear from any of you.

This question ha* imc rapidly before us, and the country is ready for it. We have through the pioneer stages, and now we must go on with our nentation. It is a very simple thing. I started a slogan a while was this : That beauty is wealth. And that is the truth. the rich thing. I once saw a team of horv.s Irnningtoa, Vermont, that they told me cost $39,000 or When that team walks off, as though they were stepping m the clouds, anil those Hashing eyes and dilateing nost iU. there is ttle wonder they brought what they did. And it is especially so in egard to decorations. You take a place that is well decorated, ind is worth ■ good deal more, for there is money in that yard if it is II decorated. There are a great many new things coming to the &gt;w in the way of a beautifier. If you want something for a rellis. there is a new grape vine, I have been raising for a few years; t has a delightful foliage, and then it bears a large amount of fru^t. ugh it is not quite as good as the old Concord, but it has a very u much for ornamentation. When you want to cover a His, or have something climb a tree, or something of that sort, r. i- the milria ijrajnr. It originated in the mountains of western You know what the salvia is? That beautiful plant, with its wealth of color. It blooms in the spring, and takes a rest in the summer, and then blooms in the fall again. Originating in the high mountains of Texas, in that dry climate, they have been moved t • I'ennsylvania. and Iowa and they went through that awful drouih Kansas, unscathed. And then there is another thin.; \u grace the farm, and that is the Mallow Marvels, and H&gt; now we have the giant form of it. It grows as high ad, and it has numerous blooms, and a great amoui.t i em, — of course they kill down every fall, but then they spring nd they get stronger and stronger every year. Now there are Wry often a man will have a big grounds and a big high stone wall, we e that down in New England a good deal, and then there will be nding walks and constant surprises of beauty. That is the selfish IjrMcM, 1 ni sitting upon the porch in Brookline. where there ar; more millionaires to the square acre than any other place in the juntry. 1 said to tlie man at whose house I was stopping, "You seem I own a good many lands around here" and he said "Yes sir, I own I many of them." And he said. "We plant so that we can look it Dur owir place here, but so that our neighbors can't look at them." My suggestion is that every beautiful lawn should be open to the road, so than when a person passes by, he can look in and see what you have, and not like an amphitheater, so you can see nothing but stone wall. Now we want to have the view to all this beauty wa Ijrstemi oi landscaping One is the system of exclusiveness. </seg>

Those trees and flowers scenting air, and that magnificent view, they represent nature on dress de and the flowers are just like maidens preparing for their ials, each one seeing which will put on the best dress, and they r taste, a great deal better than a great many of the ladies do.

There is one class of flowers that has not been mentioned That is roses. They are the finest of any plant you can mention. The rose smell or fragrance, cannot be excelled by any plant grown. there are certain kinds of roses that you can have all summer long I have them at home. Kvery day all summer long some certain ros&lt; has flowers on it. Now these perpetul roses, and the tea-roses art just as easy to raise as the old roses. There are some kinds I hav&lt; tested, about four or five different varieties in these tea roses thai have perpetual growth, that will do well in Nebraska. btC»—t I hav&lt; tried them for years. There is the Virginia J Cox which i&lt; one of th&lt; finest red roses that grows ; it has beautiful red roses, and plenty O them too, and when you have them, you are foiag to have roses and you can go out and get you boquet any time in the summer. Tha is a red rose. And then there is a little baby rambler — it autv E| has had roses on it every day this summer. I could go 01 e and get a rose every day this summer, and that is somethir irkable. I Now the old June rose, we have some of them, but we threw mo&lt;t them out.

There is no place in the world where a farmer can have everything growtag such as trees and shrubbery and plants, like here in Nebraska, and in this northern climate. We have a little experi- mental place at hunu 1 , where we have done experimenting in grow- ing these plant-, and we fond that every tree that will grow any place else, will grow in Nebraska. We have lots of experimental trees, and everyone of them is all right and growing fine. Mr. Harrison: How do your chestnuts do? A. I have had a bushel of them on one tree. I have had chestnuts bear the limbs down, just like an apple tree, and they grow healthy and bear run Mr. Harrison: The trees from York State will be all right of )urs A. Yes sir. perfectly hardy, if they get started all right. WlMi they first come up. I had a little trouble, and the winter will kill them. Mr. Dwyer : 1 had a chestnut bear the third year it was planted. Mr. Pollard: This southern type is growing just the same as it n Louisianna How is vour hemlock? A. It does well, but it is not a fast grower. It doesn't seem t&gt; catch cold as they do in mountaineous countries. I do not know why that is though, but they are living all right for me. Mr. Harrison: 1 think the English Walnuts and the Pecans will grow up all right here. I have had pecans for years, and they never kill back a particle. Mr Pollard: 1 had the English walnuts but they kill back. I have a seedless grape from California, and they grow fine and that old large black Mission grape grows just as well as it does in California. Mr. Harrison: You get an English walnut from California and you would think it would not be hardy, but they have them in Ne.v York, and they are growing fine, every place. Mr. Pollard : 1 have no interest in anything to sell, but I am interested in Nebraska. I have lived here 58 years, and it will be 59 in May, and I have been at work ever since I have been here trying to fix up and make an ideal home. There is no place in the world where a farmer can make an ideal home like he can here. The only tree I ever did try that I failed in is the peach tree. I can't make a peach tree grow.

While in our gardening as in our people we have borrowed of the best of all countries, the type evolved will be a blending of all modified by our soil, climate, topography and the use of native plants. In farm planting the must important things to be kept in mind are still the purposes of the early settlers, that is. for wood and shelter The trees best fitted for these purposes are also more in keeping with the natural landscape and the same general type should be continued to the west as tar a^ poiiiblc. though in the shelter of the hardier Kmay come a more liberal use of evergreens. With the protectio; e shelter belt to the north and west there is opportunity when th desire comes for more strictly ornamental planting to use many plants which would no thrive without their shelter.

I do not see that it has any effect, I have turned the hose on and let it run all day. and sometimes all night, but I do not see any particular damage.

I have taken up the bulbs in the spring sometimes, but if I k them up, I would rather move them in the fall. Mr. Marshall: Don't you take them up in the spring sometimes? A. I have done that I suppose. If they were left until the foliage thoroughly ripened, it would be all right.

In dealing with this subject, I will endeavor to touch upon only that portion of floriculture with which I am most familiar namely some of the members of floras large and interesting family used for lawn and park decoration or ornamentation which are grown or started under glass and then planted out in a growing state. It has been my privilege for the past 25 years to grow, and plant out, or otherwise distribute a considerable number of plants for lawn and park work and </seg>
            <seg id="p055">50 I can assure you it has been a source of pleasure as well as profit to me. eline of work must be a source of pleasure to the man who makes i business and means of livlihood, because, with a few exceptions, nd a modest living, that is all the most of us get MM of it. I think if 1 had applied my great natural ability tu any other line of business 1 could have lived well, but think of the pleasure and satis - faction I would have missed. To plant a tree, a shrub or a flowering plant, to watch it strike out vigorously and grow as though in sheer gratitude for the care you have given, repaying you abundantly with its fruit its blossoms or its grace and beauty, that's worth while. Occa - sionally you will find a person who does not care for these things. One whom the Lord left something out of. One like he of whom the poet says, "A primrose by the river's brim. A yellow primrose was to him, and nothing more. But such people arc getting harder to find. There used to be a lot of fellows who seemed to think it was beneath their dignity to confess to a liking for flowers. They cansidered the florist business a nice easy means of livelihood for an old lady. They would make all kinds of excuses when they bought a plant, a box of flowers or weeded the flower bed and it they were married they kept their flowers in the wife's name. In the larger cities, the public parks furnish some very fine examples of the different styles of planting or bedding as it is called. These displays are very attractive, and have done a great dial toward educating and interesting the general public. Carpet bedding seems to be particularly admired. This consists of planting lowgNMrMg plants of different colors and forms of leaves to form carpetlike patterns words, fraternal or patriotic emblems. From an artistic point of view this class of work never appealed to me, but from a mechanical standpoint some of the designs that a good carpet bedder will work out are simply great. A sundial, a roll of carpet partly unrolled lying on the grass, a shield in the national colors, the name of the park or city, a globe showing the different countries of the world etc some of the regular or staple design-. KI have a couple of photos taken in Hanscom Park. Omaha that arc r good examples. I took them myself. The picture taken in Como Park, St. Paul Minn, ihuwi part of about as well done a job of bedding as one usually finds. I In order to get the correct effect in carpet bedding the plants must placed so close together that they entirely lose individuality and subordinated to the plan or scheme as a whole of the design. Small, low growing plants are used, most of them being sorts th,it will submit to the necessary trimming which must be done to keep the design in shape. The sorts most commonly used are Santolina, and Echiveria and dwf. alyssum for white. Lobelia and ageratium for blue, Pyrethrum and alternanthera aurea nana for yellow, and alter - naanteas, dwarf coleus and achrenthus of those shades for red and bronze.

            <seg id="p057">FLORICULTURE APPLIED TO LAWN DECORATION 51 will produce effects that will be a source of amusement and interest ti&gt; the park going public all summer long. ( Ither styles of bedding generally used are known as, massing for color or sub-tropical planting, massing for foliage effects and planting in border The last named consists both of the narrow ribbon-line effects outlining a walk or driveway, and of the long narrow strip in Croat of a mass of shrubbery, a fence or other back ground. This last style of planting always appealed to me as it gives an opportunity to bring out the individual beauty of the different plants more than in any other way. Then too, an unsightly object like a fence can by this method be shut off from view or at least made unnoticeable. I like a border from four to six feet in width, low plants in front and taller ones to the rear of course. In a border of this kind, with the exception of planting according to height and with room enough to allow for the cultivation and natural development no rule or sys - tem need be followed. \ny or all of the plants usually used for bedding can find a plact in the border. Cannas. Kiciiius, Caladiums, salvia. Geraniums, Petunias, Heliotropes, Lantanas, etc. down through the whole list one might go. Always following the MM fundamental rule of planting according to height, use your own taste and judgment regarding what to plant and where to put it. Not a little of the charm and interest in a well planted well cared for border is due to its taste in planting or individuality. Massing for color effects means the planting of a large bed of any desired shape or form, with one or more varieties of blooming plants. A bed may be all one color, or made up of contrasting masses of different colors in any number of shades desired, though the effect is most striking when but few colors are used in one bed. Sometimes a border of some lower growing plant of a contrast - ing color is used, and in my opinion gives the bed a much more fin - ished appearance. For instance on a bed of Scarlet geranium I like to put a border of blue ageratium or dwarf allyssum or lobelia. On a bed of salvia, a border of centurea (iumim carpa, or dusty miller. On a bed of cannas a border of pennisetum or purple fountain grass. On a bed of pansies no border could be used to much advantage but pansies could be used on a bed of a great many other plants. Subtropical effects are obtained by massing or grouping suitable plants with the design of representing tropical vegetation. In this locality with its health laden but sometimes boisterous breezes, shelter is more or less important as many of the most beautiful subjects for this work would be badly disfigured if subjected to the whipping of the winds. However, the canas, Caladiums, ricimus and Musas and Crotons suffer but little from wind and excellent effects can be produced with these varieties alone. The cannas are </seg>
            <seg id="p058">52 to be had in so many varieties &gt;&gt;t various height-, ami color &gt;tl bloom and foliage that we consider them, one of our most important plants for this line of work. There would be no difference between the class of plants suitable for the park and those for the lawn or home flower bed or garden, though naturally the park display would he a great deal more elaborate and complete than would be possible upon the average private place. Unless the home grounds are large and skilled labor is employed to care for them, it is a mistake to attempt large, elaborate planting schemes or intricate carpet beds as these require skilled care and a great deal of it. And there is nothing out of doors that looks more forlorn to me than a neglected and care-needing flower bed. Some people get a whole lot of enthusiasm in the spring and buy a lot of plants and take a lot of interest in them but seem to run out of Iiusiasm before the summer is over and let their flowers just die want of a little care. . You have seen the same thing with vegetable iens. It has been my experience that when the real boss of the ily is in charge of them the flowers and vegetables are weeded watered and hoed as they should be. Who is the real boss?

It is not an uncommon thing to see every window of a large business block in city ornamented in this way, and the contrast between the fresh, green growing, things and the grim brick and stone is simply delightful. B Porch boxes placed upon the porch rail or floor, or on the roaches add just that little finishing touch that spells perfection. Provided, they are taken care of. When you see a beautiful dis - play in a park, remember that no small part of what you are admiring is the care that has been bestowed, and if you would have flowers and plants of your own that you would have others admire, take care of them. </seg>
            <seg id="p059">FLORAL SUGGESTIONS TO OUT OF TOWN FLOWER LOVERS 53 FLORAL SUGGESTIONS TO OUT-OF-TOWN FLOWER LOVERS. Edward Wiliams. Grand Island. The subject assigned to me, is "Floral Suggestions to Out-of-Town Flower Lovers, or what a Florist should do in catering to outside trade. The floral business more so than most any other business, neces - sitates a catering to "inside trade for the home consumption is not ukIi to warrant a success for a florist outside of the large And the florist located in the larger cities depend on the flor- in tlie -mailer towns for their wholesale business. Hence it is up to the Florist that is located where the railroad facilities are goo-1 to expand by working up an outside trade. Catering to that line of trade requires very careful handling, for the motto should be, 'Hang on to the old customers, and the new ones will come,' for as a, rule, when you make a shipment to a small town, most every one in that town knows that Mrs. so and so bought some flowers. And if they are not up to standard your future orders from that town are going to |M very small. And if you &lt;lo send good stuff, packed right, so that they arrive at their destination without being chilled, half the heads broken off the roses or the outside petals torn off from not tieing down the flowers to the box, you will likely hear again from them. The method I have used to work up the outside trade is to secure a «uod agent in every town within your shipping territory. Allow him or her a commision on all orders, the parties ordering paying the cost, such as express, parcel-post, phoning or telegraphing. We issue a weekly price list to all our agents, keeping them posted on prices, flowers in stock, making a notation on the varieties that are scarce, so that they can work on the flowers that you are long on. We also keep each agent supplied with a catalogue showing floral cut of arrangements along all lines, so that the customer can select the style emblem or design, varieties etc. that they may desire. The idea is to make it as easy as possible for the agent to secure the order without wasting too much of their time. By the agent system lot shipments can be made, which brings the express charges down to - a minimum. We discourage parcel-post whenever we can for we know - that the handling of flowers is not a success in mail sacks in the way they are thrown around. We don't guaranty the arrival of flowers in time by parcel post, as same is very uncertain ; so hence the reason for suggesting shipuments via express whenever possible. Rural routes locally are all right for the cut flower end of our business as they are not sacked so much. As to the working off of surplus in potted plants through the spring months, we have not worked that end of the business of late as we used to do in former years. We have had considerable experience along 1 that line, but if you can eliminate it, I think it best. Of course we solicite out-of-town shipments of potted plants and have a very nice trade in same, but we don't work it as extensively as </seg>
            <seg id="p060">54 we used to. In the early days we used to start two or tlire tea out on the first of May and keep them out until the last of June, bv now the expense is too great to allow a good margin of profit in il pommg of them in that manner. We try to get some one to htn plants for us in every town in our territory, but it is a hard prop. ■ to get the right one. The agents that handle your cut flowers don't care to handle plants. We get good results from having refer M to some one that they think would like to handle plants us, and as a rule we do get pood results We have lot the last years picked out the leading papers in our territory and placed adv cuts in them, calling attention to our agentl in their vicinity and that we carry a complete line of home and garden plants whi we would lie pleased to submit prices to them, and lor that occasi we get printed in pamphlet form a pricclist of all plants, and out of every ten that we gd inquiries from we receive an order, and at a -mall cost, for there is Bo commis&gt;i. ,n. We think that having some one handle your plants, f a lot of plants left over which takes a good p thotC that were sold, and besides, when an order comes direct can ship them out of pot-, put in an extra plant is much more satisfactory all around.

Every article has a value, we will all agree on that. The question is to get it. You have to get it. If you don't you wont last long and make a success. It costs so much to grow a plant or a flower. You have to raise so many plants in a givtn space to get your returns, cut so many flowers off the plants to get the returns from it. Your expense goes on regard - less. It takes so much coal to heat that space, so much labor to care for it, so much money invested, if we would get our business on a standard so that we could tell by glancing at our books, whether we have made a dollar or lost it. We would all be better off. The flor - ist that figures all these incidentals is the most successful one today. Taking inventory is a thing that I dare say that there is not one out of twelve florists do.. Why not? How can he tell where he is at if he don't? Supposing the bank would want a statement, he would say: "Well 1 have so and so, my green houses and my land is so-so?' Very intelligent.

I could go on thing at my finger-tips exactly what I have in stock. I could go on with some more points along this line of doing business, but I believe that I have covered that matter in general, so that you will have something to work on. I would like to ask a few of the florists present what their returns were for the past year per square foot of glass owned, but I am not going to for I am afraid they would hesi - tate to tell me. Or should I say that they could not answer me intelli - gently. 9 o'clock .*. M. January 20th, 1915. The society met pursuant to adjournment, and the following proceedings were had and done.

Mr. Pollard: (Made remark the reporter could not hear tMr. Deur: In answer to Mr. Pollard's remark I will say that we all liable to make a mistake. 1 think I had made a mistake by ling my trees higher than they are. And I find that the wind vs a great deal over the hills, and I find if I had topped my trees :r, I would have less apples that would blow off. Again on the •r hand his system of clean cultivation would not do; it would do with us, is what I mean. Our ground is quite rolling and hilly, if we had clean cultivation over there, the spring rains would h the soil away so that we would have none left. It would ruin orchards, and we absolutely have to |N* a cover crop in that ng soil of ours. tMr. Pollard: Now your plan of treating rolling ground is all right, orchard is rolling too, and we have soil that is just like snow. It es right off just like sediment. But we do not have any trouble, — use a disk and cultivators for cultivating it too. As a cultivating i we prefer alfalfa if we were going to use anything in the iard. Our orchard is all rolling land, and we are on the bluffs of Weeping Water, where it is most too rolling for farm land, but planted it in orchard. Mr. E. M. Pollard : I just want to back up father a little bit in this argument. I do not think it needs any backing up however, for I think he has taken good care of it. But there is one thought I want to express in regard to the heading of the tree, whether hiirh or low, and that is this: It doesn't make any difference whether the grower believes in cultivation as a care for his orchard, or whether he believes in the planting of clover in it. There is one thing absolutely certain, and that is that the most products need some sort of cultivation at some time or another. You can sow a crop of clover and have it act like blue grass or some of our other grasses. A clover plant only lasts two years. Now in our section of the state if the trees were headed </seg>

As a matter of fact, however, one man, doing all these e things makes from one hundred to several hundred dollars per acre each year, while another man doing them realizes just about enough pay for his labor. Some men can make their apple crop the most profitable that is grown on the farm. Others, under similar conditions, make little or nothing on their apples. Success, then, seems to depend upon the man. There may not be a very wide visable difference between men but that little difference betwee-i the man who con and the man who cant spells the difference between success and failure.

Now I have started out with a thought that by heading the tree back, and I would like to get as to whether I am right about it, and what effect the tree will have. Dr. Whitten: What varieties are those? Mr Pollard. They are all the commercial varieties. Ben Davis, lathan, (irimes (jolden. IftMMri Pippin, and so forth. Dr. Whitten : Well, we were lucky enough to have on our rtunity to test out just that kind of a proposition. i We were trying to test some 420 varieties there about 18 years ago, and as a result we put them twice as close together. I would say ii general way this: You can take those tall trees and get in at p and gradually head them back, and I think what you suggested to cl'i How I do not like to over do that right at ■&lt;t, especially with Ben Davis or Gano type, I never like to cut them back too far at first, but gradually reduce the top, as the growth begins to rill ill below. But on the Winesap or Jonathan we find we can cut back pretty well, back into the three or four year old wood, sometimes past a good vigorous branch running out to the aide, and 1 believe that is just the thing to do. We are finding a ood way of handling the canker. That is, to take white lead and il paint and dissolve into it about an ounce of turpentine, to about a quart of paint and an ounce of corrosive sublimate. We haven't had any canker where that is put on the limb. The tissues may dry back some from the wound on Ben Davis, even though you have painted it, and sometimes it will dry out and then it may canker, but we haven't had a canker get through those wounds lately and on all varieties except Ben Davis and Gano, we are not having any trouble. On the others, you can cut them back more rapidly, I think. </seg>

N'o doubt those trees were weakened some for what they were supposed to do the following year on account of that. I am not saying it was that severe every year, possibly not, but that defoliation whatever it was due to, part of it was certainly due to lack of spraying, because where he sprayed the rest of his orchard, it was not in that condition.

Mr. Pollard: That is a new disease that we have yet to come in contact with here. We have pretty nearly all the diseases we can think ni, I, m that is a new disease.

Now we were a little late, getting in there and we thought there wasn't enough wiiu'saps to spray and we sprayed the Missouri Pippins. N'ow the day we sprayed the Missouri Pippins the wind was blowing, and it went right down through the first row of Winesaps that were next to the Missouri Pippins, and in August, all the rest of that orchard of wine - saps were defoliated, except that one row.

Mr. Keyser: This problem presented by my paper is something entirely different than the one you have just been discussing, but in making up these programs of the Horticultural society, we have general problems, that we have to discuss and consider, and there are of course reasons for taking in the whole field.

Possibly there has been too much work for profit and not enough for comfort and pleasure. Why should not the farmer be able to succeed in growing fruit to supply the needs of his family as well as he succeeds in producing Field Crops and Live Stock? Is it a question of knowing how? Does it require too much time so that the farmer cannot afford to look after the orchard? Do the trees fruit at a reasonable age? Is the fruit desirable? In other words, is the farmer compensated in the product from his orchard for the land it occupies and fruit it bears? It has been proven from years of experience that fruit can be grown </seg>

Our neighboring states are doing excellent work in getting this movement started Co-opera - tion between the different states is absolutely essential in building up a (freat industry and Nebraska must take the lead in this work. When our growers have adopted all the up-to-date methods, that have made other sections so well known in the fruit markets of the ■world, then we will come into our own as the leader in horticultural development. The different agencies in the state working lor the horticultural development of Nebraska have been doing a good work in their respective Kan, A stupendous amount of work lies ahead before The President: I think we will hear the report oi the secretary at this time.

            <seg id="p084">75 I I he work of development has been completed. The growers of the tate have numerous problems that must be solved from the tecli lical side. Thit work is being carried on by the Department o horticulture ot the University of Nebraska in a satisfactory mannei iut a large number of problems need the immediate attention anil olution by the department. The hearty co-operation of every fru! iwer and every person interested in horticultural development uld be acorded the workers in that department. Nebraska consumers as well as Nebraska producers should be ppraiseil of the great possibilities of horticulture in this state. The rorfc of the society during the past year has been along the lines oi icreasing a greater interest among the growers to practice better lethods in producing, and marketing their crops. The people of state have been shown the superiority of Nebraska fruit, flowers writable liy displays at the annual apple show held last .1 in- lary and tlie display at the state fair. This work has not been as ffective as it could have been had more funds been available. This iffice has tried to reach as many people throughout the state as &gt;ossible ill its work. This has made the liberal use of the press of lie state a necessity. The newspapers have been very kind in help- UK in this work. The Bureau of Publicity of the Nebraska State ioard of Agriculture has also been a great help in getting the mate - ial in the lumils of the papers. The daily papers were given an irticle CM some phase of horticultural work several times each lonth. The weekly press had an item at least twice a month. The gricultural press was supplied occasional articles. In addition to [his there were printed and sent to members, exchanges and libraries ipproximately 8,000 copies of regular edition of "Nebraska Horti- jiture" and 4,000 copies of extra editions, the latter sent not only i members but to growers all over the state. There was distributed from this office 4200 copies of the annual eport for MJ and approximately 2,500 copies of reports of previ - us years. These were placed in the hands of some one interested horticultural work or in some school or public library. There was sent out from this office approximately 1.700 pieces of t dui mail. .5,380 pieces of mail other than reports and magazines a total of 5,080 pieces of mail sent out during the past year. (. Yop reports for the state were compiled at different times and sent to every person, whose name we could get, whom we thought might be interested in receiving them. This work is necessary in keeping our growers posted on true conditions. The hearty co-ope - ration of every grower is necessary to make it a success. The Secretary has been trying with the limited means at - .iis command to make the work of the society of benefit to all horticul - turists of the state. This is a big proposition and needs the hearty co-operation and help of every member and horticulturist in Nebraska to bring to successful conclusion. Kvery horticulturist in </seg>
            <seg id="p085">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY in the state should be a booster and member of this society. We are badly handicapped to keep up our work even in a small way by the amount of funds at our command. In order to carry on our work and get the results that we should we must have the members all pulling for a bigger and stronger society and help in increasing the funds at our disposal. The Secretary cannot do this work alone neither can the board of directors do it. It needs every member and every horticulturist in Nebraska in his place boosting, and wUfkiag. Local interest must be awakened and this must devolve on the local member or horticulturist to do. The Secretary is only to glad to co-operate in every way he can in carrying on this work. The year 1914 has taught us many lessons that we hope will 1&gt;&lt; of profit to us in 1915. The year 1915 should mt great strides for - ward in the horticultural development of t ho state in all phases of the work. </seg>

January 20th, 1915, the society met pursuant to Adjournment, and the following proceedings were had and done, and entered of record, to-wit: Mr. President : We will now take up the paper kf Prof. Y\". J. Morrill, of the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, which was to hue morning, on the subject, "Evergreens for Windbreaks, Illustrated EVERGREENS FOR WINDBREAKS. Prof. W. J. Morrill, Lincoln. l'rnt. Morrill: My talk was supposed to be illustrated but it was &gt;t convenient to get the lantern, and I presume if we had gotten the lantern, it would have been very troublesome to have r 'tten some M.ri of curtains to have excluded the light so that we could have any pictures, and therefore my illustrated lecture, will be without illus - trations. It is rather unfortunate for me, because I intended to talk in the dark upon subjects suggested by the pictures, as they were thrown upon the screen. Nevertheless I will try to present my sub - ject in the way in which I had not expected to do. Windbreaks are a mixed blessing: they do harm and they do (1. Shakespeare said. "The evil that men do lives after them, but In ynuil is oft times interred with their bones." And it seems true lso that the evils that windbreaks do, often make a deeper impres- ion than the good. We observe that windbreaks occupy ground hat could be used for field crops: that the shade from the wind - reak lessens the yields of crops for some rods on either side; and that the roots of the trees reach out and sap adjacent land of soil moisture. These evils and a few others of lesser moment are well known. But if. on the other hand, the array of benefits attributable to windbreaks outweighs the array of rvils, we should choose to* cruw windbreaks. The Benefits. Windbreaks furnish protection against the hot, dry, blighting; utherly winds of summer, and the cold, dry, killing northerly winds of winter. During the summer the windbreak protects, not abso - lutely, but considerably, our field and fruit crops from drought: and durinjj the winter our fruit trees from winter-killing. Windbreaks perform these valuable services most efficiently however, only when correctly located, properly established, well tended and composed of tree species adapted to climate and soil. Let us consider briefly how a windbreak acts: First. An effic - ient windbreak will reduce the velocity of a strong wind to a very noticeable extent. Measurements show that a wind with a normal velocity of 25 miles will be reduced to rive miles an hour, or to a velocity of only 20 per cent of the normal, at a point on the leeward. </seg>
            <seg id="p098">88 Ill to five times the height of the windbreak. At this point the imum retardation is found, as nearer than this to the windbreak currents that have penetrated through the windbreak near the ground are effective, and further friction with the air in normal windbreak. out the air is being accelerated by velocity above the height of the While the beneficient effect ward for a distance equal to ah if a good windbreak extends out - &gt;ut twenty time* the height of the windbreak, a windbreak i&gt; CMMMMMCaRy, "r practically, efficient, roughly, "ne rod for every toot in height. For example, a windbreak 40 feet high affords fair protection to the leeward for about 40 rods. Second. Because of lestcaed air velocity DM the leeward side a windbreak there is a checking of the transpiration of water, from the leaves of field crops and of orchard trcev The faster air travels the more rapid is the h&gt;s* of ~. &gt;li&lt;l moisture through the leaves. Tht soil moisture saved because of windbreak protection is equivalent as much yielded by shower*. ju*t as a "dollar saved is equival a dollar made" During a wet summer, the benefit of a windhrca few inches of the soil. You hav the surface of the ground during it till W 1 a high w tudied windl &gt;&lt; Hiservations by Bates, who , led him to say in Forest ! er will be the growth of the ervice Bulletin No. K&lt;&gt; : "How plants, if the evaporation i* r I the presence of a good windbreak to fifty or even forty per cenl (he normal amount? * * * A good windbreak 100 feet high ami MC - f mile long, will reduce by thirty-two per cent the evaporati"i in seventy-three acres, where the mean wind velocity is 10 mile - hour. By such protection the water supply of the field may bt lined until long after unprotected fields have become dry." Third: Because windbreaks reduce the velocity of the wind II a marked degree, they prevent the whipping of immature fruit in tin protected orchards. Bates found during his investigations referred to above that twenty-eight to thirty orchards unprotected by wind breaks showed an average yield of from one to three pecks per tree that partially protected orchards yielded from two to twelve peck - per tree, .ind that fuly protected orchards averaged 19.6 pecks pel tree. If these figures are true or a true index to the value of effic ient windbreaks around orchards, they increased the yield of fruii per acre in 1906, at least, many fold, or more definitely, the increase( yield was worth $80.00 per acre. It seems safe to assert that n&lt; Eiinji transpiration is. of COT1C, nothing; hut when a drought Her comes, a&gt; comes it alw.iv- lias, at intervals, tin- value of lirtak is fully rt-alizt&lt;l. and may -uvc the tiild .&gt;r ..rchard cr.&gt; wholly or in part. fc^^i{!^s a checking in transpiration the -lackiiiinw of air vclocit s also a retardation in evaporation oi moisture tor the uppi </seg>

Fourth: Numerous other benefits of windbreaks may be men- tioned, among which are their ability to hold light soils, sand and loess, from blowing; snow can be made to drift in preselected places where no inconvenience will result, or, if the windbreak is wide MMgfc, the snow will not drift in any place but will be held evenly leposited within the shelter-belt. Properly placed at a distance not closer than 100 feet to barns, rals nr dwellings, they provide agreeable windshelter to man and with con&gt;equent saving in fuel, and stock feed, without the ng presence of snow drifts. Besides the indirect benefits. am which mitigate climatic evils, tin- windbreaks furnish fuel, posts, lum- &gt;er and farm repairs to an amount that often fully pays a fair annual ental on the land occupied by them. They add beauty and the air ft to the farm and to the community, elements that also add o the property, just as lawn trees do to city property. .Mitigating the Evils of Windbreaks. Eve* the evils that windbreaks do may be mitigated considerably y careful management. The strip of land on either side of the windbreak shaded by the trees may lie more profitably employed in producing forage crops than grain crops. Less sunlight is required produce foliage than to mature the seed. A partial crop of alfalfa. ver. tiniotbv or kaffir corn, can be grow* here, and the farm road may lie located next to the trees Tlu- next most potent evil arises from the sapping of the land n either side by the roots extending outward from soil moisture. Frequent cultivation of this land will improve the moisture condi- near the surface, thus satisfying the surface roots of the trees and not making it necessary for the roots to extend far out. Deep plowing or the digging of a trench annually will cut off the strag- gling long surface roots and prevent much competition with the roots of the field crops or the orchard trees. Orientation. \ windbreak should cross the path of the prevailing strong winds cgioii. In Nebraska, we need protection against the prevailing southerly winds of summer, and the northerly winds of winter. Wind - breaks running east and west are therefore best here. As an east and west windbreak casts a narrower zone of shade than a north and south windbreak, another reason is added in favor of the east and west windbreak. The only disadvantage of this orientation, arises from the fact that such a windbreak tends to kill the lower branches of the windbreak trees in a hedge row, or the outermost trees of wider belts, thus requiring underplanting to maintain the efficiency of the shelter. </seg>
            <seg id="p100">90 Managing a Windbreak. I The spacing of the trees in a windbreak depends upon the species 1, the fertility and normal moisture content of tin- MB, and the th of the shelter.

A hedge row may l&gt;e spaced closer i a shelter-belt, as the roots have less compel it ion. »In planting a shelter-belt it is well, it convenient to plant the die raw or two tirst. and after four ur live years to plant another nr two on each side and continuing the process until the cross- E&gt;n of the shelter-belt assume The outer-most row or two of low branching conifers. I e hroadleaf species. roughly, the shape of a house on either side, may well be com - pccially if the interior rows are The sloping rout of the shelte elt thus made incline tl current upward and thereby extend the protection afforded. The outermost rows may be of species with tap roots rather than spreading shallow roots, and with crowns that do Bel spread far out. By this plan, also, the shelter-belt may be replaced gradually when mature without affecting much its protective feature. Of course, red cedar or any of the so-called cedars, will not be used within a quar - ter of a mile of an orchard, because of the fungus they may support. which lives a part of its life's cycle on the leaves and fruit of apple trees. Ample cultivation of the young trees m the windbreak as lone as possible will be rewarded with more vigorous, better shaped trees and of more rapid growth. And the replacing of dead trees during the first few years is advisable. When thinnings are made later on. to maintaii igor at § development of the remaining trees, or to provide fuel or posts, :tion for cutting should be made of the poorest, weakest, ill led trees and those crowding other better trees rather than from best trees. After from 10 to 20 years to keep the windbreak thick from the ground up and to maintain sufficient shade on the ground, under - planting with some shade enduring species like red mulberry, green ash or Black Hills spruce, will be highly desirable. Best Species. Cottonwood is the most popular windbreak tree of the middle west. It grows rapidly, attains good height, is hardy, but demands a good supply of moisture, such as is found on bottom land. It pre - fers a loose, loamy sand soil.

In short, one has ■onsiderahle choice of both broadleaf and evergreen trees for wind- reak ■\n&gt;und orchards, however, the windbreak should be either wholly rergrct— . or, if broadleaf species are used as the chief species. uous trees should be flanked with rows of evergreens. This ecause the orchardist is concerned not only in maturing a lull crop, but should also protect his fruit trees against winter-kill - ing. His windbreak must be effective both summer and winter. Measurements made, indicate that an effective windbreak will add the yield of a protected field, an amount equal to what can be own Dii a strip three times as wide as the windbreak is tall. A rnu-r in Nebraska could use to advantage 15 acres of a 160 acre farm for winbreak purposes and grow as much field crops on the remaining 145 acres well protected as he can on the 160 acres unpro - tected, thus saving the labor of farming the windbreaks and making t profit the wood products yielded by his windbreaks. In conclusion, permit me to offer as a summary, an adaption of Ten Commandments for Windbreak Planters, issued by the Forest service : 1. Place the windbreak at right angles to the direction of injur - ious prevailing winds. East and west windbreaks best for Nebraska. 2. Devote one-eighth of the farm to timber. Its protective value more than pays for the ground it occupies, to say nothing of the timber yield. 1 Plant only species suited to windbreak use, to the region and to the locality. 4. Plant rapid growers for quick results : but underplant with slower growing shade enduring species, which are usually longer lived and more valuable. </seg>

Do you wish to ibcasi this i44re&gt;t. In travel - over the eastern one-third of the state this summer, I have been y much impressed to see how much interest is being shown by farmers in permanent windbreak-, especially in evergreen wind - iks, and 1 think next to the commercial orchard, that that subject of highest; importance to the farmers all over the state of ate of t'aska, as far as I know. Those who formerly planted temporary bbreaks, and hedges, willows and cottonwoods. and those dicidu - trees, I think are turning their attention more bow to ever - n windbreaks. This subject that the professor has had is a very irtant one, and we will just steal a few minutes off from the subject to let you ask a few questions. Mr. Williams: I do not have any questions to ask, but I would like to add a point to something that he said in regard to the width of windbreaks when he advocated a wider plat, in order to avoid the effect of the snow drifting through it. I feel as though there is just a weak point there. Perhaps he did not intend to leave it uncov - ered. But I had the need of this brought forcibly home to me years ago. when living up in Platte county. A neighbor of mine had a grove of ash and box-elder, but they were pretty well burned up, and the hedge was way up high, with no limbs, and this grove was on the north of his house. Well, between the grove and his house was a highway, and the snows that came in the wintertime would drift </seg>

I had no big trees at all. but I had however a big plot of cedars. They were growing on the tilt road, and they were then perhaps only two or three ut those heavy snows whenever they came, with the .._ „ . _ . ».-^j *. U niv, nun lilt winds, lodged right among those cedars, and stayed there. the road remained open unobstructed entirely while the r with his hi&gt;;h break, ten times higher or larger and bigger mine, had a road full of snow. And the point I want to make h You want to have low-growing, as well as high growing es. If he had had low growth, the snow would have then lodged Ml tr,e&gt;. and left the roadway open. I think that there is a point it we must «ive to the farmers of the state for thought. If it was thing more than a half a dozen rows of corn stalks on the north the road, or the orchard, I would see that they were there, in ■ r.ier to hold the snow. In other words the snowbreak is quite as important as the windbreak in the winter time. There are several t..rin- of this low break which may be used; I have the mulberry. I think that a row of mulberries placed in hedge form, placed low to .1 J ■ &gt; , ground would be a very desirable addition to the other wind - ks. hut tiie evergreen is the ideal windbreak. Mr. Nati.m: What is the best time in the year to set out the rtrreens? Prof. Morril : The government, on the Nebraska National For -t Reserve, in the sand hills, has found out after a great deal of ixperience and many mistakes, that the earlier in the spring they l.lant their evergreens, the better. Therefore they are planting their M.uth slopes now before their north slopes have thawed out. and are already l.y the time the north slopes have thawed out to plant the .rth slopes, which should be done just as early as possible in the &gt;rin K : the sooner after the frost is out the better. That is what thev have determined there from results. Now in the east, we used to plant clear up to the middle of June and get good results, and where the climatic conditions are more favorable you can do so, but where you ave adverse climatic conditions, the method I have just described better in my opinion. Mr Nation: I read something a few days ago in the paper and when I told it to a nurseryman, he said it was wrong, and I wanted to Kit the opinion of someone that had been through the mill upon that What I read was as follows: The article, said, to set out your rvcrgreen and then to dig down in two or three weeks, according to the moisture that was falling, and pour a pail of water around the evergreen, and I have been told by a nurseryman, "Don't water them." Now I want to know which is right. Mr. Pollard : I would like to give my opinion. The great trouble </seg>

When a erynian comes around, they look so handsome we want them, and i we get them the trees die.

I saw the smoke ris - ing from the dozens of smokestacks, representing the industrial life of this capital city of Nebraska. I saw the smoke of your railroad yards and your factories. Back of these were churches and school - houses, and homes, and still back of these for hundreds of miles, I knew extended fertile farms and the basis of alt our wealth, and I thouKht how everything went back to nature and the soil, and how all these things were dependent one upon the other. Your factories would be silent, your railroads would become disused streaks of rust if it were not for the farms surrounding you. On the other hand, without these great railroads, which are the arteries of commerce and trade, and these factories and cities, which are the farmer's market, agriculture would stagnate, in fact, it would never have been born upon these prairies. And then 1 contrasted all this peace and progress and prosperity with the conditions across the water, where half the world is at war. where nation grapples at the throat of nation, where men art- mere pawns of monarchs and where human life and property, by the thousands and tens of thousands, are being daily swallowed up in the terrible vortex of war. It is said that Confucius, the great Chinese statesman, once trav - eled in a distant part of the empire which was infested with ferocious wild beasts. One day he came upon a woman weeping bitterly and stopping to inquire the cause of her grief learned that her husband had recently been killed by a tiger. "Why," asked Confucius, 'do you remain in a province infested with such danger?" "We have a good government here" was the woman's reply.

Coburn of Kansas, in referring to the average of 13 to 15 bushels per acre, on Kansas wheat land, once said, "Men write of the Shame of Cities' and the "Crime of Society," but this is the 'Crime of Agriculture.'" These old methods were sad mistakes, and were indeed costly, not only to the individual, but to the aggregate wealth of the community. And today we congratulate ourselves and the country that we are teaching and practicing bet - ter ways. We know now that we must farm and husband the land instead of mining it. We know now that if we would preserve the fertility of the soil, we must handle live, stock and market our crops in the form of beef and pork, and mutton. We know now that clover and alfalfa are as necessary to the life of our land as red blood is to the life of ur bodies. We know now what nitrogen and humus are, and that liey are the soil's capital. We know now that lands which wash away ih'ut return, and that ugly ditches, like ugly wounds, are not only unsightly but are sometimes fatal. Fields have been ruined by being gullied and washed to pieces. Nature's remedy is grass. We know now that corn stalks in a silo are better for the farmer and his herds than cornstalks in winter-swept and snow bound fields, and that we must mm this and all other roughness, if we are to handle livestock -ucesstully on high priced land. We know now that the hog is a grazing animal and that alfalfa should be on his bill of fare the year around. He should not only have alfalfa pasture from April to November, but should be fed alfalfa hay the rest of the year in racks, the same as cattle. We know that while the hog is growing we should furnish him with this cheap protein ration, but that when he fattening on a full feed of corn, alfalfa hay should be supplemented th a concentrated protein ration in the form of tankage. Feed a ,11 the alfalfa he will eat and at the present price of corn you ut off 20 cents on every bushel. We know now that every hogyard ould have its cement feeding floor, for every bushel of corn fed on li feeding floor saves a pound of pork. We know now that lice and ,vnriiis an- the two greatest enemies of the hog-raiser, and that ihcM an- easily controlled. We know that the great hog scourge can be prevented by vaccination, and that the man who properly guards hi&gt; bogl need tftm4 no sleepless nights on account of lion cholera. These observations are made from some experience in the hog business. Weaver Brothers raise 2,000 hogs every year, and we believe that hogs and alfalfa are the most profitable combination on the farm. Yes, we used to think that anybody could be a farmer. We know better now. It requires as much or more brains to farm success - fully, as it does to succeed in any other business. We used to think that we had to sow and reap like our fathers. We know better now. </seg>

The apples product this section are the equal, it not the superior in flavor and quality of any produced in the United States, and the fruit from sprayed and cared for orchards is eagerly sought by the buyers for the best city markets. Fortunately the values of our best apple lands, which are the hill or bluff lands, adjacent to the Missouri river, have never been inflated and can be purchased from $5000 to $125.00 per acre. Upon this basis orcharding is a safe business venture, particularly so when we consider the inflated values of orchard land in the irrigated sec - tions, from which points the freight rates to Minneapolis and Chicago ni the Mnoari Valley, and particularly my experience in tooth rn Nebraska, when Weaver Brother* owl and COMrol ami "1" rate over 200 acrt-s mt apple orchard.

            <seg id="p111">GROWING APPLES IN EASTERN NEBRASKA 99 is as much per bushel box as it is for a three bushel barrel from the Missouri river to the same markets. A large fruit dealer from Minneapolis, who had just returned from the Pacific coast, and who is familiar with every detail of the apple marketing business told me last September, that the orchardists of the Missouri Valley, who escaped the expense of irrigation and the expensive long haul, were the masters of the apple situation, and that all that was necessary to the highest success, was proper methods. I might add that the highest compliment I have ever had, as an orchardist, was paid me when this man, introduced me to two large orchardists of the Yakima Valley, Washington, as one of the very few men in the southwest who knew how to raise and pack apples. These two men, one of them an ex-Superior Court Judge, were in Minneapolis to sell their crop of western box apples. I don't know what success they had, but after a 30 minute conference with the fruit merchant, I sold him 13 cars of Nebraska apples, and have in previous years in less time, sold him as many as 30 cars, and always at a satisfactory price. Our apples are sold year after year to the same parties, on the same basis as your grain merchant sells No. I, No. 2, or No. 3 wheat and corn, with no dispute over the grades and qaulity. Raising apples under these conditions in the Missouri Val - ley, where natural conditions are almost ideal, make the business a desirable one. I will now discuss the essentials necessary for the production of good apples, as practiced in our orchards. We spray our orchards thoroughly. We spray three, and some - times four times during the season. The first is the dormant spray, before any foliage has appeared, with either Bordeaux Mixture or Lime and Sulphur. We prefer the Lime and Sulphur. We use no Bordeaux Spray after the foliage appears, as it produces a rusty appearance of the apple, especially on the Ben Davis variety. These sprays are used as a fungicide, controlling all diseases of a fungus nature, such as scab, blotch and kindred diseases. For the dormant spray one gallon of lime and sulphur should be used with twelve to fourteen gallons of water. Where Bordeaux is used it should consist of four lbs. of Copper Sulphate, four lbs. lime and 50 gallons of water. The next most important spraying is what is know as the blossom spray, which is a combination of Lime and Sulphur, and Arsenate of Lead, the Arsenate of Lead being the recognized insecticide for alt leaf eating insects, and the one great apple pest, the Codling Moth. This spray is made by using Lime and Sulphur diluted, one to thirty - live into which is added three pounds of Arsenate of Lead to fifty gallons of water. This spray should be applied with a pressure of from two hundred to two hundred and fifty pounds so that the poison spray will be forced into the calyx cup of ever blossom. The spray nozzles should be attached to the spray rod with a forty-five degree elbow so that every blossom can be reached from any angle. The man handling the spray rod is the "Man behind the gun." </seg>
            <seg id="p112">100 {lessness and indifference here may cost an orchardist hundreds &gt;llars. Every inside and top blossom should be reached. To do continuous driving with the sprayer is impossible. The machine Id be stopped at each tree so that thorough work can be domv e blossom spraying is not thorough and complete, the apples will r-ormy, no matter how many sprayings you give later. 1 will ly explain the reason for this. The Codling Moth is of a brownish color and about one half inch in length. It deposits its eggs on the bark of the tree and on its foliage shortly after the petals of the blossom falls. These eggs art - white specks about the size of a small pin head. Tiny worms which hatch from these eggs gradually work their way to the small apples and through the calyx cup into the apple core. If the spraying has been thorough this calyx cup is full of poison and the little worm dies from poison food without getting into the apple iln this latitude there are generally two broods of tkcM worm-. second brood appearing in from 40 to 60 days after the tirst. This &gt;d comes from the full grown worms surviving from the first. r about three weeks sprnt in the apple these MVnwn come out. a hiding place and here spin cocoons and change to a chry-ali - ti this comes again the Codling Moth, then the i'i;ks. then the xl of worms. tin the south, and sometimes here this operation is repeated i time, hence more spraying is necessary in MM sections an ons than in others. In this latitude we have been able to contn moth with two poison sprays, one immediately following the rir - he time of the calyx spray. This catches the late bloom and all of the earlier bloom missed in the first application. To spray successfully and economically, the orchardist should vide himself with a first class high power spraying outfit. Wi in our orchards seven power machines, one New Bean Machine, a magneto and six Cushmans, manufactured in St. Joseph. Mo. N'ext in importance in the care of an orchard is systematic and heavy pruning. Do net do it all in one year but do part of it every year. Keep the tops cut back, the center cleaned out and the lower branches cut away, so that the air and sunshine will be admitted. After doing this have your pruners take stepladders and k&gt;&lt; around the tree, thinning the sides of the tree which are liable to become too bushy. This side trimming is very important, a lesson which we have learned within the last few years. In this connection, however, I would caution the orchardist against cutting away too many sicje branches on the south and west. These parts of the tree get enough sun in any event to properly color the fruit and too much pruning on the south and west may subject the limbs and trunk of that tree to injury from the hot summer sun. We keep all water sprout- out of the trees by sending a foreman with eight or ten boys through the orchard, the last of June each year, and, with gloved hands, all sprouts </seg>
            <seg id="p113">GROWING APPLES IN EASTERN NEBRASKA 101 are rubbed off with no injury to the tree, and at small expense. In pruning leave no stubs as these are a source of infection from disease and borers. Stubs do not heal readily as the wound is too far from the &gt;ap circulation of the tret. Many orchards have been ruined and are being ruined by the stubs left in pruning. The limbs should be taken off close to the trunk or at the fork. Paint every wound at once, that means within two or three days. If you allow the wood to dry and check you have left an opening for disease, insects and the weather. We have always used white lead and oil, colored with lamp black to produce the tree trunk color. The last two seasons we used a pruning compound, an asphalt paint which had been recom - mended to us. and found it very satisfactory. We prune only in May and June, and in any event not later than he middle of July These are the ideal months, both for healing and painting- In the winter time wounds cannot be always promptly painted and are subject to the killing process of zero weather. \lter a tree is put in shape and properly trimmed, a little work year will keep it in good condition. I would urge on every orchardist the necessity of making pruning secondary only to spraying. We have learned that we cannot grow both wood and good fruit on same tree. We have also learned that fancy apples do not grow leiise foliage. tf spraying and pruning are the Siamese Twins of Orcharding. are Cultivation and Fertilization likewise twins in the same family. You can grow good apples which are well colored, fair size and free from worms by pruning and spraying properly, but you will have larger apples, more of them and come nearer raising a crop every year by adding proper cultivation and fertilization. We use the ordinary disk as soon as the ground is dry and free n trust and then harrow after every rain. This keeps a dust mulch he orchard and conserves all the moisture. This cultivation should kept up until the middle of July, even until the first of August re is any s,,d in the orchard this should be plowed up, and then sk and harrow used. Kvery bearing orchard should be systematically fertilized. We use the ordinary barn-yard manure every year, where available. When not, we use nitrate of soda and get even better results. This year we used a carload of nitrate of soda purchased of Swift &amp; Co., St. Joseph. Some day we expect to have a soil analysis made in all our orchards and then supply only those elements in which the soil is deficient. We have secured excellent results, however, from the ordi - nary manure. A few years ago we manured heavily, ten acres in one orchard. Since then we noticed the increased yield and superior quality in the tree row. This was the best investment we ever made in the orchard b»«—m We contend that by conserving the moisture by cultivation and feeding the tree&gt; by fertilization we can raise apples every year barring </seg>

We have been raising apples every year from the same for the last three years and if we can continue this for the three years, will be quite sure that this continued production U proper cuitivaion and fertilization. Ey spraying and pruning the tree is kept healthy and vigorous, ltivation and fertilization there is enough moisture and strength il to set healthy and strong fruit buds every year. I Each spring the hanging bark on the trunk and limbs of the trees ild be removed. This should be done just before the dormant iy. This clinging bark furnishes a breeding place for insects, ms and disease. For its removal we use the ordinary mud curry - fa, the surface of which has no sharp points but consists at circular pieces of corrugated tin. These can be purchased at any hardware store and are the best things we have found for the work I The old uncared for orchards in this country are dying as if by epidemic. Some day we will wake up and find that the only hards which are left are the commercial orchards, which have jived proper care and attention. The flat and round headed ers are doing this deadly work. Kach summer we go through orchards and cut away all diseased parts, dig out the borers ami away the affected part back to the live wood and bark, disinfect wounds with Bordoux Mixture, and paint the wounds. The round-headed borer works in t lie wood, the flat headei: works between the wood and the bark and keeps killing ba bark. Poor pruning, especially where stubs are left is rc-p for much of the trouble from borers. I There is also considerable Illinois Canker in the orchards &lt;&gt;t thi itory. which especially affects the Hen Davis. The same treat it is recommended and by use of the Bordaux Spray at th ■nant state, and the use of Lime ami Sulphur combined wit cnate of Lead as a summer spray, it is claimed that the ravage his new disease can he kept in check. We have thoroughly trie treatment and in normal years had fair success, but the last tw seasons have shown the weakness of such trees, and where • is much affected, we recommend its destruction. The planting of an orchard should be with ereat care as U distance between the trees and the selection of varieties. Appl&lt; trees should be planted forty feet apart and upon good rich protind. This will enable the trees to develop la food size and kp . room for work in the orchard. There is also sufficient room to ere. crops between the rows during the productive period, and thus raisi the orchard at small expense. As to the selection of varieties, I would plant one-sixtli Wint sap, one-sixth Jonathan, one-sixth Delicious, one-sixth Grimes Golden one-sixth Blacktwig and one-sixth Ben Davis. In a small orchard il might be advisable to increase the Jonathan and Winesap. but in a larger orchards I would limit these varieties, on account of their pro- </seg>

The President: I am sure we are glad we got acquainted with Mr. Weaver. It is just such pactical orchardists that these fellows are looking for, who are intending to plant commercial orchards. elieve you had better ask Mr. Weaver some questions? Mr Marshall: I would like to ask Mr. Weaver what distance would recommend for the commercial planting in the Missouri territory Mr. Weaver: I said 40 feet, but if I was planting an orchard ] would say 20 feet, and cut out every other row. (.) At what BBel A. The ordinary man would not cut his tree down. That has been the experience. I have seen orchards growing up into regular forest trees, because the men do not have the nerve to cut the trees out. But the best apples are raised on young trees, and by proper cultivation you could bring a tree into early bearing, earlier than in the past and by setting these trees 20 feet apart, you could get room for them.

Q. Well, cultivation is all right? A. Well our idea was this, that we had to cultivate in order to conserve the moisture. And we had to feed these trees something sn that there would not only be moisture but plant food. I may be wrong about that, hut that is simply my idea. Mr. Pollard : Well that is what I want to get at, we always want they were asking. We have no healthier or more vigorous growing tree than the Delicious, and we haven't one that is freer from canker and we haven't a variety that has a more uniformly and well distril uted crop throughout the tree: it has stood lower temperatures bloom than any other variety except the Ingram, which wasn't so fully out when this frost came. It is a hardier tree than the others. And it is a good regular bearer, where it is coming into bearing: and we have regarded it as one of our choicest coming varieties. I do not think even the Jonathan will equal it in flavor, so I think it is an apple worth trying out in the orchards in this state Mr Marshall: How early does it begin bearing in your state? to learn all we can. A Member: I would like to ask if the Ben Davis apple is n&lt; more likely to l&gt;ear under more adverse conditions than any otht variety?

Prof. Whitten: The Delicious about which inquiry has been mad' has in some of our orchards down in Missouri, begva to come • : ; • hearing. My own opinion of it is this, with reference to the notion </seg>
            <seg id="p119">107 A. Just as early as the Jonathan, there is practically no differ - •ncc. seven or eight years, and it sets even more uniformily throughout he tree than any other variety that is in the commercial orchards in In-, section. Apples just far enough apart for each apple to develop &gt;erfectly, and close enough together to get a good crop on it, it if ■emarkable for that characteristic. Prof. Howard: I would just like to add a word briefly I thought he DtlicioM was progressing enough three years ago, that I ordered K) trees planted in the experimental orchard of the state farm, and hey are getting along now, but haven't reached bearing age And know of 65 trees west of Columbus, that are owned by Mr. Babcack : that city. They have borne several crops, and I was out there and Kited that the trees have grown throughout and are very similar to he Grimes Golden. Mr. Weaver: There is one thing further, and that is that the lands for fruit in Nebraska are the lands closest to the Missouri ver on account of the character of the soil. 1 have always known at for ■ good many years, hut have been more convinced the ast tun years. 1 have two orchards close to the Missouri River, .ind the last two dry seasons we have raised elegant crops on those rchanl-, whereas on the dryer, harder and closer soils and lan-ls urther away from the river, our production was smaller. The land rtry the trees had hard work to survive, although we didn't suf - h from canker or drouth. And when you consider that the«e II lands can be purchased from $75 to $125 an acre, it looks to me lat the orchard business is a very safe business venure. especially A-hen you compare these orchard land apples with the apples from in the irrigated sections of the west, where they run I! to the hundreds of dollars Mr Marshall: Before we get too far along with the program there is a little matter I want to bring up.

            <seg id="p120">108 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 1 r i i .1 when I was a boy, we used to grow apples that were perfect in every respect. There was not a blemish; you could not find a blemish on the apple, and I will say too, that we followed no modern agriculture methods at that time. We planted the tree, and that was the end it until we went to harvest the crops, and we harvested bount crops, and they were always perfectly clean also. Now during th period of time, of course every farmer had a small orchard, ar was marketing his fruit himself, and so experienced bo trouble. \V were removed great distances from other fruit producing and their fruit coming in here was no better than our own a as its perfectness was concerned. The quality also was no better thai ours, and consequently we experienced no trouble in marketing al the apples we could produce. But now it is different. Tht was a time following those years when it was perf far as the disease was concerned. But after this tim years, our orchards were visited with the various « 1 1 il t wards wrought such havoc.

And the result of this was whe he bought a barrel of apples from this region he found it infected wit this disease that came in, while it was not true with the apples fror the northwest, and as a result he purchased the northwest apples, an it was not but a little while until we found ourselves without a h&lt; </seg>

We find here in the city of Lincoln and ( &gt;maha, and in all the great centers of population lot only in this state, but throughout the central part of the United States, that the apples that are consumed, very largely are apples that come e Rocky Mountains. Now there was a reason here was a reason why the men on the coast tion of scientific culture of apples before we did. lly means of support; 1 refer to those that were in ss. They cannot raise the crops that we do here, the men who were growing apples here, were pro - ttle and wheat and so forth. That was their chief 11 jpation ; producing apples was an incident to the main crop, and as a result they did not appreciate the importance of taking up scientific culture of apples. Hence the western men came in and absorbed their market while they were resting on the oars. But be that as it may. it is not material what the cause may be for this situation, but the fact remains that this is the condition as one of t presidents said ?o well, "It is a condition, and not a ficory, fronts the apple grower in this community today." Now what are you going to do about it. Gentlemen my opinion is that the solution of this question of marketing our crop and winning back home market which we all recognize to be the best market in world no matter what the product may be we have to offer for follow the same method that the men followed who stole sale t&gt; Now how did they do it? They rganizations on the Pacific coast, ■eattle, representing the northwest have two or three great business One at Los Angeles, another at and one on this side, or in the lidst of the mountains, representing the east of the northwest. The astern part of the northwest. Those great business organizations made up of fruit men. They are not men who are brokers or lesalers. engaged in the handling of fruits, but they are the pro- &gt;f the fruit. Those organizations are made up of the men w the apples. Now those men realize that standing singly it \v tter of utter impossibilty for them to place their fruit in the city of Lincoln or Omaha, and other centers and dispose n competition with the growers here at home, and so they went these great organizations, where those growers ther and join hands. They say we will co-operate; we will place our whole production of apples, or oranges, or lemons, or what - ever it may be in the hands of a central selling agency, in order that we may reach all the markets over the country, and not only the United States, but the whole world. By co-operating, and by con - solidation of their efforts and their wealth and products, they have built up an organization that today girts the world. And we are finding their fruit all over the world, exactly as it is here. </seg>
            <seg id="p123">110 Now then I believe it is a pretty good idea when you find some - one doing something that we are doing, and doing it a great deal better than we are doing it, it is a pretty good idea to pattern just a little. I believe this, gentlemen, that we are never going to win back this home market, we fruit men in Nebraska, unless we get together. We have to adopt some methods in marketing our fruit that are in vogue in the northwest, and the extreme west today. Of we will never bring back our fruit. Why is it that the extra fancy apples growing in the northwest today art 1 selling at a premium at a dollar and a half a box. And thousands of barrels are going begging on the market. So far as its flavor is concerned our fruit WTfllli - it infinitely. Gentlemen 1 want to say to you that it is up to us to get together as producers of fruit — It is up to us to co-operate UHi| ourselves and we are attempting to do that in a small way. We have as you know our Central Fruit Growers Association, and the only trouble with that is it doesn't include every single grower of fruit in Nebraska. That is the only trouble with it. Now the moment we get together in a co-operative way, it is our business to demon - strate to the consumers of apples in this section and in the region round about us, and in the markets that naturally belong to u&gt;. which we can do, that our apples are better than the apples that come from the northwest, in every respect. 1 care not upon w may do it — enter upon an advertising campaign as th I us do as they have done, and if we do it and mple our association has set and put out an extra fane every package exactly what we represent them to l&gt;t consumer buys a package, he finds every apple i :tly as represented, then we will drive the northwc ;r out of this market, just as sure as the sun rises to K'ow the only trouble with Central Fruit Grower! e haven't all the men in Nebraska that are prod nt to say to my good friend Weaver over here — Mr \Y been acquainted for the last 25 years, and we rulibe in the university — but I want to say, that 1 believe it leaver Brothers and every other producer of fruit o E:ial scale in this section, to join in and help to put N'ebra map, and help us to redeem our people here, or redeem out ket and demonstrate to our people here that we have a as any place in the world. t[ do not want my good friend Weaver to think I am criticizing because I am not in the least, but what 1 believe is this, gentle - : That as citizens of Nebraska, we owe the obligation to our c. It is not enough that we do well ourselves, and that we supply family with the necessities and comforts of life, and prepare for age as we should do, but I believe we owe a duty to the state and he community and to society to exercise that duty, and I believe </seg>
            <seg id="p124">111 that those of us who are engaged in the production of fruit should put our shoulders to the wheel, and carry that movement forward. I think you should join hands and help us out, and help us add thou - sands and thousands of dollars to the wealth of the state of Nebraska and to the comfort of the home, to the health of the people, of this state. Discussion. The President : It has been customary for us to have discussions following these talks. Have any of you anything to say further on the subject that Mr. Pollard has talked upon. A Member: I have been one of the first men to help form a fruit association — A. T. Hart and I, were one of the first men who formed a fruit growers association in Lincoln. I have stood in the stores many times, and can tell brother Pollard why we lost our home market. Today a man came to me and said he ordered a box of Nebraska grown Winesaps. When they arrived, he found they came im Hood River Valley. He said to the grocer, "Where were they awn?" And the grocer said "They were northwestern apples.' He said "1 ordered Nebraska grown apples, send up your automobile. and get this box of apples and send me Nebraska apples." Ham when a customer comes in and asks for Nebraska apples. ers say we have them, but these are so much better that 10 comparison. It is a lack of civic pride in the grocers here when they will recommend a foreign grown article instead MM grown one, and until you get that civic pride you will not ur own goods. Unless you get a man to swear by his own and his own territory you cannot get that line of business to by you. Here is the case of the Pure Butter company, they ut butter all over the state, but they do not sell in Lincoln, and he lack of civic pride. Mr. Weaver: Mr. Pollard referred to the fact that I am not in Fruit Growers association. I will state that I believe in the fruit k-ers association, and at the time it was organized I was at two we :hree of the preliminary meetings, and agreed to go into this ciation, if the association before they started on the marketing basis, and before they put the association brand on their packs would take a couple of years and try to educate the members to properly regulate and grow and pack their fruit. I told the boys, you do not need to be afraid of us, we are not going to interfere with you, and we have been selling our apples to a pretty high class of trade, and have been getting a good price, and it is perfectly satisfactory. Now I want to say that these gentlemen are on the right line, and it may be that I will look you over again and go in with you. I want you to succeed and there is no reason why you should not have this Nebraska market. It is the market right at home, and of course the best market of all. </seg>
            <seg id="p125">112 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Now as an illustration of that, and of just what can be done, I will say there was a gentleman from Seward, Nebraska, who runs a fancy grocery store there, came down to Falls City, and I showed him some apples I had there, and we agreed on the price and Iything of that kind, but I recommended that he take a car - of apples up at Shubert in an orchard that Governor Morehead I had. I quoted these apples at four dollars a barrel on the track, they were good and fine, and they were going to be packed right, he told me he would let me know when he got home — he said it n get another groceryman to go in with me I will buy that car here. When he got home he wired me he would take the Shubert After he got that car of apples nut home and had sold part of them, and put the rest away — he knew what they were by that timt he wrote me that they were the 1 Seward. Now this year that man asked me what apples were worth the price very good, but I aimed show you why I gave him good st car of apples that called me up on the telephor and what I could give him. I to Rive him good stuff, and I will stuff. He told me to «*• him so many barrels of this and that, and fix up that car, and left it Now it rained in the meantime and he didn't get that ca two weeks, and during that time there had been two carl into Seward, some of your western box apples, and he kept phor when the apple market began to get good, and thuse Mk of apples all at once up there, and 1 said. "I will let &gt; &lt;&gt;u sell these for me. I have held these apples, and now I ar make money on them." I have the circular I referred to, where they said something like this. It was issued in May, 1912, along about the 10th or 12th of May, and as follows: "In accordance with our predic - tions of last week the apple market is considerable higher, but we are now fortunate in having some of the Weaver pack on hand which are by far the best apples coming to this market, and they are in color, the equal, if not the superior to tin western grade." And then ■about this carload of apples. But 1 wa-n't K"'"u lo get t li i s car ou lim unless I could get it to him right. I told him that in so man KIs.

And I say this from wha I know of Mr. Pollard and his method of 4otag bu-ine-s, and his pad and Val Keyser, and these other geatleMea, their methods are ju- at good as that, for I know it. But I am telling you this from my o\\ experience, to try and interest some of you gentlemen that have in been doing it right, so that you will do it right.

Finally his agent was so impressed with country and the production of apples along the Missouri river, that he sent this partner out— and the first thing the old man said was that he wasn't going to buy a Ben Davis at any price. I took him t to my orchard, and I sold him 12 car loads in ten minutes, and couple of carloads of Jonathans in the same time. He then went k tn New York to buy apples, and his brother wrote me, or it wa* partner, and he said he had nothing to suggest as to the pack or quality. The next fall, the old gentleman wired me from Chicago, ind he came out to Falls City and I took him around and showed him the orchards, and the old gentleman told me that the year before when he went back and told his partner what he paid for this stuff that he thought the old man had gone entirely wrong, but when he saw the apples he was satisfied. Now the next year he wanted to buy all the apples, but I would t sell him all of them. He wanted them all because along in May June there was some party from Norway in there, a reputable merchant over in Norway with whom he did a good deal of business, and the old man told me he wanted to ship them to N'orway. The thing I want to get at is, if you neglect your pack, and through indif - ferent methods, and carelessness, allow your apples to become of uality. you will some day suffer for it. The President : We will now hear from Father Harrison, on The Future of Horticulture." THE FUTURE OF HORTICULTURE.' By C. S. Harrison, York. Horticulture is a large word. It takes in the nursery, tree grow - ing, the orchard, ornamental shrubbery and the vegetable and flower gardens. It is something immense. It takes a man of brains and energy to grasp it. Think of the triumphs achieved in the last half century. At first you see a broad expanse of prairie, with no tree or shrub, only a few scraggy groves along our streams. Now your eye takes in com - fortable homes — cottages embellished with beauty, barns and dwell - ings protected by windbreaks and groves. In the yards stately trees, flowering bushes and beds of choicest flowers. Our prairies weary </seg>

There orchards of apples, plums and cherries on every hand. \ ou start Mage and the trees grow so rapidly that the houses are hidden soon, instead of a town you see a forest which is sheltering it. We well remember the bleakness of the early days, when in winter old Boreas charged down upon us, scourging us with the sting - ing lash of the North wind and in the summer the siroccos came with their scorching blasts as if pouring from the gates of inferno, whipping, cuffing and withering. Now how our trees stand guard as faithful sentinels and our flowers how they cheer us. So with little effort we are surrounded with fields Klysian.

            <seg id="p131">THE FARM HOME AND VEGETABLE GARDEN 117 9 o'clock A. M. January 21st, 1915, the Forty-sixth annual meeting of the Nebraska State Horticultural Society convened, pursuant to adjournment, and the following proceedings were had and done. The President : The next subject upon the program I see is b&gt; Mr. \V. R. Martin. Manager of the Wathena Fruit Growers' Associ - ation of Wathena, Kansas, but in as much as Mr. Ma-Min does not seem to be here, we will take up the next paper, by Pro:. Gco. W. Hood, of the Uni. of Neb., Lincoln, Nebraska, on the subject, "The Farm Home and the Vegetable Garden." THE FARM HOME AND VEGETABLE GARDEN. Prof. Gco. W. Hood, Lincoln. Prof. Hood: Now probably the better way to get at this subject would be to give somewhat briefly the subjects which are included in Horticulture, and then to show you the relative importance as shown by financial returns derived from those crops. In order to do this I have secured a few statistics from Washington which I think will bring this out very nicely. First of all I want to divide Horticulture into four main divisions. First, I am going to put vegetable growing. It is proven beyond a doubt that its value is far in excess of any other horticultural crop grown. That then, is subdivided into truck farming proper, and by that we mean the growing of all vegetable crops on a large scale, that is for instance trucking sections that have a crop like potatoes and onions grown extensively, and disposed of at wholesale. Bean? also may be included in that, or any other crop similarly grown. Next I am going to put truck gardening which is distinguished from truck farming, and is scattered more or less around large cities, in which we have a number of vegetable grown more or less for the retail trade. Following this closely, comes the garden for the home, &gt;&lt;r suburban garden. The next division is pomology or fruit gardening and I will give you some figures on that from the last census report. According to the Nebraska report I find the number of apples grown in the State was 1,200,000 bushel, valued at $1,060,000 compared with the potatoes which were something over 9,000,0G0 dollars. I could find no hsrurt* on the value of the other vegetable croos. but I know there are certain sections which are producing large financial gains, and I might men - tion the seed industry, and its bi-product of vegetables, which is scattered around Waterloo and from which many of our corn crops : s grown. I might say here that Nebraska produced 80 per cent of the seed corn in the United States, showing the relative value of the great financial gains from that side. Now to ca r ry this further and compare the results of the entire United States, we have a total value of the vegetables of the United States as being $418,000,000. The potato alone in this country is </seg>
            <seg id="p132">118 '(I valued at $166,000,000; sweetpotatoes at $35,000,000 and the remainder of the vegetables make up the rest. Now we have $222,000,000 for the fruits altogether. So I think you can readily see from those figures the importance of these crops. Now then I wish to sa&gt; just a word here in stimulating your interest in home gardening, since it is impossible for me to no into detail in any way as to the various devices or methods of makin-,' i home garden. 1 thought it might he of interest to take up JMK a little in detail some of the tests we have tried at the station this &gt;ear to show what different varieties would do. Owing to the lack of funds arc ureat a degree as I would like to crops, which I consider the Ml taken, which would illustrate very in certain regions. Take potatoes essentials and one of the main en station, just merely as a variety te were not able to carry this on to a - hut I have picked up three of thi t profitable, and tlieir yield-. «r&lt; nicely the value of certain varieli : in as much as this is one of tlu ps. we tried out 43 varieties at tin • t. and we found in that there wcri great ranges of yields, ranging tram 08 to .S2V bushels to the acre \\ had practically one-fortieth of an acre devoted to each variety, an they were given regular rield conditions. Now to show you how the\ ran and to show you some of the percent of culls which are produce as well as marketable varieties of potatoes. I want to give you rvures. I might say that the Karlv Ohio which is conceded by every the station, and we sold some at $1.05 a buibel at that tin that time, the yields were reduced, but the prices wer it really paid to sell rather than to hoi Now we found that the Alhloma followed the Early Oh econd, the Triumph and Irish Cooler were next. Now the last tw were not particularly adapted for all purpose^ since the potatoes wt irregular, and not as good a type as the Karlv Ohio. Sweet Pota were also tried out in a somewhat similar manner, and judging fro the records we took at the station, it would indicate that Nebr was more or less adapted to the gTOWMf of Sweet Potatoes l-'..r ■ lad in the growing of the sweet potatoes. 12 varieties, and they rar in yields from 50 bushel up to 500 and 544 bushel. Now some larger growing types of yams that are not considered quite eating, do have quite a value for stock feeding and cann are usul quite considerably in the MMtk Now the yellow ai Jerseys which are quite the highest quality for eating, averaged 45' to 455 bushcK to the acre I might say that judging from growth an Kto be the leading variety of thi- m-cmihi. that we pra 329 bushel le acre of that variety, which a&gt; yum mt i- (|iiiti j a profitable crc.i though around Lincoln i&gt; not C0WCe4cd to b* tilt- heal i&gt;otat on in the State, hut be that as it may. we think it is a | 1 MCtioi I also wish to call your attention at this time of the lellMfl i potatoes beforr they mature, and that proved to lie quite profitable a </seg>
            <seg id="p133">THE FARM HOME AND VEGETABLE GARDEN 119 from the way the vines stood the drouth, they were particularly adapted to that section, and in fact better than any other crop we had. Tomatoes were also a very profitable crop, it we can judge from all the yields that were obtained. We had 80 varieties, in all, whicn ranged in yield from 100 bushel to 700, with all the stages between these figures. Now some of the varieties were superior to others, anil the yield was also superior in some ways. I also want to call your attention now to some of the virtues of the tomato. You probably have heard considerable about the various strains of the vegetable, and I do not know of any other crop that has more strains than th» tomato. The Karliana illustrates that as well as any other tomat &gt; I tried out four strains of the Earliana which averaged from 150 '.o 450 bushel., so that you see it sometimes pays to pick out certain strains which have demonstrated their power of producing a hi-jnr yield Now just a word in regard to the home garden. I think the loca- tion and arrangement is more or less definite in the minds of most of you, but 1 want to just say that by all means it seems to me the home garden should be given more of less prominence, and more attention should be paid to that in the production of fruit as well as vegetables for home consumption. Xow this will fit in well with the orchard, and a home maker along with the orchard, and the size is determined more or U-ss by the size of the family and those that are to use it. Here is a point too: It seems to me, in talking with many tanners, and looking over many regions although I would not care to make a statem to the percent, but the great percent depends entirely ipon the grocery for their supply of vegetables and fruit Now there is one great advantage in having a garden of your own. First the pleasure you get out of it, and second the chance to produce quality which is almost impossible to buy on the market. You are probably familiar enough with the varieties to know that we have many commercial varieties that are not superior in quality, but they u other qualities such as being good shippers, which makes them good for that purpose. Now if you have your home garden this can &gt;e done away with, and you can grow quality, and it is a great advan- tage Another thing which should be considered in the consideration of a garden is the construction of the hot bed. In addition to the plants that can Ik glow, which in turn increases the yield and makes the crop come M the market or places the crop on the market in an earlier time, we have the opportunity of growing some of the earlier crops such as lettuce and radishes, earlier in the season and also late in the fall. Of course it goes without saying that the farm garden sh &gt;ni&lt;l be located next to the house and well drained if possible, and should be a sandy loam, although if properly handled it can be brought u to a state of fertility, without having a portion that comes up to a' : these requirements </seg>

I will say that the present method of planting under individual care show usually bad effects and by having it under one central board — for instance if Mr. Barnard is in a village and knows how these things should be done, it is only proper that he should be on that board, and it is with that idea in view, nf getting someone that is competent to take care of the entire planting, and who has better knowledge, than every Tom, Dick and Harry, that this resolution is brought forward.

Now the apple is, and we give it credit of being the king of fruits, and it is generally known as that, because it is perhaps the most met fruit we have, in a commercial way, and while the apple is the king of fruits, I wish to say that the grape might be known as the queen.

But I will mention a lew things in regard to his recommendation- The limitation of my subject to the commercial point of view brings into prominence the great commercial grape for this section of the country — the Concord. The sturdiness and hardiness of its vines which resist both drought and freeze, its unfailing production. The convenience in gathering for the picking season of it extends over three weeks, its packing qualities and most of all its excellent flavor makes it so far above other tirapr - believe, I am safe in saying that 951 yards are Concords. as a commercial product, that, I of the vines in commercial vine- In selecting the site for a vine ferred and the slope should be tow ■yard hilly ground should be pre - ard the south. This will give the necessary air ventilation which is needed because of the dense foliage and the hot sun for ripening. And soil that is not too poor and a clay subsoil will do, but it should be free from hard pan as the deep roots protect the vine during drouth. The first few years after planting give the young vines a chance Keep the weeds down with freqt rows. This should be continued the entire life of the plant. \Y success in growing grape- nt cultivation and hoeing out oi the after the vine matures and during ithotlt cultivation there will be no Next in importance is pruning. In this connection I quote Prof. T. J. Maney of the Iowa Agricultural Kxperiment Station, who has made a careful study of our vineyards near Council Bluffs. "If you recommend the long system of pruning I believe it should be for trial for the present, although I am almost convinced that it will be the best system for growers in Southwestern Iowa to follow in future pruning. It is used in practically every other region in the United States where American grapes are grown. produce fruiting canes for 1916. </seg>

The spurs "Care last year's growth which has been cut back to one that they will produce a strong wood growth which w used next year for the fruiting canes." Two purposes are aimed at in this system of pruning, a maxi- fruit and the gluwlk ofl a new set of canes to bear fruit ng year when the old fruit bearing canes are cut back to ur^ and the renewal process constantly carried on. There is only ne other question involved and that is the vitality of the vine itself nd this, I think, is what Mr. Maney has in mind when he speaks of ystem being on trial for the present but I know of vineyards e the system has been carried on for a dozen years where par- iVlHT •talk shows mure strength and vitality each year, and in fact re \itality than vines pruned by any other system. here is almost no limit to the life of the Concord vine I have actual first hand knowledge of one vineyard near Council Bluffs that is thirty-seven years old and the original vines are still in excellent aring condition and apparently as vigorous as ever. The grapes in our county are very free from disease or insect Leaf hopper is a pest only where lack of cultivation allows the weeds to crow under and about the vines. Borers can be eliminated by careful pruning and cutting away all canes where they appear and burning them. Black rot appears only where rows are too close together or on level ground and in a wet season. These are the only pests that I know of. We do not spray. But actual esults arc after all what count and these are most encouraging. One grower this year from a five acre vineyard produced and sold hrough the association 7269 eight pound baskets, an average of 1,454 iaskets per acre and realized a net profit after paying all expenses ncludirig his own labor and use of his team of over $150.00 per acre. This result is slightly higher than the average but can be attained with any vineyard properly located and cared for. The average pro - duction is a little better than 1.000 baskets per acre. The average price per basket of grapes handled through our association since it hat commenced business is .183 per 8 pound basket. Our association has been very successful in handling our grapes. It has handled our fruit during the past year at the remarkably low i-o^t of S '-T' r &lt; • Hir manager tells me that the demand is constantly increasing and as long as this condition exists there will be no danger of over production. The association has orders for 30,000 young plants mostly Concords and a few Moore's Early to be set out this spring by association members. We have not yet gotten into the really big business in grape growing and we have no grape juice factory, nor the acreage to justify it. However, we have done enough to prove that the opportunity is here and all that is needed is for more people to engage in the busi- </seg>
            <seg id="p141">126 ness of grape growing. I know of nothing that gives a better return on labor expended with greater certainty. One crop of grapes has never been a total failure and the result of Professor Maney's experi - ments showing the possibility of getting larger returns by applying lat - est methods of culture and pruning. The very satisfactory return* received by those now engaged in the business and the increase in acreage arranged for bids fair to make the grapes an important asset tir Horticultural productions and every effort to promote the try is not wasted. Now I might add here. I told you in my paper that there was an fr of 30,000 vines that had been ordered through the association bers. Now what is the reason for this increase this year We had that association now for about twenty years, and in the five or six years there is practically no increase in the crop. And I do not know there would have been tliis year tor certainly there i iiw ii. »i mion intn. n.'uiii ua.i i".cn mis jui^iui tiiiamit inci would not have been orders for these thirty thofisaiid grape vint Irss we had had a secretary the n and to remind the yen . rssary for their success.

The state oi n explain to you just how it was on. or how. but anyway Professor state college, for two years, and he thought t hi - section of Sonth- K:ern Iowa was the section of country that is bcM adaptc producing of grapes. Hi- lias tested all the grape growing se he country, especially in New York, and in the east, and h&lt; &gt;| he knows of no place anywhere in tile United States win l&gt;e growing industry is more likely to succeed than it N the soil in Southwestern Iowa, and of course Eastern Xel which has the same soil and where the same conditions pr Now after he took charge of the work, he had 1 Bhe Commercial club in Council Bluffs He went out and visitt e vineyards and he told them what he thought they should d he made some recommendations, the last ipriag; he often wet wt into some vineyard and showed them how to prune, and in June we had a picnic which brought the growers together, and we visited some of these places, where he showed the difference in his system of prun - ing and the old system. Now most of the vineyard men who had vine - yards, weren't very well posted in the business — they would follow a system of pruning— what they called the spur system They would prune with the spur system with a view of renewing the wood and the vines. He took some of these vineyards and pruned one row for them, or a certain number of vines according to his system, and let them continue in the old system on the other vines. I got a report on them in this letter he wrote me, and while it is a personal letter I just want to mention a few things in it to show the change. I brought the letter along, and here it is regardiag the vineyard of J. </seg>
            <seg id="p142">127 \V. Darling, which shows the difference. There was thirty vines pruned, at an average of eight and nine joints every vine. 1 will give you an increase of his system over the old system, which is thirty - two per cent at gathering time. Here is another vineyard that he pruned. He put in his system, and the owner of the vineyard followed his own system, and there was an increase of twenty-five per cent ; and here is another one, that is still better, Mr. Johnson's vineyard. There is an increase of 85 per cent in that one. Well the grape grow - ers could sec at once that they were neglecting something, and that they wen- losing money by following their own system, and I think it wa&gt; the best investment that the state of Iowa ever made in placing Mr. Maney there and having him tell these people how to do things. They were anxious to do things right, but they didn't know how — now this is the result of it all. The first year of course he didn't make these demonstrations. It was only this last year that he did this, to show that something can be done in the way of improving the system. Now there is another point I wish to say a few words on, and that is in regard to fertilization. My son's vineyard is on a hill - side slope, and at first he would not fertilize. He was like Mr. Pollard with his apple trees, he thought that Iowa soil was rich enough with - out fertilization. But after having several heavy crops, he noticed that tie grapes were getting yellow in the summer, and they didn't have quite the color of the first ones, or the foliage. So he got the idea in his head of manuring. We plant our rows so that every fourth vwwe could driye through and manure and spray them, if you want la So far we haven't sprayed yet. But he drives through there on every fourth row and then he manures the grape vines. Well he hauls out thirty or forty or fifty loads of manure, and places them on the places where the weakness showed, where they weren't holding their own. and the result is that those grapes there are just as green and thrifty as they are in any other part of the vineyard, and he has had a wonderful increase in the amount of grapes grown in that see- on of the vineyard Discussion. Mr. Barnard: What is the average ordinary yield of a grape vine at three or four years, what do you expect of it when they are com - ing into maturity? A. I would say about a basket to the vine, an eight pound basket to the vine, but we have had lots of vines this year that produced four baskets to the vine, and counting seven hundred baskets to the acre you can see where you would get if you have an average of that kind and that can be reached very easily. Mr. Barnard: In growing grapes at home for a long while we have held our vineyard down to just an acre all the time, and years ago we started in with something like thirty or forty varieties; and we have kept eliminating until we got down to four varieties; and I </seg>
            <seg id="p143">128 NEBKASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY have 25 experimentals, but they are like every man's children; he thinks his child is the best and brighest one. We have gotten down to four varieties. Among them the Brighton, which is a red grape, and which is a most wonderful bearer during these dry years. It has made the best clusters of anything we have ever had. and it is a wt derful seller, and I believe that the future of the Brighton graf one of the bright futures in this country, or Nebraska. You can better price than with others Mr. Roesch : I would like to ask Mr. Hesi, what Mr. Maney system of pruning was? A. I have a copy of the figure there, which will show it bett than I can tell Q. Sort of on the fan system A. Well, it is not the fan system but you can apply it to the fan system as well as to the tree system. I wish to answer Mr. Barnare Of course he is all right as to the varieties of grapes for a hoirn vineyard, but my speech was the commercial vineyard, and I would say in a commercial vineyard if you tried anything else but the Cor cord, it would be more or less experimental. You might be su ful with the Moore's Karlv but we never had much success w They would not produce the amount or the number of pour vine. Now you take the Concord, and you can always depend up&lt; good crop. I know at the time they had this expositior Omaha.

I have no speech to make, and what 1 have to say will be merely extemporaneous, and if there is any questions anybody wants to ask, I would just like to answer them. I would rather have this a round table talk than any - thing else. You all know that it is impossible to make a home without some - thins nice to eat in it, and the small fruits certainly go a long ways to make home comfortable. Now 1 wouldn't think of talking about the small fruits in the small garden, from the standpoint of making money, but you know money is not all it takes to make a home. In as much as the strawberry is the first tiling that comes along in the spring, we will have to begin with the strawberry first. Just as these other gentlemen have spoken of the apple and grape, that we plant too many varieties, the same thing is true of the strawberry, and 1 believe that a few minutes spent on what not to plant, would be as good as what to plant. Because more failures are made from the fact that people do not know what to plant, than they are from any other one cause. So that the varieties are more important than the care of the plant. Of course in the standards, we could not think of a straw - berry, without thinking of the Senator Dunlap, and 1 do not think there is a berry today the equal of the good old Senator Ounlap. Bederwood is a good one too. I rather suspicion that the Warfield is one of the parents of the Dunlap, from the fact there is so much resemblance among the two berries. The Dunlap is more red than the Warfield, but they are both red. But the Dunlap is easier cleaned. than any other berry, except possibly the old Parker's Ruddy. It is hard to pick a Parker's Ruddy, without leaving the calyx on the stem, unless you are an expert picker. There are so many fellows traveling </seg>

The facts are that if we picked our berries in that condition, and shipped them into Missouri to sell them, they would not be a bit better than the Missouri berries we get here. That is the advantage of having a home market, where we can get the fresh stuff. You will never enjoy any berry until your wife goes out and picks them, and then you have a good dish of straw- berries and criam TlMM three varieties are all that 1 am going into Of course there kinds beaMef those three. I have some Gandys, and Klon- are dike, but neither one of those are equal to the first three. They all have the same fault. The Klondike lacks in color. While it is a red berry it has a kind of a dead color, and it doesn't appeal to the eye like the beautiful luster that is in the Warneld or the Dunlap. Com- mercially I think that the Warneld or the Dunlap are as good as you could possibly get. And here we are again to this proposition. From Kansas City south to the Ozark. there is not a berry in the whole list that will equal the Arona, but in Ncknuka, we have not been able to make a success of it. 1 mean in a commercial way of course. It fruits fairly well, but some years it does not. I have too many failures, but nevertheless they are an elegant berry. The same thing is true of the Sample. It is an elegant berry sometimes, but not always. As &gt;p of berries as I ever saw was the Parker Earl but they didn't do it every year, and 1 believe because of these things that we will have to come to this in our berries, and that is, to spray them, because there is a good deal of rust working on them. The old Clyde was a fjnod berry, but its foliage was not good and like other Clyde* it has to be taken care of to succeed. But its foliage is so poor that it is no gomd to us. and the disease that effects the strawberry effects i rioiislv for that reason, and because of that it has to be sprayed. Mr Barnard: What do you use in your spray? tly t A Well seriously. I haven't followed any real system; if I see plaits are beMf effected by something, then I spray them, but I have somitimes left them until they are effected too bad; I did that last year with my strawberries and Loganberries. They were effected with the rust, and I thought I was going to have a half a million Wl plants anyhow, and about the fourth of July I never saw a prettier plant in my life. Then it turned dry and the rust got to them seriously take root. I think the Bordeaux mixture was the best and they ut 1 would use the lime sulphur to spray with.

My tirst experience too, was in Southwestern Iowa, lt was at my home in Mills county, and I helped my father dig anil pick up oetween rive and six hundred bushels of potatoes from. what we called hazel brush soil. In all my experience I have never seen any toil equal that particular kind of soil. We raised several ps iif Karly kcise in those years, that ran around three hundred ihels. That is what I think Early Rose was expected to do in. ays. 1 think we picked between five and six hundred bushels i' day. per acre, and I have never seen its equal. N'ow the we can approach those conditions which I think are ideal OSes, the better. I think your suggestion of planting alfalfa in con - nect mn with preparing the soil was an excellent one. I have turned under rye in the early spring and planted potatoes to good success. I think the nearest approach to the old ideal hazel brush soil was where you turned under a crop of strawberry plants, and the potatoes were planted just after the berries were gone. I did that for a man who was a crank in potato growing. He just rented the ground and turned over my strawberry bed after the second or third crop had been harvested. He turned them under, and they yielded perhaps upwards of three hundred bushels to the acre. They were planted aluiut the 25th of June or the latter part of June. That was ordinary soil. Those will be the ideal conditions in my judgment for growing potatoes today, with an abundance of humus. Where I have the most humus I get the best potatoes. I believe that one point, quantity of humus is more essential than all other points combined. Of course </seg>

To the grower the most serious feature is the reduction i yield— a fact which fully explains the greatly reduced yields of 1911 and 1912 in Colorado. Thus far we have unfortunately no tuber character by mean which the presence of leaf roll may be detected Leaf roll cannot be communicated from a diseased plant to a healthy plant — certainly not by ordinary means and probably not even by grafting. </seg>

In order to care for an orchard economically it is advisable to make use of the land between the trees. The family garden can be grown in the orchard and furnish a liberal supply of all kinds of vegetables for summer and winter use. In those portions of the state where rainfall is sufficient or irriga - tion is practiced and small fruits thrive; enough strawberries, rasp - berries, gooseberries and currants can be grown between the trees to supply the family needs and in favorable seasons have a surplus for market. Corn (either sweet corn or any field variety) is one of the best crops to grow in the young orchard. We must cultivate the vegetables, small fruits or corn and in so doing we are cultivating the trees. An example of intercropping is cited that has come to our notice and shows what can be done along this line. One orchard in Cass county has been cropped to corn as above advocated. The rows of trees are 33 feet apart and at the seventh year the owner was still raising five rows of corn in each of the strips between the rows of trees. This little orchard of ISO trees which occupied about 4 acres of land produced in 1911 the seventh year from planting 200 bushels of Jonathan and Gano apples and 80 bushels of corn </seg>
            <seg id="p193">174 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY I CAUTION: We must not forget that we are growing an orchard the crops grown between the trees are to utilize the land until trees are large enough to take the entire area. Be careful in ting the crop in the young orchard to allow ample space along rows of trees so that they may be carefully cultivated and yet not be injured by having limbs or bark on the trunk broken by cultivator or horses.

The owner who didn't think his orchard needed any spraying or was indifferent as to time of application has a very poor prospect for harvesting many first-class apples. Apple scab has appeared on foliage and fruit in greater quantity than for several years. The strawberry crop from a commercial standpoint was a slight disap - pointment to the growers owing- to loss from too much rainfall dur - ing picking season. However, the crop was nearly normal as regards returns received. Raspberries promise a fair to good crop. Black - berries excellent. Grapes were unevenly pollenized and the bunches are irregularly filled. Although vines have a good set of fruit the prospects for commercial crop will be cut down by the irregularly filled bunches.

The average farmer has too much work to do for him to stop and bother with his little orchard (or thinks he has) and so it is neglected. The time is at hand when two classes of orchards will be found in the statf, the strictly commercial orchard and the home wiut will give it the proper care and attention rcha Reports received in this of lice for August show many things of interest. The cnmnurtial orchards show a high average yield per .vhile the home or farm orchard shows a low yield per tree. This is not only trm- this year but other years as well. This can r partly by care and partly by the large number of accour non-producing trees' found in so many orchards. Usually these trees were able to pull through the seru^ oi bad years and the heavy producing trees being loaded with fruit succumbed. The season of 1915 has liven an excellent one for tree growth.

In the colder parts of tile Northwest the severe winters kill the plants, and in the arid sections of the west hot, dry winds, destroy the ripening fruit. The choice of proper varieties, however will do much to overcome natural difficulties. electing a site for a blackberry plantation, the most import- ant considerations are the moisture of the soil and the accessibility of a market.

The best land is a deep, fine, sandy loam with a large y of humus and abundant moisture at the ripening seucn. On the other hand, the plants are often killed if water stands the plantation during the winter. The year before the establishment of the blackberry plantation the land should be planted with a cultivated crop. This insures the thorough rotting of the sod and will help to destroy the cutworms and other insects injurious to the young plants. The soil should be plowed to a depth of about nine inches in the spring and a thorough harrowing should be given the whole field before the plants are This is usually done as early in the spring as the land can be properly prepared. The earlier the plants are set the larger the proportion that live an&lt;l the better their growth. The tops be cut back &gt;ix inches or less in length.

STRAWBERRIES FOR THE HOME GARDEN. C. (i. Blodgett, Mt. Pleasant, la. ting this subject I will not attempt information to the fruit grower hut will give to the one beginning the busi - &gt;oints in growing the strawberry. Just such information I would like to have known a half century ago when my father k up some wild prairie in Northern, 111. and began the pioneer's irk of making a home. some years all the fruit we had was wild plums, wild and crali apples and we children considered it a great treat allowed to (a to the woods that bordered the streams in that , t" gather that fruit. I was quite a youth when one morning king one. my first lesson in horticulture by helping my lant (mt some strawberry plants and this tells which side iw I got my love for fruit and flowers) when a neighbor along and told us of the terrible tragedy that had been enact- Ford's theatre in Washington the night before.

Do not feel that the growing of strawberries is low down work; literally it is but get above your task at least head and shoulders, then with a silver spoon, sugar and cream added the act of raising strawberries is I assure you a very pleasant occupation. Location and Soil — Perhaps on a town lot or even in the country garden there cannot be very much chance for things to be ideal but we can avoid some places that would tend to failure. Do not plant </seg>

Neither plant on low flat ground, there is danger of frost settling on the bloom nor on high exposed knolls where winds sweep off the mulch in winter. Choose the best you have and plant in rows north and south long enough so that you can use a horse cul - tivator occasionally or oftener as the season may require. The soil, like the location, need the best. However there is very little soil if any in Iowa but which if properly prepared will grow good straw - berries. If rich enough to successfully grow cabbage, sweet corn and potatoes, strawberries should do equally well. If potatoes have been grown the year previous to setting the strawberry plants it gives you a chance to destroy most of the white grub when digging the potatoes and in my experience this worm is the greatest pest to the strawberry grower. I am never too busy to stop to kill him. Plowing or spading the ground pretty deep late in the fall not only leaves the soil in good condition for spring preparation hut aids greatly in ridding it of insect pests. tNow, possibly about as difficult a question to answer is what eties to plant. There have been luindrt-ds. probably thousands Dduced since the one great market berry that did more to make wberry growing a commercial success — namely.

But coming on mom I have we today? 1 suppose in my vicinity there are more Dunla than any others. I planted my first in 1901. Since then have civ up all else excepting a few seedlings of my own until gone back to alternate rows of Warfield and Dunlap.

This, if fall plowed, can be done by cultivating thoroughly, finishing with a drag and harrow and if in doubt the soil being tine enough to go over it again. Thorough work now is no labor lost. The distance apart varies somewhat. Home grown plants taken up with some earth on roots may be set somewhat farther apart in the row than shipped plants. The variety also will make a difference.

The ground should be in such condition that a spade or dibble is not necessary. Taking the plant in the left hand I prepare the place with right, being careful to keep the crown of plant just even with surface of soil, pressing the earth firmly about the plants. And possible just here is where the low down work conies in ; for I find that to avoid considerable backache I must get on my knees. Some patches sewed on the knees of pants help by saving the cloth and keeping out dampness of the soil. By the way patches on this part of the pants are not considered a dis- grace in our calling in our part of the state. Now cultivate. With rake, hoe, wheel cultivator, or horse and twelve tooth cultivator. I find that often the garden rake, if ground is in good cultivation is just as good and much faster than the hoe but when the hoe is needed use it right and not merely shave the top of the ground. Learn to stand erect and you will soon find it unnec - essary to stand in a half circle in order to do good work. When the blossom stems appear cut them off so the strength of plant may go into runners, these train along row until you have plants enough to about half cover the ground. Plants should be spaced from three to ti\ i- or &gt;ix inches. After this cut the runners (not pull) and you A-ill find yon are making quarts of berries every time. Indeed I have found it more work to keep down the runners in a wet season than cultivate. Also that many times a plantation has been much ured by ftOowMg the plants to become too thick. As the growing near- the end stop the cultivation that the ground may settle then apply the mulch which should be old prairie heat straw, being sure that the grain is all out and no using enough to just cover the vines from sight.

Remember always that whether in town or itry, very seldom if ever, will good berries be allowed to waste.

The ground, one twenty-fifth of an acre was planted to Dunlap and Warfield with a few Crescent. Amount gath - ered 525 boxes. One hundred and one boxes sold for $41.15, At this rate an acre will produce 13,125 boxes selling for $1,312.50. The yield is excellent, the price not unusual but I would not advise a beginner to plant out ten acres with the expectation of prorating these fig - ures. However what has been done can be : so try two or three hundred plants. Let the garden take the place of the diamond. Aid the plants with or without the gloves in their struggle for mastery over the weeds; deal them a few knockout blows. Then the movies will have no attraction for you. In their place first the green leaves pushing up through the mulch, then the white and yellow bloom mingled with the dark green of the foliage and later the ripened fruit in all its perfection.

IMPROVING THE LAWN Repair, Improvement and General Management The improvement of an old lawn is a very much m&lt; problem than establishing a new MM. In many cases it i* imprac - ticable to attempt the improvement of an old lawn that is in bad condition, say the specialists of the U. S. Department of Agriculture However, if a reasonably good turf obtains, it is in possible to better it materially by reseeding, fertilizing and watering. In the majority of cases improvement is desired in the spring, since at this season many bare spots are in evidence as the result of the preceding win - ter. If the areas to be improved are small, they can be handworked and seeded with little difficulty. If they are large, it is usually advisable to spade them up, work thoroughly, and seed, as in the case of starting a new lawn. In any event, reseeding should be done early in the spring with a liberal quantity of the mixture before described. When the stand of grass is thin over the entire lawn or a greater portion of it, a special seeder equipped with small discs has been found very satisfactory for cutting the seed into the sod and thereby producing favorable conditions for germination and subsequent </seg>
            <seg id="p226">205 growth. In the early spring, however, the soil is usually loose as a result of the freezing and thawing, and is in sufficiently open con - dition to permit the seed to be covered with little difficulty. After Kng, if the ground has become quite dry, rolling is usually bene- Care should be taken when mowing or watering the newly seeded areas to avoid disturbing the young grass. This caution always applies in a measure to fall seeding, although there is not much danger of damage in the case of the latter. Fertilizing. The management of the lawn, after it is once established, is an extremely important matter, and there are a few general practices that should be followed carefuly. Beginning in the early spring, the first thing to do is to remove with a rake the top dressing that has been applied the fall before. After removing this it is usually advis - able to apply some fertilizer, even though the soil is already rea - sonably fertile. One of the very best fertilizers for the lawn in the spring is nitrate of soda, but on account of its quick action and its caustic effect extreme caution should be used in its application. Five pounds of nitrate of soda are sufficient for 1,000 square feet of lawn, and if applied in solution with the watering pot and the grass then thoroughly watered with a hose, there is little danger of scalding. Bone meal is probably the best commercial fertilizer to use on a lawn, considering the danger from the missuse of nitrate of soda. Bone meal can be used without taking any special caution in its application, as it is in no way injurious to the grass. Eight pounds to 1,000 square feet is a liberal application. Any commercial fertil - izer that is used should be applied early in the spring when the grass begins to grow. In fact, bone meal can be used to advantage every month during the growing season, except perhaps July and August. Fertilizing through the season is especially beneficial in keeping the grass stimulated at times when it would otherwise be more or less inactive. Pulverized limestone as a top dressing is very helpful, and an application of this substance can be made either in the fall, winter or spring. Lime corrects the acidity of the surface soil and is useful in checking the growth of moss and various other plants that are detrimental to the grass. Moving, Rolling and Sprinkling. There is no hard and fast rule to be followed in connection with mowing the lawn, but clipping twice a week is not apt to injure it, and will induce the formation of a good turf. Too frequent clip - ping, however, is a drain on the vitality of the grass, and frequencly results in permanent injury. There is some difference of opinion as to whether clippings should he removed after mowing, but in general their removal is advised (specially during wet weather, since if left to lie on the surface they </seg>
            <seg id="p227">206 are conducive to the growth of molds, which in turn produce injury to the turf. On new seedings, however or where the sra**' is thin, dippings can frequently be allowed to remain with benefit. New seedings should not be clipped closely, and during the hot weather of midsummer and early fall the mower should be set high for old and new grass alike. The roller should be used dis - cretely. New grass is frequently benefitted by a light rolling after the first cutting. Old sod should be rolled in the spring to firm the surface that has been loosened by freezing and thawing, but during midseason it is very doubtful if the lawn should be rolled even lightly, especially where the soil is of a heavy nature. There are probably more mistakes made in connection with the watering of the lawn than in any other phase of its management. The practice of sprinkling as it is almost universally followed is fundamentally wrong, rot that the sprinkler does not furnish enough water to the grass during the season, but that it does not furnish it in properly distributed quantities. Sprinkling for a short period may appear to wet the sod thoroughly, but in reality the water does not penetrate much below the surface. This encourages the forma- tion of surface roots and makes the conditions of weather and usage. grass less resistant to the sever Except in rare cases, the lawn than two or three times a week, pr A thorough soaking is necessary ; afternoon or early morning.

The point to be borne in m ground should be thoroughly saturated at each application to at least three inches in depth Eradication of Weeds, While weed enemies of the lawn are troubleson growing season, they are RMMt particularly so from the latter part of June until frost. During this period crab-grass is by tar the worst weed present. There is no really satisfactory method of checking its growth, and the only treatment to be recommended is to cut or c pull the plants before they have formed large mats. This is a very tedious and expensive practice, but where a good lawn is iarohred the results justify the expense. Rational fertilizing and careful watering during the summer help to overcome the effects of weeds. Chemical sprays or treatments have proven to be of very little assistance. Much difficulty is experienced in cutting crab-grass with the ordinary mower on account of its semiprostrate character. This difficulty can be overcome to a certain extent if a rake is used in connection with the mower. By means of the rake the branches of the grass may be lifted so that they can be clipped reasonably close. </seg>
            <seg id="p228">207 It is almost impossible, however, to cut crab-grass sufficiently clos to prevent the formation of seed. There art- many other weeds that are troublesome in the lawn, not only in the spring but also in the summer and autumn. Among the most important ones are dandelion, plantain, chickweed, oxeye daisy and yarrow. While chemical sprays are more effective in the eradication of these weeds than in the case of crab-grass, the best method of preventing their development is to remove them with a spud or similar implement. Top Dressing. The weed problem can perhaps best be solved by making th; conditions as favorable as possible for the lawn grasses and to main - tain a strict watch at all times to check the growth of the trouble - some weeds at the beginning. At the end of the growing season, before the severe weather of winter arrives, the lawn should be given a good top-dressing of well-rotted barnyard manure. If ;he manure is not well rotted, it is likely to introduce an abundance of weed seets. which will ultimately cause considerable trouble. Top - dressing not only adds fertility to the soil, but gives the grass pro - tection during the severe weather of winter and the freezing and thawing of early spring. Office of Information, U. S.

If you would have rich beds of tulips or give the beds or th-s corners of your lawns a beautiful spring-like yellow or white glow of narcissus, daffodil and jonquil, you must begin to think of the early spring appearance of your garden in the fall, for the bulbs of these two flowers must be planted in the fall before the ground is frozen. In fact, this work should be undertaken as soon as or before early frost has begun to make the annual flowers in the beds look weakened. In dealing with narcissus, which is the family which the daffodil and jonquil belong, it might be well to think of trying to naturalize the narcissus to grow and blossom on the lawn much as dc the wild Dowers. How to plant and handle the bulbs as well as the best method of getting them to become spring residents of grassy corners, are described in the following directions issued by the bulb specialists of the United States Department of Agriculture: These bullis should lie planted in light, rich soil that has been dug to a depth of at least 10 inches. The tulip bulbs should be set 5 inches apart and 4 inches deep and the narcissus bulbs about 10 inches apart and 5 inches deep. If they are to be grown in pots or window boxes, light, rich soil should be used. Place 1 to 2 inches of cinders or broken pots in the bottoms of the pots or boxes to insure good drainage.

They may then be brought into the light and heat for flow - ering. Keep the soil well moistened from time of planting but avoid overmoistening, for if kept too wet the bulbs will decay. Cultivation. I If planted in beds, the surface of the soil should be loosened r each rain, and the bed kept free from weeds. In the late fall early winter months it is well to cover the beds with a light ch of straw or leaves to prevent injury to the young roots from alternate freezing and thawing of the soil. This mulch should gradually removed in spring, as soon as growth appears above and. The bulbs are quite hardy and not injured by severe cold if soil is well drained. Lifting and Dividing. Tulip and narcissus plants are perennial, and if given proper care and grown under suitable soil and climate conditions will increase and multiply from year to year. The bulbs may remain in the ground two or three years, or until the clumps begin to crowd. After blos- (ing in the spring, from six to foliage to die partially down, ade or fork.

Department of Agriculture is calling attention to the iduction and establishment in America of the European pine it moth, which threatens to cause serious loss. This insect is a t orange-red moth, the larva of which hollows out new buds and or injures the ends of twigs of pine trees. This injury causes formity which is serious in ornamental trees, and in trees grown lumber makes a crooked growth and a consequent waste when the tree is cut. In Europe the insect not only attacks all native pines but is equally injurious to American species cultivated there. The Depart - ment states that the young larva came into this country within the buds on imported pine seedlings which have come from France, Eng - land, Holland, Belgium or Germany. The department's investi - gators have discovered it in only ten localities, in six states from Massachusetts to Pennsylvania, but it is likely that it may be found in other localities. It has not been found in any native trees in the forest, and with only one exception has always been on European pines in nurseries and private parks. There is no evidence to indi - cate that it has been in this country more than a year except on Long Island, where it has existed for more than two years. There are several native pine shoot moths, but none of them inflict the serious injury of the European species. The department hopes that the new pest may be stamped out before it becomes too widespread to be controlled. At present the problem of its elimination is confined mainly to nurseries, but if it once gets into the native pine forests the experts think that it would be beyond control. In its larval stage the moth is so effectively pro - tected in the bud and shoots that it can not be reached by any insec - ticide, and the only method of getting rid of it is to prune out and destroy the shoots 'which contain the insect. This should preferably be done during the fall and winter. Though it is easier to locate the injured tips and shoots after growth has started in the spring, it is safer and better for the tree to have it done in the fall. Measures for control, to be effective, can not be accomplished without the co-opcratjve action of all who grow or plant European pines or deal in them. THE INDOOR WINDOW BOX. A large proportion of the plants in a window box should be of the same general character if the growth is to be successful. Plants of different character need different treatment. It is very difficult to raise flowering plants in a window box with the exception of bego - nias. Ordinary flowering plants are very exacting, and will not finJ enough light in the ordinary living room, even though placed near the window, although they may do well in a conservatory. The main </seg>
            <seg id="p231">210 object of an indoor window box is to furnish the fresh appearance of growing green leaves rather than to raise flowers indoor-.. The ordinary individual who desires other varieties of growing flowers may supplement his window box with flowering potted plants brought in from outside, including bulbs raised as described in a previous article of this series. These will probably keep their bloom for a brief period only. People who are fond of plants will, of course, obtain better results with blooming varieties, after many trials. Some have dealt with very difficult problems, which they have solved successfully, but the present suggestions are meant for the novice as well as the more experienced grower. t["he indoor window Imx. properly planned and tended, will afford 1 pleasure and satisfaction to tin- housewife who misses her out- Dor garden during the winter months.

I The top of the soil should be allowed to become quite dry once a while. The results of watering will teach the owner to regulate supply. Boxes may need watering in sunshiny weather (espe - lly toward spring) every day, or at least every other day; in udy weather not more than once a week. As a rule it is better water lightly and frequently than heavily and infrequently. The cialist of the department advises this, although just the reverse is isidered best when watering is done out of door* in the summer. </seg>

The department's specialist makes the following suggestions for a window box : Begonias are one of the most attractive plants that may be used for an indoor box. Both flowering and nonflowering varieties will give satisfaction; in fact the flowering variety is one of the few plants that will blossom indoors without special cultivation. The begonia is not very particular in its requirements and will flourish with ordinary care. Small ferns obtained from a florist will flourish. These are par - ticularly adapted to house culture, as they do not require direct sun - light. Even more hardy than ferns i.s the foliage plant known as the aspidistra. This adaptable plant-growth will stand a measure of neglect, drought, and dust and still thrive. It does not require direct sunlight. Geraniums may also be used as foliage plants, though they must not be expected to blossom in the window box. Kenilworth ivy may be planted along the edge. It will grow nicely from seed. Smilax may be grown from the back of the box and trained up about the window to give the effect of an attractive bower. The inexperienced grower of plants indoors can not expect to do well with roses. These plants are most exacting and not only will they probably fail to flower, but also their foliage may be affected by mildew, blight, etc. — U. S. Department Agriculture. ANNUAL PLANTS FOR NEWLY GRADED GROUNDS. A few well-chosen annual plants placed on newly graded grounds *ill do much to take the place of trees and shrubs until the later iay have time to grow, according to the U. S. Department of Agri - ulture's specialist. It is often a question in a new community where slow-growing vegetation has not had an opportunity, as to what mav be done to make grounds seem less bare. "A lawn can be w made in a few weeks and its appearance may be greatly increased by the addition of a few well chosen annuals. The specialist suggests as particularly suited for this purpose following plants, which may be grown in most parts of the United Sta Tall foliage plants— Castor bean, Caladium canna. Tall flowering plants — Cosmos, scarlet sage, sunflowers. Border plants— Alternanthera, alyssum, ageratum, coleus.

For this reason special attention should be given to the grading, cultivation, and enriching of the area to be devoted to the lawn. After good preparation come good seed and I The variety of soils which will be encountered and the special tments which they need render it possible to make only the idest generalizations here. For localities north of St. Louis, Mo., Richmond, Va., lawns can be formed chiefly of blue-grass, red and white clover. South of this point Bermuda grass and St. ;ustine grass will have to be relied upon chiefly, although it is that in some places alfalfa has been employed with good results. FLOWERS THAT WILL "MAKE OOOD" IN YOUR GARDEN. tMany people at tin- mm of the year are considering what ering plants they shall put in their gardens. The average house - , who has not much time to spare M the matter, the child who ist becoming interested in growing plants, and the teacher who lying out a school garden for the benefit of her pupils will un - &gt;tedly welcome some simple suggestions along this line. The ed States Department of Agriculture's specialist particularly mmends as satisfactory and easily-grown flowers, the ageratum, nasturium, the petunia, the California poppy, ami the zinnia. n Here are a few pointers on each of them Ageratum. — The ageratum is one of the few blue flowers we have. In its form it resembles the heliotrope but has no odor. Ager - atums grow well upon almost all soils and through a wide range of climate. For that reason many combinations with them are possible. The plants are neat, bushy, and erect, and produce a profusion of brush like flowers throughout the season. The dwarf blue &gt;orts make fine borders and are much used where contrasting color effects are desired. For early bloom the seed should be sown in cold frames or in boxes in the house early in the season (MarcM, but for sum - mer and fall bloom the seeds may be sown in April or early in May in well prepared beds in the open. Seeds sown in August will pro - duce good plants for winter flowering. Nasturtium.— The large seeds of the nasturtium require to be planted much deeper than the fine seeds of the petunia. Sow them in rows where the plants are to grow, placing the seeds about 6 inches apart in the row and cover them about an inch deep. When all plants are up, thin so that they stand a foot apart if the soil is </seg>
            <seg id="p234">rich; it rather thin, it will be as well to allow them to Stand at the planting distance. The plants should be given clean cultivation to induce rapid growth. If planted in the open at the same time that beans are planted, very satisfactory results will follow. For earlier iil.M.tn plant in advance of this date in hotbeds, cold frames or window s. Petunia. — While the petunia grows readily and rapidly from seeds sown in the open about corn planting time, earlier bloom can be Eed by sowing the seed in window boxes or hotbeds and trans - inn the plants once before placing them in the open. For local - north of New York the most satisfactory method of handling plants will be to start the seeds in window boxes about April 1, and to transfer the young plants to the open when the weather permits — about the middle of May. The seeds are very small and should not be covered with earth in the ordinary way. They should In- sown on the surface and brought in contact with the earth by firming it with a board. California poppy (Eschscholtzia).— The eschscholtzia is an annual of striking character both as regards the form and color of its flowers, which are bright and rich in their tints of yellow and orange. The plants average aobut a foot in height, have attractive silvery foliage, and produce their large poppy-like flowers quite lavishly from early spring until frost. The seeds of eschscholtzia may be wn in window boxes or in a hotbed in March, or in the open where plants are to bloom as soon as the soil is in fit condition, in April May in the latitude of Xew York. In latitudes south of New York ds may be sown in the autumn for early bloom. The plants enjoy a rich loam and should be allowed about 5 or 6 inches of space in the row. When n&gt;nl m beds they may be sown broadcast. Zinnia. — The zinnia is easily grown from seed sown in the open ground. When sown in April the plants will bloom abundantly and continuously through the entire season. During the month of August zinnias are at their best. To secure larger flowers and a profusion of bloom the plants must be given ample room for full development, as well as an abundant supply of food. Strong, rich soils suit the - zinnia. If the seeds are sown in a dwelling house or in a hotbed in March and the young plants are picked out once or twice before bejng placed in their permanent situations more satisfactory results will be secured than from outdoor-sown seeds unless equal care ia thinning or transplanting is given. In addition to their use in the school garden, zinnias can be used for groups, beds, borders, garden lines, and summer hedges. Their average height is V/i feet. The zinnia is a rather large, formal flower whose colors range through the shades of red and yellow. Their season of bloom is through the late summer and autumn and the individual bloom lasts for a long time both on the plant and as cut flowers. </seg>

Excepting our scientists, there are comparatively few people in § country who ever stop to think of how many important products now minister to the health, sustenance, and pleasures of man - were added to the world's supply by the discovery of America, w of these are incidentally mentioned in an interesting article on "The Tomato," in the current number of The Bulletin of the Pan- American Union, by Edward Albes, who writes : "The greatest febrifuge known today — quinine — came to exist- ence because the Incas of Peru had discovered the medicinal prop - erties of the bark of the Cinchona tree; the leaves of the cocoa plant, a South American product, have served to alleviate pain the world It by their essence — cocaine; Indian corn, or maize, was unknown the Old World before it was found to be the great food staple the American ; Irish as well as sweet potatoes had their first home the New World; the delicious concoction known as chocolate, serving man as both food and drink, had been known for centuries by the Incas of Peru and the Aztecs of Mexico before the Spaniard found it in these countries and introduced it in to Europ whose rings of aromatic smoke now circumscribe the earth. \v added to man's pleasures l&gt;y the Indian of America.

It is certain, at any rate, that it was known and cultivated for its fruit centuries before the Columbian discovery That the cultivated tomato was known to some botanists over 360 years ago is evidenced by the fact that two large varieties were described by Matthiolus as early at 1554 but for many years it was only in southern Europe that the value of the fruit for use in soups and as a salad was recognized.

            <seg id="p236">215 of course, no foundation in fact. It was not until the early part of the 19th century that the tomato came into general use as a food in northern Europe and even in the United States. Since about 1835, however, the use and cultivation of the vegetable has grown to such an extent that it has now become one of the most important of our garden cropv When a successful process of canning the fruit was evolved the tomato industry at once assumed large proportions. It was found that for all coukmy purposes the canned fruit was as good as that fresh from the vine, and as a result the tomato has become a staple food the year round, and millions of dollars are now invested in can - ning factories in the United States, whose chief output consists of tomatoes. From statistics compiled by the National Canners' Asso - ciation for the year 1914 it is learned that among the tomato-produc - ing states Maryland ranked first with a production of 5,850,000 cases of canned tomatoes; Delaware second, with 1,335,030 cases; Indiana third with 1,295,000 cases. The total production for the whole coun - try amounted to 15.222,000 cases of tomatoes, and about 5,000,000 cases of tomato pulp (used in making catsup, sauces, soups, etc.) The total was therefore over 20,000,000 cases of 24 two-pound cans, each, or an output of 480.000,000 cans, weighing 480,000 tons, and having an approximate value of $28,000,000. If these cans were placed one on t&gt;p of the other, the resulting column would be very nearly 27,000 mile- high, or if placed end to end in a row would encircle the earth one and a half times at the equator. These figures deal only with the canned product of factories keeping accurate statistics. When we remember that perhaps twice as many more are eaten raw and canned by the thrifty housewives and Girls' Canning Clubs, we may ime idea of the importance in our national economy of the garden tomato. — Memorandum for press issued by Pan-American Union, Washington, D. C. POTATOES FOR STOCK FEED The heavy production and the low price of potatoes has directed attention to their value for stock feed. Hitherto this subject has not received much attention in this country because under ordinary con - ditions other feeds are undoubtedly much cheaper and better. Some estimate that even at IS cents a bushel it is more expensive to feed potatoes to stock than it is to feed silage, while on the other hand it is scarcely probably that the farmer can raise potatoes for much less than 30 cents a bushel. Their actual value for feed depends upon many factors, but it is better to make some use of the potatoes on hand rather than let them rot. In Germany, where the potato crop is proportionately far greater than in this country, the question has been more thoroughly studied. The tubers may be used for feeding cows, horses, sheep and pigs, but they are best adapted for pigs. To secure the best results with </seg>

I purchased the Idaho Rural potatoes. They were not espe - cially selected seed, therefore I was very careful in preparing the seed for planting. I was anxious that every seed piece had one or two perfect eyes on it. I then treated the seed with a formaldehyde solution, (one pint to ,iO gallons water). This treatment consisted in soaking the seed (before cutting) for two hours in the prescribed solution. The purpose of the treatment was to kill any scab germs appearing on the surface of the potatoes. Other than this there was no treatment' given. "From March 20 to March 30 I prepared my land. I covered the ground with barn-yard manure using 8 tons of wet manure to the half acre. I plowed the land 12 inches deep using four horses for </seg>

I did the plowing in the forenoon and followed with the harrow in the afternoon. I did this to conserve the moisture and mellow the soil. After harrowing I pulverized the clods by dragging up the soil with a square framed timber. I tried in every way to be particular about every phase of cultivation as 1 figured that the secret of my success was good cul- tivation "Five days later on April 5 I again went over the land with a spring tooth harrow. The following week I again went over it with a spiked tooth harrow which kept the soil moist and mellow. Just before planting I went over it again with the square timber in order to make it perfectly level. On April 18 I planted the seed in plowed furrows 4 inches deep and the rows 30 inches apart, the seed being ilropped about 12 inches apart in the rows. The seed was then cov - ered about 4 inches deep with a small hand plow. As soon as the little plants appeared above the ground I began my work on the field. I at once freed the field of weeds by giving it a thorough harrowing with a spiked tooth harrow. This I did May 5 and repeated the same treatment on May 12. On May 26 I used the hand cultivator drawn e horse giving them a thorough cultivation with this implement which I cultivated them once with the hand hoe, cleaning out all of the weeds. During all the time I was working in my potatoes I watched growth very carefully, as I was warned about the appearance of lam diseases and insect enemies which might appear to injure the lants. Fortunately as far as I was able to detect neither plant dis- ease n.&gt;r insect enemies appeared as the growing plants had such a strong thrifty appearance. Up to June 15 the plants had grown rapidly and gave a strong •ous appearance. Soon after this date they began to blossom and June 25 1 gave them the first application of irrigation water. I nated them on July 5 and again on July 20. The crop was matured h but these three applications of water. After the second irriga- the vines were so large that I could not work in them without Lirbing them. The operations practically ceased from this time on until the tubers were ripe and ready for digging. I sent a selected 50 lbs. to the State Fair which was held at Salt Lake City, October 3 to 10 for which I received honorable mention by the judges. On Octo - ber 13, 14 and IS I harvested the crop and the potatoes were weighed and sold right from the field.

K Potato pwmf in Nebraska me of the leading industries is rapidly growrag into prominence Home wardens, truck gardens and commercial growers have all contributed their share in producing the crop of. 1914, which is estimated by the state board of agricul- ture at 7,070,701 bushels, valued at H2Sl.472.06l The crop for 1914 was not produced in any one particular section or county but a portion w.i- produced in every county. The western part of the state is the only section of the state where potato growing has reached the stage "i i large commercial industry. Here large acreages are planted each year to potatoes. Some are produced under irrigation and otlu dry farming methods. The industry i-, .me of great importaii Nebraska. Numerous problems confront the growers, the I solution of which mean the building of a still greater industry. The questions are of importance not only to the gruWUI of this sectic but also every person in the state who is trying to gnm for either home use or market. Nebraska should produce enough potatoes to supply all her own needs and have a surplus for other states who desire the best grown. Production must be increased. Instead of producing an average of 50 bushels per acre the fields should produce double and more. Larger production at less cost per riel should be the aim of the growers. Problems of distribution I be worked out so that the grower will get a maximum profit producing the crop and the consumer be able to buy the crop at a minimum price. These are problems that are affecting all phases of agriculture. They must be solved for the betterment of the pro- ducers and consumers alike. The Nebraska State Horticultural Society realizing the import- Iof the potato industry to the economic welfare of the state both i the producers and consumers viewpoint have arranged a meet - of potato specialists to discuss the various phases of the industry ng the annual meetings of the society.

In Kurope the potato is a crop of great economic importance. The production per acre is several times what the best average in this country amounts to. The crop is used for food for l&gt;uth man and beast. Numerous by-products are made from the potato so that a steady market demand can be maintained for the rop. The potato growing industry in Nebraska can be of great mportance economically. The proper solution of the problems fac- nijr our grower! and the adoption of methods which will eliminate the waste in production, and distribution means the adding of sev- 1 1 millions of dollars to the wealth of the state.

TO WHAT FAMILY DO YOUR POTATOES BELONG? Greater Familiarity With This Vegetable Will Enable Growers to Detect the Present Practice of Some Seedmen Who .Manu- facture New Varieties from Old Ones. To what family do your potatoes belong?" The farmers who -ire^ to know may obtain some enlightenment from a new bulletin the U. S. Department of Agriculture, entitled "Group Classifica - m and Varietal Descriptions of Some American Potatoes." This a professional paper and deals in detail with each potato family nsidered. &amp; more intimate knowledge of the potato is much to be desired, only by scientists, but by the farmers who grow them. If the latter can recognize old varieties under new names, he will not be deceived by the present practice of some seedsmen who manufacture new varieties from old ones. The bulletin does not claim to present a completed classification of all American potatoes, but endeavors to offer a list that may prove a .starting point upon which to enlarge later on.

CONTROLLING THE SQUASH-VINE BORER. rOften Cause the Death of Squashes, Pumpkins, Muskmelons, Cucumbers and Uourds — How Their Work is Detected and Curtailed. The squash-vine borer lives largely upon the squash and pumpl liut is also -found on the muskmelon. cucumber and gourd. Its pi ence is not usually detected at first, but can later be located by course, yellowish excrement which the borers force from their h rows in the stems and which accumulates on the ground bene; Later the leaves suddenly wilt and die down, and unless the bor are cut out of the vines, the chances are great that the vines will killed. The presence of the borers in the stems causes a nati 11 rotting at the affected points, and the stems becorr the root.

The Hubbard squash marrow cymlings and other late varieties quash often suffer the greatest injury from the squash-vine borer, the devastations are likely to be more acutely felt in small gar - s than in large commercial fields. Not infrequently crops are lost year after year where the ground is successively planted to pumpkins, squashes or other crops which the borers infest. The insect is exceedingly difficult to control in that ordinary insecticides and repellents are practically useless. Since the insect passes the winter in the fields which it has ravaged, the ground </seg>

Good results have often been obtained by planting as a trap crop, as early as possible, a few summer squashes such as crookneck and early cymlings, between the rows of the main crop of late varieties. The summer squashes attract the borers in such numbers as to leave a much smaller number to deal with upon the main crop. As soon as the early crop is harvested, or earlier, if the ground is needed for the main crop, the summer squashes and vines are raked up and burned to destroy all larvae which they may harbor. The same treat - ment is followed after gathering the late varieties. This method has oved profitable where used in Xew Jersey, and should produce good suits further north. In the south, however, where well defined oods of borers appear, it may not be efficient, but is at least worthy horough test. The borer may be greatly reduced in numbers by lightly harrow- the infested fields in the fall, so as to bring the cocoons to the ace.

It is about the only method open for employment after the borers have entered the vines. As several individuals often infest a single vine, it is best to cut longtitudinally not to sever the vine from the root stalk. The wound will heal more quickly if covered with moist soil. The location of the borer in the vine may l&gt;e readily detected by the accumulation of yellow "fras" or excrement at the point where it is working. The parent of this insect is a beautiful, medium-sized moth. The fore wings are opaque, lustrous, olive brown in color, with metallic green extremeties, and extend from less than an inch to nearly an inch and a half. The hind wings are transparent and veined, the abdomen is conspicuously marked with orange or red. black and bronze, and the hind legs are fringed with long hairs. These moths </seg>

III. Naming. (a) The paramount right of the originator, discoverer or intro - ducer of a new variety, strain or stock to name it, within the limits of this code, is recognized and emphasized. (b) No two varieties of the same kind of vegetable should bear the same name. The name first published for a variety should be the accepted and recognized name, except in cases where it has been applied in violation of this code. (c) Where a given variety name through long usage has become thoroughly established in American horticultural literature for two or more varieties, it should not be displaced or radically modified for either sort, except in cases where a well known synonym can be advanced to the position of leading name. The several varieties bear - ing identical names should be distinguished by (1) adding or pre - fixing the name of the originator, discoverer or introducer or the author who is first known to have described it, or (2), by using in like manner some distinguishable term that will insure their identity in catalogs and discussions. (d) Existing American names of varieties which conflict with earlier published foreign names of the same, or other varieties, but which have become thoroughly established through long usuage should not be displaced. The name of a variety of vegetables should consist, if possi - ;i tingle word, and in no case should it consist of more than words, including that of the originator, discoverer or intro- he latter is to be incorporated in the name.

R. Duncan. The popular idea of horticulture is associated entirely with the growing of fruit and flowers. Webster defines horticulture as "The art of cultivating orchards and gardens." An orchard is denned as "A fruit garden." Garden is designated as "Cultivated ground." Horticulture in its true sense is the art of cultivating tree fruits, small fruits, vineyards, nut trees, flowers, ornamental shrubs, trees and plants and all kinds of vegetables. Horticulture is one phase of agricultural activity that is not only necessary for the support of mankind by furnishing fruits and vege - tables for his consumption, but tends to make his life more enjoyable while on earth by giving him flowers, shrubs and trees to decorate his home both indoors and out. In Nebraska where a living has been so easily obtained by grow - ing general farm crops and live stock, horticultural advancement has not been as rapid as in sections of our country where special kinds </seg>
            <seg id="p251">229 of crops must be the rule. Intensive farming means the incorpora - tion of horticultural crops among the crops grown. Extensive farm - ing is giving way to intensive methods. The price of land is getting so high that a radical change must be made in our methods of farm - ing. Intensive methods must be employed to bring maximum returns. Horticulture has the greatest opportunities for advancement, with both profit and pleasure to the horticulturist, in Nebraska and the middle west of any section in the U. S. Climate, soil, geographical location and the people with brain and brawn are factors that give to Nebraska advantages in producing horticultural wealth not found in any other section. THE ANNUAL MEETING J. R. Duncan. The annual meetings at the Nebraska State Horticultural Society were held at the Lindell Hotel in Lincoln, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. January 19 to 21. The meetings this year were well attended and a great deal of interest and enthusiasm was shown in the horticultural work of the state. The apple and corn show was held in the city Auditorium across the street during the entire week under the auspices of the Society and the State Corn Improvers' Association. The color and size of fruit on display was excellent and the quality the usual Nebraska brand which is not excelled by any other section. Box and barrel displays were in evidence taken from the com - mercial packs in storage that showed that the Nebraska grower is keenly alive to the necessity of rigid grading and packing in attrac - tive packages. It seems to be the opinions of the growers that when they adopt the best methods of other sections in entirety and with the superior flavor and keeping quality of the middle western apples, attractive color and uniform size and shape that they will be able to regain the home market and successfully compete with any other section in any market. The Missouri River territory has without a doubt advantages in producing high grade fruit which are found in no other section and it is up to the growers to avail themselves of the best methods and take their right tul position as leaders in production of high grade, superior flavored fruit. Nebraska growers are making an excellent start in this direction. The meetings of the Nebraska State Horticultural Society this year were toruni&gt; for the discussion of the leading questions that confront the horticulturists of Nebraska today. Every phase of horticulture was treated at some time during the meeting. The ses - sions on Tuesday were devoted to topics relating to floriculture. The decoration of the country home or city home was ably handled by Irwin Frey of Lincoln and C E. Dwyi-r of Nebraska City. Herbace- </seg>
            <seg id="p252">230 ous ornamentals was handled in a practical manner by Mr. J. S. Wil - ton, a leading florist of Des Moines. Discussions brought out many points of interest on the papers given. Wednesday was taken up largely in the discussion of the prob - lems confronting the fruit grower. Mr. C. H. Duer of Missouri Valley, Iowa, gave a very instructive paper on commercial apple grow - ing in Iowa. Dr. J. C. Whitten of Columbia, Mo., gave the Nebraska growers, several points on how they can raise better fruit, and thus raise the standard of fruit produced on Nebraska fruit farms. Proper cultural methods, proper pruning, spraying, packing and grading of the fruit into attractive packages are absolutely essential in the production of a high grade product. Every grower must practice these methods and work in harmony with every other grower if it is to be most effective. A spirited discussion followed this talk which indicated a widespread interest in the raising of the standard of Nebraska fruit.

The varieties of small fruit that should be bought and planted in the home garden was discussed. Commercial grape grow - ing was a subject of much interest. The experiences of the grape growers around Council Bluffs and the methods employed was given by Mr. J. P. Hess of Council Bluffs. The grape industry is flourish - ing and a large acreage of new vineyards will be set in the spring. A new method of pruning whereby the growers are getting from 25 to 35 per cent more fruit was described and aroused much interest. The value of vegetables as compared with other horticultural product* \vu&gt; brought out in a talk on "Farm Home and Vegetable Gardens" by Prof. G. \V. Hood of the University of Nebraska. Vege - table growng is the leading phase of horticultural production yet it has not been given the attention in horticultural work that other lines of the industry has received. More attention should be placed on this part of the work. The value of bees as pollinators of fruit blossoms given by Prof. Myron H. Swenk, University of Nebraska was a subject of great nterest to the fruit growers. It was shown that practically all our r ruits must be cross pollinated by insects and that the honey bee was &gt;ne of the most important insects in performing this work. The growing of potatoes is becoming a large industry in Nebraska in a commercial way as well as for home use. A special session devoted to potato culture was held Thursday afternoon. The sub - ject of gt owing potatoes in different parts of the state under differ - ent methods and the best methods in handling and marketing was fully discussed. It is hoped that this is a fore runner of other meet- will result in putting the potato growing industry on a ing mer, sounder economic basis The annual meetings were a source of inspiration to many grow - to produce more and better crops in the ensuing year.

The grower should keep in constant touch with the market other through the newspapers, trade papers, private firms, auction reports, or by telephone, telegraph, or mail. 3. In offering goods for sale shippers should give definite and detailed information regarding the prospective shipments, such at the probable date of shipment, the commodity, number of packages, kind and size of package, quantity and quality of each variety, whether freight or express shipment, and the road and route. 4. Market quotations are of value in finding the best market, but only as temporary indicators of general price levels, and too much reliance must not be placed upon them. 5. Personal visits to the market patronized will enable the grower to obtain the proper market perspective. He will see the difficulties under which the distributors work, he will see his pro - ducts in competition with those from the most highly specialized dis - tricts, and he will learn the necessity of good quality, honest packing and standardization. 6. Before establishing market connections, the dValer's •com - mercial standing should be studied very carefully. Commercial credit agencies, trade papers, chambers of commerce, and local bankers all can be of assistance in this respect. 7. The producer can sell either individually or co-operatively. Co-operativi- associations assume all marketing responsibilities for the individual shipper and are in a much better position to keep in such with the market and to secure an equitable distribution. 8. Sales direct to the consumer are not always advisable owing to the difficulties of transportation and the problems of collections and bad accounts.

APPLES AND OTHER TREE FRUITS. REMEDIES FOR "DAMPING OFF" Soil Disinfection Will Minimize Nurserymen's Loss in the Destruction of Young Seedlings. ulphuric acid has been found by the United States Department of Agriculture to be an effective remedy for the loss of pine and iprace seedlings from "damping off." It is quite common nil tissues it these young seedlings to decay so rapidly soon that they disappear sometimes before the nurseryman anything the matter with them.

Tin- white pine blister rust has already been intro- ■uiitry in this way. and continued importations of ain to result in the establishment in the United reign pesti ■ the department attaches much importance to the ns of possible disinfecting agents which will rid the fungi which cause "damping oft." Of these agents ry for commercial use in the majority of cases has sulphuric acid. Treatment with this acid not only "damping off" but increases germination. seedling* in treated beds may be from one and ne -fourth to ten or even twenty times as great as in untreated beds, lepemHnc on how icrtOM the disease is in the untreated beds At most nurseries, moreover, the treatment also decreases the num ber of weeds and cause the pines to make a better growth during their first season. At one nursery, jack-pine seedlings have grown three times as high in acid-tested beds as in untreated beds. The treatment is not expensive, for commercial sulphuric acid can be purchased in quantity at very low rates. At one nursery where careful accounts were kept it was found that the entire cost of the treatment, including labor, materials, and extra waterings, was less </seg>
            <seg id="p268">244 »$5.00 per thousand square feet of bed. On the other hand the ig in the cost of weeding alone, which the treatment made possi - amounted to $5.30 per thousand square feet. The sulphuric acid is dissolved in water and applied to the beds with a paraffin-coated sprinkler just after the seed is sown and cov - ered. From one-eighth to three-eighths of a fluid ounce of acid should be used per square foot of bed, dissolved in enough water to make one and one-half or two pints of solution. At some nurseries it is also necessary to water the beds once or twice daily during the germ - ination period to prevent chemical injury to the seedlings. Individ - ual conditions, however, must determine for each nursery whether or mot this frequent watering is necessary and exactly how much acid should be used. Sulphuric acid is now in regular use on the seed beds at nurseries in four western states, Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and New Mexico. Considerable quantities of carbonates, however, are contained in some soils in these states, their presence being indicated by vigorous effer - vescence or bubbling when a strong solution of acid is applied. Where this is the case, sulphuric acid is not likely to be effective. In one nursery in Kansas zinc chloride and copper sulphate have been found satisfactory Mih.-titutrs when used in the same way as sul - phuric acid. For zinc chloride one-half ounce avoirdupios is used per square foot; and for copper sulphate three-eighths of an ounce or tThe chloride is less apt to injure seedlings, but is more expen - than the copper sulphate. Despite its greater cost, however, it ssible that the zinc chloride may be preferred both to sulphuric and to copper sulphate, even on soils which do not contain car- ain car bonate. In some northern nurseries where soil disini en Eted to, fall sowing has been found to control "damping off" fairly At all nurseries where the soil remains frozen during the win - it is worth while to test sowing just before the soil freezes, ssive moisture should lie avided in unsterilized seed beds.

Many Factors the Prospective Grower Should Consider Before He Determines the Location of His Orchard. t Depth of subsoil as a necessity for successful apple growing is ngly emphasized in a new bulletin of the United States Depait - t of Agriculture No. 140 which, although dealing primarily with iitions in Connecticut and Massachuetts. contains much informa - of value to orchardists all over the country. The presence f^f roken rock, large ledges, or hardpan within three feet of the sur- </seg>
            <seg id="p269">245 face, the bulletin considers prohibitive, and a soil depth of at least six feet is ftlaMMt ■ necessity. An even greater depth is desirable. There is also no foundation lor the popular belief that the presence of •-tones is useful. Their only benefit is to loosen to some degree the excessive compactness of clayey, stiff soils which however, are never the best fitted for fruit growing. True hardpan. the hulk-tin points out. is not a clay loam which may under certain circumstances constitute a desirable subsoil, but i» a mixture el saml. gravel, soil, and clay with more or less cementing material which hinds tile mass together so that the movement of th directions is seriously impeded. Where hardpan is inoi&gt;tur«. found close to the surface it can sometimes be broken up by the use of dynamite. This, however, is an expensive process and with the prevailing prices for good orchard lands, it will be better for the fruit &gt;wer to select soil which does not require it The cultural method employed in an orchard should alawys be flexible and adapted to the individual soil characteristics. Thus if the soil is too retentive of moisture, leaving the orchard uncultivated will hasten evaporation. If the soil tends to dry out too quickly, on the other hand, cultivation should be frequent and a good supply of liunms maintained by growing leguminous crops. It is better, how- ever, to adapt the varieties to be grown to the soil rather than to attempt to change the nature of the latter. For any kind of orchard planting the soil should be deep, well drained, and friable, yet not so porous as to be droughty. The exact il best suited to each variety of apple will depend largely, however. ■ m such climatic factors as the range of temperature, the rainfall, the surface drainage, exposure, etc. If these climatic factors are unfav - orable lor any given variety the character of the soil will not make it possihle to j. r ro\v this fruit successfully unless it serves to offset the unfavorable condition*. For example, apples ripen a little later on a northerly slope than on a southern one. They also ripen earlier on a sandy loam than on heavier soils. Thus a light soil on the north side of a hill may produce earlier fruit than a heavier one on the south side. There are, therefore, many factors which the prospective orch - ardist should take into consideration before definitely purchasing his land or before deciding what variety of apple he will devote himself to. The character of the soils best adapted to the principal commer - cial varieties are discussed in the new bulletin of the department. No. 140, entitled.

When is tin- proper time to prune peach trees? liustioii frequently asked of the United States Depart- ment of Agriculture's specialists. In general, the answer is: "During the dormant period, preferably late winter or early spring, just before iwtli start*. This is true except in regions where bleeding from unds is likely to occur, when it should probably be done in early winter." The subject of pruning peach trees is more fully explained in a new Farmers' Bulletin NO (&gt;32 on growing peaches, which deals also with the renewal of tops, thinning, interplanted crops, and other spe - cial practices. Sometime* the owner of a peach orchard will find it necessary to prune his trees throughout the winter whenever the weather is suit - able for man to work in the orchard, particluarly if the operations are very extensive. But if the fruit buds are endangered during the winter by adverse temperatures, it may be advisable to delay prun- nch as economic conditions permit until settled spring weather pecially advisable if heavy heading in of the pre%- at mib season's growth is involved, since the proportion of live buds, may determine the extent to which the cutting back should be car- ■V limited amount of summer pruning can usually be done to idvuntagc. Tile trees should be observed constantly throughout the rowth. Whenever a branch is seen which is so ii placed that it obviously will need to be removed at the annual prun ng for tile shaping up of the tree, it is well to take it off at once. In his way the annual pruning can be reduced to a minimum and the removal of large limbs will rarely be necessary Then. too. it frequently happens that a single branch in the top i the tree will grow considerably faster than any of the others, thus making the three unsymmetrical if its growth is not checked. A slight heading in as soon as such a tendency is apparent will usually keep the top well balanced. There is a wide difference of opinion regarding the practice of pruning trees, but the most successful fruit growers usually prune their trees. The principal objects may be summed up briefly as fol- lows </seg>
            <seg id="p272">248 1. To modify the vigor of the tree. 2. To keep the tree shapely and within bounds. 3. To make the tree more stocky. 4. To open the tree top to admit air and sunshine. 5. To reduce the struggle for existence in the tree top. 6. To remove dead or interfering branches. 7. To aid in stimulating the development of fruit buds. 8. To thin the fruit. 9. To make thorough spraying possible. 10. To facilitate the harvesting of the fruit Obviously the pruning which a tree receives during the first tw Eree years after it is planted has much to do. with its future. Mis - in forming the head or the results of neglect during the early in the life of a tree are practically irreparable. On the other if the tree is well formed and properly pruned during its first years, the foundation lor good tree is established; subsequent errors in pruning, if they occur, may admit of correction without permanent harm to the tree. The new bulletin explains why in certain regions where warn periods of considerable length occur during the winter, it i&gt; well prolong the growth ol trees until late every season. The rest peri during which trees generally remain dormant is one which is fairlj decided by nature. L'ntil that period is past, when one have become dormant they do not respond readily to temr which later would cause them to resume a more or less ac dition. If the growth ol the tree i&gt; continued actively until the approach of cold weather each season by means of late till genous fertilizers, or in other ways, the period of rest will not be completed until a later time in the winter. Then if a spe of warm weather occurs in January, for instance, the tree which w ordinarily respond to it. will remain inactive until many of t gers of frost have passed. A great many practical pointers on renewing the tops of peac trees, changing the top by budding and grafting, thinning the fruit, co trolhng insect pests, and on growing some annual crop in betwee K trees, are included in the new bulletin.

The length of time it takes to fill the barrel will depend upon how much faster the water goes in than it : &gt;ut. The value of an orchard will likewise depend upon the compar - ative cost and returns. A small crop well handled and disposed of is more profitable than a much larger crop where we find waste and inefficiency in handling the crop after it has been grown. The time of harvesting the fruit should receive more attention. Of course several factors must be considered, such as the length of time the fruit is to be held, whether or not it will be placed in cold storage, how far it must be shipped to market, etc. When the fruit i to be held for sometime or when it is to be stored or shipped long istances it should not be allowed to become thoroughly ripe, and the farther the fruit is tor be shipped the greener it must be picked. Often in the rush to get the crop harvested and disposed of, the fruit is eked much too green. Apples picked green and allowed to ripen 1 or in transit are certainly inferior in flavor to those allowed &gt; remain on the trees until they are sufficiently matured. This is n advantage which the growers of the middle west have over those the east and northwest. We are much nearer a good market — still be developed in many instances, and our fruit may well be left on nger. For storage, well matured fruit is better than fruit either too ■n or over ripe. The proper degree of maturity may be judged in nu&gt; ways. In red apples, the amount of color is a fair index. uit should be allowed to attain the highest color possible and still main tirm. Instead of picking when it presents an even hard green ne side and a fair amount of color on the other, the fruit lould be left until it has assumed more color and begun to look jibie. The color of the seeds is an important point especially in iealing with half colored fruits. The seeds as a rule should be deep arown color before the apple is ready to pick, but there are exceptions :o this rule. Some varieties are quite edible while the seeds are still ight colored, while others are immature even after the seeds have ttained full color. These exceptions are few, however. Another xcellent index to maturity is the ease with which the stem separates from the tree. So long as the joint between the stem and the spur does not separate readily it is best to leave the fruit on the tree unless be shipped long distances. There is not much danger of the t fruit being too green if the joint separates easily. One phase of orcharding in which our growers as a class lack sadly in efficiency is the grading and packing of the fruit. These two operations are very intimately associated in this district where we have less of both than we need, but where more improved methods are used we find the two operations separated. Each assumes an important part in selling the fruit. It is astonishing to note the neg - lect along this line of the business. With the example set by our more </seg>

To secure the best results a spirit of co-operation must exist not only among the growers themselves, bat between the growers and the distributors; the growers anil the consumers; and especially between the growers and consumers in the same districts. In conclusion permit me to say that I think the first and most important step in orcharding in order to meet demands of the near future is to save the orchards already planted and make them profit - able. Tin- next step is to prepare for the more distant future by plant - ing new orchards. Finally we should, by co-operation in buying and selling, raise the standard of grading and packing and by using attractive and con - venient packs, create a home market for middle west fruit and thus benefit, not the grower alone, nor the consumer alone, but the country as a whole. APPLE GROWING IN NEBRASKA J. R. Duncan \l&gt;l&gt;k-&gt; have been grown in Nebraska for fifty years with varying degrees of success. In the early days fungous and insect injury to the fruit was practically unknown. The main problem to solve was, "What varieties were adapted to the climatic conditions here in Nebraska?" Most of the settlers were from the eastern states where such varieties of apples as Baldwin. Northern Spy, Spitzenberg, Rome Beauty, were the leading commercial sorts. Naturally these varieties were first tried together with such varieties as Ben Davis, Winesap, Jonathan, and Grimes Golden. The first mentioned varieties did not prove as adaptable as the latter named sorts. The latter varieties proved to be adapted and are making Eastern Nebraska famous as a producer of as fine flavored, well colored, and long keeping apples as can be grown anywhere. After the pioneers had successfully demonstrated that apples could be grown commercially and also the varieties which gave the best results, a wave oi orchard planting spread over the state. Five, ten, forty and even eighty acre orchards were set out. The major part of the orchards were set to such varieties as Ben Davis, Grimes Golden. Winesap. Missouri Pippin. Jonathan. Mammoth Black Twig and (iano. These varieties seemed to be well suited for Nebraska conditions. The trees set in these orchards were grown in many dif - ferent Mates, and were shipped in from districts which had many fungous and insect pests. Fruit was also shipped in from these dis - tricts. All that time spraying and inspection was practically unknown. As a result fungous diseases and insect pests were well distributed over the state. Luckily some of the worst pests such as San Jose scale (which has caused thousands of dollars damage in others sec - tions) have failed to get into the state. Among the fungous diseases </seg>
            <seg id="p278">254 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY that has caused the greatest loss is the apple scab and the greatest insect pest is the codling moth. These two things together with the other pests became so bad that most of the fruit was wormy, scabby and unfit for sale. As a consequence the large commercial orchards ised to pay any profits and in most cases did not pay for the use :he land on which they stood. Many owners threatened to, and le did, pull up their orchards and plant the ground to some farm j. About this time the practice of controlling the insect and fung - by spraying with certain fungicides and insecticides was found be practical and successful. At first the skeptics were in the ority, among orchard owners and only a tew would try MM the new hods.

The development of young orchards is a basil There is an aesthetic side to the enterprise, but primarily orchar are planted for profit and not for pleasure. The paramount question in the minds of most prospective fruit growers is, what investment is required to bring an orchard into pro - fitable bearing? Hundreds of people do not plant orchards because of the financial burden in caring for them before they begin to yield returns; mi the other hand, a host of men in this state have planted trees with the full intention of giving them the proper care, but have failed largely because the necessary funds were lacking. I am per - sonally acquainted with young men who would like to engage in fruit culture, but the expenditure demanded before there is any return </seg>

Three men from a Pennsylvania city visited State College recently and said they had $&gt;5.UX) to invest in the development of a great commercial orchard, lint they much preferred a plan and policy which would not call for the spending of the entire sum. Planters should bear in mind that every year added to the age ot wcll-cared-for orchard of approved varieties enhances its value. There is an increasing number of men who are willing to pay a lib - eral price for young orchards that have not reached a hearing age, and with this knowledge growers should not hesitate to plant trees and follow approved methods in their can-. Any plan, however, which will reduce the cash outlay in growing a young orchard, will be wel - comed by all classes of fruit growers. In the development of young orchards, the aim should he to grow very best trees at a minimum cost. Any plan of culture which have this high purpose should be condemned. The grow- of crops between the trees is a secondary matter and should not any time interfere with such treatment as will result in perfectly healthy and properly grown trees. Inter-cropping in orchards has not been popular with the rank and file of orcliardists. mainly for the three reasons. First, it has been claimed that the trees need all the plant food naturally furnished by the soil and any additional amount that the grower might be able supply, and that the cultivation of companion crops necessarily s the trees. This is a weak argument, and many instances might cited where ample food lias been supplied for both trees and mpanioii crops, which of course is absolutely essential to success, 1th from the standpoint of the orchard and of the inter-til'age crops. Second, it has been claimed that tillage is interfered with when crops are p|M between the trees. This may or may not be true. It depends upon the character of the crop selected and also upon the method and frequency of cultivation. By choosing the right crop and by Hiving it the right kind of tillage the trees will not suffer from lack of cultivation. Third, the most justifiable reason for not inter - cropping is that it places additional irons in the fire, some of which are likely to be burned. To engage in market gardening or potato culture on a large scale in connection with orcharding requires con - siderable executive ability. Not all men can succeed in handling garden crops on a large scale and at the same time give the trees proper attention. In recent years, however, inter-cropping is becoming more popu - lar. It is not difficult to cite instances where the plan has been worked out with entire success. One of the best examples is that of the well known horticulturist. Mr. H. C Snavely, Lebanon, Pa. Mr. Suavely was formerly chairman of the General Fruit Committee of the Pennsylvania Horticultural society, and he is recognized as one of the most intelligent and IMIIMfal orchardists in the state. In </seg>
            <seg id="p281">256 1907 Mr. Snavely planted four rows of potatoes thirty-four inches apart, using the variety known as Carman No. 3, between the peach trees, which were set at standard distances. The land previous to the setting of trees was plowed very deep and thoroughly harrowed. No fertilizer was used for the trees at the time of planting, but 1,000 pounds of 2-8-7 mixture was applied in drills for the potatoes. Thor - ough tillage was given during the season. The potatoes were planted April 5th. From twelve acres, 2,000 bushels of potatoes were harv - ested and the trees made a most satisfactory growth. The trees for this orchard were the largest that could be secured, some measuring eight feet in height at the time of planting. In 1908, potatoes were again planted, but on account of severe drouth, only 860 bushels were harvested. The growth of the peach trees the second season was also satisfactory. 1 did not hear directly from Mr. Snavely the fol - lowing year, but I understand that he harvested a tine crop of peaches. Mr. Snavely has told me repeatedly that he never saw a liner young orchard. It is a pleasure to call attention to inter-cropping as practiced by Horace Roberts, Moorestown, X. J. Mr. Roberts purchased his first farm some years ago and was unable to make a single payment on the place. He had barely enough capital to stock the farm with tools and a few animals. The success of his operations is almost phenom - enal for he now owns nine farms, and he is a comparatively young man. Mr. Roberts is known as an orchardist as well as a market gardener, and his success must be attributed largely to inn-r-cropping in the orchards. The general policy is to buy a farm when the price is right and to plant all of it with fruit trees. Peaches, apples, pears, plums and cherries are grown extensively on the Roberts' farm, and inter-tillage crops are used in all the plantations. In a number of Inces it has been possible to pay for the places from the profits wo seasons. Expenses of the young orchards as well as of the e farm are more than paid from the outset, and it should also be i that the farms become more valuable because of the starting of g orchards and the improvement in soil fertility. Many other ers within easy reach of Philadelphia markets have been prac - g companion cropping with success. The most common practice le Roberts farm is to plant peas as early as possible in the spring, wing with such crops as tomatoes, sweet corn, muskmelons, tnbers, watermelons, potatoes and other crops that may be sold to advantage in Philadelphia. Most of the farms are about eleven miles from the city and nearly all produce is marketed by wagon. In deciding as to the kind of crop which is best adapted to any particular location, the following points should be considered: (1) The equipment and capital required. The growing of such crops as peas, sweet corn and potatoes would require a very much smaller outlay for equipment than early cabbage and early tomatoes, -which must be started under glass. Practically all farms have the </seg>
            <seg id="p282">257 tools necessary for the growing of potatoes, although if undertaken on a large scale it would be necessary to «ecure planters and harvest - ers, while one could not expect to grow early cabbage and early tomatoes on a large scale without expensive areas devoted to hot - beds, cold frames and perhaps greenhouses. (2) The natural bent or inclination of the grower should be taken into account. Many people who are very fond of fruit culture would not make a success in growing vegetables because these crops do not appeal to them. This is a most important factor and should not be ignored l&gt;y t lie individual or the community. (3) Inter-cropping requires more labor than when no crops arc grown between the trees. This may or may not be a serious factor. It the grower possesses sufficient skill to make a success in the grow - ing of vegetable or other companion crops he can well afford to pay jr labor in competition with other classes of producers. (4) A most important factor to be carefully considered is the question of markets and marketing. On account of easy access to a large market, the growers of Moorestown possess special advantages ivrr persons operating remote from large centers of population. Although these men are within easy driving distances of Philadelphia, much time of the men and horses is required to cart the produce to market. If a good shipping trade is developed it possesses special ;idvantagc in requiring very little time for the delivery of vegetables the railroad siding. Some crops which might be grown between fruit trees require more skillful management than others. This factor is well worth the consideration of the orchardist. His time and thought are needed in caring for the trees and if inter-tillage crops can be selected which. imple to cultivate, it will be a decided advantage. Whin the growers of a given community desire to engage in le growing of inter-crops, it would be a great advantage to decide upon a few crops that best meet the requirements of the locality. To make such an enterprise a success, those crops should be selected which require the least skill, unless there is assurance that more dif - ficult crops can be grown successfully. (7) Crops should be K row n for which there is a large demand. Potatoes are especially desirable because this vegetable is consumed in very large quantities. From the standpoint of demand, cabbage probably ranks second, and tomatoes third. (8) It is an advantage to select crops that have the fewest enemies to combat and which may be controlled without great diffi - culty. Looking at the matter from this standpoint, the tomato is one of our best crops, especially if rotation is practiced. (9) Other things being equal, it is important to select crops which will interfere the least with spraying. Crops with erect habit f growth will permit the use of spray machinery, while those of a </seg>
            <seg id="p283">258 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY f il straggling nature would not allow the use of carts or wagons without damage to the companion crop 10) The location is a most important factor in deciding the crops which should be grown between the trees. It is especially important to telect those which are adapted to your soil type. Some crops, as cabbage, have a much wider adaptation than others. The quality of the companion crop will depend largely upon the character of the soil. A large crop of potatoes might be |ii)»i successfully on limestone soils, but they lack quality as compared with tubers grown on sand - stone. Early tomatoes arc smoother and more regular when grown on the lighter soils. The question of exposure should be considered with reference to this problem. In orchards having trees on sunny slopes, the growing of early crops, as peas, cabbage and tomatoes, might well be considered, while it would probably be futile for fruit growers on northern slopes to attempt the culture of these crops. The steepness of the land must also be considered. It is impracticable to grow on steep hillsides crops requiring frequent tillage. 1(11) It is desirable to select crops which have the same fertilizer tillage requirements as the trees under culture. Cabbage, for mple, is not a desirable crop to gTOV in peach orchards, because it iires more nitrogen than is required by peach trees. On the other d, there could be little objection to the growing of this crop in le orchards, provided the soil is well tilled with humus.

Sweet corn, and especially the early varieties, may be grown with entire success in young orchards without detriment to the trees. By - planting the early varieties in thoroughly drained soils which have been well enriched by the plowing down of clover sods and the appli - cation of manure along with high grade fertilizer, the crop would be harvested in ample time to start cover crops. Some of the best varieties for this purpose are Crosby. White Cob Cory, Premo, Fork - hook, First and Golden Bantam. Later varieties may be grown with entire success, but the crop is harvested rather l»»p for sowing cover crops. Small fruits may be used as companion crops in orchards, but are undesirable because they require tillage later in the season than is favorable for starting cover crops. I see no reason, however, why the bush fruits could not be grown in the orchards, using each year a legume, as cow peas, which would be killed by frost and which would add materially to the supply of vegetable matter. Soy beans are better adapted to clay soils. They made a much larger growth at State College, in Hagerstown clay loam, than cow peas. Xone of the small fruits, however, are generally regarded as good inter-tillage crop* for the orchard. Peas meet the requirements, as far as the trees are concerned, better than any other vegetable. They add nitrogen and vegetable matter to the soil when the vines are plowed down and do not draw heavily upon the supply of mineral elements. The earliest varieties should lie used and planted just as soon as the ground can be pre - pared. The largest yields are procured by the free use of seed and thorough cultivation. Tomatoes, when the bulk of the crop is off before the middle of \ugust or the first of September, is a desirable crop. It is important to use an early variety, such as Karliana, and grow strong, stocky plants, carrying a cluster &lt;ir two of flowers, which are set in the field as early in the season as the locality will permit. This is important because yields are larger from early set plants, and the profits are certainly larger from the earliest crop.

Early potatoes are exceedingly desirable for this purpose. All points considered, we probably have no crop which is so valuable for companion cropping. The advantages are the small cost of equipment tor growing the crop; soil and fertilizer requirements are very much the same as for most fruits; it must have the same kind of tillage as is favorable to tree growth; there is a large demand for this product; it is a simple crop to nmvv as well as to harvest and market; and the crop matures in ample time to follow with crimson clover or other hardy legume. To make the crop a full success, great care should be exercised in preparing the soil and firm seed should be planted as early as possible in the spring. There should be no delay in harvest - ing the crop after it has reached marketable size. — Address delivered at annual meeting Minnesota State Horticultural Society, from "The Minnesota Horticulturist ' APPLE AND PEAR BLIGHT. I According to Mr. H. R.

Numerous requests have been received by the •eriment Station as to methods of combating and controlling the ase. The following description and methods of control will be of rest to all apple growers : "The disease attacks apple, pear and quince. It is caused by bac - teria that multiply in the inner bark when- spray materials cannot reach them. It is spread by insects Much of its damage is due to destruction of the flowers in the nectar of which the bacteria can multiply readily. It is carried over winter in the thick bark cankers of larger limbs or trunks Most of the infections occur in April and May, during close, showery weather. Remove watersprouts immedi - ately because of danger of spread downward to important parts, espe - cially the crown region where collar rot may be produced. Cut off limbs that have thick bark affected, or cut out the bark canker if it is small. The small twigs and fruit spurs on apple are not dangerous at this date, after they have dried and cracks have appeared between sound and dead parts.

Look over the trees after the next showery period to be sure there is no spread from imperfectly removed parts.

ORCHARDING IN THE MIDDLE WEST. Prof. J. R. Cooper, University of Nebraska. Orcharding in the middle west has suffered many reverses. So any. that it is astonishing that we have so many thriving orchards the present time. When the middle west region was being settled the idea prevailed hat fruit could not be grown here and later experience has almost iroved to be true. In spite of this sentiment a few early settlers their fir-t si-vfii years. </seg>
            <seg id="p287">262 planted trees which thrived and bore early and abundantly. They were not diseased and had few insects to contend with. The first cost of establishing the orchard was slight. The trees were set in holes dug in the unbroken sod, sometimes plowed later, and some - times not at all or they were set on land recently cleared of timber. among the stumps, and given no further care. The success of these early orchards and the slight cost and amount of care necessary brought on an area of promiscuous planting. Every land holder planted an orchard. From 1890 to 1903-04 the number of orchard trees planted equaled all that had been planted before that tinu About the time these trees were old enough to bear the troubles bewail \ aneties had been brought from the "old home" and were tmmi in the majority of cases to be unsuited to this district. Then- wa* .. general ignorance of what varieties to plant, many useless ones hail been set out. The trees planted in sod and clearings soon bore them - selves to death. A general system of close planting had been prac - ticed by the majority of early planters. The trees soon began to »d each other. This caused them to grow long, slender, up Chci with little bearmg surface. Little or no pruning m the lower limbs died for lack of proper nourishment and ligl I The "Tree AgMt" was abroad in the land.

The same conditions with :ts and disease have prevailed in the west and northw \\ there in the middle west. This was once "the land of the worn apple." Later the northwest took the title from Us.

They have the advantage they employ better methods However, this handicap, we H and should overcome. We have the advantage in that we can gro apples far superior to theirs in quality and flavor and apple* whit will keep better in storage. People are beginning to awaken to the possibilities of fruit grow - ing in the middle west. This is proven by the great interest shown in orcharding since the beginning of the present century. Men of all walks of life are turning to orcharding. Wealthy men are setting orchards. Farmers are setting orchards and enlarging those already set. Salaried men are investing their savings in orchards, or in orch- </seg>

Now, however, instead of planting orchards of a hundred acres or upwards as was the practice thirty years ago. the threat majority of owers are planting orchards of from rive to forty — the average ing aliout 20 acres. These are the orchards which are making y lr owners today, and which are building up the repu ation oi the Missouri Valley as an apple producing region. The arrest orchards have not as a rule been nearly so profitable as the aller ones owing largely to improper management. C oiisiderinjjr this great increase in orchard planting, it is easy to dcrstand why the cry has gone up among conservative orchardists that the market will sooif l»e so overloaded with fruit that orcharding will cease to be a paying investment. It is enough to cause even the most ( nthusiastic advocates of orcharding to hesitate and to wonder what the outcome may be. there danger of over production? 1 answer, unhesitatingly, no! rin re has been a wonderful increase in planting it is true, but thou - ands of men have gaaa into the business without sufficient thought. .wledgc or preparation and are doomed to fail. We have numer - examples in every locality. Insufficient capital will cause the failure of many more. Thousands of acres of land unsuited to the purpose have been planted to orchards which will never repay the IMMII for the time and labor spent in planting and caring for them. The ravages of insects and diseases go farther than all other agencies Tibincd to lower the production of fruit. The loss from these weci is estimated at millions of bushels annually and to those who ■ acquainted with the work of the codling moth, the curculio, the 'litter rot and the Illinois or blister canker, this estimate is not large. The blister canker alone is killing thousands of trees annually. By consulting the report of the U. S. Government which, by the *ay. is more suggestive than accurate, but from which one may secure a somewhat definite idea of the present conditions. We find the apple crap of the United States gradually decreasing from 60.500,00'.) bbls. in 1895 to 23.825.000 in 1910. In 1910 there were 50.000,000 less bearing ipple mis than ill 1900. And only 65,000,000 not in bearing. If all ees which were alive in 1910 would come into bearing next year would be a crop of only about 72,000,000 or 15.000,000 barrels more than in 1900. However, thousands of the trees which were in bearing in 1910 and large numbers of the trees not then of bearing age have died since then so that it will be sometime yet before the apple crop will surpass or even equal what it was 20 years ago. Various estimates have been made of the 1911, '12, "13 and '14 pa hut they have all been made on the number of trees given the 1910 census report and are a great deal larger than the crops actually were, owing to the great reduction of hearing trees. While apple production has been decreasing the population has been ncreasing. In 1910 the population was in round numbers 78.000,0JO. </seg>
            <seg id="p289">264 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Xow it is close to the 100,000,000 mark with two-thirds of the apple crop we had twenty years ago to supply the demand. On top of the great increase in population we have constantly increasing export trade of fresh, dried and canned fruit. From about 1,000,000 bbls. in 1908. it increased to more than 8,000,000 bbls. o{ fresh apples in 1913. Of this. amount 2,000,000 bl&gt;ls. were shipped to Kurope, principally to England. Ireland, Norway. Denmark, Germany, Belgium and Netherlands. That the present European war will materially increase or at least not decrease the sale of American fruit abroad may be under - stood from the following: France in 1913 shipped to the before men - tioned countries 5,000,000 bbls. of apples. Austria supplied not only her own needs but two-thirds of the German* market. Russia supplied her own and a portion of the European markets: Since exportation from these countries has ceased the demand must be met by Ameri - can fruit. Again since by far the greater part of the exported fruit wai shipped to ports which are still open to our trade there is no great danger of the demand diminishing. With the orchards of north - ern France and of Austria destroyed by the warring armies and neg - lect as were those of France in 1870 it will be many years before they can again compete with the United States in the apple industry. B Indeed it seems to me that in spite of past discouragement^ ng in the United States, especially in the Missouri Valley brighter prospects ;ibead than has being the case.

If we stop growing cull our orchards and trying to force them on to the unsuspectiii! lie. I am sure that we will be agreeably surprised by the improve it in market conditions. Success means efficiency all along the line from the time the tree is set in the orchard until the last crop is harvested and sold. The success of the fruit growers of the northwest is due not to their loca- </seg>
            <seg id="p290">265 ng their fruit. We will never be able to compete with them suc- cs-fully until we can equal their methods not only in one phase of he industry but in all. All over the country we find old orchards which have been neg- lected for years and which as they now stand are not only worthless hut a menace to surrounding orchards, because of the innumerable pest- and diseases which they harbor. However many of these neglected orchards 1&gt;\ proper attention and care can be made to pro - duce profitable crops in two to three years time. There are orchards from which, m account of age. disease, or other conditions the return? would not justify the expenditure of time and money necessary to iring them into bearing condition. A knowledge of conditions, and .■•i.id sound judgment are necessary in deciding whether to attempt to rejuvenate an orchard or to remove it. there is a fair stand of trees of good varieties, if the trees are o badly cankered, if they have good strong root systems, trunk-. main limbs, the orchard is certainly worth considering even if • is considerable dead wood, for by utilizing the watersprouis. which will be numerous under such conditions new branches or even entire tops may be secured. One of the first and most important step* reclaiming a neglected orchard is the removal of the dead or dying wood This applies, however, to all orchards. No dead wood should be allowed to remain in any orchard, on account of the liability of acilitating the spread of disease and insects to other trees. This i* especially true of the wood infected by Illinois canker. The next important step to consider is cultivation. If the tree* are standing in sod or weed patches as many of them are, thorough plowing early in the spring followed by clean cultivation up to the time the t'ruit is well grow will work wonders. But if canker is pre- valent or if the roots are weak, the task is almost hopeless. If the found to l&gt;e in yood state of preservation, but the number tr greatly reduced it is again a questionable undertaking. Young trees may l&gt;e set where the old ones have died out but this is not often satisfactory. The young trees do not do well; sometimes do not grow at all. If they do it takes a number of years for them to come into bearing. When they finally reach bearing age there will be more old treci to replace. This state of affairs will greatly reduce profits since the chances are that at no one time will all the trees be bearing at the same time while the BOM ai caring for the orchard is practically as great as though there were a full stand of bearing trees. The reclamation or renovation of a neglected orchard resolves itself into several distinct operations which can conveniently be grouped under pruning, cultivation, cover crops and spraying. The pruning operation will require study, care, and good judg- ment. No two trees will require just the same treatment. Young trees or trees with many water sprouts in the top will bear more severe pruning than old trees or trees without water sprouts. Trees </seg>

The first step in pruning should l&gt;e to go over the entire top anil take out all dead or diseased wood, and all crossed branches. Branches affected with blight should be removed altogether. Branches ■fleeted with canker should he treated or removed according to the severity of the case. Black rot and bitter rot cankers rari-ly penetrate deeply into the wood and may be treated by removing all of the cankered area down to sound wood. After disinfecting the wound, it shiuild be covered with some material which is impervious to air and water. Both solid and liquid asphaltum has given good results at the Nebraska Experiment Station. Illinois or Mister canker is Mil Mft* .111. than any other canker we have in our orchards. It attacks not only the bark but the wihiiI a&gt; well, and except in the case of cankers ItM than two years old it is best to remove the entire limb in which the canker is found. In case it is desired to retain the limb it may be- treated as in the case of black or bitter rot cankers, but great care lliu»t lie taken to remove all of the wood containing the fMfJM and t.. disinfect and cover them uglily. After treating a tree for cankir it w.uld be well to prune it severely in order to induce a more rifOTOW flow ot sap into the remaining top. In this cutting back as well as ii other pruning, great care must be exercised not to leave any stubs and t&lt;&gt; cover all wounds large and small. Heading in or pruning " any kind should never be done by cutting oft the ends of the branches but by selecting relatively small limbs which may be removed entirely If this is not sufficient smaller limbs at the outer end of the limb which arc left may be cut off. In this way the top is lowered am thinned out without leaving stubs, which rarely heal, and which an open doors for infectii n. In examining some Nebraska orchards S( per cent of the canker tmfeCtHM! were found surrounding old pruniiij. wounds where stubs were left or where wounds were not Covered. It all pruning operations it is of the utmost importance to disinfect all I""!- used on a tree before beginning work on another, to prevenl the spread of disease by disseminating spores which may have col - lected on the tools while cutting through some diseased part. The next important -tep. especially where the orchard is in sod o, weeds as the majority or neglected orchards are. is a thorough plow - ing followed by clean cultivation up to the time the fruit is well growi after which a cover crop may be sown if it is necessary to check tin growth of the trees A yrcat many roots will be cut in plowing ■ orchard which has been left in sod for a number of years.

Any tool may be used for subsequent cultivation which will keep the ground well pulverized. An extension disc is excellent it available but any other tool which will do as good work will answer the purpose Alter cultivating up to about the middle or last of July it is a ood practice to sow a cover crop. This will be beneficial not only in ripening the wood, thus lessening the danger of fire blight infection, and winter killing, but will add humus to the sod. In por - tions of the country where rainfall is abundant a crop which viil mat down and form a heavy mulch is most desirable, but in the dryer sections, (specially where there is much wind a crop which will remain upright and catch the snow is most desirable. Where the land il too rolling to permit of clean cultivation, excellent results an- being secured by ceding the orchard to red clover and plowing it under ccasionally, say every three or four years. The next important step in orchard renovation is the spraying ampaign. In this operation success lies first in knowing the caust the trouble, second in knowing the remedy for the trouble and third applying thorough treatment. It is impracticable to spray for each lividual pest with which we are troubled, but by using judgment H lie combination of materials and in the time of application the greater umber of these may be controlled. radically all of the fungous diseases may be controlled by the ■m .! either Bordeaux mixture or lime sulphur solution. Bordeaux is more effective in many cases, especially in combatting apple blotch. sulphur, but when used during periods of wet weather or when .roperly mixed. However, it costs slightly more and requires care in the mixing. More burning results from improper mix- : than otherwise. On the other hand lime sulphur causes more wry during dry hot periods than does Bordeaux. hir most valuable insecticide is arsenate of lead either in paste iwdtr form. Ordinarily the powder gives the best results and is uch more easily handled than the paste forms. The great question at the present time is "when shall we spray for control of the codling moth?" This insect has not yet seen fit to disclose all the complications in his life history. We are all agreed that the petal-fall application is the most important, but we are not so well agreed as to the relative importance of other applications or when they should be made. From results obtained last season we thought that the third spray should be applied 21 to 28 days after the petal-fall stage. The indications from the results of the present sea - son are that this date should be changed to 7 to 14 days after the petal-fall stage. There is no question about the time to apply the fourth spray. It should be applied just before the second brood of larvae begin to appear. The question is when do they begin to appear? Usually there is a season when the young larvae appear in </seg>
            <seg id="p295">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 268 frwcr numbers than early in the spring, followed by a season when the numbers are increased by what we term the second larvae. This year there was, instead of a decrease in number after the time for the first brood, apparently a continual increase in the number of emerging larvae. To control this army required five sprays as they were applied this season, the petal-fall, the ten days after, the twenty - five days after, the middle of July and the first of August. A better arrangement of the schedule might have enabled us to leave out one application but applied at the times stated we could have left none oat. However, we hope after another season's work to obtain more definite information along this line. It must be liornc in mind that an orchard cannot be made over in a few days or a year. The process of reclamation should cover at least three years after which profitable crops may be expected. The »ir*t year the orchard will not pay expenses tor it is an expensive job t.. |.ritne neglected tries and such trees rarely produce much more than water sprouts the first year.
