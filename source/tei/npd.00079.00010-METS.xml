            <seg id="p007">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL December 23, 1936. To His Excellency, R. L. Cochran, Governor of the State of Nebraska. Sir: I have the honor to transmit, herewith, the biennial report of the Attorney General for the biennium from January 3, 1935 to January 7, 1937. The past two years have been strenuous ones for this office. Probably never before has the Attorney General's office been called upon to do as much work as m the last biennium. This work has been of an extremely varied nature and involved many matters of the utmost importance to the State of Nebraska. The entire staff of the office has worked diligently and tirelessly, and has attempted to do its work efficiently. In furnishing legal opinions to the state and county officers, it has been our aim to give the best opinions of which we were able, without regard to politics. I feel that m this respect we have been successful. Much of the extra work thrown upon the Attorney General's office during the past biennum was due to the fact that the last legislature had before it jmany new and different problems with vvhich it had to deal, lyiuch new and experimental legislation was passed to cope with these problems. Much of this legislation Has been attacked m the courts. It became the duty of this office to defend the validity of such legislation. In many instances we were faced with the proposition of attempting to defend the legal - ity of legislative acts which we ourselves felt were invalid. In such cases we attempted to make the strongest possible defense of the validity of such acts. In many of such instances the Supreme Court declared the acts to be unconstitutional. </seg>
            <seg id="p008">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL The fact that a considerable number of the legislative acts passed during the past two years have been declared void by the Supreme Court should not be taken as a criticism of the legisla - ture, for we must bear in mind the additional fact that the legis - lative body was dealing with conditions different from any that have heretofore existed. Under such circumstances the system of trial and error must be used. It is only natural that some of the legislation passed would be held void by the courts, but this in itself gave the opportunity to redraft that legislation along lines that would meet the l-equirements of the Constitution. How - ever, the defense of these legislative acts and the redrafting of laws that were declared void by the court thi-ew a heavy ad - ditional burden upon the Attorney General's office. After the Suprem3 Court held the original Old Age Pension Act to be void, the duty fell upon the office of the Attorney General to draft new legislation for the assistance of the aged, the blind, the needy and crippled and dependent children. At the time this legislation was drafted there was little in the way of precedent which could be followed. A bill was drafted which was satisfactory to the Federal Social Security Board, and I believe will meet the requirements of the Nebraska Constitution. Under this Act the State of Nebraska has been able to give much needed assistance to its aged, its needy, and to its unfortunate children. Aside from the ordinary business that must be handled by this office, a great deal of extra work has fallen upon the members of my staff in construing the liquor control act and the state assistance act. Both of these laws were new. and many legal problems connected therewith had to be settled. The legislature. in setting up the unicameral legislature, also threw an extra burden upon this office. Much important litigation has been handled by the Attorney General during the past two years. Most of this litigation has been completed with satisfacrory results. However, the case which most vitally affects the entire state is still pending and unfinished. I refer to the interstate irrigation suit brought by this state against Wyoming and Colorado. I consider this case to be most important legal action' that has ever been brought by the State of Nebraska. The entire future of a large portion of the State hinges upon our success or failure in this action. At the present time two hearings have been held in which a vast amount of testimony was presented. Another hearing is scheduled to begin March 1, 1937. The case as it now stands is in splendid shape. We have been able to proceed at a much faster </seg>
            <seg id="p009">report of Attorney general rate than is ordinarily done in cases of this kind. We have been able to conduct this suit up to the present time with a minimum of expense. It must be remembered, however, that as yet we have not been required to (pay any fees to the Special Master appointed by the United States Supreme Court. These fees wily probably be assessed against the three states by the court during the next biennium. (in addition to the Master's fees it will be necesary during the coming biennium for Nebraska to pay its share of the printed record that is furnished to the Court. The expense of holding hearing:;, the salary and expenses of cur ex - pert engineer, the fees anc expenses of counsel to conduct the suit will continue during th'e coming biennium. It will be neces - sary that an adequate appropriation be made in order to carry on with this suit and to pay the expenses set out above. I recom - mend not less than $75,000,00 for the biennium. This seems like a large sum. and it is, but compared to the amount involved in the suit, and compared to Lts importance to Nebraska, it is very small. During the past bienn urn a vigorous fight has been carried on by this office against thje unauthorized and unethical practice of law. We have attempted to stamp out such unethical practices as jambulance chasing, and have also attempted to prevent persons who are not qualified to act as attorneys from attempting to give legal advice and engage in the law business. The purpose behind our activities along this line is to give protection to the people of the State of Nebraska from unscrupulous and unethical lawyers, arid to preserve the dignity of the courts of our state. Our success along this line has been good up to the present time. However, the field for work of this kind is so great that we were hardly able to scratch the surface. A good beginning has been made, and I sincerely hope that this work will be carried on in the future. As an example of the vast amount of work performed by the Attorney General's office in the past biennium, I wish to call your attention to the fact that 'this office has participated in 625 law - suits during that time. Of this number 3 matters were in the United States Supreme Court; 11 in the United States District Court; 108 in the State Supreme Court; 144 in the District Courts of the State; 305 in County Courts; 38 in the compensation court and 7 in municipal and justice courts; and 9 before the Interstate Commerce Commission. Practically all of this work has been handled by the regular staff of assistants. We have employed out - side counsel in very few cases. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS Appointment of Attorney General: There has been considerable agitation of late to provide for a constitutional amendment making the office of Attorney General an appointive office rather than an elective one. The suggestions that have been made to date provide for the appointment of the Attorney General by the Governor. I am in hearty accord with the idea of making the office of the Attorney General an appointive one. I differ with the suggestions that have been made up to the present time, in that I do not feel the Governor is the proper person to appoint this officer. Rather, I am of the opinion that if the Attorney General is to be appointed the Supreme Court is the only proper body to make such an appointment. This conclusion is based upon the following propositions: First. The Attorney Generals office should be non-political. The Attorney General is the legal adviser to all state officers and he also gives legal advice to many county officials. The opinions given by him should not be colored by his political beliefs. He should base his opinion upon what is the law rather than what he may think to be good politics. Many of the officers to whom the Attorney General acts as legal adviser may not belong to the same political party as does the Attorney General. Such officers are entitled to an unbiased, independent opinion, entirely free from political influences. The Supreme Court is elected on a non-political ballot. The past record of this court demonstrates that it has conducted its own affairs without regard to politics. An Attorney General appointed by this body would not owe allegiance to any political group by reason of his appointment. His only duty would be to perform his work well and efficiently. If he failed in this, he could be removed, but he would not be removed under any circumstances because of his politics. Such an Attorney General could pass upon all questions submitted to him for his decision in an independent and impartial manner. Second. An Attorney General should be entirely independent of any outside influence, political or otherwise. If he were to be appointed by the Governor, there is apt to be a tendency on his part to arrive at his decisions in accordance with the wishes of the party who appointed him. For example,— if the Governor should be advocating or sponsoring any particular type of legislation </seg>
            <seg id="p011">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL the Attorney General might feel that loyalty required him to give, an opinion on the validity of such legislation which upheld the ideas of the Governor who appointed him. Such an Attorney General would not be able to give an opinion independent of all outside influences. Then, too, it could be possible, as has been demonstrated in other statejs, for a Governor to demand that his appointee prepare opinions in keeping with the views of the Governor. In other words, [there is a possibility that an Attorney General who was appointed by the Governor might be nothing more than the Governor's "yes man". His opinions might be merely the Governor's opinions given over the signature of the Attorney General. Such a condition would not be possible if the Attorney General were to be appointed by the Supreme Court. Third. Under the present; Constitution the Governor and the Attorney General are members on the Pardon Board, the Board of Educational Lands and Funds and the State Assistance Board. If the Attorney General were to be appointed by the Governor and still remained as a member of such Boards, the effect would be the giving of an additional vote to the Governor in the conduct of the affairs of such Boards. Either through fear of removal, or through loyalty to the person responsible for his appointment, there would be a strong tendency on the part of the Attorney General to vote with the Governor, or to adopt the Governor's views. On the Pardon Board, for instance, where there are only three members, such a system would make it possible for the Governor to have full power to grant or to deny pardons to inmates of the penal institutions. The present Pardon Board was created in order to take away from the Governor his pardoning powers and the effect of the constitutional amendment setting up the present Pardon Board might be destroyed by making the Attorney General the appointee of the Governor. An Attorney General who was appointed by the Court would act entirely independent of the Governor and the objec - tions raised in the foregoing paragraph could not. exist. Fourth. The laws of a few states at the present time provide that the Attorney General shall be appointed by the Governor. From the information that I can gather, the system is not work - ing out satisfactorily in those states, for many of the reasons that I have set out heretofore. | ■ Fifth. The Supreme Court has a better opportunity to know which lawyers within the state are capable of handling the work </seg>
            <seg id="p012">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL in the Attorney General's office than has a Governor. Practically all lawyers within the- state at some time or other appear before the Court. Some of them many times. No one person or group of persons could better be able to know which lawyers in the state had sufficient ability properly to conduct the Attorney General's office. The Supreme Court's decision would rot be based upon a patronage proposition, and would, necessarily, be based solely upon the ability of the appointee. PARDON BOARD I am not entirely satisfied with the present set-up of the Board of Pardons and Paroles. As the Board now is constituted, it is composed of three elective state officers. — the Governor, the Secretary of State and the Attorney General. All of these officers have so many other duties to perform that they cannot devote an adequate amount of time to the matters of pardon and parole. The individual members of this Board cannot, through lack of time, go to the penitentiary oivother penal institutions in order to interview the inmates confined therein. The only op - portunity that is afforded the members of the Board of seeing and talking to applicants for a pardon or parole is at the hearing held for that purpose. At those hearings the Board members do not get an opportunity to talk to such applicants for over ten or fifteen minutes at the most. From this brief interview, and from a consideration of the prisoner's past record, the Board must determine whether or not it desires to release a prisoner on parole. In a matter as vital as is the question of whether or not an inmate of a penal institution should be released, more first-hand knowledge on the part of the Board members is necessary in order to arrive at a correct de - cision. The record of the present Board, insofar as parole violations are concerned, is exceedingly good. I am somewhat inclined to think we have been extremely lucky and that our luck may not last forever. A constitutional amendment would be required to make any changes in the present set-up relating to pardons and paroles. It may 'be that a constitutional amendment is not desired at this time. If not, some provision should be made to provide greater efficiency in parole matters, and to enable the individual mem - bers of the Parole Board an opportunity to pass upon applications for pardon and parole in a more intelligent manner. </seg>
            <seg id="p013">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ! At the present time we employ one parole officer. It is his duty to select prisoners who may come before the Board for hearing on the question as to whether or not they should be re - leased. This parole officer is also supposed to supervise all prisoners that have been released by the Board while such prisoners are on parole. In addition to this, he must run the office of the Board of Pardons and Paroles. One man cannot do all of this work. We should employ at least two additional parole officers, whose duty it should be to maintain a strict supervision over all paroled prisoners. Such men could aid and assist the parolees, and through such aid and assistance could prevent many parole violations and future criminal acts. I find that Nebraska is far behind other states in the supervision of persons who have been paroled from penal institutions. ■ : Due to the lack of an adequate force in the office of the Board of Pardons and Paroles, many prisoners on parole violate their parole agreement, but the parole board never learns of such violations. It seems to me that it is the duty of the state to its citizens that an adequate supervision of paroled prisoners bo maintained. Such a supervision would prevent many law viola - tions by parolees and would, therefore, furnish greater protection than is now furnished to the law abiding citizens of the state. It seems to me that the people of the state are entitled to this protec - tion, and that we are not performing our duty to them when we do not take the necessary steps to afford them such protection. It will be necessary to appropriate a greater sum of money to the Board of Pardons and Paroles than has been appropriated heretofore in order to provide an adequate staff of parole officers, but when we consider the fact that the property, and even the lives of the citizens of the state may be involved, we can come to no con - clusion other than that such an added appropriation would be justified. In addition to the employment of additional parole officers, the Board should employ at least one competent psychiatrist who should spend his enth-e time interviewing prisoners in our penal institutions who have applied for a pardon, parole or commutation of sentence. At the time; of the hearing held by the Board, such a person could furnish the Board members full information re - lating to the applicant, together with an expert opinion as to the mental or psychological makeup of such prisoner. Since the members of the Board cannot make this investigation themselves, Someone ought to be employed who can do it for them. </seg>
            <seg id="p014">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL REVISION OF STATUTES The statutes of this state have not been revised since 191?. Since that time a great deal of legislation has been passed and placed upon the statute books. In countless instances we have in our statutes several laws that are in direct conflict with each other. In many cases new laws have been passed which in e!7 ect either amend or repeal existing statutes, yet such new laws make no provision for such amendment or repeal. Both the old and the new laws become a part of our statutes, even though they conflict with each other. Such a situation causes confusion in the administration of our laws. To avoid this confusion, a complete revision of cur statutes is necessary. Under a revision of the statutes old and out moded laws could be eliminated completely. Where a conflict exists, the law could be made uniform. In cases of uncertainty as to the meaning cr legal effect of a law, such uncertainty could be cured. Our laws would be made more uniform and more intelligible. I earnestly recommend that the coming legislature make provision for a complete revision of our statutes. CRIMINAL LAWS I recommend that the next legislature pass the following uniform criminal laws sponsored by the Uniform Law Conference: (1) The close pursuit law, which enables officers of one state in which a crime has been committed to pursue the party suspect - ed of the crime across state lines for the purpose of making an arrest, provided they are in close pursuit of such party at the time they cross the state line; and (2) The law permitting witnesses resident in another state to be subpoenaed by this state and brought into the boundaries of this state for the purpose of furnishing testimony in criminal cases. CONCLUSION I have attempted to summarize herein the work that has been done by this office in the past two years, and to offer my own suggestions of improvements that could be made in our state government by future legislation and constitutional amendments. I feel some pride in the manner in which the Attorney General's office has functioned during the past biennium. Probably a majority of the credit for the work done should go to the men who have acted as Assistant Attorneys General during that time. </seg>
            <seg id="p015">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL namely: George W. Ayres, Paul P. Chaney, Milton C. Murphy, William C. Ramsey, Daniel Stubbs, Edwin Vail and C. G. Perry, Special Assistant Attorney General in charge of Irrigation. These men have demonstrated that they possess a thorough knowledge of the law, as well as a high degree of ethics. They have done their work willingly and tirelessly. In order to handle the large amount of work that is performed in this office, they have been compelled to devote many of their nights and week - ends to the performance of their tasks. They have done this of their own accord, without complaint. The fact that I have been able to conduct this office, and to end my term with a substantial saving for the state of Nebraska, has been due to the willingness of these men to devote extra time to their job. Respectfully submitted, WM. H. WRIGHT, Attorney General of the State of Nebraska. </seg>

            <seg id="p028">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL PRICE DISCRIMINATION June 22, 193G. Honorable Stratton Shartel, Kansas City, Missouri. This will acknowledge our receipt of your letter dated June 20 wherein you advise that the Omaha Bakery branch of your company plans to submit bids for the furnishing of bread to certain Citizens Con - servation Camps in Nebraska. You present the question of whether our statute requires that the prices submitted by you for furnishing bread at each of the several camps be the same. Eliminating the question of the cost of transportation of the bread from the bakery to the camp, it is our opinion that our statute requires that your bid be the same for each camp to be supplied. The remaining exception in our statute is the right to meet local competition. Because the bid is a competitive one until all bids are open, we do not believe that you could possibly anticipate local competition so as to make your bid identical with the local bidder provided the bid of the local dealer was the lowest bid submitted at any of the camps upon which you were bidding. PAUL P. CHANEY. Assirtant Attorney General. ANTIDISCRIMINATION December 31. 1035. Mr. Dan Rennick, New York, N. Y. You have asked for an opinion as to whether the State of Nebraska has a law which prohibits the sale or purchase of merchandise by the same individual for different prices in different localities. Section 59-501, Comp. Stat. Neb. 1929, which is our local discrimin - ation Statute, provides in substance that any person, firm or company, association or corporation, foreign or domestic, doing business in the State of Nebraska and engaged in the production, manufacture or dis - tribution of any commodity in general use. that shall intentionally, for the purpose of destroying the business of a competitor in any locality, discriminate between different sections, communities, or cities of this state by selling such commodity at a lower rate in one section, community or city, than is charged for said commodity by said party in another section, community or city, after making due allowance for the dif- </seg>

PAUL P. CHANEY, Assistant Attorney General. | ■ ■ ■ ■ . . FOREIGN COMMERCIAL TRUCK LICENSE February 9, 1935. Joseph A. Mrazek Moving &amp; Storage Co., Inc., St. Louis, Mo. Replying to your letter of February 5, in which you inquire as to the laws of Nebraska regarding the hauling of household goods for the house - holder in and through this state, would advise that we have adopted the • theory of reciprocity by statute. Section 60-302 Comp. Stat. Neb. Supp. 1933 requires that foreign trucks doing either an interstate or intra-state business shall be required to com - ply with all laws and regulations imposed on Nebraska trucks, and to pay all license, permit and ether lees which Nebraska truckers are required to pay, unless the state or states in which such foreign trucks are domiciled grant reciprocity comparable to that extended bv the laws of Nebraska. In case there is no reciprocity, foreign commercial trucks will have to pay the same fees and licenses as Nebraska trucks have to pay in their home states. Foreign trucks doing intra-state business must pay the same fees as local trucks. We do not know what laws Missouri has in this regard and you should consult a local attorney in that regard, in order to learn whether there would be reciprocity. The registration fee charged on commercial trucks in Nebraska is based upon the load to be hauled. It applies to tractor and semi-trailer units, ihe same as an ordinary truck. The rates are: For a half ton truck $ 4.00 One ton : 8.00 One and one-half tons : ..: 12.00 Two tons 15.00 Two and one-half tons : 25.00 Three tons 45.00 Four tons 60.00 Four and one-half tons 75.00 Five tons ...

McKnight, County Attorney, Auburn, Nebraska. You ask whether the law authorizes a prosecution for using a truck with a farm license only as a commercial truck. We suggest that a prosecution may be had for operating a truck com - mercially on the highways without a license therefor and without paying the fee therefor, even though the truck is licensed as a farm truck. As you suggest, section 39-1037 provides a penalty for violations of Chapter 60, Article 3. Section 60-328 provides that any truck operated outride of the limits of the classification for which it is licensed shall be classified as a commercial truck. Section (50-302, C. S. S. 1935 requires the owner to make application to register his truck and section 60-328 requires that in the case of a commercial truck the fees shall be in definite amounts. The use of a commercial truck without a commercial licence, regardless of the fact that it is licensed under another classification, seems to us to be a violation of the sections referred to so that a prosecution may be laid by authority of section 39-1037. DANIEL STU3BS, Assistant Attorney General. S. F. 230 Lincoln, Nebraska, September 12, 1935. Honorable A. C. Tilley, State Engineer, Building. You inquire whether certain motor vehicles must obtain Nebraska licenses when using Nebraska highways. In the various classes the answers are as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p031">OPINIONS 1. A ncn-reddent dealer driving cars through this state in order to elTect delivery to some point outside the state must obtain a Nebraska license under section 60-302, as amended. 2. The same dealers towing a car across this state are required to obtain a license and pay the fees upon the car being towed as well as upon the towing car in addition to the towing permit duty. Section 60-302, as amended. 3. Dealers doing business within this state and driving a new car into the state in order to effect delivery within the state need pay no fees except the towing fee and are permitted to use an "In Transit" car license upon which the registration number of said dealer must be shown. 4. Motor vehicles being hauled into V&gt;r through the state when loaded entirely on another truck require no special fees and should be treated as so much merchandise. The transporting truck must of course be properly licensed. DANIEL STUBBS, Assistant Attorney General. . ■ ■ ■ ■/•■'■ .■.■.." ■ ■. ■ . ; May 2, 1936. Mrs. M. G. Tracy, Department of Roads &amp; Irrigation. You ask for our opinion as to the terms and conditions and proper procedure for the cancellation of a motor vehicle operator's license when the operator is convicted of driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. In the first place, let me state as simply and as forcefully as I know how that section 60-603, C. S. S. 1935 has absolutely no connection and no application to the subject of driving a motor vehicle while intoxicated or to any other of the criminal offenses named in section 60-602, C. S. S. 1935. Section 60-603 applies only in case of a judgment "for damages on account of personal injury, including death, or damage to property * * *." The judgment which may be satisfied in thirty days under that section refers only to a civil judgment for damages. You will notice that section 60-602 says nothing whatever about satisfaction of the kind of judgment which is a conviction of the offenses named therein and a sentence imposed in accordance therewith. There - fore, under that section, upon conviction of the named offenses and j. dg - ment thereon, no satisfaction of the judgment will stay the suspension of the license and the necessity of proof of financial responsibility before the license may again be issued. </seg>
            <seg id="p032">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL The proof of financial responsibility required under section 60-602 is defined and described in section 60-604, which I take it it is not necessary for me to elaborate on. You inquire further whether the operator's license may be revoked under section 39-1106 for the first or second offense or only for the third offense. The license may be revoked for the first offense and for the second offense. Although I have previously told you in conversation with Mrs. Tripp that this was my construction of the law, I find the Supreme Court has considered the question and agrees with me and places the matter beyond any doubt. Smith v. State, 124 Neb. 587. It is true that prior to the enactment of section 60-602 in 1931 that proof of financial responsibility could not be required before the reissue of a license cancelled by reason of a conviction of the offense of driving a motor vehicle while intoxicated. DANIEL STUBBS, Assistant Attorney General. PERMIT TO HAUL LIVESTOCK. SECTION 60-701. C. S. S. 1935. I- .. February 27. 1936. Mr. Allan F. Black, County Attorney, Broken Bow, Nebraska. You inquire whether section 60-701, C. S. S. 1935, requires an owner carrying his own livestock to have a permit as required in that section made out by himself before he commences his trip. The language of the section is all inclusive and we believe that it was intended to cover an owner as well as every body else. If not, it would be possible for one to evade the law by asserting that he was an owner when - ever he was stopped and when he sold the stock at market. We therefore agree with your interpretation. DANIEL STUBBS, Assistant Attorney General. FARM TRUCKS April 1, 1935. Mr. Frank B. Morrison, Stockville, Nebr. The questions contained in your letter of March 26, can only be answered by application of the statutory definition of farm trucks, contained in sec- </seg>
            <seg id="p033">OPINIONS ■ I ■ tion 39-1036 Comp. Stat. Suppl. 1933, under the facts and circumstances of each particular case. With this in mind we shall attempt to answer your questions in the order given. ■ i . ■ .■.'.■■ .. • ' ■'"■•.- ■ . ■ 1. Does exchanging work mean the exchange of trucking work or can one farmer haul for another in exchange for hoeing his garden, helping him pick corn, milking his cows, etc.? In our opinion this section of the statute would be construed to mean the exchange of trucking work, hauling supplies to the farm or the pro - ducts of the farm to market or storage, and would not be extended to work such as tho examples given. 2. Is the farmer's own product that which is produced on the farm, or any products which the farmer may buy and resell? The answer to this question depends upon whether or not the owner of the truck is actually engaged in farming or ranching or is merely engaged in the buying and selling of live stock. If the former, the mere fact that he may not keep stock which he purchases more than a few days in some instances, should not require him to obtain other than a farm truck license. If the latter, the mere fact that a man may be engaged in farming does not authorize him to engage in the occupation of buying and selling live stock and claiming an exemption from purchasing a commercial truck license. We would say that live stock becomes the farmer's own produce, within the meaning of this act, when he acquires it for the purpose of development in his farming or ranching operations, and not for the mere purpose of speculation or immediate resale. 3. What constitutes hauling produce to his own farm? Can a farmer buy machinery and haul it to his place for resale? The statute permits the hauling of supplies to the owner's farm or ranch and shall not extend to the hauling of machinery there for the sole purpose of resale, or to any other mere device to avoid the purchase of a commercial license. i No general rule can be laid down which will have uniform application in a community such as yours. The question is whether or not the truck is mainly used in farming or ranching operations, and as stated 'above, this depends upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case. We know of no Nebraska cases in which our Supreme Court has interpreted this act. MILTON C. MURPHY, Assistant Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p034">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL USE OF FOREIGN DEALER PLATES IN NEBRASKA June 23, 1936. Honorable A. C. Tilley. State Engineer. Your inquire whether a dealer in motor vehicles licensed in another state may operate a car in Nebraska on the dealer's registration plates issued by the other siate without a Nebraska registration. The applicable statute seems to be section GO-302, C. S. S. 1035. which requires every owner of a motor vehicle operated in this state to regi' tor the car here with the following exception: "• * the display of registration numbers shall not be construed to apply to any motor vehicle owned by a non-resident of this state ex - cept vehicles moved over the highways of this state on .their own wheels for the purpose of exchange, sale or offering the same for ?ale to or by an agent, dealer, purchaser or prospective purchaser, or for delivery after sale or for storage prior to rple. if the owner thereof shall have complied with the provisions of the law of the state of which he is ;i resident, relative to the registration thereof • *." It is immediately appaient that the exception to non-rrer idcr.ts does hoi apply to cars transported for rale or when tha cars are offered for talc. Dealers cars licensed as such are ordinarily demonstrated for sale and ii that is the case we think it clear that the car must bo registered in thi r state. It is possible that the foreign dealer does not offer the car he is operating for sale. In that case, the law of the foreign .state must be examined to see. first, if he is permitted to drive under a dealer's licence for any purpose except to demonstrate the car for sale. In this state seel ion 60-319, C. S. S. 1935, under which dealers' licenses are granted, forbids the use of the car to licensed for the personal or private purpose of the dealer. If this is Ix'uc in Iowa or any other state the use of the car not offered for sale by a dealer under a deajer's- license is a non-compliance with the foreign law and consequently cannot be recognized here. Secondly, assuming all the conditions to be met. it must be determined if a dealer's license is a registration of the particular car being driven for it is only a car properly registered in a foreign state that is exempt from registration in this state. If the dealer's license in a foreign state is like the Nebraska dealer's license, no particular car is registered but a license is granted the dealer which he may use on any car. In such a case the non - resident dealer must register in Nebraska. If all these conditions be met, we believe a non-resident may operate on a dealer's license.

Colorado and therefore Nebraska exempts trucks carrying only Roods owned and manufactured by the owner of- the truck. In our opinion the goods referred to in the case ol" H. A. Marr Grocery Company under the arrangements above outlined are not manufactured by H. A. Marr Company but by some one else. The company is nothing but a distributor and certainly not a manufacturer. The license tax should oc imposed. If and when and upon satisfactory showing that Nebraska trucks under the same circumstances would be granted exemption in Colorado, a truck Irom that state would be exempt here. As the ruling and information now stands, the contrary is true. DANIEL STUBBS, Assistant Attorney General. . '• ; SECTIONS (iO-322, 324, 60-319, 60-306. TEN-DAY PLACARD QN AUTOS AND "IN TRANSIT" CARDS March 28. 1930. Mr. Lloyd L. Pospishil, County Attorney, Schuyler. Nebraska. I acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 27th, relating to the prosecution in your county for operating a car without proper license plates displayed thereon. I have examined the statutes relating to the-registration of automobiles and have come to the conclusion that there is no ten-day period during which a purchaser may drive an automobile without having received regis - tration certificate and license plates. Section 60-319, C. S. 1929, as you point out, did give that right. However, when that act was amended and as the act now stands, the privilege of driving a car for ten days by the use of pasteboard cards issued by the dealer was withdrawn. That section constituted the only authority by which a person was authorized to operate a car for ten days after the purchase by the use of such cardboard cards. Since that section has been amended and that privilege has been withdrawn, lhat right no longer exists. Unless there is some other statute permitting </seg>
            <seg id="p036">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL operation of a car by the use of cardboard cards, a party would net be authorized to do so. While it is true that Sections G0-30G, 60-310 and 60-311, C. S. 1929, make reference to a registration within ten days after purchase, I construe these sections to mean merely that a party, whether he uses the car or not. must obtain his registration certificate within ten days after purchase or pay a penalty of $1.00. I do not construe these sections to give any permission to operate such a car on the streets or roads during such ten-day period. As I construe the law, it is necessary for a person to immediately obtain a registration certificate and license plates if he intends to use his car on the highways. In any event, the party being prosecuted by you would not have the right to use "in transit" on a cardboard card. Section 60-319, 1935 Supple - ment to C. S. 1929, provides that the use of the words "in transit" is to be made only in case where a dealer: "desiring to effect delivery of any motor vehicle bought or sold by him, from the point where purchased or sold to points within this state or outside this state, may, solely for the purpose of such delivery by himself, agent or bona fide purchaser, drive such motor vehicle on the highways of this state without charge or registration of such vehicle. Provided, there shall be permanently displayed on the front and rear of each vehicle a white cardboard placard or sign on which shall be plainly printed in black letter; not lesy than four inches high the words "In Transit." " This section further provides: "Provided further, however, that no in transit cards or dealers' license plates shall be issued or used for any purpose other than in conjunction with the bona fide purchase or sale of motor vehicles by dealers regularly engaged in such business within this state and regularly maintaining a place of business for such purchase within this state." As I see it, the party attempting to use "in transit" placards would not fall within the provisions of the statute above quoted. In this case the delivery of the car had actually been made. The car was no longer in transit. Such person could not properly use such cards under these circum - stances. It is, therefore, my opinion that prosecution under Sections 60-322 and GO-324, C. S. 1929, is proper under the circumstances outlined in your letter. \VM. H. WRIGHT. Attorney General. </seg>

In my opinion a fee of $3.00 is required regardless of the time of the &gt; ear the plates are requested. The sentence which authorizes the issuance of additional plates contains no language justifying the implication that the fee is reduced during the latter part of the year. In other instances it is expressly stated and the absence of any language to that effect in this case leads to the conclusion that the legislature did not intend to provide a i eduction in fee.

It is provided by Section 60-319, Compiled Statutes, as amended in 1933, that "Any person conducting the business of buying, selling or dealing in motor vehicles, and having received a license therefor, shall before removing any one or more of his places of business, or before opening any additional place of business, apply to the Department of Public Works and obtain a supplemental license, for which no fee shall be charged." </seg>

As to the county within which licenses should be procured by persons resident on the military reservation, will say, that although the United States Government owns this property, it u not for that reason taken out of the boundaries of the counties within which it is geographically located, particularly since jurisdiction for civil or criminal process is retained in those counties. It is our judgment that so much of the military reservation as lies within Sicux C-junty is to be regarded as a part of that county so far as the adiri i t. alive laws of the state are applicable therein, and a like situation exi ts with regard to that portion of the military reservation which lies within Dnv.es County.

Can a county treasurer issue an automobile license to a party if no bill of sale for the automobile has been given? 12. Can a county treasurer issue an automobile license to a non-resideni of the county? 1 I jhnll answer your questions in tho order above stated. First, an examination of our Motor Vehicle Registration Law, and particularly of sections GO-308, 60-310, 60-311, and 60-325, of the Comp. Stat. of Nebr. 1929, and of Section 60-306, C. S. Suppl. 1935, will disclose that one object of the law is to record the ownership of the motor vehicle iticlf. The registration certificate issued to the applicant contains a form on its reverse side which, in case of transfer of the vehicle, is to be signed by 'both the transferer and the transferee. The Department of Roads and Irrigation is, furthermore, cautioned not to register a motor vehicle in tht name of the transferee if it is not satisfied of the genuineness of the transfer. Arid, in fact, title to a motor vehicle does not pass until the transfer is evidenced by the signatures of both parties on the reverse side of the registration certificate and the certificate itself is filed in the Department cf Roads and Irrigation. In re Estate of Wroth, 125 Neb. 832. And in case of new purchases it is provided that the transfer must be made upon an ap - proved transfer form. As it is necessary that an applicant for registration exhibit the foregoing evidence of ownership, it is our opinion that a county </seg>
            <seg id="p044">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ■ treasurer may not grant a license to a party if no bill of sale (a proporly executed transfer on reverse side of registration certificate) has been given. Second, Section 60-302, C. S. Suppl. 1935, provides that: "Every owner of a motor vehicle shall • • • make application ioi registration on a blank to be furnished by the county treasurer of the county in which the owner resides, * * •." And by Section 39-1106, C. S. Suppl. 1935, it is made a misdemeanor for one to apply for or take out motor vehicle registration in a county other than the one in which one resides, maintains a legal residence, or conducts a bona fide business. The foregoing provisions incline us to the opinion that a county treasurer may not grant a license to a resident of the state who is a non-resident ol the county unless such non-resident conducts a bona fide business within the county. This should not be construed to mean, however, that a county treasurer may not grant a license to a non-resident of the state who does not conduct a bona fide business within the county, as distinguished from a resident oi the state who is a non-resident of the ccunfy and who does not conduct a bona fide business within the county, as the statutes provide that ron - residents of the state must, in tome instances, register their motor vehicle! - in this state. Such provisions have been enacted with reference to ITUitct' vehicles which are moved across the highways of this state for purpos3s oi sale or delivery, and with reference to trucks and busses from states which do not grant reciprocity comparable to that extended by the laws of this state.

What charges do the laws of this state impose for driving one car and towing another car across the state? 2. What charges do the laws of this state impose for driving a car through Nebraska to a dealer in Washington if the car carries an individual Washington license for the year 1936? </seg>

(2) towing, or (3) being driven through the state? 5. Is it necessary to buy a Nebraska license also if the car carries Washington "dealer plates?" ; 6. Do the laws of this state impose any taxes or charges upon motor vehicles which are towed (or used as towing vehicles) through this state other than the regular towing fee and license for each car? i I shall answer your questions in the order in which they have been stated above. First, by Section 60-302, Compiled Statutes Supplement, 1935, it is provided that a non-resident motor vehicle owner, owning a foreign vehicle which has been duly registered for the current calendar year in the state of which the owner is a resident, and which at all times, when operated in this state, has displayed upon it the number plate or plates issued for such vehicle in the place of residence of such owner, may operate or permit the operation of such vehicle within the state .without registering such vehicle or paying any fees to this state. By further provisions of this section, it is provided that the above exception shall not be applicable to vehicles moved over the highways of this state on their own wheels for the purpose of ex - change, sale or offering the same for sale to or by any agent, dealer, purchaser or prospective purchaser, or for delivery after sale or for storage prior to sale. This section also provides that the above exception shall not be ap - plicable to trucks and busses except insofar as the domiciliary state of such truck or bus shall grant reciprocity comparable to the laws of this state. By Section 60-801, Compiled Statutes Supplement, 1935, it is provided that anyone desiring to tow or pull any motor truck or passenger car upon the highways of this state must apply to the County Treasurer for a permit so to do. If the trip is one originating in a foreign state, it is provided that the application for the necessary permit shall be made to the County Treasurer of the County in this state in which the applicant enters this state on such trip. This section further provides that the application shall be accompanied by a fee of ten dollars ($10.00) for each vehicle to be towed. 1. That a motor vehicle moved over the highways of this state on its own wheels for the above observed purposes is subject to the laws of this state pertaining to registration. From an examination of the foregoing provisions one observes: 2. That a fee of ten dollars ($10) must be paid for each vehicle which one desires to tow upon the highways of this state. </seg>
            <seg id="p046">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL It would appear, therefore, that the charges imposed by the laws of this state for driving one car and towing another car across this state would be as follows: (a) Ten dollars ($10) for the vehicle towed. &gt; (b) A registration fee for the vehicle towed, which would vary with the size of the vehicle. The following data may be suggestive: 1. Three dollars (S3) for motor vehicles having an advertised ship - ping weight of less than 2800 pounds: 2. Five dollars ($5) above 2800 pounds; 3. Eight dollars (S8) for ambulances and hearses (c) If the towing vehicle were duly registered in the domiciliary state it would not be necessary to register it here if it were not' moved across the highways of this state for any of the purposes enumerated in Section 60-302, supra. Second, we have observed that Section 60-302, Compiled Statutes Sup - plement. 1935, does not except foreign vehicles from its provisions if .such . vehicles are moved over the highways of this state on their own wheels for the purpose of exchange, sale or offering the same for sale to or by any agent, dealer, purchaser, or prospective purchaser, or for delivery after sale or for storage prior to sale. If a car were driven through Nebraska for delivery to a dealer in Washington, it would be our opinion, therefore that it would be necessary that that car be registered in this state. Third. Section GQ-330, Compiled Statutes Supplement, 1935. provide - that the registration fee for motor vehicles having an advertised shipping weight of less than 2800 pounds shall be S3. Fourth, we have observed that it is necessary that a car be registered in this state if it is moved across the highways of this state for the purposes enumerated in Section 60-302, supra. If a car were towed across theZvh - ways of this state for the purpose therein enumerated, it would be necessarv to register it in this state. The same would be true with reference to a towing vehicle. And the same would be true with reference to a vehicle being driven through the state. Fifth, if the car is moved over the highways of this state for any of the purposes enumerated in Section 60-302, supra, it would be necessary that- it be registered in this state. However, if the car were not moved for such purposes, we are inclined to the opinion that registration in this state would not be necessary ,f full compliance were had with the laws of the dom - icihary state. </seg>

You also state that the laws of your state require an applicant to turn in! the certificate of title when an application for a motor vehicle license is made; that the license plates and a receipt of application are issued im - mediately, but that the registration card is not issued until approximately thirty (30 ) days thereafter, or until the certificate of title has been carefully checked: and that it is lawful to operate a motor vehicle in your state upon the issuance of the receipt of application but prior to the issuance of the icsistration card itself. Upon the foregoing facts, you ask if the laws of this state would permit you to pass through this state if the receipt of application has been issued to you but before you have received your registration card, or would it be necessary for you to register your car in this state I Section 60-302, Compiled Statutes Supplement, 1935. provides in part as follows: "A non-resident owner, * * *, owning any foreign vehicle which has been duly registered for the current calendar year in the state, county or other place of which the owner is a resident, and which at all times, when operated in this state, has displayed upon it the number plate or plates issued for such vehicle in the place of resi - dence of such owner, may operate or permit the operation of such vehicle within the state without registering such vehicle or paying any fees to this state." From a consideration of the foregoing language, it is our opinion thai the laws of this state would permit you to pass through this state before you actually obtained your registration card, if the receipt of application and the registration plates have been issued to you, and if the vehicle were not moved for a purpose enumerated in Section 60-302, supra.

What penalties are provided for the violation of the foregoing laws? I shall answer your questions in the order above stated. First. The laws of this state impose a fee of ten dollars ($10.00) for each vehicle towed across the highways of this state. In addition thereto i&lt; would be necessary that the owner of a vehicle moved over the highways of this state on its own wheels for the purpose of exchange, sale or offering for sale, or for delivery after sale or storage prior to sale, register such vehicle in this state and pay the prescribed registration fee. This registration fee would vary with the size and nature of the vehicle. Second. The laws of this state do not prescribe that a certain wage be paid the drivers of towing vehicles. Third. The laws of this state do not require that a non-resident drivel of a towing car procure a motor vehicle operator's license in this state if he is duly licensed in the state of his residence. This immunity does not. how - ever, extend beyond a period of thirty days continuous residence in this state. Fourth. Section 60-801, C. S.

Department of Banking, Building. You ask several questions concerning the method of transferring the assets of a bank whose charter expired some time ago to a new bank to succeed it. 1. Where considerable of the assets have been acquired after the expiration of the old charter the legal interest becomes vested in the directors and stockholders. No corporation exists in which title can vest. Since the corporation has held itself out as duly organized, however, I believe that the old corporation together with the directors and stockholders individually should execute a transfer and in the case of real estate the spouse, if any, of any stockholder should also join. , 2. One of the perplexing problems is whether any preferred rights are created against the assets so conveyed in favor of creditors who do not con - sent to the transfer. Of course, this problem can only arise in the event of the insolvency of the new corporation. If a creditor has dealt with the organization since its charter expired by dealing with his account or renew - ing a certificate of deposit in the case of a depositor, my opinion is that such a creditor could not claim a preferred status at a later time over depositors becoming such after the new bank is chartered. Any dealing with the organization is tantamount to consent. Of course, the creditor believes that the organization with which he deals is a banking corporation with the assets, officers, and other interested parties which will be true of the new banking corporation. In other words, the effect of the transfer will be to place the organization in exactly the situation which the creditor believed existed. </seg>
            <seg id="p050">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL In the case of a creditor whose credit arose before the expiration of the charter and who has not dealt with the bank since that time, it is possible that a liability may arise diflerent than that to other creditors becoming such aftci the formation of the new bank. The statute provides that upon the expira - tion of the term of a charter, the affairs of the corporation .shall be liquidated and creditors paid. Section 24-107, C. S. 1929. If this is not done but thi assets transferred to a new corporation without the consent of the creditor and the bank later becomes insolvent, obligations as (o such creditor ma) be raised which would place him in a preferred class. To obviate this we believe that the consent of such creditors should be obtained. 3. In an opinion of even date we are advising Mr. McLain that iIil transfer of assets, if sufficient to meet all reserve requirements, is adequate consideration for the issuance of stock in the new corporation. When propel articles and certificates have been adopted and approved, the assets trans - ferred with the above safeguards, all requirements as to the organization oi a new bank performed, and the new bank has assumed all the liabilities &lt;&gt;l the old as well as those of creditors who became such after the old chartci expired we believe that you will be justified in issuing a charter.

We beg to acknowledge receipt of the letter of February 1st addressed to you by George B. Wilson. Deputy Superintendent of the Department o Banking, wherein he says: "Would you kindly advise us if co-operative credit associations arc subject to capital stock tax; and, if so. on what basis?"

You ask our opinion as to the extent of the preference for a commercial bank charter given a cooperative credit association operating in the locality in which a charter for commercial bank is required. The particular question you raise is whether the preference granted by House Roll 258, 1935 session extends to a credit association which has not actually opened for business at the time a commercial bank charter is requested. 1 ■ '.;'■■■. The pertinent part of House Roll 258 provides that: "Provided that in towns where a cooperative credit association is now operating the stockholders of such association shall be given the first opportunity to secure a charter for a commercial bank." We do not believe that a cooperative credit association is operating prior to the time it actually opens for business. Prior to that time no busi - ness has been acquired of which they may be deprived. Therefore, we be - lieve the legislature intended that in order to obtain a preference all pro - visions of the statute relating to the organization of the association ihall have been fulfilled and business actually commenced. If the words were given any other meaning it is impossible to say where the line should be drawn or at what point the association could be said to be operating. </seg>

DANIEL STUBBS, Assistant Attorney General. EXEMPTION OF FEDERAL LAND BANK FROM STATE STATE GASOLINE TAX June 11, 1035 Federal Land Bank, Omaha, Nebraska. I have re-examined the question of the exemption of the Federal Land Bank of Omaha from the state gasoline tax as to gasoline used in motor vehicles owned by the Bank and my conclusion is that no exemption exists as to gasoline so used. The question turns both upon the nature of the Federal Land Bank and the nature of the tax. The tax is not a property tax nor a privilege tax imposed as a condition precedent to doing business. In this respect it is fur more remote a burden than that involved in Federal Land Bank v. Cro.ssland. 67 L. Ed. 703. Immunity from a gasoline tax which was imposed as a privilege tax was granted with great reluctance in Pan Handle Oil Co. v. Knox, 227 U. S. 218 in favor of a direct arm of the United States government, the Coast Guard and the Veterans Hospital. I do not believe the United States Supreme Court will extend the immunity to include a corporation which is not ex - clusively of a governmental nature in the case of an excise rather than a privilege tax. The tax is too remote. It seems clear that a Federal Land Bank is not exclusively a sovereign agency but serves in a dual capacity. In Federal Land Bank v. Prid&lt;ly. 79 Su. Ct. 709, Mr. Justice Stone observed: "In interpreting section 4, it is to be borne in mind that federal land banks, although concededly federal instrumentalities, possess also some of the characteristics of private business corporations. * * * The statute does not contemplate that their stock is to be wholly. or even chiefly government owned." Even though a federal instrumentality may have purposes of its own in addition, I do not understand that the doctrine of federal Instrumentalities will extend to a grant of immunity from an excise tax. The specific exemption from taxes, section 931, title 12, U. S. C. A., I believe to extend only to direct taxes and not to remote ones. It was in - tended by Congress only to declare the policy that the corporation should </seg>
            <seg id="p053">OPINIONS be a federal instrumentality insofar as it was possible. See 53 Cong. Rec. (&gt;961-6970. 7305-7318, 7372-7378. I believe the specific exemption by Con - gress 'rises no higher than the general exemption of a federal instrumentality. The tax must be direct and the agency an exclusive arm of the government. Ift addition lour cents of the five cent tax is used exclusively to main - tain the highways which the bank desires to use. Although the states may not impose tax burdens on interstate commerce where the revenue derived is used wholly to maintain the privilege used by the agency in interstate commerce the tax is valid as compensation for the privilege of using the convenience afforded by the state. Interstate Transit v. Lindsey, 75 L. Ed. 953 and cases in note thereto. Ii do not feel that we should recede from the opinion of this office of March 2. 1933.

Superintendent of Banks. Lincoln, Nebraska. In reply to your letter of May 31st, in which you request information regarding S. F. 123, which was approved on May 23, 1935, with reference to the provisions therein permitting the Issuance by banks of capital notes, we cjite to you from an opinion of Honorable Paul F. Good, former Attorney General, which deals with Section 11 of the act, and which we desire tc adopt as our own opinion, as follows: "Sec. 11. With the approval of the Superintendent of Bank;, any banking institution may at any time through action of its Board of Directors and without requiring any action of its stock - holders issue and sell its capital notes or debentures. Such capital notes or debentures shall be subordinate and subject to the claims of depositors and may be subordinated and subjected to the claims of other creditors. The capital stock of any commercial bank or trust company as such term 'capital stock' is used respectively in Sections 8-122 and 8-205. Compiled Statutes for 1929 and the capital of any savings bank as such term 'capital' is used in Sec - tion 8-123, Compiled Statutes for 1929 and the capital of any corporation transacting a banking business as the term 'capital' is used in Section 8-181, Compiled Statutes Supp., 1933, and the capital of a savings bank as the term 'capital' is used in Secticn 8-135. C. S. Supp., 1933, and the capital stock of any trust company </seg>
            <seg id="p054">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL as the term 'capital stock' is used in Section 8-215. C. S. Supp., 1933. shall be deemed to be unimpaired when the amount of such capital notes and debentures as represented by cash or sound assets ex - ceeds the impairment as found by the Department of Banking. Before any such capital notes or debentures are retired or paid by the banking institution any existing deficiency of its capital (dis - regarding the notes or debentures to be retired) must be paid in. in cash, to the end that the sound capital assets shall at least equal the capital or capital stock of the respective institutions above . named in the sense such terms 'capital' and 'capital stock' are used in the respective sections named. Such capital notes or de - bentures shall in no case be subject to any assessment. The holders of such capital notes or debentures shall not be held individually responsible as such holders for any debts, contracts, or engagements of such institution, and shall not be held liable for assessments to restore impairments in the capital of such institution." I am of the opinion that for all purposes connected with capital stock. such capital notes when so issued are to be treated as capital, and that they are to be treated as obligations of the bank only in the event of a liquidation of the bank or for purposes of distribution of net earnings or profits of the bank. As I understand the form of such capital notes as the Reconstruction Finance Corporation have been willing to take, they make provision J\.r their retirement out of net earnings and require the application of in t earnings for that purpose until the full amount has been paid; making provision that no distribution of net earnings to stockholders in the form of dividends or otherwise, shall be made so long as there is any unpaid principal or interest on such capital noter.. The description which I have just given of the terms ol the capital notes is based upon a recollection of having seen the form as then used, during the fall of 1933. It may be that some change has been made in the form or in the rules of the Reconstruction Finance Coiporation in th" meantime. I would suggest that you obtain information direct from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in that respect. With further reference to the relationship of capital notes issued under the provisons of Senate File 123 to the other banking statutes of the State of Nebraska, I wish to point out that the Attorney General of Nebraska op. October 7, 1933, gave an opinion to Honorable E. H. Luikart, Superintendent of Banks of the State of Nebraska, in relation to the use of capital notes in the rehabilitation of state banks by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. At that time there was no statute authorizing the issuance of such notes but in this opinion, the Attorney General gave the opinion that the issuance of such notes was permissible as being imp'.ied under the general powers </seg>
            <seg id="p055">OPINIONS conferred upon banking corporations. The Attorney General, however, further pointed out that under the provisons of Section 8-136 C. S. Supp., 1933, a limitation was placed upon the "re-discounts and bills payable of any corporation transacting a banking business in this state." and that the limit was placed at the amount of its capital and surplus. The opinion just re - ferred| to further pointed out that capital notes issued under the implied powers of banks would be treated as a part of the bills payable of the bank. I • . ■ ■ • For the reasons given in that opinion, the Superintendent of Banks at that time considered it inadvisable to authorize the issuance of capital notes, and the Banking Department in cooperation with the Reconstruction Finance Corporation provided a means of rehabilitation of weak banks by issuance of preferred stock which was pledged to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation as collateral instead of being purchased by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Although Senate File 12S does not refer to Section 8-136 C. S. Supp. 1933. above referred to, in my opinion the effect of Senate File 123 is to place capital notes in the class of capital stock or surplus for the purpose of said section 8-136 and the capital notes would be added to capital and sur - plus for the purpose of arriving at the amount of bills payable permisible rather than being themselves treated as bills payable. The relationship of the capital notes to the banking structure as covered by other sections of the Statute is taken care of expressly by the terms of Section 11 of Senate File 123, above quoted. In Sections 8-122 and 8-205 of the Compiled Statutes, provision is made for the amount of capital re - quired for banks and trust companies respectively in the various sizes of cities | and towns. By virtue of this legislative enactment, capital notes are treated as a part of the capital for this purpose. By the terms of Section 8-135. provision is made for powers of the Banking Department in case of impairment of reserves or capital, and by Section 8-181 provision is made for the Banking Department taking over a bank I if it becomes insolvent or the capital impaired. For these purposes the act provides that the capital notes shall be considered as a part of the capital of the bank. I i understand that one purpose for which you are considering the effect of this law is in relation to the rules of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corppration which prohibits a bank from receiving deposits in excess of ten times the amount of its capital (with which, no doubt, is included also the surplus). ! It is of course a matter for construction by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as to whether these capital notes would be treated as a part of the capital of the bank for that purpose. In view of the fact that both the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Reconstruction Finance </seg>
            <seg id="p056">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Corporation are agencies of the United States Government and work in close cooperation, I am strongly inclined to believe that if the Reconstruction Finance Corporation were to take these notes and they bore such conditions as above described, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation would treat them as a part of the capital structure of the bank. This would particularly be the case if, as I understand their form, they provided that they were not payable except out of surplus or net earnings. You have further asked whether these would be treated as capital in the sense provided by the Constitution as to double liability. I am quite - confident that they would not so be treated in view of the specific pro - vision in Section 11 of Senate File 123 to the effect that they are not to b, - subjected to double liability." In your letter you inquire whether these capital notes will b? subject to taxation In our opinion they will be subject to taxation under the pro - yisums of Sections 77-104 and 77-1437 C. S. Supp. 1930. However, in comput - ng the value of the capital stock for purposes of taxation, it is our opinion that share of the surplus or earning on hand at the time of making the tax return, which is subject to be applied to the redemption of capital notes of the bank should be deducted; as otherwise, there would be double taxation upon such share of the surplus or earnings. MILTON C. MURPHY. Assistant Attorney General. CO-OPERATIVE CREDIT ASSOCIATIONS September 17. 1335. Honorable B. N. Saunders, Superintendent, of Banking. Building.

            <seg id="p057">OPINIONS chartci and to advertise or hold themselves out as being able to do or as doing i banking business is misleading and any such practice should be stopped. Seition 24-1310 apparently contemplates that members may make depositls with the association and withdraw the same. Although the power to receive and permit withdrawal of deposits is not mentioned in section 24-13l4 which purports to specify the powers held by such an association, we believe the act must be construed as a whole and when all sections are lead together the intention to permit deposits and withdrawals thereof seems ito follow. The manner of withdrawal must not, of course, be a method which is designated as a banking perquisite under Chapter 8, Comp. Stat. The use of an assignment of the funds docs not seem to us to be one of the referred to perquisites and since the law permits by-laws to designate the condition upon which withdrawal may be made, in our opinion a service charge may be imposed. If this be deducted from, the amount of the assignment, the purchaser of such an assignment takes it subject to the by-laws of the association since it is non-negotiable and may protect himself only by ex - tending the credit upon it which it will eventually be given by the associ - ation.

You ask if our stale law required state banks to pledge assets to secure county funds when the depository bank is a member of the Federal De - pository Insurance Corporation. Senate File No. 184 passed by the fiftieth session of the Nebraska State Legislature, declared an emergency and became the law when the same was approved on May 16, 1935. Section one of this bill provides in sub - stance that no bonds or other security shall be required by governmental officers when the depository is a member of the Federal Depository In - surance Corporation; provided, the deposit does not exceed the amount of the insurance. This is new statutory law which does not attempt to directly repeal or amend laws existing at the time it came into operation. Senate File No. 122 passed by the same session of our legislature, de - clared an emergency and became operative when approved on April 12, 1935. </seg>
            <seg id="p058">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL It is our opinion that if there is a conflict between Senate File 184 ;mH Senate-File 122, both as above described, that Senate File 184 prevails and that a legally declared depository which is a member of the Federal Oe - pository Insurance Corporation need not deposit bonds or other :;ecuritk-s for county funds; provided, the deposit is less than the amount of the insurance.

The resolution further advises that a sign in a hamburger stand reads as follows: "Colored trade is not solicited." Section 23-101. C. S. Nebraska. 1920. provides. "All persons within this state shall be entitled to a full and equnl enjoyment of the accommodations, advantages, facilities and privi - leges of inns, restaurants, public conveyances, barber shops, theaters, and other places of amusement; subject only to the conditions and limitations established by law and applicable alike to every poison." It is our opinion that either one of the acts complained of in your res - olution is a violation of section 23-101 and amounts to a denial to the people of the colored race of the full and equal enjoyment of the accommodations, advantages, facilities and privileges of such establishment.

In answer to the question you ask, I will say that I too have been unable to find any statutory ' provision that fixes a fee for the filing and recording of an official bond by a county clerk, and the rule is that "A public officer must discharge all the duties pertaining to his office for the compensation allowed by law, and will not be allowed compensation for extra work unless it is authorized by statute." Stoner v. Keith Co. 48 Neb. 289. Bayha v. Co. of Webster, 18 Neb. 132. And Nuckolls Co. v. Peebler, 65 Neb. 356 held that if a public officer is required to perform certain official duties for which no fee is provided by statute, he can recover no fee therefor. Failing to find any statute that fixes a fee for the filing and recording ol an official bond, I am of the opinion that no fee can be charged for such filing and recording. GEO. W.

In reply to your inquiry of January 30th regarding the investment ol the surpluses in various funds of your village, in outstanding water bonds, will advise that we believe your question is answered by the providing clause in Section 17-515 Comp. Stat. Neb. Supplement for 1933. which is ;». follows: "Provided, when the treasurer of any such city or village holds funds of any such city or village in excess of the amount required for maintenance or set aside for betterments and improvement;; the mayor and council or the board of trustees may by resolution direct and authorize said treasurer to invest said surplus fund in the outstanding bonds or registered warrants of said city or village. The interest on such bonds or warrants shall be credited to the fund out of which said bonds or warrants were purchased: Pro - vided, further, that the mayor and council or board of trustees may by resolution direct and authorize the treasurer to dispose of the surplus electric light or water funds or the funds arising from the sale of electric light and water properties by the payment oi outstanding electric light or water bonds then due, or electric light or water warrants then due. the excess, if any. after such payments, to be transferred to the general fund of such city or village." We believe that by virtue of this provision, any money in any fund of the village, in excess of the amount required for maintenance, or set aside for betterments and improvements, may be invested in outstanding bonds or registered warrants of the village. When purchased, the interest on such bonds must be credited to the fund out of which they were purchased: that is, you could not stop the interest on water bonds and thereby save for the water fund. The interest would have to be credited to the particular fund from which the bond was purchased. </seg>

The nvestment must be authorized by resolution of the board of trustees. MILTON C. MURPHY, Assistant Attorney General. ELECTRIC LIGHT AND GAS DISTRIBUTING SYSTEM October 26, 1935. Mr. J. T. Stanton, City Attorney. Stromsburg, Nebraska. I have your letter of October 25, wherein you request our opinion on the following: You ask if under Section 19-701 Comp. Stat. Neb. 1929, when a city is attempting to condemn the electric distribution plant, if it is also necessary to condemn the gas distribution plant operated by the same company in said city. Jn my opinion, where the gas and electric plants are operated by the same company under one management under the provisions of Section 19-701 Comp. Stat. Neb. 1929, it is required that the entire system be con - demned and that it is not possible under this law for a city to condemn only one ipart of that system and to leave the other part in the hands of the company. That law is proper, for it can easily be seen that if your city were permitted to take only one part of the system, leaving the balance of the system to the company to operate, that the city could select only that part of the entire system being operated by the company that produced a profit, and could leave the non-profit producing parts of such system to be oper - ated! at a loss by the power company. In your second question, you ask if the petition calling the election on the [question of condemnation should include specific reference to taking over the electric system and the gas system. In answer to that question, it is my opinion that since it is necessary for the city to condemn both the electric light system and the gas distribu - tion system, that the petition calling for an election upon this question should set out fully all matters to be voted upon at the election. Such petition, therefore, should include reference not only to the condemnation of the light system, but of the gas distribution system as well. WM. H. WRIGHT, Attorney General. </seg>

It is true that Section 17-149 Compiled Statutes, which gives a city of 'he sec jnd class power "• * * to organize fire engine, hook and ladder and bucket com - panies, and to prescribe rules of duty and the government there - of ♦ * * " is only made applicable, by its terms, to cities of the second class, and a village is not eligible to become a city of the second class until it has at least 1000 inhabitants. A village, however, as well as a city of the second class is given the right bv Section 17-441 Compiled Statutes, "To provide for the purchase of steam engines or fire extinguishing apparatus and for a supply of water for the purpose of fire pro - tection." A village is also given the right by 17-589 Compiled Statutes to "Levy a tax annually for the maintenance and benefit of fire de - partments and companies." </seg>

GEO. W AYRES. Assistant Attorney General. i j TRANSFER OF LIGHT PLANT FUND TO GENERAL FUNI&gt; January 21,. 1936 Mr. W. F. Lange, City Clerk, Bloomfield, Nebraska. You say: "In a short time the bonded indebtedness on the municipal li^l" plant will be paid off, which has been paid with the earnings of the plant. After we have paid all the, bonds. I understand we can transfer the funds from the light plant account to the city"s general fund. I would like to be advised whether this can be done without any further authority, and whether we are permitted to credit it to any fund of the city such as the street department, miscellaneous account and the like, or must it be credited to the general fund and then pro rated to the various accounts." * The question you ask Ls answered in part by Section 17-515 Compiled Statutes, which provides that surplus electric light funds, which may re - main after taking care of maintenance charged, may by direction of the mayor and council, be used in paying off electric light and water bonds and electric light and water warrants then due, and the excess, if any. left after such payments, may be transferred to the general fund of the city. There is a like provision regarding the use of any surplus left in the water fund, but that is in apparent conflict with Section 17-441 Compiled Statutes as amended by Chapter 34 Session Laws of 1935, which provides, among other things, that "All incomes received by such cities or villages from such water - works, from the payment and collection of water taxes, rents or rates or assessments shall be kept in a separate fund, and shall first be applied in the payment of running expenses and interest on bonds or money borrowed and used in erection and construction of such waterworks, and should there be any surplus, it shall be annually created into a sinking fund for the payment of water </seg>
            <seg id="p065">OPINIONS bonds, or for the improvements of the works as the council or board of trustees may direct." Section 17-515 also provides that when the treasurer of a city of the secohd class holds city funds in excess of the amount required for mainten - ance or set aside for betterments, the mayor and council may, by resolution, direct and authorize said treasurer to invest such surplus in the outstanding bonds or registered warrants of the city. This, I take it, authorizes the use of any surplus in the light fund of the city in the purchase of outstanding warrants of the city, without any pre- Inniiary transfer of such surplus to the city general fund. GEO. W. AYRES, Assistant Attorney General. August 6, 1935. Mr. E. A. Calling, Gothenburg, Nebraska. You say: "The question has arisen as to duty of the railroad to care for street and sidewalks across its right-of-way. "Can you infrom me if it is the duty of the railroad to care for and maintain the streets crossing its right-of-way, and also keep up the side - walks, for the full width of the right-of-way, or, does its duty end with the road bed crossing and the immediate approaches?" In answer to your question I will say that section 17-432 provides that: "any street or other railway company, occupying with any tract any street, avenue or alley or portion thereof which may be ordered paved, repaved, macadamized or graveled may be charged with the expense of such improvement of said portion of such street, avenue or alley so occupied by it between its tracks, between its rails and for one foot beyond the outer rails, and the cost thereof may be collected and enforced against such company in such man - ner as may be provided by ordinance, or the mayor and council or board of trustees may by ordinance require such company to pave, repave, macadamize or gravel such portion of such street, avenue or alley occupied by said tracks and for one feet beyond its outside rails;" ' Sec. 17-432. C. S. Suppl. 1933. This clearly does not require a railroad company to bear the entire exjtense of paving or graveling the entire width of its right-of-way where il crosses the street of a city. </seg>
            <seg id="p066">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Section 17-432 also provides that a city of the second class may: "construct sidewalks and improve the sidewalk space at publir cost or by levy of special assessments on the property specially benefited thereby, proportionate to benefits." If the expense of constructing the balance of the sidewalk which in its course crosses a railroad right-of-way is assessed against the adjacent property in proportion to the benefits it receives. I do not know of any reason why a like assessment should not be made against the railroad com - pany or against its property adjacent to the sidewalk. ■ GEO. W. AYRES, Assistant Attorney General POPULATION OF VILLAGES AND CITIES OF SECOND CLASS July 2. 1935 Mr. John S. Logan. Attorney at Law. Fairfield. Neb. You inquire whether an incorporated city of the second class, if it: - population decreased until it has less than one thousand inhabitants, ceosti - automatically to be a city of the second class and comes under the provisions of the law governing villages? My answer to the question you ask is no. There are, I think, several cities in the state which now have less thun one thousand population. There is no statute law in this state which says that when a city of the second class ceased to have at least a population of 1000 inhabitants, it shall at once cease to be a city of the second class :md become a village. If this were the rule, in a case where the city had say 1001 inhabitants. the removal of a family from the city would change it from a city to ;i village, unless enough pepole moved in to make up the loss by removal and this would be true, even though within a month, more than enough would move in to make up the loss by removal. Similarly where just enough people were residing in the city to makr up the number required by statute for organization as a city the death of one of them without a corresponding increase by birth or by some one moving into the city would automatically destroy its city organization. This, of course, is not the law. GEO. W. AYRES. Assistant Attorney General </seg>
            <seg id="p067">OPINIONS ANNUAL REPORT OF TOWNSHIP CLERK February 5. 1936. Mrs. Earl Landholm, Lynch, Nebraska. Speaking with reference to the annual financial report which the law requires a township clerk to make, you ask: . "Do they have to be published in the local newspaper or one in the county, or may the clerk type the report and post it in his township: Some argue that they can post it and save money, others claim it is not legal unless published in the paper. What rates are usually charged for such reports and just what style or form are they to be in? jln answer to the first question you ask, I will say the law requires that -uch a report shall be published in a newspaper in the county. Section Jti-250 Comp. Stat. Neb. 1929 reads as follows: '"Within ten days after the first Tuesday in January of each year the town clerk in counties under township organization shall pre - pare an itemized report of all moneys received and all moneys paid out during the year by the town board and shall publish the same once the following week in one newspaper in said county. The expense of said publication shall be paid as are other town ex - penses." 1 ! 1 do not consider the posting of the report in the township as equivalent i" publishing it in a newspaper. It should be published in a newspaper. as the law requires. As you will observe, the law requires the report as made and as published to be itemized. This requires, I think, that each item of any particular size in both the receipts and the expenditures should he separately stated in the report. GEO. W. AYRES. Assistant Attorney General. SALE OF FIRE WORKS WITHIN CITY LIMITS. June 15. 1936. i : Mr, Raymond B. Morrissey. County Attorney. Tecumseh, Nebraska.

It is clear from the statement of fact you make, that as the city ordinance is now drawn it is not a violation of the ordinance to sell fire crackers without the corporate limits of the city although within its immediate - vicinity. I do not recall any state law which forbids the sale of fire crackers nu matter how small they may be, within the state. Section 28-1003, Compiled Statutes, 1929, does provide, however, that it shall be unlawful to: "Use, sell, offer for sale or keep for sale in this state any fire crackers more than five inches in length and more than three - fourths of an inch in diameter." ■ .".'■■.'

Assistant Attorney General DISTRIBUTION OF GASOLINE TAX IN TOWNSHIPS February 14. 193. r &gt; Mr. Jesse L. Dougherty, County Attorney, Columbus, Nebraska. You say: "In our county, which is under township organization, the gasoline tax, which the county receives from the state, is prorated by the - county board among the various supervisors to be used in their respective districts and each supervisor is in the habit of dividing his proportionate share among the townships in his district. "I have been asked the question as to ' Whether or not a township in a supervisor's district, which does not vote a township levy for road purposes at its general election, may participate in a division of the gasoline tax money, which has been assigned to its super - visor's district. "I will appreciate very much your opinion In this matter." The statutory provision relative to the use of such part of the gasoline tax allocated to the counties is as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p069">OPINIONS "(1) Ten per cent (10%) to be credited to the road fund of the cities and incorporated villages within said county in the proportion that the total population of each city or village, based on the 1930 federal census, bears to the total population of all the cities or incorporated villages within said county, and the sum of money so allocated shall be used solely by such cities or incorporated villages for constructing street improvements; and (2) Twenty per cent (20%) to be credited to the county bridge fun,d, and if any portion thereof be not required for bridges it shall be used to pay the interest on and to retire any outstanding county road or highway construction bonds of the county and the balance thereof, if any, shall be credited to the county road fund; and (3) The remainder, seventy per cent (70%), to be credited to the county road fund, to be used by the County Board for the purpose of maintaining, grading, graveling, regraveling, laying, littering, oiling or paving, and for no other purpose whatsoever:" It thus appears that no provision is made for the division of the gasoline lax received by a county under township organization among the several townships. 1 1 am of the opinion that so far as the law is concerned, a township which levies no township road tax is just as much entitled to share in the gasoline lax as a township which does make such a levy, but I do not know of a-y statute which directs that the gasoline tax shall be apportioned among the townships. The statute does provide, however, that seventy per cent of the county's .-hare of the gasoline tax shall be credited to the county road fund and shall he lsed by the county board "* * • for the purpose of maintaining, grading, graveling, regravel - ing, claying, littering, oiling or paving and for no other purpose whatsoever."

Assistant Attorney General APPLICATION FOR RIGHT-OF-WAY FOR IRRIGATION CANAL: CENTRAL NEBRASKA PUBLIC POWER &amp; IRRIGATION DISTRICT March 19, 1936 Mr. Leo N. Swanson, Commissioner Public Lands &amp; Buildings. Lincoln. Nebraska. I have your letter of March 10. with the enclosed letter from the Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District relating to their application to the Board of Educational Lands and Funds for a right-of-way across school lands located in the NE U 4 of Section 36 in Township 8 North. Ranee 13 West of the 6th P. M. in Kearney County, Nebraska. The application states that this canal is to be used by the Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District for irrigation purposes Attached to the application is a certified copy of tenant's agreement where - by such tenant waives all claim to damages due to the construction of canal An examination of the statutes would indicate that this public powei and irrigation district is entitled to a right of way across school lands with - out having to pay the state anything for such right-of-way. Section 46-607 C. S. Neb. 1929 provides, in part, as follows; "All persons desirous of constructing any of the works provided for in the preceding sections, shall have the right to occupy state lands and to obtain right-of-way over, and across any highway in this state for such purpose without compensation * * *." Section 46-128 C. S. Neb. 1929 also provides: " * • * the right-of-way is hereby given, dedicated, and set apart to locate, construct and maintain such works over and through any of the lands which are now, or may be the property of the state; * * •" Under these sections, which apply to the construction of irrigation ditches, either by persons or irrigation districts, it would appear that the Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District does have the privilege to obtain from the state of Nebraska right-of-way across school </seg>
            <seg id="p071">OPINIONS lanls without the necessity of having to pay any money for such right-of - way. It is true Section 72-211 C. S. 1935 Supplement provides, in part: "Any irrigation district in which there is or may be any educa - tional lands belonging to the state which are or may hereafter become sites for reservoir purposes, may purchase from the state for reservoir sites such additional land, or portion thereof, upon conditions set forth in Section 72-236 C. S. Nebraska 1929." I construe this provision to relate solely to land needed for reservoir sites. From the application and map sent in by the Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District, I judge that the right-of-way requested i« ijo be used solely for the construction of an irrigation ditch and is not connected with any reservoir site. I notice further that the application requests a right-of-way of a width ai 270 feet. I do not know the width of the proposed ditch or the amount of land that would be covered by the banks of such ditch. It would be my opinion that all of the right-of-way that this district would be entitled to under the sections quoted above would be merely such right-of-way as is actually needed for the ditch itself and for the banks of the ditch. If the ditch and its banks would take the full 270 feet, then I believe we should yrarit them a right of way for that amount. If, however, the ditch a.id banks would not take up the full 270 feet, it would be my opinion that the right - of-way should be limited to the amount that would be taken up by such ditch and banks. I am returning herewith the letter of the Central Nebraska Public- Power and Irrigation District and the map which accompanied it. together with the certified copy of the tenant's agreement. WM. H.

            <seg id="p072">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL River by the Nebraska Central Public Irrigation and Power Company. known as the Tri-County project; that you were unable to ascertain where Merrick County as a corporate entity was involved in any litigation, and inquire as to the legal right of the County Board to adopt said resolution appropriating said money for said purpose. As we understand it, Merrick County, Nebraska is not a party to the litigation which you mention and could not be made a party thereto, since it as a county has no appropriation and no right to any of the waters of the Platte river, although a number of its citizens and property owners may br vitally interested in the matter involved in the litigation. It is our opinion that the County Board 'exceeded its powers in making? this appropriation for the purpose mentioned. We know of no statute authorizing such an appropriation for such a purpose. Powers of the county and of the county board are confined to those expressly granted to it by th&lt; statutes or necessarily implied from the expressly granted powers. Section 26-104 C. S. Neb. 1929. to which you refer, provides: "To make all contracts and to do all other acts in relation to the property and concern of the county necessary to the exercise of its corporate powers." We do not believe that this provision would authorize the county to appropriate money for the cost of litigation kvhich involves the right of it - citizens and property owners, because such an appropriation and the pay - ment of such expenses would not be acts in relation to the property and concern of the county necessary to the exercise of its corporate powers. The corporate powers of the county are governmental powers and do rail include the power to interfere in private litigation to which it is not a party : : nd in which it as a governmental subdivision could not be interested. .

            <seg id="p074">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ANNUAL REPORT OF FOREIGN CORPORATION September 25, 193G Mr. L. K. Twinem, Attorney at Law, Lincoln. Nebraska.

S. Neb. 1929, for a year during which it transacts no business in the state. In my opinion the law does not require a corporation to make an annual report to this office, which transacts no business during the year for which the report is to be made, even though it may have authority to transact business in this state. j I suggest that it will be well, however, to state the reason why no re - port is made, in a brief letter addressed to this office. GEO. W. AYRJES, Assistant Attorney General. . ■ ' : ■ ' ■ January 20. 193t! Mr. P. J. Heaton, County Attorney. Sidney. Nebraska. This will acknowledge our receipt of your letter of January 15th where - in you present a statement of facts and question of law which arises under section 26-130, C. S. of Nebraska. 1929, which statute reads as follows: "No county officer or county surveyor shall in any manner, either directly or indirectly, be pecuniarily interested in or receive the benefits of any contracts executed by the county for the furnishing of supplies or any other purpose; neither shall any county officer or county surveyor, furnish any supplies for the county on order of the county board, without contract." You advise us that after advertisement, ! the three legal newspapers ol your county submitted bids for county printing and supplies and that the Record Publishing Company was low bidder; that the Record Publishing Company and Mrs. I. L. Pindell, wife of the county clerk of your county, are the owners and publishers of the Cheyenne County Record, a newspaper, and that Mr. Pindell, the county clerk of your county is the owner of the Record Publishing Company. This statement of facts fixes ownership of the Cheyenne County Record in Mr. Pindell and his wife. You further advise that upon request for opinion you have advised your county commissioners that by reason of the above statute a contract </seg>
            <seg id="p075">OPINIONS could not be awarded to Mr. Pindell's paper for the furnishing of supplies or the county printing because of his holding the office of county clerk. It is our opinion that Mr. Pindell, being the sole owner of the business operating and existing under the trade name of Record Publishing Company, cannot contract with your county for county supplies or printing. If such a contract were to be entered into, it would constitute a direct violation of the above statute and thereby void. : Although your letter states that the Record Publishing Company was low bidder you further infer that the Cheyenne County Record (a co - partnership) was a party to the contract with the county. This suggestion presents a further question for consideration. It has been suggested to us that a co-partnership which has as one of its members a county officer may enter into a contract with the county. The support for this contention is found in State v. Pielstickcr, 118 Neb. 419. 225 |N. W. 51. This decision has been referred to by us in former opinions, but' we do not now believe this case is applicable in considering section 26-130 of our statute. The statute under consideration in the Pielsticker case (sec. 8-149), was not as broad as the one under consideration here. A reading of the two statutes with the Pielsticker opinion makes a ready distinction. We have found in the case of Montgomery v. Atlanta, 134 S. E. 152, 47 A. L. R. 233. a case almost identical in fact and law with the position of the Cheyenne County Record. In that case you will find that the court held the contract to be void. The dissenting opinion in this case cites Hardy v. Gainesville, 121 Ga. 327, 48 S. E. 921, which is further support for the conclusion reached by us. It is therefore our opinion that a contract made and entered into between Cheyenne County and the Record Publishing Company, which company is owned solely by the county clerk of said county, or a contract entered into between the county and the Cheyenne County Record, which paper is partly owned by the county clerk, is void. PAUL P. CHANEY, Assistant Attorney General. ISSUANCE OF COUNTY WARRANTS IN EXCESS OF LEVY August 5, 1935. Mr. W. L. Brennan, County Attorney, Butte, Nebraska. You make a statement of fact and ask questions thereon as follows: "Under present conditions Boyd County will exhaust eighty five per cent of the levy to be made in August as soon as made. </seg>
            <seg id="p076">REPORT OF ATTORNEY; GENERAL I ' • "Can we issue warrants for salar\j to constitutional officers in excess of the. eighty five per cent? "Would this be broad enough to include per diem for supervisors?" I do not know of any constitutional officer except the county judgi - that is paid a salary by the county. The law provides that: "County judges shall receive salaries hereinafter designated for the year 1921 and subsequent yeais thereto payable by warrant drawn on the General Fund of the County." 33-133, C. S. Nebr. 1929. This section was passed in 1921 which was thirty-eight years after section 26-116 was last amended. Another statute provides that: "No county officer shall be entitled to draw in one month more than one-twelfth of the total annual salary." It is obvious the law contemplates a county judge shall be paid his salary in monthly installments. It is clear too that at the time section 26-116 was passed it did not affect the compensation paid a county judge for at that time county judges were paid out of the fees collected by them and not by warrants drawn against the county general fund. I am of the opinion that warrants may be drawn in payment of the earned salary of a county judge up to one hundred per cent of the levy made for that purpose regardless of the fact there may be no money in the treasury at the time it is drawn with which to pay it. This applies I think to all officers who are paid salaries monthly bj[ the county regardless of the fact that they may not be constitutional officers. In counties where the members of the county board are not paid salaries but a per diem the same reasoning dobs not apply. GEO. W. AYRES. Assistant Attorney General. SECTION 33-118. C. S. 1929. AS AMENDED SESSION LAWS OF 193!. PAGE 186 July 3. 1935 Mr. C. G. Perry, Attorney at Law, Bridgeport. Nebraska. i . ■ You call attention to section 33-118, Compiled Statutes which provides among other things that: "For the collection of all sums of money general or bonded ol irrigation districts, the county treasurer shall receive for his </seg>
            <seg id="p077">OPINIONS services a fee of one-half of one per cent of such sums so collected: Provided, that one-fourth of the one-half per cent so collected shall be paid to the incumbent of the county treasurer's office as ad - ditional salary in no year to exceed the sum of five hundred dollars." You inquire whether a county treasurer is entitled to additional com - pensation as above outlined for the collection of irrigation district taxes. In 1922 what is now 33-118 was 2379; what is now 33-131 was 2392: what is now 33-135 was 2396 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. 2379 provided what commission a county treasurer should receive for the collection of taxes. 2392 provided what salary a county treasurer should receive. 2396 provided that county officers should turn all fees collected by them into the county treasury. At that time it is clear the county treasurer received a salary payable out of the general fund of the county and that all fees received by him for official services were to be turned into the county treasury. No part of the fees received by him were to be retained by him as additional compensation for his services. In 1923 what is now 33-118 was amended by an act entitled: "An Act to amend Section 2379, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. relating to fees and salaries, providing that for the collec - tion of all sums of money, general or bonded, of irrigation districts, the county treasurer shall receive for his services a fee of one-half of one per cent of such sums so collected, and to repeal said original section." Neither Section 2392 nor section 2396 Compiled Statutes for 1922 are mentioned either in the title or in the body of the act amending 2379. I am doubtful therefore whether the provision found in 33-118, formerly section 2379, Compiled Statutes of 1922, which gives a county treasurer one - fourth of one-half per cent of all irrigation district taxes collected by him should be considered as amending or modifying 33-13, Compiled Statutes 1929: edition, which states the compensation a county treasurer shall re - ceive, or 33-135, Compiled Statutes 1929, which states that county treasurers in common with other county officers shall turn all fees received by them into 'the county treasury. In other words, I doubt the right in strict law of a county treasurer to receive additional compensation for the collection of irrigation taxes. GEO. W. AYRES, Assistant Attorney General. </seg>

We agree with your opinion that the maximum levy of H. R. 424 must include the levy for care of insane patients. S. F. 241 does not purport to authorize an additional levy.

CONVICTION FOR ASSAULT AND BATTERY NOT A BAR TO PROSECUTION FOR MURDER May 7. 193(i. Mr. Emil J. Eret, County Attorney, Wilber, Nebraska. Sometime ago I promised to send you some authorities as to whether or not a conviction for assault and battery would be a bar to a prosecution for murder in the event that the person against whom the assault was made died after the conviction for assault and battery was had. I had thought there were some Nebraska cases on this, but an investiga - tion shows that the Nebraska court has not been called upon to pass on this question. However, the rule of law is well settled that a conviction or acquittal of assault and battery is not a bar to a subsequent prosecution for murder where the person assaulted died of the blows inflicted. This rule appears in 16 C. J. 275, 276. In 8 R. C. L. 148, Sec. 134, we find this rule: "When, after the first prosecution, a new fact supervenes, for which the defendant is responsible, which changes the character of the offense, and together with the facts existing at the time con - stitutes a new and distinct crime, an acquittal or conviction of the - first offense is not a bar to an indictment for the other distinct crime. This principle is the foundation for the universal rule that at common law a conviction for assault while the person assaulted is still living, is no bar to a prosecution for murder or manslaughter instituted after death has resulted to the person assaulted on </seg>

And in Section 397. on page 5R3, it is held: "A conviction of simple assault in justice court (is) no bar to a prosecution for aggravated assault in a higher court." In Southworth v. Slate, 125 So. 345, this rule is set out in the 4th syllabus: "When an assault has been committed, for which the defendant is tried and convicted, and the victim after such conviction dies as a result of force set in motion by the defendant at the time of such assault, a new and distinct crime is committed of which the defendant was not theretofore guilty, and a conviction had before death for the first offense is not a bar to an indictment for the new crime."

In People v. Dugus. 141 N. E. 7G9. in the 8th syllabus the court held: "A conviction of assault with intent to commit murder is no bar to a prosecution upon an indictment for murder." </seg>

DANIEL STUBBS, Assistant Attorney General SECURITY FOB DEPOSIT OF COUNTY FUNDS June 1, 1935. Mr. Wilber S. Aten, County Attorney, Holdrege, Nebraska. You ask for an opinion from this office as to whether the security now beinn issued by the United States Government and commonly called Treasury Notes and Certificates of Indebtedness meets the definition of United btates Government bonds, under Section 77-2508 as amended by S. F. 122 passed at the last session of the Legislature. The answer to your question may not be entirely free from doubt, inasmuch as the United States Government itself calls the securities of which you speak Treasury Notes and Certificates of Indebtedness, instead of Bonds. I am of the opinion, however, that such securities may be accepted, for no reason occurs to me why they will not be as safe as any of the other securities mentioned in your letter. I am strengthened in this conclusion by the fact that Sec. 77-2601 Compiled Statutes, as amended in 1933, reads in part as follows: "All depositories of public moneys or other funds belonging to the governmental agencies above enumerated shall have full authority to give bond for the safe keeping and payment of such deposits and the accretions thereof and in lieu of such bond such depositories shall have full authority to pledge assets of such depositories for the security and payment of all such deposits and accretions; and all of such governmental agencies are hereby given the right and authority to accept such bonds or in lieu thereof such pledge of assets." </seg>

COUNTY AGRICULTURAL AGENTS September 11. l'SM. Mr. S. S. Diedrichs, County Attorney, North Platte, Nebraska. You ask for an opinion from this Department upon some question which you say this office has discussed with the Supervisor of Extension work of the Department of Agriculture of the University of Nebraska. You enclose a letter you received from Mr. J. P. Ross, Supervisor of Extension Work. I take it, from Mr. Ross' letter, that a petition containing 331 names was filed September 14, 1934, asking that there be submitted to the voters of Lincoln County at the general election to be held therein on November (i. 1934 "The question of whether there shall be county funds appropriated for the continuance or support of county agricultural extension work in said county on and after January 1. 1935." I am of the opinion this petition ought not to be construed as asking that a like question be submitted to the voters in 1936 as t6 the furnishing of like help by the county in 1937. I am further of the opinion that a petition filed alter September 1, 1934. could not be considered in determining whether at the election held in 1934 the question of furnishing like help after 1935 should be voted upon. Being filed after September 1, 1934, the petition was filed too late to authorize the submission of the question at the general election held that year. "•,. I will add that in my opinion if in 1934 the furnishing of such aid was submitted to the voters of a county and carried, or if at the biennial election to be held on any of the even numbered years thereafter, such a proposition is submitted and carries and is not again submitted, but no remonstrance is filed against it, aid should be furnished annually so long as the law remains as it is. I base this opinion upon the provision found in Sec. 2-1113 C. S. 1935 Supplement, which reads, in part, as follows: ''If a majority of the votes cast are opposed to such appropriation then the county board shall deny the appropriation. If a majority </seg>

WRIGHT, Attorney General. SECTION 26-906 COVERING REPLEVIN ACTION November 27, 1935. Mr. Arthur A. Weber, County Attorney, Bassett, Nebraska. This will acknowledge our receipt of your letter wherein you present a question to this department as to whether you may properly represent a plaintiff in a replevin action, the subject matter in said action being the same property involved in a criminal action you have filed in your county and upon which complaint warrant has been issued but not served by reason of the absence of the defendant from the county. We have read the cases annotated in the statute under section 29-906, but do not believe that these citations present an analogous case with the one presented by you. Of course the cases are grounds for argument that you Ihave a right to appear in both the replevin and criminal case, but in our opinion the cases cited do not go far enough to become authorities in the question presented by you. It is our opinion that if you appear for the plaintiff in the replevin action and attempt to prosecute the criminal com - plaint that a motion by defendant made in the criminal prosecution would be reason to disquality you as a prosecutor and the refusal of the court to disqualify you would be error prejudicial to the defendant. Your assuming the office of county attorney places upon you the responsibility of prosecuting criminal complaints and you should do nothing to disqualify you in the carrying out of your duty. By reason of the conclusion reached by us as herein stated, we do not believe that you can properly act in the replevin action. PAUL P. CHANEY, Assistant Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p084">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL PRINTING OF BALLOTS FOR UNICAMERAL LEGISLATURE February 15. 1936. Hon. Harry R. Swanson, Secretary of State. You have asked for our opinion as to what ballots are to be printed in the primary and general elections this year. You particularly ask whether separate ballots must be prepared in the general election for nominees for the Unicameral Legislature, or whether the names of the nominees for such office shall be placed on the same official ballot as the political candi - dates, as provided for in Section 32-1203, 1935 Supplement to Compiled Statutes, 1929. At the primary election the names of candidates for nomination to tho Unicameral Legislature shall be placed on a separate non-political ballot. the same as candidates for nomination to judicial offices, the offices of State Superintendent of Public Instruction, County Superintendent and Regents of the State University, as provided for in Sections 32-1202. Compiled Statutes, 1929, and 32-1206, 1935 Supplement to Compiled Statutes, 1929. The names of candidates for nomination to the Unicameral Legislature should be included in the non-political ballot along with judicial offices and the other non-political offices set out above. There is some confusion as to whether the names of nominees to the Unicameral Legislature should be placed on the tame official ballot as political candidates in the general election, or trhould be placed on a separate non-political ballot. This is caused because of the seemingly conflicting provisions of Chapter 76 of the 1935 Session Laws and Chapter 112 of the 1936 Session Laws. Both of these Acts were approved on the same day. to-wit: May 27. 1935. Section 3, Chapter 112 (Sec. 32-1207, 1935 Supp. C. S. 1II29) provides in part: "After said primary election, held as aforesaid, the county clerk or other official whose duty it is to prepare the official ballot for the general election to be held in this state shall prepare a separate ballot similar and substantially in the same general form and the names rotated on said ballot as hereinbefore provided for in this act for the nomination of members of the legislature at the primary election; and said county clerk or other official shall place on said separate ballot, on each office division, twice as many names as there are places to be filled at the said general election. ' " ." Section 1, Chapter 76, 1935 Session Laws (Section 32-1203. 1935 Supple - ment to C. S. 1929) provides in part: </seg>
            <seg id="p085">OPINIONS • "After said primary election, held as aforesaid, the county clerk or other official whose duty it is to prepare the official ballot for the general election to be held in this state, shall place the names of all non-political candidates upon the same official ballot as the political candidates and substantially in the same general form and the names rotated on said official ballot as hereinbefore provided for in this act for the nomination of judicial officers, State Superin - tendent of Public Instruction, County Superintendents, Regents of the State University, and members of (he legislature at the primary election; * * • ." Standing alone these sectipns might be considered to be in conflict. However, Section 1, Chapter 112, 1935 Session Laws (Section 32-1205. 1935 Supp. C. S. 1929) provides: "Whenever the words 'separate ballot' shall be used in this Act they shall be construed to mean the non-partisan ballot provided for in Article 12. Chapter 32, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929. as amended." I ■ As we have pointed out above, Chapter 76 of the 1935 Session Laws. which was approved on the same day as Chapter 112, 1935 Session Laws, amended Article 12, Chapter 32, C. S. 1929, by completely doing away with the separate non-political ballot in the general election. Section 1, Chapter 112. 1935 Sesion Laws (Section 32-1205, 1935 Supp. C. S. 1929) expressly refers to' and adopts the provisions of Article 12, Chapter 32, C. S. 1929, as amended. At the same time that Chapter 112, 1935 Session Laws was approved, Chapter 7G. 1935 Session Laws, which amended Article 12, Chapter 32, C. S. 1929, was also approved. These acts would take effect then at the same time, and Chapter 112, 1935 Session Laws would automatically adopt the amendment to Article 12, Chapter 32, C. S. 1929, provided for by Chapter 76, 1935 Session Laws. It is obvious, therefore, that the Legislature did intend to adopt the amendment contained in Chapter 76, 1935, Session Laws insofar as that pertained to the candidates for the Unicameral Legislature. This amendment, as wu have pointed out, expressly requires that the names of all non-political candidates be placed on the same official ballot as the political candidates. This amendment also included in the recital of the various non-political candidates affected thereby "members of the Legislature." It is, therefore, our opinion that in the primary election names of can - didates for the Legislature shall be placed on a separate non-political ballot, along with candidates for other non-political offices, but that at the general election the names of candidates for the Legislature, as well as all other non-political candidates, must be placed on the same official ballot as the political candidates!

            <seg id="p086">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL USE OF STICKERS ON BALLOTS October 17. 1936. Mr. Roy Copper. Niobrara, Nebraska. ■ . ■ . I I have your letter of October 16th, in which you ask whether or not undei the election laws of the State of Nebraska written or printed stickers may be used by voters for the purpose of casting a ballot for a person whose name is not printed upon the official ballot. The intention of this would be U&gt; use such stickers in lieu of writing in the name of the person in question in the blank space provided for by Section 32-508. Compiled Statutes, 1929. In the section above quoted, it is provided: "In each division, and beneath all candidates placed there by nomination or petition, a blank space shall be provided, into which electors may write the name of any person for whom they wish to vote and who.se name is not printed upon the ballot." In Section 32-514. in connection with instructions to voters, the following language appears: "If you wish to vote for any person whose name is not printed on the ballot, write his name in full in the blank space on the ballot under the proper office you wish him to hold, and make a cross in the square opposite the written name." In Section 32-715, the following provision appears: "Nothing in this article contained shall prevent any voter from writing on his ballot the name of any person for whom he desires to vote for any office, and such vote shall be counted. " * ." Although the Supreme Court of this state has not passed upon these sections of the statute, it is my opinion that these sections do not authorize the use of a printed sticker in lieu of the act of writing in the name of the person for whom the voter desires to cast his ballot. The act of pasting an already printed slip of paper upon the ballot is not a "writing" within the meaning of that term. The weight of authority in other states under statutes similar or identical with our own is that stickers may not be used where the statute only provides that the voter may write in the name of the candidate for whom he desires to vote. In the case of McSorley v. Schroeder. 196 111. 99, 63 N. E. 697. the Illinois court said: </seg>
            <seg id="p087">OPINIONS "It is manifest that, if pasters may be resorted to by one candidate, they may be by all, and the official ballot might become but little more than a convenient card upon which to paste private tickets printed and circulated in secret. The use of such tickets would revive the evils sought to be guarded against by the ballot law.'' In the case of McFarland v. Spangler, 248 Pac. 521, a recent decision by the California court follows the same rule as that established in Illinois. In this case the court held: "The use of the words 'writing' and 'writing in' and 'written' as applied to voting for a person whose name is not on the official ballot, is a clear evidence of the intention on the part of the legislature to exclude other methods not specifically authorized. It has been held, and may well be said to be the general rule, that: " 'If a statute so provides, but not otherwise, the electors may use printed pasters for the insertion of names not upon the ballot in - stead of writing them in the space reserved for their reception.'." This question has been given consideration by this office heretofore, and I feel convinced that the proper rule is that stickers or pasters cannot be used in lieu of the act of actually writing in the name of the candidate for whom a voter wishes to cast his ballot. To hold otherwise would open the door to many of the evils and frauds that our present election laws intended to prevent. It is. therefore, my opinion that the use of stickers or pasters in lieu nf the act of writing in the name of candidates is improper. WM. H. WRIGHT, Attorney General. SECTION 32-223. SUPP. C. S. 1935, IN RE-ELECTION OF ROAD OVERSEERS September 22, 1936. Mr. Paul R. Morris, County Attorney, Central City, Nebraska. We are in receipt of your letter of September 19th, relative to the proper arrangement of the ballot for the general election with respect to candidates for road overseer in the various road districts of the county. It would seem to us that it would be better to provide separate ballots for the road overseer candidates in the various precincts as if this is not done the result may be confusing to the elector, who may mark the ballot in the wrong district. It has been the practice in some counties to print all </seg>
            <seg id="p088">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL the candidates for the various districts on one ballot and to mark out in pencil the districts in which the voter was not entitled to vote, but this has the objection of serving as a partial identification of the ballot, and is not provided for in the statute. Where separate ballots are provided, they can be furnished to the voters qualified for each district without any marking or mutilation of ballots. You also ask as to the right of electors in villages of from two hundred to seven hundred to vote for road overseers as well as other township officers. An examination of Section 39-601. C. S. 1929. discloses that the first clause of that section is as follows: "The county board shall divide the county, except the portion occupied by the cities and incorporated villages, into as many road districts as may be necessary and alter the boundaries thereol as may seem proper"* * • ." It would hardly seem that the inhabitants of cities and villages which are excluded from the territory which the overseers are to serve should participate in their election. We. therefore, think you are right in your judgment. EDWIN VAIL, Assistant Attorney General ABSENTEE VOTING September 10. 19:!t&gt; Mr. Ludvick Johnson. County Clerk, Kearney, Nebraska. 1. A name written in on a ballot, though no cross is made in the square opposite should be counted if it is obvious for whom the vote is intended. 2. We believe that if the ballots are properly prepared and endorsed, an absent vote may be cast before the county clerk as before any other officer authorized to administer an oath and the same may be done in the county before the election upon a proper affidavit that the voter will be absent on election day.

You ask our opinion as to whether the two constitutional amendments to be submitted at the coming general election should be placed on one or separate ballots. The submission of the amendment is made under section 1, Article XVI of the Constitution, which, in part, provides: "At such election said amendments shall be submitted • * • upon a ballot separate from that upon which the names of candidates appear." The use of the singular number for the word "ballot" means that all the amendments initiated by the legislature shall be submitted on one ballot which shall be separate from any others. DANIEL STUBBS, Assistant Attorney General TIME FOR HOLDING CITY CAUCUSES March 7, 1935 Mr. John P. Corbett, Attorney at Law, Fremont, Nebraska. We have your letter of March 5th, inquiring as to our opinion relative to the time for holding city caucuses under the provisions of Section 32-1133. Cumulative Supplement, 1933. Section 33-1106, Compiled Statutes, 1929, excepts from the general pro - visions of the primary law offices in cities with a population of less than twenty-five thousand. Section 32-1133, above referred to, purports in the first part thereof to provide regulations for nomination of officers which are excepted from the general provisons of the law. This section requires that nominating caucuses be held on or before the fifth Wednesday preceding the election. The latter part of the said section provides: "It is the intention that the manner provided in this section for the nomination of officers named herein, by a convention or com - mittee, shall apply only where such officers are to be chosen at a special election, township or precinct officers to be elected at a general election or village or officers, or members of school boards not members of boards of education." </seg>
            <seg id="p090">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL The quoted section apparently restricts the requirements of the section to village offices and, therefore, excepts offices in cities of the first and second class under twenty-five thousand. It is clear that the regulation applies to village offices, but there is considerable doubt as to whether the section is applicable to cities of the first and second class. If it does not so apply, no regulation exists by statute for the nomination of such officers and the matter is left subject to party management and custom. If this be true, then the requirement that the caucus be held on or before the fifth Wednesday preceding the election does not apply to city officers in cities of the first and second class. If the court held that the first part of the section controlled the later provision whicli we quote above, which is doubtful, then the time provison would apply to Eaid cities. As a practical matter, if a caucus is held at a date later than that pro - vided by the statute and election is held without objection, the person elected, although nominated at a caucus held out of time, will, in our opinion, be entitled to take office. DANIEL STUBBS, Assistant Attorney General. THE It. F. C. MORTGAGE COMPANY June 10, 1935. Honorable Harry R. Swanson, Secretary of State. Building. You inquire whether the R. F. C. Mortgage Company is exempt from the payment of the occupation tax imposed by this state upon foreign corpor - ations. The R. F. C. Mortgage Company L&gt; a corporation organized In the State of Maryland by directors of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the entire capital stock by section 5c of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation act is subscribed by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. The R. F. C. Mortgage Company is entirely owned and controlled by the United States through the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, and no other person is per - mitted to subscribe to its capital stock. It is organized for the purpose of re-er.tablishing a normal mortgage market, under the direction of the Re - construction Finance Corporation. As such it is a corporation owned and operated exclusively by the United States government. We consider it to be a Federal instrumentality created exclusively for the purpose of the Federal government and as such is exempt from state occupation taxes. </seg>

The appointment so made only until the next general election and the office will be vacant for that election. The one elected next November will occupy only the balance of the unexpired term, i. e. — two years. This is settled by State v. Colt-man, 91 Neb. 167 under sections 32-211. 32-1704 and 1706. C.

S. 1935, to file an acceptance of the nomination to procure his name to be printed on tlte ballot. We do not believe so. As the law was enacted in 1907, sec. 41, 1907 Session Laws p. 221, now section 32-1128, clearly applied to such a nomination and required a declination to prevent the name being placed on the ballot rather than an acceptance to assure the place on thjKballot. No law that we can discover has been enacted which requires an acceptance in this case.. Section 32-1164, C. S. 1929 we believe to apply only to candidates nominated at the primary election.

The fee was paid voluntarily under the provisions of section 32-1123. C. S. 1929 which does not provide for a refund. ■ It is a fee paid for a privilege, to-wit: the right to file as a candidate. Upon payment of the fee the county is required to issue a receipt which entitles the person paying to the right to become a candidate.

            <seg id="p093">OPINIONS FILLING VACANCY ON GENERAL ELECTION BALLOT AS TO CANDIDATES FOR UNICAMERAL LEGISLATURE July 17, 1936. Honorable Donald E. Devries. Deputy Secretary of State, Building. You submit that a vacancy as to one of the duly nominated candidates for the unicameral legislature in the 27th District was caused by death. You ask what method should be pursued to fill the vacancy on the general election ballot. The method of filling such a vacancy is provided in sections 3 and 4 »f Chapter 112. 1935 Session Laws, p. 358 (32-1207-8, C. S. S. 1935). The difficulty arises because these two sections provide three different methods for filling the vacancy, no one of which is consistent with the other two. Although the general rule is to read the act as a whole to arrive at the intention of the legislature, a casual perusal of the act will reveal that such is impossible in this case. The three methods provided are so repugnant to each other that no two of them can be enforced together. The existing conflict cannot be reconciled. The Supreme Court has had several cases in which a like question was presented. In Ryan v. State, 5 Neb. 276, the court held: "In an act providing for the appointment of a delinquent tax col - lector, defining his powers and duties, wherein the last section re-enacts a former law which exclusively invests the county treasurer with such office and all the powers and duties of the same; held, that the last section must prevail, and all of the act which relates to a delinquent tax collector is inoperative." In Omaha Real Estate Co. v. Kragscow, 47 Neb. 592, the court held in an almost identical case: "Where two sections or portions of the same statute, passed at the same time, are inconsistent with and repugnant to each other, so much so that both cannot be enforced, the last section, or last words, will be allowed to prevail and the section or words in con - flict therewith held to be repealed." "Sections 5 and 41 of chapter 43, Revised Statutes of 1866, entitled 'Real Estate,' were enacted at the same time, as parts of the same statute, and being in some of their provisions so repugnant that both could not be executed, inasmuch as they conflicted, the last section — 41 — prevailed and the other was repealed." As late as Kirby v. Omaha Bridge Com.. 127 Neb. 382, the court said, p. 391: </seg>
            <seg id="p094">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "Conceding that, where there is an irreconcilable conflict between different sections of the same statute, the last words stand and those in conflict therewith are repealed." Consequently, we believe that in the instant act, the last provision in the premises controls, and the previous ones which conflict stand repealed. The language employed is clear and it seems only necessary to quote: "If there shall be a vacancy on the ballot after the primary, the man polling the third highest in the primary shall be the candidate and if two vacancies exist then the third and fourth highest in the primary shall be the candidates, and in case there was no third and fourth choice candidates in the primary, then candidates may file by petition, by securing ten per cent of the legal voters voting for Governor at the preceding election and if more file than there are places vacant then the candidates shall be chosen by drawing for place."

You ask whether a candidate for the office of county judge by petition is required to pay a filing fee. Of course, under section 32-1203, C. S.

Assuming such a condition exists, no filing fee is required. DANIEL STUBBS, Assistant Attorney General. . '■ .' ■■.[■■■ ■ VACANCY IN OFFICE OF COUNTY COMMISSIONER September 13. 1936. Mrs. F. B.

Morgan, County Clerk, Lincoln, Nebraska. In your letter of March 13 you say: "Section 32-302, provides, among other things, that notice of election shall be published in newspapers. "Section 32-1127, provides, among other things, that the County Clerk or Election Commissioner, shall upon receipt thereof make public by proclamation, as provided in Section 32-302, under proper party designation, the title of each office, etc. "I inteipret this to mean that no further notice is now required by the Statute, than the notices placed in newspapers, and that the former practice of posting notices in each precinct, is no longer required. Do you agree with me in my interpretation of the law. as it now stands in regard to notices?" We believe that your interpretation of the statutes is correct and that since 1931 it has not been a requirement of the law that notices or proclama - tions of primary elections be posted in the precincts, the only duty of the county clerk being to cause publication of such notices to be made in. the newspapers prescribed in Section 32-302, as provided in said section.

            <seg id="p096">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL PETITION FILING FOR DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POWER DISTRICT September 21. 1936. Mr. Charles Dobry, County Attorney, St. Paul, Nebraska. You inquire where a petition nominating a candidate for director of a public power district located entirely within one county should be filed. You do not raise the question of whether a petition filing is possible at all by reason of a preexisting vacancy on the ballot, and consequently we do not. deal with that question. We believe such petition should be filed with the Secretary of State. The statute provides that the procedure j for such a director shall be the same as for a judge of the district court. ! For that office, the non-partisan election law provides that the filing shall be made with the officer who issues the certificate of election. Sections 32-931 and 32-932, provide for the issuance of certificates of election. These sections do not authorize the county clerk to issue such a certificate to a state officer, and the district judge is a state officer. Consequently, a district judge, and therefore the above defined director, should file with the secretary of state, even though the public power district is contained within the boundaries of one county. ■ DANIEL STUBBS, Assistant Attorney General '•■■■ ■ i ■ • ' '' ■■-..-■■■ .

You inquire whether section 32-1107, providing that the incumbent of an elective office must file fifty days before the primary for any other elective office than the one he is holding, applies to a petition filing under section 32-1108. We believe that it does. Section 32-1107 requires the requisite [nominating papers, which in our opinion include a petition filing, to be filed in the above stated time. That time is now pased, so that it is impossible for an incumbent to file by petition for another elective office. The only way an incumbent may now file is to resign from office so that he is no longer an incumbent. DANIEL STUBBS. Assistant Attorney General. </seg>

Dittrick, County Attorney, Norfolk, Nebraska. I have your letter of March 31st, in which you ask whether or not parties enrolled in a CCC camp in your county are entitled to vote there or whether they should vote in their original place of residence. The question you ask cannot be answered by direct answer one way or another. The right to vote depends upon the residence of a person and there is necessarily a question of fact involved as to whether or not members of a CCC camp are residents of the county in which they are stationed. Some members of a CCC camp may possibly be residents of such county, while others would not. The tests of residence are: (1) Physical presence in a county for the time required by statute; and (2) The intent to make such place his home in' the future. The matter of the intent of the person desiring to vote is difficult to de - termine as it rests entirely within the mind of the person. Circumstances may be taken into consideration, however, to determine the intent of the person. In the case of Berry v. Wilcox. 44 Neb. 82, the Nebraska Supreme Court held: "One's residence is where he has his established home, the place where he is habitually present and to which, when he departs, he intends to return. The fact that he may at a future time intend to </seg>
            <seg id="p098">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL remove will not necessarily defeat 1 his residence before he actually does remove. It is not necessary that he should have the intention of always remaining, but there must be no intention of presently removing." The court also held: "The fact that one is a student in a university does not entitle him to vote where the university is situated, nor does it of itself prevent his voting there. He may vote at the seat of the university if he has his residence there and is otherwise qualified to vote." In the above case the facts showed that certain individuals attended Wesleyan University. During the summer ijionths they left University Place and worked at various places throughout the state. When the school term started they returned again to the site of 'the university to take up their studies. The evidence further showed that they were not dependent upon their families and did not consider the hoine of their families to be their home. It also showed that in some cases at 'least they did not know whether they would stay in University Place after they finished their school or whether they would go some other place. The court held that these persons had established a residence at the site of t!he university and were entitled to vote there, because of the fact that they had abandoned their former home and for purposes of voting had sufficiently established a residence .-\i the university as it was their intent to maintain that place as their home - particularly since they had no plans to go jo any other location upon com - pletion of their schooling. On the other hand, in AVhite v. Slania, 89 Neb. 65, the rule established in Derry v. Wilcox was followed. The case jwas distinguished, however, for the reason that the facts were different. In this case certain laborers on a railroad boarded in a boxcar located on the railroad tracks. When they had work to do in a different community, the boxcars were moved at the discretion of the superintendent. When thej work ended at the place where they had been moved, these boxcars would again be moved to some other community where the men would perform! their regular work. The men attempted to vote at Union, claiming that the greater portion of the time the boxcars were stationed in that town. The court held that they had not acquired a residence at Union which would entitle them to vote, even though they had lived in that community the statutory time. The court stated that the men had no control over the r movements and had no reason to expect to return to Union after they ha&amp; been moved to another place, any more than they could expect to be moved to some other town. The court decided the case upon the question of intent to establish a residence at Union, holding that no such intent was disclosed. </seg>
            <seg id="p099">OPINIONS ■ ■ In State v. School District, 55 Neb. 317, it was held that to effect a change of domicile there must not only be a change of residence but an intention permanently to abandon the former home. Generally, it is held that if a student intends to return to his former home after graduation, he does not establish a voting residence at the site uf the college. On the other hand, if the student does not intend to return home, but expects to stay in the college town, then he may vote in such town, provided he has lived there the proper period of time and is otherwise qualified. If the student does not expect to return home, but is not certain ns to the place where he will go, it is generally held that he may vote in the college town. The same rule that is established as to students might be adopted as to members of a CCC camp. I would say, therefore, that if iii(-mbers of a CCC camp have not other home, and intend to remain in the county where they are now located, or if they have abandoned their former lilacs of residence and do not intend to return there, but, instead, intend to stay where they are now located, that such persons would be entitled to vote in the county where they are located at the present time, provided they have lived there the statutory period of time and are otherwise qualified to vote. If, on the other hand, members of a CCC camp have not abandoned their former home nnd expect to return there after their period of enlistment expires, or expect to go elsewhere and do not intend to remain where they are, such persons could no! vote in the county where the camp is located, but would have to vote by mail at the place of their former home. If the person stationed at a CCC camp has a wife or children, and those persons are living in some county other than the one where the CCC camp is located, then, as a general proposition, the county where he maintains his family would be considered to be his place of residence. The entire question of residence depends upon the facts of each in - dividual case. In determining a question of whether or not one of these men may vote, it will be necessary to go into the facts to determine whether or not sufficient evidence exists to establish an intent on the part of the member of the CCC camp to establish a residence in the county wherein such camp is located. These men should be entitled to vote somewhere, and great care should be used in passing upon this question of residence to see to it that no party is disenfranchised. I appreciate the fact that this opinion does not give you a definite answer, but under the circumstances it is impossible for such an answer to be given. WM. H. WRIGHT, Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p100">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL COUNTING OF VOTES WRITTEN IN Oljf DEMOCRATIC BALLOT FOR REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE April 3, 1936. Mr. E. W. Caswell, Box 302, Fullerton, Nebraska. I have your letter of March 30th, wherein you state that you have filed for the office of county supervisor on the Republican ticket; that no one has filed for that office on the Democratic ticket; and you ask if your name written in on the Democratic ballot would be legal and would be counted as a vote for you. If your name is written in on the Democratic ticket and a cross placed in the square behind the 'written in name, such a vote would count for you on the Democratic ticket. If you received the most votes cast for that particular office on the Democratic ticket, and the number of votes received by you met the percentage required by I statute, you would receive the nomination on the Democratic ticket for that office, provided you also received the nomination on the Republican ticket. If, however, you were not nominated on the Republican ticket, even though you received sufficient ballots on the Democratic ticket to be nominated, you could not accept the Democratic nomination. Section 32-1125, Compiled Statutes, 1929, provides: I ■ ■ ' ■ "The name of the same candidate shall not appear printed on more than one party ticket, Provided however, the electors of any party may vote for a candidate of another party by writing his name in and making a cross for him, but if: he should lose the nomination of the party of which he is an avowed candidate, he shall not be permitted to accept the nomination thus tendered to him by the electors of the other party. No candidate defeated at the primary election shall be permitted to file by petition in the general election next following." If you received the nomination on the | Republican ticket, and received sufficient votes on the Democratic ticket (o be nominated as a Democrat as well as a Republican, your name could go on the ballot with the designa - tion Republican-Democrat following your jname. In any event, the votes cast for you on the Democratic ballot could not be added to the vote you received on the Republican ballot. In State v. Sheldon, this same question arose and the court held that if a person secured sufficient votes in more jthan one party to nominate him as the candidate of that party, his name could go on the general election ballot as the nominee of both of such parties. The court, however, held that </seg>
            <seg id="p101">OPINIONS the votes cast for a person on the primary ballots of two separate parties could not be added together in order to nominate. him for the office on one party or the other. The court said: "It is supposed that members of each political party will participate in nominating the candidates of that party, and the voters of one party are not allowed to nominate the candidates for another party. Each voter must declare his party affiliations, and thereupon he receives a ballot of that party, and may vote for whomsoever he pleases as a candidate of that party." Under the decision in this case, if you did not receive enough Republican votes to nominate you as the Republican candidate for the office of county supervisor, such votes as you received on the Democratic ballot could not be added to your Republican vote in order to give you such nomination. WM. H. WRIGHT, Attorney General. FORM FOR NOMINATION OF PRESIDENTIAL ELECTORS August 10, 1936. Hon. Donald E. Devries, Deputy Secretary of State, Building. We acknowledge receipt of your letter of August 4th, with which you enclose us a form '"for nomination of presidential electors by petition," which you say has been sent to your office for approval. You ask us to advise you whether presidential electors may be so nominated.

Under the provisions of Section 32-220, those who have been nominated as electors receive the votes which are cast upon the general election ballot for the presidential candidates of their respective parties. There is no provision for the nomination of electors save by the state party convention, and if a party has not been organized and held such a convention there is no provision in the statute whereby it may be provided with electors.

EDWIN VAIL, Assistant Attorney General. POWER OF LEGISLATURE TO FIX TIME FOR CITY ELECTIONS IN METROPOLITAN CITIES UNDER HOME RULE CHARTER April 19, 1935. Mr. Anton J. Tusa, Election Commissioner, Omaha, Nebraska. The question to be considered in this opinion is whether the Legislature has the power to fix the time for the holding! of city elections in cities of the metropolitan class, which have adopted home rule charters in which the time of such elections has been fixed. • ' ■ r . In other words, may the Legislature amend provisions of such a charter without violation of the Constitution? The answer to this question depends upon whether the regulation of city elections in home rule cities is a matter of purely local concern or a matter of such state governmental interest that it may be constitutionally dealt with by general laws of the state. So far as we know, the Supreme Court of Nebraska has not defined the line of demarcation between local and general matters so as to establish a rule by which any one can say arbitrarily what is or is not a matter of local concern. Our court has held that this question must be determined by the facts, circumstances and subject matter of each particular case: for instance. in the case of Carlberg v. Metcalfe, 120 Neb. 481, the court said: "It is evident that article XI of the Constitution contemplated a division between state affairs and municipal affairs. The language is that. certain cities may frame a charter for their own government consistent with the Constitution and laws of the state. The Con - stitution does not define which laws relate to matters of strictly municipal concern and which to sta^e affairs. There is no sure test which will enable us to distinguish between matters of strictly municipal concern and those of state concern. The court must consider each case as it arises and draw the line of demarcation." </seg>
            <seg id="p103">OPINIONS The above case involved the question as to whether the act of the Legislature authorizing the establishment of a municipal university in the city of Omaha, and the regulation thereof, dealt with a matter of strictly municipal or one of state concern; and the court held that it was a matter of state concern and that the statute was, therefore, valid. On the other hand, in the case of Sandell v. City of Omaha, 115 Neb. 8G1. the court held valid an amendment to the city charter relating to the streets and boulevards, which was in conflict with a state law, on the ground that the improvement of streets and boulevards was a matter purely of local concern, as distinguished from a state matter. But in the latter case it was :il.so held that: "It is not easy in all cases to distinguish between municipal powers and state powers. We must, therefore, content ourselves with the consideration of each case as it arises, applying those principles which procedure and logic approve." In McBain on the Law and the Practice of Municipal Home Rule, we find that a number of states have adopted amendments to their Constitutions which are in almost precisely the same language as that in our Constitution, whereby cities are authorized to adopt home rule charters "consistent with and subject to the constitution and laws of this state" (Sec. 2 of Article XI Nebraska Constitution) and in the majority of these states, according to this authority, the courts have held that regulation of municipal elections should be controlled by the general laws of the state rather than the pro - visions of the home rule charter. In the case of Ewing v. Hobligzcllc, 85 Mo. 64, the court held that a general state law which prescribed the method of conducting elections at which state, as well as municipal officers, were elected, superseded the provisions of the charter of the city of St. Louis. On page 145 of his work, McBain says: "On the whole, therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that the doctrine of the Missouri cases has been taken to mean that as to all matters concerning elections, municipal or otherwise, a state law supersedes and controls a contrary provision in a home rule charter." The Missouri Constitution was identical with ours. Under a similar Constitution, a state law which changed the time of city elections was held to be a general law, superior to the provisions of the home rule charter of San Francisco and. therefore, valid. It appears that the states of Washington and Colorado have had similar rulings. </seg>
            <seg id="p104">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Our Constitution provides (Sec. 4 Art. XVII) for the general election of all officers except school district and municipal officers. It does not fix the time of election of those officers. Since our Constitution is a limitation upon the power of the Legislature, then the Legislature may enact such laws as are not expressly prohibited by the Constitution, and since there is no con - stitutional limitation upon the power toi regulate municipal elections, by general law, we believe that it is within the province of our Legislature to enact laws fixing the time for holding city elections, even though such laws may affect, alter or amend the present provisions of city charters adopted pursuant to the authority contained in Article XI of the Constitution, and that such a law should be held by our Supreme Court to be a matter of such concern to the state at large as would be not a matter of purely local con - cern but of general state concern, and thjat such a law, though amending the charter, would not, for that reason, be invalid. Of course such a law could not refer to any specific election or to any specific city, so as to be special or class legislation, which is prohibited by Section 18 of Art. Ill of the Constitution.) It would have to be a general law, applying to all cities of the class or! classes affected, whether metro - politan, first class or some other class. Such a law would possibly have the effect of extending the terms of the present officers. A law passed for the pijrpose of extending the terms of the officers would be invalid (State v. Plasters, 74 Neb. 652); but the mere fact that it might incidentally extend such terms could not affect its validity (State v. Stewart, 52 Neb. 243; State v. Reilly, 94 Neb. 232). On July 18, 1922 the city of Omaha adopted a home rule charter, pur - suant to the Constitution, by the terms of which the then charter of the city, as found in the statutes of Nebraska! was adopted as the home rule charter. Since that time the Legislature has repeatedly amended and changed the charter, both directly and indirectly, as shown by Sections 14 - 528, 14-540 and Articles 12 and 13 of Chapter 14 of the 1933 Compiled Sup - plement, C. S. of Nebraska; and other laws affecting all cities, generally enacted since 1922. The validity of these amendments and additions to the charter has not been questioned, except in the case of Articlfe XIII referring to the municipal university involved in one of the cases cited above. The matter of city elections in metropolitan cities is dealt with not only in Chapter 14 of our statutes, but also! in the general election statutes found in Chapter 32; for instance, the office of election commissioner, filled by appointment of the Governor is given general powers over certain election matters, which directly affect elections of city officers in metropolitan cities in counties of over 150,000 population. I </seg>
            <seg id="p105">OPINIONS We therefore conclude that the question set forth in the beginning of this opinion ■should be answered in the affirmative. MILTON C. MURPHY, Assistant Attorney General. September 22, 1936. Honorable Harry R. Swanson, Secretary of State, Building.

You inquire whether any additional signatures received at September 29; meeting may be added to those already obtained to make up the 750 required to form a new party. In our opinion, section 32-1135, requires all 750 electors to be present at the same convention at the same time. In the absence of 750 at the first convention; not enough were present to form a convention legally. Con - sequently any signatures obtained at a later date may not be added to those already obtained in order to make up the 750 required. DANIEL STUBBS, Assistant Attorney General.

Elections to that office, therefore, are governed by the provisions of the so-called "Corrupt Practices Act", which by its terms is made applicable to offices created by the laws of the state, which are to be filled by popular election. Similarly, the provisions of said act wheh define the phrase "Political Committee" (32-2017) and provide for the appointment of a treasurer of such committee (20-2018) and define his duties are applicable in my opinion to those associated together to raise money for the support or defeat of any measure submitted to a vote of the electoratp of the city.

The city council or officials are all on the relief rolls except clerk and treasurer and treasurer has no bond." In order to be legally qualified to hold the office of village trustee, a man should be a taxpayer of the village at the time of election. Section 17-203 Comp. Stat. Neb. 1929 provides that "Any person may be a trustee who shall have attained the age ol twenty-one years and shall be a citizen of the United States, who shall have been a bona fide residerit and taxpayer of the village at the time of his election and shall have resided therein for three months next preceding his election; * •" I do not believe a man or woman necessarily needs to be a taxpayer in order to hold a school district office, but that is necessary, unless the party has children of school age residing with him or her in the district. </seg>

Thus it is said in relation to the directors of a private corporation: " • • -• • a majority of the directors must be present at a meeting to constitute a quorum • s * unless the power is given to a lesser number. * * * the rules of the common law " ' * require a majority to be present." 7 Ruling Case Law 146 7 Ruling Case Law 338 19 Ruling Case Law 888 25 Ruling Case Law 378 The County Central Committee in the instant controversay, has authority to act by reason of the power conferred upon it by the legislature. That body (the creating power) prescribed that | the County Central Committee shall, • • * by majority vote of a quorum * ' * elect a successor and shall forthwith transmit the choice to the Governor. One observes that the legislature did not vest any power in a number less than a quorum to act, nor did it prescribe that a lesser number than a majority should constitute a quorum. The very apparent conclusion is. therefore, that the legislature did not intend to disturb the common law rule which holds that a majority of the members is necessary to constitute a quorum. The silence of the creating power ' indicates that the common law rule persists. It is our opinion, therefore, that as the instant County Central Com - mittee was composed of 55 members, at least 28 members were necessary to constitute a quorum, and that action by a Jesser number was a nullity. PAUL P. CHANEY, Assistant Attorney General. L EXEMPTION FROM GASOLINE TAX ON GASOLINE SOLD THROUGH POST EXCHANGES ETC. September 19, 1936. Colonel James Totten, Adjutant General, Headquarters Seventh Corps Area. Omaha, Nebraska. We have your favor of the 11th instant relative to the exemption from immunity to the usual gasoline tax on gasoline sold through post exchanges. </seg>
            <seg id="p109">OPINIONS etc. We have given careful consideration to the matter and we do not agree with your construction of the nature of the tax in this state. ... The statute imposing the tax is section 66-405, as amended, Special Session Laws 1935, p. 127, and not section 66-416 to which you refer, although we do not consider that important. Section 66-405 provides: "Every dealer * * * shall at the time said statement is filed pay a tax of five cents per gallon upon all motor vehicle fuels, as shown by such statement * *." Section 66-416 was enacted to catch any loose ends such as was supposed to exist in the case of Burke v. Bass, 123 Neb. 297 and to prevent any gasoline from escaping taxation even though the dealer was not required to pay it. The tax is not an occupation or license fee, but is a tax on the com - modity itself and its sale, distribution or use in this state. Burke v. Bass. 123 Neb. 297. The fact that it is called an excise tax does not militate against this conclusion nor make the tax an occupation or license fee. An excise tax includes sales taxes and use taxes as well as occupation taxes. It is a term much broader than occupation tax and is not synonymous with it. See Pattnn v. Brady, 184 U. S. 608; Pac. Ins. Co. v. Soule, 74 U. S. (7 Wall.) 433, 435; Words &amp; Phrases, Excise, and cases cited. An occupation tax is one measured by a percentage of the receipts of the business rather than by a flat charge on each unit of a commodity. We are not ready to say that the Nebraska gasoline tax is a flat sales tax because it is something more than that. But it is not a tax on the dealer. Gasoline sold through post exchanges to private individuals and used on the highways of this state is taxable to someone in any event. If the exchange is exempt the individual using the gasoline is by section 66-416, supra, obligated for the tax and if it has not been collected in the past it is because of the difficulty of enforcement and not because of lack of liability. The question of whether the dealer is simply an agent to collect the tax for the State from the ultimate consumer is now in litigation. See Smithberger v. Banning, 5 S. C. J. 409. We do not feel it necessary at this time to decide whether the Act of Congress lifting the exemption accorded to Federal territory is applicable in Nebraska. With our view of the nature of the tax before you we shall be pleased to first receive your opinion in the matter. DANIEL STUBBS, Assistant Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p110">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL TAX ON GASOLINE IN TANKS OF BUS November 25, 1935. Mr. Floyd Atkins, Chief Inspector, Department of Agriculture, Building. You inquire whether a bus carrying passengers is subject to the in - spection at port of entry and tax on all fuel over twenty gallons which they carry, under H. R. 419, 1935 Session, 1935 Session Laws, p. 583. The answer is yes. Section 2 of the Acti imposing the tax and section 3 providing for inspection both expressly include buses. DANIEL STUBBS, Assistant Attorney General PORT OF ENTRY LAWS APPLIED TO TRUCKS TRANSPORTING GASOLINE February 24. 19ri(i Honorable Alva Zieme, County Judge, Beaver City, Nebraska. You inquire what vehicles must stop at a' port of entry. Section 3, H. R. 419. 1935 Session Laws, page 584, requires trucks not transporting gasoline which have a capacity o'£ more than twenty gallons for fuel to be used in the engine to stop. You will thus perceive that the capacity of the tank and not the amount carried designates which trucks shall stop. If the capacity is over twenty gallons but less than twenty gallons is carried, of course no tax is due. :■-■.. i DANIEL STUBBS, Assistant Attorney General. INSPECTION FEE ON GASOLINE February 27. 193U. Mr. Wm. B. Banning. Director, Department of Agriculture, Building. You inquire whether a refund of an inspection fee on gasoline which after inspection is shipped out of the state, should be permitted. We do not believe such a refund is possible. To avoid the fee, the dealer must declare at the time it is brought into the state that it is not to be sold or distributed in Nebraska. If he does not do so, and permits an in - spection, we do not believe a refund is proper. DANIEL STUBBS, Assistant Attorney General. </seg>

I We are this day in receipt of your letter dated September 23, 1936, en - closing a copy of a letter addressed to you by Cal A. Ward, Regional Director, dated September 1, 1936. The first presented question is stated by you as follows: "1. May the public funds of the state and political subdivisions thereof and other local governing or public administrative bodies be used for the payment of premiums or workmen's compensation insurance or other equivalent form of insurance covering signatories of voluntary work agreements?" It is our opinion that the several political divisions may use their respective funds for the purpose of buying protection against loss that might be suffered by one employed by them. Payment for this protection would be dependent upon whether funds were available in the accounts to be charged against. The second presented question is stated by you as follows: "2. Are the state and its political subdivisions and other local authorities authorized by law to assume liability for injuries sustained by assigned voluntary work agreement signatories?" </seg>
            <seg id="p112">REPORT OF ATTORNEjY GENERAL Section 48-114, C.

The third presented question is stated by you as follows: "3.

This will acknowledge our receipt of your letter relative to the legality of a plan so prevalent throughout the state, which plan is known as bank night. - Although the question has never been presented to the Supreme Court of this state, it is our opinion that bank night conducted in accordance with the following plan is not a statutory violation. The plan provides in part that the theater conducting bank night shall keep its registration book in the open so as all persons desiring to do so may register their names without being required to purchase a ticket to the theater. The plan further pro - vides that the operator of the theater will conduct his drawing at a stated time and that he will install loud speakers on the outside of the theater so as persons standing outside of the theater will be advised of the name of the winner simultaneously with all other persons. If the person whose name is called is outside of the theater hejis permitted to enter and claim his award without purchasing a ticket. </seg>
            <seg id="p113">OPINIONS The presence of the above three elements of the contract brings the plan of bank night, in our opinion, outside of the lottery laws of our state. The question of the legality of bank night is now before the Supreme Court of the State of Iowa, and it is probable that a decision will be handed down by that tribunal at an early date. Whatever decision is reached in that court will be of assistance to us in this state for the reason that our lottery laws are very similar. PAUL P. CHANEY, Assistant Attorney General. LEGALITY OF "SCOOPO" October 31, 1935. Mr. Ladd J. Hubka, Attorney at Law, Beatrice, Nebraska. You have sent advertising material and asked for an opinion of this department as to whether the merchandising plan known as "Scoopo" is a lottery within the meaning of the Nebraska statute. It is our opinion that this plan contains the essential elements which go to make up a lottery and that the operation of the plan in this state would be a violation of our statutory laws. PAUL P. CHANEY, Assistant Attorney General. LOTTERIES October 9,1935. Mr Wilber S. Aten, County Attorney, Holdrege, Nebraska. We are advised of a plan of merchandising which is now in operation in Holdrege, Nebraska. The plan is operated under the name of the "Holdrege Treasury Day Club" and seems to be sponsored by the local chamber of commerce. The information furnished to us as to the operation of this plan is that with each purchase by a customer from a store that is a member of the club, the purchaser may be registered, and on Saturday a drawing is held and only those present at the drawing are entitled to the award. Under this plan, it is our opinion that the same constitutes a violation of the lottery laws of this state. Our support for this position is the case of Kieck vs..

PAUL P. CHANEY, Assistant Attorney General. GAMBLING DEVICES April 6. 1935. Mr. Raymond B. Morrissey, County Attorney, Tecumseh, Nebraska. We are in receipt of your letter replying to our letter relative to gambl - ing devices in Johnson County. It is our opinion that ball machines may be gambling devices. Like a deck of cards, they are not gambling devices per sc. The use that the machines are put to is the fact that determines the question. If a merchant is in possession of a ball machine and gives either merchandise or cash of unequal value to the different persons who play the machine, based entirely upon the score made by them, then in that event it is our opinion that the machines are being used as gambling devices. The writer remembers clearly when the machines were first introduced that they were merely a game whereby the player would place a coin in the machine, play ten balls, and of course, receive nothing in return. An essential element of gambling, viz, a prize, was entirely absent, and the machines were thereby legal. A majority of the machines have since the time of their introduction changed in character by reason of the desire ot the person having them in possession to create a bigger play and invoke the gambling spirit. It is therefore our opinion that if prizes of either cash or merchandise, of unequal values are paid to the different players that the same are beinn used as gambling devices and that they should be confiscated and the oper - ators prosecuted. PAUL P. CHANEY. Assistant Attorney General June 21, 1935. The so-called "ten ball" and "ball" machines as have been in general operation throughout the state are not, in themselves, gambling devices prohibited by statute. However, a large; percentage oi these machines in </seg>

I ■■ ■ ■ ' ' I A machine of the type referred to, which is for amusement only and does not pay cash, merchandise or the privilege of re-play without further coin deposit, it not a prohibited machine. In playing a machine of this description the player deposits a coin and plays the machine and the play of the machine constitutes the amusement which he has purchased and -paid for. On the contrary, a machine of the type referred to, which may be for amusement, but also pays cash, merchandise or a privilege to re-play without further coin deposit, said benefits or awards being dependent upon the score obtained on the play, is prohibited by statute. PAUL P. CHANEY, Assistant Attorney General. June 7, 1935. Nebraska Liquor Control Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. You have ask for our opinion upon the question of whether or not alcoholic liquor which is transported into this state for delivery to a licensed manufacturing or distributing agency may be stored in a public bonded warehouse which is not the holder of a manufactuer's or distributor's license. Section 22 of the liquor law provides, in part, "Any such liquor arriving at a point of entry in the. state of Ne - braska, may be entered under such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe, for the transportation in bond to any bonded warehouse in the State of Nebraska." Under this provision, your body has the right to prescribe such rules and regulations relating to the shipment of liquor into the State as are not in, conflict with the provisions of the law. The liquor law requires that all shipments of liquor into this State must be consigned to a licensed manufacturer or distributor, who maintains a bonded warehouse. It also provides that the transportation of such liquor to said bonded warehouse must be made by a common carrier which has been designated by the Commission as a liquor carrier. From a study of the law, we have come to the conclusion that the Com - mission has the right to pass a rule or regulation determining that until delivery has actually been made to the warehouse of a licensed manufacturer or] distributor, that such liquor shall be deemed and considered to be "in </seg>
            <seg id="p116">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL transit". That during the time such liquor remains "in transit" it is within your power to permit the storage thereof in a public bonded warehouse in the State. That storage in such public bonded warehouse is to be considered as "storage in transit." However, your rule must include provisions requiring that such liquor which is stored 'in transit" must be delivered only to a designated liquor carrier and then only for delivery to the consignee thereof, who must be a manufacturer or distributor, licensed by you as such. Yo\i should also require that the public warehouse wherein such liquor is stored "in transit" furnish bond guaranteeing compliance with the law and the rules and regulations of the Commission. Further, you should re - quire reports from the public warehouse of all liquor received by it, as well as reports of removal of any liquor from such warehouse. These reports are necessary in order that your Commission will have full information of all shipments of liquor into this State. We are submitting herewith a proposed rule and regulation for your Commission, which we believe covers this subject. WM. H. WRIGHT, Attorney General. COPY Wherever alcoholic liquor, except beer, shall be transported into this state, consigned to a licensed distributor or manufacturer of alcoholic liquor, such alcoholic liquor shall be deemed and considered to remain in transit until it is delivered to the bonded warehouse of the consignee there - of, and such alcoholic liquor may be stored in transit in a public bonded warehouse within the State of Nebraska, upon the following terms and conditions. 1. That such public bonded warehouse wherein such alcoholic liquor is to be stored in transit shall have filed with the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission a corporate surety bond in the amount of S conditioned that said public bonded warehouse will in all respects comply with the terms and conditions of this order, and with the provisions of H. R. 128, 50th Session Nebraska Legislature, and the rules and regulations of this Commission in so far as the same are applicable to said public bonded warehouse. 2. That said public bonded warehouse in which any alcoholic liquor. except beer, shall be stored in transit, shall, within hours of receipt of such alcoholic liquor, give written notice to the Liquor Con - trol Commission of receipt thereof, stating the names of the consignor and consignee, the description of the liquor and the name of the carrier which delivered such liquor to said public bonded warehouse. </seg>

That said public bonded warehouse shall make delivery of such liquor, or any part thereof, only to a common carrier which has been desig - nated by the Commission as a liquor carrier, for delivery by such carrier to a licensed manufacturer or distributor who is the consignee of such liquor. 4. That within '. hours after such liquor has been removed from such public bonded warehouse for delivery to the consignee thereof, the public bonded warehouse shall make written report to the Ne - braska Liquor Control Commission setting out the common carrier to which such liquor has been delivered, the name of the consignee thereof and a description of the liquor so delivered. ■ - ' PROHIBITION OF SALES BY PACKAGE UNDER ORDINANCE OF CITY; ETC. June 10, 1935. Mr. Benton Perry, City Attorney, York, Nebraska. I have your letter of June 6th, in which you ask whether or not a city can by ordinance prevent the sale of intoxicating liquors by the package. In answer to that question, would say that it was declared to be the policy of this state by House Roll No. 128 that sale by the package should be universal throughout the state until April 30, 1937. During that time any ordinance of a city which attempted to bar the sale of intoxicating liquors by the package would be void and of no effect. After that time, of course, the city has the opportunity to vote upon the question and if the vote was against the sale of liquor by the package, then your city would have the power to pass an ordinance forbidding the sale of intoxicating liquors by the package within the limits of the municipality. WM. H. WRIGHT, Attorney General. LABELING OF BEER June 10, 1935. Falstaff Brewing Corporation, Saint Louis, Mo. I We have your letter of May 31st, wherein you ask for state regulations regarding labeling of beer. Section 31 of House Roll No. 128 sets out the requirements relating to labels on liquors. This section requires the alcoholic content of all liquors </seg>
            <seg id="p118">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL except beer to be placed on the label. As the law now stands, there is no provision that requires any statement on the label of the beer bottle relating to the alcoholic content of the beer therein contained. There is nothing to forbid a label from containing-- a statement of the alcoholic content. The Liquor Control Commission has tht power to permit or forbid any statement on the label as to alcoholic content of beer. As yet the Commission has made no ruling on this. WM. H. WRIGHT, Attorney General. LIQUOR LICENSE BOND June 17. 1935. The Harry A. Koch Company, Omaha, Nebraska. In reply to your inquiry of June 12, as to whether the provision in the form of the liquor, license bond required by the Commission under H. R. 128. which binds the principal and surety to the state, city and liquor commission, and each of them, jointly or severally, creates an aggregate liability of three times the penalty of the bond, will advise that in our opinion this form of bond is a several one, so that either of the obligees could sue upon it independently of the others, or jointly with them, but in no event do we believe the surety would be liable for more than the total penalty or face of the bond. In other words, we agree with the opinion expressed in your letter. MILTON C. MURPHY, Assistant Attorney General. LIQUOR LICENSE, ETC. June 20, 1935. Mr. George G. Proud, City Attorney. Arapahoe, Nebraska. I have your letter of June 14th, wherein you ask for our advice as to the steps necessary to securing a liquor license. In your letter you do not state what type of a license the party who consulted you desires. I assume, however, you are referring to a package sale license of intoxicating liquors other than beer. If that is true, it is necessary that your party secure an application and set out the information </seg>
            <seg id="p119">OPINIONS therein required. At the same time he should have a bond executed in the amount of $2,000.00, signed by a corporate surety company, as surety, and should forward the application and the bond, together with the full amount of the- license fee, to the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission. The fee for a package sale license, which is commonly known as an "off-sale" license, is $150.00. The $250.00 license fee referred to in your letter is the com - bination license fee for the sale of intoxicating liquors other than beer both by j the package and by the drink, or in other words, — both "on-sale" and "off -sale". Of course, unless the city wherein your party lives has voted to permit sale of intoxicating liquor other than beer by the drink, your party - would not be entitled to the "on-sale" license. In any event, the application for an "on-sale" license is made to the city council rather than to the Liquor Control Commission. j It is unnecessary for your city to pass an ordinance authorizing the sale of liquor by the package within the city. Under the statute, package sale of liquor is to be universal throughout the state until April 30, 1937, and the city council can neither permit nor forbid a sale of liquor by the package. The only power that the city council has in connection with the sale of liquor by the package is the power to recommend to the state com - mission as to whether or not they favor a license being granted to a par - ticular applicant. The city has the power to levy an occupation tax upon the business, yet this is not a prerequisite to the right to conduct a liquor business for sale by the package. It is merely a privilege that the city has. If the city fails to pass an ordinance levying occupation tax, then, of course, the licensee need not pay such tax. ; Your city clerk should have in his possession application blanks as well as forms for the bond. Your party can secure these blanks at his office. In making application for a package sale license for the balance of the year, — that is, from the present date to the 1st of May, 1936, — your party need send only the proportionate fee for the balance of the license year. He must also send a $2.00 check to the Commission to cover the costs of registration. As soon as the Commission receives his application, which should be made in! duplicate, they will send the duplicate copy to the city council and will withhold granting a license for fifteen days, during which time the city council may make its recommendations. If the license is denied, your party will secure back the money paid in by him, with the exception of the $2.00 registration fee. The application for a license to sell beer should be made to the city cbuncil instead of the Liquor Commission. TO H. WRIGHT, Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p120">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL I • LIQUOR LICENSE TO BISHOP CLARKSON MEMORIAL HOSPITAL June 24, 1935. Honorable R. L. Cochran, Governor of the State of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska. We have the telegram, directed to you, from Bishop Clarkson Hospital asking advice on procedure to purchase alcohol. We have previously given opinion upon this question, wherein we have advised that no one except licensed manufacturers or wholesalers are authorized to import alcohol into this state. [ Hospitals desiring to use alcohol are permitted to take out a non-beverage user's license, by payment of the fee prescribed in section 26 and furnishing the bond required by section 92. If this is done, such hospital may then purchase alcohol direct from a whole - saler and thereby avoid payment of the gallonage tax fixed by Section 50. Unless such hospital holds such non-beverage user's license, it can purchase - only from a retailer licensed in this state and must pay the gallonage tax. Under no circumstances is a hospital authorized to import alcohol into this state direct from the distillery. Section 2, subsection 8 defines a non-beverage user as follows: "The words 'non-beverage user' means every manufacturer of any of the products set forth and described in subsection (a) of section 50 of this act, when the same contains alcohol, and all laboratories and hospitals and sanatoria using alcohol for non-beverage pur - poses." Clearly it is the intent of house roll 128 that hospitals must obtain a non-beverage user's license in order to purchase alcohol tax free. If the . Clarkson Hospital will make application for a non-beverage user's license, I am certain it would receive such license with little or no delay. Had such application been made a month ago, they would have had their license now and could purchase all the alcohol they need, free of the tax thereon. This hospital can now buy all the alcohol they want from any retailer licensed in this state, but until such time as they secure a non-beverage user's license, they must pay the state gallonage tax upon such alcohol.

            <seg id="p121">• OPINIONS LIQUOR LAW— H. R. 128 June 26, 1935. Mr. W. H. Line. County Attorney, Loup City, Nebraska. I have your letter of June 25th, wherein you ask if a violation of the liquor law occurring prior to the passage of H. R. 128 would bar a person from receiving a license under the provisions of the new act. There are some contradictory provisions contained in the liquor law upon this subject. Section 28, which treats with the granting of all types of licenses, under sub-section 12, provides: "A person who, within a period of five years prior to the date of his application for license has been convicted of or pled guilty to a violation of any federal or state law concerning the manufacture, possession or sale of alcoholic liquor, subsequent to the passage of this Act, or shall have forfeited his bond to appear in court to answer charges for any such violation." The old beer law was retained in part in the present law, and in the section dealing with the statements that must be contained in the application, we find the provision that the applicant must state that he has never been convicted or pled guilty to a violation of the laws relating to the sale of alcoholic liquors. This provision applies only to applications for beer licenses, while Section 28 applies to all licenses. It will be necessary to adopt one theory or the other, and since a person obtaining a liquor license would not be barred by reason of a conviction for a violation of the liquor laws which occurred prior to the passage of the present law, I do not feel that a person who desires a beer license should have any greater restrictions put on him in regard to his qualifications than would the applicant for a whiskey license. I have, therefore, advised the Commission that they must treat all . applicants alike and should accept the provisions of Section 28, and should treat the provisions of Section 99, quoted in your letter, as referring to' convictions for violations of the liquor laws occurring subsequent to the passage of this act. The granting of beer licenses is in the discretion of the city council, and most certainly they should take into consideration a person's past con - duct. If the applicant has been guilty of numerous violations of the old liquor law, I would say this to be a very fair indication of the manner in which he would conduct a beer business. The council would be justified in refusing to grant such a person a license if they saw fit, even though the person was not disqualified by the statute. WM. H. WRIGHT, Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p122">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL DELIVERY BY RETAIL LICENSEES June 27. 1935. Nebraska Liquor Control Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. We have been confronted with a number of questions relating to the matter of delivery of alcoholic liquors in the original package to purchasers, where the sale by the retailer is hoi followed by delivery to the purchaser in person at the place of business of the licensee. There are a number of angles to this question, the three most important being as follows: 1. May the retailer, upon receiving an order for package alcoholic liquor deliver the same in person or by an employe to the pur - chaser outside the place of business of the licensee? 2. May such delivery be made by a third party not a regular em - ploye of the licensee? 3. Where payment for the purchase is not made until actual de - livery to the purchaser, is there any extension of credit which violates the provisions of the Nebraska Liquor Control Act? 1. The first question would arise in connection with all retail licensees. and particularly in the case of hotels, where frequent requests are made for delivery to rooms from the place of sale. The Uniform Sales Act, Article 4 of Chapter 69 C. S. Neb. 1929. contains the following definition: "A sale of goods is an agreement whereby the seller transfers the property in goods to the buyer for a consideration called the price." Section 69-418 C. S. Neb. 1929 is as follows: "1. Where there is a contract to j sell specific or ascertained goods, the property in them is transferred to the buyer at such time as the parties to the contract intend it to be transferred. 2. For the purpose of ascertaining the intention of the parties, regard shall be had to the terms of the contract, ithe conduct of the parties, usages of trade and the circumstances ofj the case." Under Section 69-419 certain rules for ascertaining the intention of the parties as to the time at which the properly in goods is to pass to the buyer are laid down. Rule 1 provides:' "Where there is an unconditional contract to sell specific goods, in a deliverable state, the property in the goods passes to the </seg>
            <seg id="p123">OPINIONS buyer when the contract is made and it is immaterial whether the time of payment, or the time of delivery, or both, be postponed." ■ Rule 2 provides: ■ "Where there is a contract to sell specific goods and the seller is bound to do something to the goods, for the purpose of putting them into a deliverable state, the property does not pass until such thing be done." (Under the above rule, if it were necessary to separate the specific item involved in the sale from the bulk of the merchandise in the stock of the seller and put it into condition for delivery, the words 'bound to do something' would apply.) Under these provisions of the statute, it would seem that the time or the method of delivery or payment for the goods involved is immaterial, .so far as the question as to when the sale is made and completed and title to the goods passes from the seller to the buyer, is concerned. Section 25 (d) of the Nebraska Liquor Control Act provides; "A retailer's license shall allow the licensee to sell and offer for sale at retail either in the original package or otherwise, as therein prescribed, in the premises specified in such license, alcoholic liquors or beer regardless of alcoholic content, for use or con - sumption, but not for resale in any form." It is our opinion that a licensee would be making a sale "in the premises" specified in his license where he took an order from a buyer by telephone, or otherwise, for package alcoholic liquor in his place of business and took such steps as were necessary to segregate the items ordered from the bulk of his stock and placed them in a deliverable state, and that there would be no violation of the law in thereafter making delivery of the same by his own employe or agent to the purchaser at the place designated by the purchaser, and receiving payment either at the time of the placing of the order or of delivery of the merchandise to the purchaser through such agent, employe, or otherwise. In other words, we believe that a licensed retailer operating a hotel or any other business may make a sale of alcoholic liquors in the licensed premises and make delivery and collection of the purchase price by himself, his agent or employe, outside of the licensed premises. See 55 C. J. 535 and the subject of sales generally in 55 C. J. 2. If we are correct in our opinion to the first question therein, then it would necessarily follow that a sale might be made by a retail licensee in his place of business and that delivery of the items sold might be made through a third person, such as a common carrier or an agent or employe of the purchaser, at a place other than the licensed premises, regardless of </seg>
            <seg id="p124">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL the time or place of payment therefor, so long as no extension of credit to the purchaser be involved. Aside from the matter of credit, which we shall discuss herein, we think that delivery of the alcoholic liquors from the licensed premises of a re - tailer could lawfully be made through the agency of such carriers as taxi - cabs, messenger boys of telegraph companies, express companies or other carriers, public or private or agents or employes of the purchaser, so far as the law of this state is concerned. We think that if there were any question as to the correctness of our views upon the first question above, yet we are correct on this second question for the reason that delivery in the licensed premises to any car - rier or messenger employed by the purchaser, directly or incidentally, is the same as delivery in the licensed premises to the purchaser himself, so far as the law is concerned. As above pointed out, the sale in the premises is completed and the property in the merchandise is transferred when an unconditional contract involving goods in a deliverable state is made, regardless of the time or place of payment or delivery. In the case under consideration the sale, as well as the delivery, is actually made to the purchaser or his agent in the licensed premises. 3. The third question above stated is necessarily involved in a con - sideration of the other two. Section 40 of the Nebraska Liquor Control Act prohibits the sale or furnishing of alcoholic liquor at retail to any person on credit, and provides that any person who shall extend credit therefore shall not be allowed to recover from the debtor, except in the case of clubs and hotels. Of course any carrier who actively participated in a sale of alcoholic - liquor on credit would be violating this section of the Act. Generally speaking, however, the matter of credit is not one with which the carrier would be concerned. Frequently a sale would be made by virtue of an order received in the licensed premises from without, and delivery to be made by the retailer or by a carrier or agent, expressly or impliedly selected and designated by the purchaser, with collection of the purchase price to be made for the seller by the one making the delivery. Would the fact that payment was not made prior to or coincident with the actual sale, and not until actual delivery into the hands of the purchaser constitute this a sale on credit? We think not. It is our opinion that a sale in the premises with payment "collect on delivery" or "cash on delivery" is not a credit transaction. Rule 4 of Section 69-419 Comp. Stat. Neb. 1929 is as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p125">OPINIONS "Where there is a contract to sell unascertained or future goods by description, and goods of that description and in a deliverable state are unconditionally appropriated to the contract, either by the seller, with the assent of the buyer, or by the buyer with the assent of the seller, the property in the goods thereupon passes to the buyer. Such assent may be expressed or implied, and may be given either before or after the appropriation is made. "Where, in pursuance of a contract to sell, the seller delivers the goods to the buyer, or to a carrier or other bailee (whether named by the buyer or not) for the purpose of transmission to or holding for the buyer, he is presumed to have unconditionally appropriated the goods to the contract, except in the cases provided for in the next rule and in section 20. This presumption is applicable, al - though by the terms of the contract, the buyer is to pay the price before receiving delivery of the goods, and the goods are marked with the words 'collect on delivery' or their equivalents." See 55 C. J. 369, 567, 575, 591 ■ ' ' ' ■ ■ ■ ' ". ."■-!■■■ 11 C. J. 24, 939 10 C. J. 278 In the latter work it is said: "* * * w here an order for such liquors has been accepted by the seller and the liquors have been delivered to the carrier for trans - portation c. o. d. to the buyer, the sale is made: that is, the title passes where the liquors are delivered to the carrier, and not where the carrier delivers the liquor to the buyer and accepts payment of the purchase price." In 33 C. J. 598, it is stated that where it is necessary to ascertain when and where a sale of intoxicating liquors is made, reference should be made to the general rules on the subject of sales. We have, therefore, applied the uniform sales act to the problems discussed herein. We can see no objection, under the Nebraska Liquor Control Act, to retail liquor licensees making deliveries of package liquor off the licensed premises through their own agents or to carriers for the purchasers in the licensed premises c. o. d. In either event, no credit transaction is involved. This applies to messengers of telegraph companies employed in making deliveries, as well as other carrying agencies. Since there is actually no sale to the carriers in transactions of this kind, we do not think that it would be material whether the carrier or the employe of the carrier was a minor or one of full age. </seg>
            <seg id="p126">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL We have considered sections and provisions of the Nebraska Liquor Control Act in writing this opinion and do not believe that it conflicts there - with. "Sec. 2 (12) The word 'retailer' rr eans a person who sells, or offers for sale, alcoholic liquors for use and consumption and not for resale in any form." "Sec. 2 (15) The word 'sale' means any transfer, exchange or barter in any manner or by means whatsoever for a consideration, and includes and means all sales made by any person, whether principal, proprietor, agent, servant or employe." "Sec. 2 (16) The words 'to sell' include to solicit or receive an order for, to keep or expose for sale and to keep with intent to sell." Under the last provision it will be seen that the sale must actually take place in the licensed premises. The seller must be there at the time of the sale. Where the buyer is at that time is immaterial. "Sec. 1 (c) No person shall manufacture, bottle, blend, sell, barter, transport, deliver, furnish or possess any alcoholic liquor for bever - age purposes, except as specifically provided in this Act." Reading the above with the act as a whole, we do not think that it prohibits transportation or delivery under I he circumstances outlined above. "It shall not be lawful to sell alcoholic liquor at retail nor shall the commission grant or issue, or cause to be granted or issued, any license to sell alcoholic liquor at retail within the limits of any governmental subdivision of this state, while the prohibition against such sales, arising under Sections 5 and 48 of this Act. or otherwise as provided in this Act, is in effect; and if any such license be granted or issued in violation hereof the same shall be void: Pro - vided, this section shall not prohibit the issuance of a manu - facturer's or distributor's license in accordance with law by the commission in such prohibited territory." (Sec. 59) "The giving away or delivery of any alcoholic liquor for the pur - pose of evading any provision of: the preceding section or taking of orders or the making of agreements, at or within any govern - mental subdivision, while such sales are prohibited, for the sale or delivery of any alcoholic liquor, cr other shift or device to evade any provision of this Act, shall be held to be an unlawful selling." (Sec. 60) Under the foregoing sections of the Aqt, we believe that delivery by a retailer or his agent, to a purchaser, in a governmental subdivision where sales of alcoholic liquor are prohibited would be unlawful: but delivery to </seg>

Section 63 provides a penalty for selling alcoholic liquor at any place within the state, without having first obtained a valid license so to do under the provisions of the Act, and provides penalties for violations of other provisions of the act for which penalty is not otherwise provided. This opinion does not conflict with any part of this section; and since section 40 fixes the penalty for extension of credit as losing the right to recover the debt at law, it is probable that no other penalty for extension of credit is imposed. Common carriers, mentioned in section 69 of the Act, should comply therewith in making deliveries as discussed herein by obtaining a written receipt in each instance from the consignee in person or from his authorized agent. .

Our attention has been called to the question which has arisen in Falls City regarding the sale and disposition cf contraband alcoholic liquors seized by the sheriff. Under Section A of the Nebraska Liquor Control Act such liquor is to bo sold under order of the court. The special taxes imposed upon whole - sale and retail liquor dealers by Section 205J Title 26 U S C A do not apply to such sales, by reason of a specific provision of said section which is as follows: "No special tax shall be held to accrue on a sale of distilled spirits, wines or malt liquors made by a person who is not otherwise a dealer in liquors, where such spirits, wines or liquors * * have been levied on by any officer under order or process oi any court of (or) magistrate, and where such spirits are sold by such person in one parcel only, or at public auction in parcels not less than 20 wine gallons, * * " ." So far as such special Federal taxes are concerned, the sheriff may proceed with such sales under order of the 'court. However, if the liquor to be so sold has not been taxed under Chapter 5 Title 26 U S C A, the gallonage tax should jbe paid to the Federal Govern - ment by the officer holding the same underj an order of sale from a court of this state, prior to offering the same for sale, if such liquor is worth enough to justify the payment of such tax. Otherwise, such liquor will be subject to confiscation by the Federal authorities. Of course, where liquor which is seized is unfit for consumption, or is worth so little as to not justify the payment of the Federal tax, no attempt should be made to sell the same. In all cases the state gallonage tax shnulrl also be paid upon liquor sold by an officer under order of a court. </seg>
            <seg id="p129">OPINIONS Both the Federal and the state gallonage taxes, together with the costs of the sale, should be deducted from the proceeds of the sale to reimburse the officer paying the same, and only the balance should be remitted in the same manner as license fees, as provided by said Section 80. MILTON C. MURPHY, Assistant Attorney General. BOOKS AND RECORDS OF LIQUOR COMMISSION June 29, 1935. I Mr. J. A. JIcEachen, Nebraska Liquor Control Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. We are in receipt of your letter bearing date June 28th, wherein you advise that the request has been made of your body for the privilege of ex - amining your books and records for the purpose of compiling lists which the compiler sells to third parties. You further say that there is a possibility of the records being changed by the person compiling his personal list and 'hat the company bonding your employees would deny liability in the event of a shortage, on the grounds that the books had been changed by some person not authorized by law to have charge and control of them. It is our opinion that the records of your Department are public records, available to the public generally. By this we do not mean that it is mandatory upon you to reveal your records to every one who asks for them at your inconvenience. What we do mean is that the records are available to the public during your regular office hours and at times when the work of your Department will not be interfered with in any manner. You should, of course, in no event release your records to any individual, but you should, when making your records available to the public, keep them under the constant supervision of the person charged with the responsibility of their keep. PAUL P. CHANEY, Assistant Attorney General. SPECIAL ELECTION ON QUESTION OF SALE BY THE DRINK July 25. 1935. Mr. C. D. Siratton. Grand Island, Nebraska. In reply to your question as to when notice of a special flection upon the (question of drink sales of alcoholic liquors should be given, with reference to the time when petitions therefore are filed, will advise that in our opinion </seg>
            <seg id="p130">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL -.■■■ - such notices should be given as soon as the clerk has had a reasonable time within which to examine the petitions as to their sufficiency, unless an ordinance of the city prescribed a particular time for the giving of such notice. Such ordinance might be a special one with reference to liquor elections or a general one with reference to all special elections. We do not think that the giving of such notice can be arbitrarily delayed merely for the convenience of the city council or for other city matters. Section 48 of the Nebraska Liquor Control Act provides for the filing ol the petitions for special elections upon the question of licensing the sale ol alcoholic liquors, except beer, by the drink in all cities and villages of the state, "Whereupon, the municipal clerk shall cause to be published, etc." Although the word whereupon does not mean immediately, it means after or following, according to the authorities which we have investigated, yet in a law of this kind it confers no! right in the municipal clerk to arbitrarily delay proceeding with his dufies which the statute prescribes, and it might be that a clerk would be liable for damages caused by an un - reasonable or abritrary delay to the parties damaged. Section 48 of the liquor law also provides; "The provisions of the statutes of this state, relating to elections, officers, voting places, election apparatus and blanks, preparation and form of ballots, information to voters, delivery of ballots, calling of elections, conduct of elections, manner of voting, counting of votes, records and certificates of elections and recounts of votes. so far as applicable shall, apply! to voting on the proposition or propositions under the provisions of this Act." Section 16-217 Compiled Statutes 192&amp; authorizes cities to provide bj ordinance for the holding of special elections, therefore such an ordinance which fixed the time of giving notice of I special elections, after the filinj. of a proper petition therefore, would govern the notice of special elections of the kind in question.

City Attorney. Lincoln. Nebraska. Ir. your letter of July 19 you inquire: j . i . </seg>
            <seg id="p131">OPINIONS "1. Does the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission have power to revoke licenses to sell alcoholic liquor other than beer at retail in the original package within the City of Lincoln or does the City Council have such original power, subject to review by the Liquor Commission on appeal? "2. 11 the power be resident in the Nebraska Liquor Control Com - mission, what is the procedure to be taken before that body by the Mayor and Council of the City of Lincoln to obtain a hearing and what rules will govern said hearing on such revocation of license?" We have considered the sections of the Nebraska Liquor Control Act. referred to in your letter, and taking these sections together, in connection with the entire Act, it appears to us that the Legislature intended to vest the exclusive control over the matter of the sale of alcoholic liquor, other than beer, at retail in the original package in the Nebraska Liquor Com - mission at least until such time as the provisions for local option are given t-ltect. It is our opinion that Section 85, which provides in part "The local governing bodies of cities and villages shall also have the following powers, functions and duties with respect to licenses, other than licenses to * • * retailers to sell in the original package within corporate limits * '.*. • to revoke for cause all retail licenses to sell alcoholic liquors issued to persons for premises within their respective jurisdiction, subject to the right of appeal to the Com - mission " H&lt; veins and controls the provisions of sections 86 to 90 inclusive, and that the latter sections deal only with revocation of retail licenses which the local governing bodies are authorized by the other provisions of the Act to is ue. Under Section 5 of the Act exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Com - mission to Ltsuc licenses to sell alcoholic liquors other than beer at retail in the original package within the corporate limits of cities and villages. An.l Section 16 (1) gives the Commission power to revoke licenses of re - tailers. It is. therefore, our opinion that the Commission has exclusive and oijiginal jurisdiction in the matter of revocation of the class of licenses mentioned. The act does not set up any specific procedure for the re - vocation of such licenses and we understand that the Commission has not adopted any rules therefor, except that it has been giving notice and hearing lo licensees against whom complaints have been filed. </seg>
            <seg id="p132">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL We think that the local council or any individual, or group of individuals, residing in a city or village, may file a complaint with the Commission seeking the revocation of such a license issued to a person for premises with - in that city or village, and that if such complaint states facts sufficient to^ constitute grounds for the revocation of such license, the Commission will - fix a time and place for hearing thereon,! and give notice to the licensee and to the complaining parties thereof, probably directing the licensee to appear at that time and place to show cause, if any there be, why his license should not be revoked under the facts statejd in the complaint. Since the rules of procedure have not yet been worked out fully by the Commission, we merely suggest this as a logical means of bringing grounds for revocation of such licenses to the attention of the Commission.

August 14. 1935. Mr. C. E. McMonies, Lyons, Nebraska. In your letter of August 12th you inquire whether there is any provision of the Liquor Control Act prohibiting the issuance of licenses for the sale of beer where deeds of conveyance running (to the village contain provisions that the title shall revert to the grantor in 'case the sale of beer is licensed in the city or village, and our answer is that there is no specific provision in the Act in regard thereto. Sections 5 and 48 make specific provision in the case of licensing of the sale of alcoholic liquors other than beer. However, if there are such deeds of conveyance to property within the city or village, and the provisions thereof include beer, the city or village might by ordinance forbid the issuance of such licenses therein, and we believe that under such circumstances the liquor Control Commission should refuse to grant licenses therein if the city council or village board recom - mended that none should be granted. Such provisions in deeds are valid and enforceable, and regardless of the provisions of the Liquor Control Act the property rights of a city or village should not be jeopardized where such provisions exist and are not waived by the grantors or their heirs or assigns. If such provisons arc found in deeds of conveyance to private persons and do not run against city or village property, then the city or village is </seg>
            <seg id="p133">OPINIONS not concerned therewith and it is a matter involving only the title to the premises sought to be licensed — a private matter. If, as you state, the applicant mentioned in your letter has premises which are not subject to such a restriction, and if there are no conveyances in the chain of title to property owned by the village containing such re - strictions, then there is neither any public or private reason why the license should not be granted, if the applicant is otherwise qualified. MILTON C. MURPHY, Assistant Attorney General. SOLICITING LIQUOR SALES September 5, 1935. Ne jraska Liquor Control Commission. '| I I have the letter from Mr. Monsky which you have referred to this oflice for an opinion. In this letter the only question raised is whether or not the provisons of H. R. 128 will permit a retailer of alcoholic liquors to employ persons to solicit sales of liquor at places other than the licensed promises of such retailer. As I understand it, the plan presented is as follows: The retailer would employ a salesman who would go about the city wherein the licensed premises are located, or would go into other towns and would solicit orders for alcoholic liquors. These orders would then be mailed or taken to the licensed premises, where they would be approved or rejected by the licensee. If the orders were approved, the alcoholic liquors called for by such orders would be delivered by common carrier, or otherwise, to the party making the order. This office has previously ruled that liquors can be delivered by the licensee where the sale taxes place in the licensed premises. I do not be - lieve, however, that the plan submitted by Mr. Monsky falls within that ruling, as an entirely different question is presented. Section 25 (d) of H. R. 128 sets out the powers of a retailer of alcoholic liquors as follows: "A retailer's license shall allow the licensee to sell and offer for sale at retail either in the original package, or otherwise, as therein pre - scribed, in the premises specified in such license, alcoholic liquors or beer regardless of alcoholic content, for use or consumption, but not for resale in any form." Section 2(16) defines the term "to sell" as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p134">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ■ "The words 'to sell' include to solicit or receive an order for. o keep or expose for sale and to keep with intent to sell." Section 1 (c) provides: "No person shall, * * * sell * * * any alcoholic liquor for beveraj ;e purposes, except as specifically provided in this act: * * *" It is our opinion that under Section 25 (d) of H. R. 128 a licensee's powers are limited "To sell and offer for sale * * * in the premises specified in such license " * *." The act of the licensee's agent in soliciting orders outside of the licensee s premises would, in our opinion, be an "offer to sell' and since the powerp of the licensee are limited to sell and offer for sale in the licensed premises, such act would, in our opinion, be a violation of the provisions of the law. In addition to this, since the definition of the term 'to sell' includes the solicitation and receiving of orders for liquor, such solicitation and receipt of orders must necessarily, under the provisions of Section 25 (d), take placij within the licensed premises. Any one soliciting or receiving orders foil liquor outside of the licensed premises would, in effect, be selling liquoi without a license so to do. The advertisement of intoxicating liquors in a newspaper does not. in our opinion, amount to a solicitation under the definition of 'to sell'. contained in Section 2; nor does it amount to an offer for sale as treated in Section 25 (d). 15 R. C. L. 343. It is, therefore, our opinion that the plan suggested by Mr. Monsky is not one that can be properly carried on under the provisions of H. R. 128. WM. H. WRIGHT. Attorney General. I DUTIES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS September 19, 1935. Liquor Control Commission. I have your letter of September 18. in which you say: "Some question has .arisen as to the responsibility of the Liquor Control Commission in gathering evidence and prosecuting vio - lations of the liquor act. </seg>
            <seg id="p135">OPINIONS "The Commission has been taking the position that it is primarily the duty of the county sheriffs, constables, police officers and other law enforcement officers to enforce the provisions of the Liquor Control Act in their community with the Commission through its Inspectors rendering such assistance as the local officers need or request but they should not in any county assume the sole re - sponsibility for the enforcement of the liquor act. ' "I would appreciate very much having your opinion as to the re - sponsibility of the local sheriffs, county attorneys and other peace officers for enforcement of the liquor act." Section 26-1410 of the 1929 Compiled Statutes sets out the duties of the county sheriffs relating to the enforcement of the law. This section provides as follows: ■* "It shall be the duty of the sheriff by himself or deputy to preserve the peace in his county, to ferret out crime, to apprehend and arrest all criminals, and in so far as it is within his power, to secure evidence of all crimes committed in his county, and present the same to the county attorney and the grand jury; to file informations against all persons who he knows, or has reason to believe, have violated the laws of the state, and to perform all other duties per - taining to the office of sheriff or enjoined upon him by law." In regard to the duties of constables, Section 29-204 provides as follows: "Constables shall be ministerial officers of the courts holden by justices of the peace in criminal cases, within their respective coun^ ties, and it shall be their duty to apprehend and bring to justice felons and disturbers of the peace, and to suppress riots and to keep and preserve the peace within their respective counties. They shall have power, and they are hereby authorized to execute all writs and process in criminal cases throughout the county in which they may reside and where they were elected or appointed." Section 29-206 of the 1929 Compiled Statutes is as follows: "Every city, town or village marshal, lawfully holding such office, shall be the appropriate ministerial officer of the police court or mayor's court of the city or town or incorporated village, and as such shall have all the powers and be charged with all the duties of constables in the making of arrests, serving process and pre - serving the peace, as prescribed in the last two preceding sections in criminal matters." In addition to these sections. Section 75 of H. R. 128 provides: </seg>
            <seg id="p136">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "Every sheriff, deputy sheriff, police officer, marshal, deputy marshal or constable who shall know, or who shall be credibly informed, that any offense has been committed against the pro - visions of -any law of this state relating to the sale of alcoholic liquors shall make complaint against the person so offending within their respective jurisdictions to a proper justice of the peace or other magistrate therein, and for every neglect or refusal so to do. every such officer shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and. upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine not more than one hundred dollars." Your inspectors, under the provisions of H. R. 128, are commissioned as deputy state sheriffs. The. powers of a state sheriff and his deputies are set out in Section 84-107 C. S. Neb. 1929. This section provides that the state sheriff ■ - .■ i ■ - ■ "Shall have the same powers in each of the several counties of the state as the sheriffs have in their respective counties in so far as criminal matters are concerned." Under the provisions of the sections quoted above, it is my opinion that the county sheriffs, the constables, city marshals and police officers have a definite duty to enforce the provisions of H. R. 128. The inspectors of the Liquor Commission, as deputy state sheriffs, havi - equal authority with the sheriffs, the constables and marshals to do any acts necessary to bring about proper enforcement of the provisions of this act. However, the fact that the inspectors of the Liquor Commission have equal authority with the sheriffs, etc. in no way reduces the powers of the sheriffs, constables and marshals, nor does it relieve such officers of any of the duties imposed upon them by the statute. If any sheriff, constable or marshal knows of any violation of the pro - visions of the liquor law, it automatically becomes his duty to make com - plaint against the person guilty of such violation. In addition to this, i such sheriff, constable or marshal has reliable information that the law has been violated, then too it becomes his duty to make complaint agains the guilty party and to take immediate steps to prevent further violations The same duty is imposed upon the inspectors of the Liquor Commission as deputy state sheriffs. If any sheriff, constable or marshal knows, or has been credibly informed of any violation of H. R. 128 and fails or refused to make complaint against the offending party, such sheriff, constable or marshal is himself subject to prosecution for failure to enforce the law. Summing up then, under the provisions of our statutes it is the duty ol every sheriff, constable, marshal or police officer to enforce all the provisions </seg>
            <seg id="p137">OPINIONS of the liquor laws of this state. Inspectors of the Liquor Commission have a like duty as well. The duties and powers of such inspectors are concur - rent with those of the sheriffs, constables, marshals and police officers, but do not take those duties away from such sheriffs, constables, marshals or police officers. The duty of the sheriff, constable, marshal or police officer remains the same as it would be if there were no inspectors appointed by the Liquor Control Commission. Failure to perform such duties subjects such sheriff, constable, marshal and police officer to prosecution and fine for such failure. . ■ ■ . ■ ■ . I trust this explains the duties of the various officers, as requested in your letter. WM. H. WRIGHT. Attorney General. LIQUOR LICENSES— PERMIT AFTER CONVICTION OR DATE OF OFFENSE December 14, 1935. Nebraska Liquor Control Commission, State Capitol Building. J November 15th you sent to me a copy of a letter from C. B. Ellis, of yniore, wherein he requested the opinion of this office as to whether or not a person who was charged with a violation of the old state liquor laws, the violation occurring on November 1, 1934, but who did not plead guilty or was not convicted until May 24, 1935, would be barred from obtaining a license. I have made a rather careful study of the question presented, to de - termine whether or not the time of the conviction was the test as to whether a person would be eligible for a license or whether the time the offense was committed would be the date determining the question of eligibility for a licenser This matter is governed by Section 28, subsection 12, which reads as k Hows: "A person who, within a period of five years prior to the date of his application for license, has been convicted of or pled guilty to a violation of any federal or state law concerning the manufacture, possession or sale of alcoholic liquor, subsequent to the passage of this Act, or shall have forfeited his bond to appear in court to answer charges for any such violation." The question raised here would be whether the term '"subsequent to the passage of this Act" would be descriptive of the term "who has been </seg>
            <seg id="p138">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ' convicted of or pled guilty" or whether it would be descriptive of the term "violation of any federal or state law." As I see it, this provision can be read either as follows: "A person who, within a period of five years prior, to the date of his application for license has been convicted of or pled guilty, read "A person who * * * Has been convicted or pled guilty to a violation subsequent to the passage of this act, to a violation * * *," or it could be (occurring) subsequent' to the passage of this Act." The design of the legislation referred to is not clearly apparent. As I see it, a successful argument can be made on either construction that can be placed on this section. When a statute is ambiguous, it is necessary to place on the statute the construction that is most reasonable. It has been held: "When the design of the legislation is not clearly apparent, it is presumed that a statute was to have the most reasonable and beneficial operation that its language permits. And when a statute is ambiguous in terms or fairly susceptible of two con - structions, the injustice, unreasonableness, absurdity, hardship or , even the inconvenience which may follow one construction may properly be considered and a construction of which the statute is fairly susceptible may be placed on it that will avoid all such objectionable consequences and advance what must be presumed to be its true object and purpose." (25 R. C. L. 1017-1018) It is also stated: "When the language of a statute fairly permits, a construction which will lead to an unreasonable result should be avoided." (25 R. C. L. 1018) and: "It is to be presumed that the Legislature did not intend a law to work a hardship or injustice, and it is a reasonable and safe rule of construction to resolve any ambiguity or absurdity in a statute in favor of a just and equitable operation of the law." (25 R: C. L. 1022) It is! further stated: I "Nothing but clear and unmistakable language will warrant ;i . court in a construction which will produce injustice by the un - equal operation of the statutes. • • • . When the legislature has j clearly laid down a rule for one class of cases, it is not readily to be supposed that in its choice of words or phrases, and in the enactment of various provisons in the same act, it has prescribed </seg>
            <seg id="p139">OPINIONS a different rule for another class of cases within the same reason as the first; a construction which will avoid such senseless dis - criminations where the meaning of the statute as evidenced by its language is debatable." (25 R. C. L. 1024.) It occurs to us that it would be entirely inequitable to hold that the date of conviction is the fact that should be considered in determining whether or not a person is eligible for a license. Such a construction would work inequalities that would be inequitable. For instance, if A and B committed the same violation of the old liquor laws on the same identical date, and if both were prosecuted for such violations, it is possible that A would be prosecuted and convicted prior to the passage of the present liquor law while B would not come to trial until after the passage of the law. Since both committed the same offense, and were convicted for the same vio - lation of the law, it seems unreasonable that merely because A's case was brought up first he should be eligible for a license while B should be held to be ineligible. If we take the time of the violation as the test, both parties would be treated exactly alike. If their violations occurred prior to the pasage of the present law, both would be eligible for a license. If the viola - tion occurred after the passage of the law, of course, both would be ineligible. Under the rules of law set out above, I believe that this is the construc - tion that the court would put on subsection 12 of Section 28. It was never intended by the law that two people who are in exactly the same class should be treated in a different manner, since the wording of the section referred to is ambiguous, I believe that the rules set out above would be controlling. There is another reason why I feel that we must take the time of the violation as the test rather than the date of the conviction. If we construe this section from a grammatical standpoint, we find the law to be: '"By what is known as the doctrine of the 'last antecedent', relative and qualifying words, phrases, and clauses are to be applied to the words or phrase immediately preceding, and are not to be construed as extending to or including others more remote. This rule is, how - ever, merely an aid to construction and will not be adhered to where a more remote antecedent is clearly required by a con - sideration of the entire act." (59 C. J. 985.) This rule of law was followed in Nebraska State Railway Commission v. Alfalfa Butter Co., 104 Neb. 797, wherein syllabus 2 reads as follows: "Relative and qualifying words or phrases are to be applied to the words or phrases immediately preceding, and as not extending to or including other words, phrases or clauses more remote, unless </seg>
            <seg id="p140">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL such extension or inclusion is clearly required by the intent and meaning of the context, or disclosed by an examination of the entire act." • . As we read subsection 12, of Section 28, the clause "violation of any federal or state law" is the one immediately preceding the term "subsequent to the passage of this act," and where the provisions of the section are ambiguous, as we feel they are in this section, the rule above quoted would apply, ' and the phrase "subsequent to the passage of this act" would be applied therefore to the last antecedent, which would be the phrase "viola - tion of any federal or state law * * * ." Therefore, it is our opinion that under the case set out by Mr. Ellis the party who violated the old liquor law in November of 1934, but was not convicted of that violation until after the passage of the present liquor law. would not be disqualified by that fact from receiving a license. WM. H. WRIGHT, Attorney General January 4, 1936. ■ ■ ' . • ' ■ ■'■■■'• Gentlemen: Complaint has been made to this office of acts committed by you and other liquor dealers in this city which were committed with the intent of forcing other liquor dealers within the city to observe certain price schedules, or in the alternative with the intent to drive such dealers out of business if they failed to maintain such price schedules as may have been established by you and others. There has been submitted to this oflice in support of this complaint the following telegram, supposedly sent by you and others to five wholesale liquor dealers, to-wit: i "Poska Delicatessen disrupting entire price situation Lincoln he is only one consistently getting out of line causing some other dealers to meet cuts stop others are compelled to discontinue any further purchases your line until you withdraw your entire line from his store and advise all your dealers and salesmen not to make any further sales to him stop we expect immediate action." If the complaint made to us is true, we feel that your act in sending this telegram in combination with the other signers thereof constitutes a violation of the laws of this state relating to the unlawful restraint of trade. </seg>
            <seg id="p141">OPINIONS The liquor laws of this state were drafted with the idea in mind that in order to stamp out the practice of bootlegging the price of legal liquor should be kept as low as possible so that there would be very little profit in the illegal sale of liquors. In order to carry out this intent the gallonage tax on liquors was kept to a very low figure and license fees were also as low as possible. Any attempt to hold up prices on liquor nullifies the intent of the law and destroys its effectiveness as a means of curbing the illicit traffic in liquors. This office does not intend in any way to attempt to dictate the prices at "which liquor shall be sold; neither can we permit combinations or con - spiracies which are designed solely to maintain a high price schedule on liquors and to force out of business anyone who does not maintain such price schedules. We would, therefore, appreciate it if you would advise us whether or not the complaint made against you is true. WM. H. WRIGHT, Attorney General. I RECOMMENDATION BY CITY COUNCIL REMONSTRANCE PETITION ., • ■ January 18. 1936. Dear Sir: This will acknowledge our receipt of your letter of recent date relative to the granting of licenses under the liquor laws of our state. Section 98 of H. R. 128, Fiftieth Session of the Nebraska State Legislautre provides that a city council or board of trustees may recommend to the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission the issuance of licenses for the sale of beer unless objected to by a special petition filed by the qualified electors or any village of such number as shall equal fifty -one percent of the votes cast at the last general municipal election. It is our opinion that it is not necessary that those filing the petition voted at the last general municipal election. All that is necessary is that those who filed the petition are qualified electors of the village. At the present time and under the present existing laws a remonstrance petition against the sale of intoxicating liquor other than beer by the package has no legal effect. It is true that such a petition may have a regulating effect upon the village board and the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission. Sale of intoxicating liquors other than beer by the drink must be voted upon by the people of the city or village after notice. </seg>
            <seg id="p142">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL The question presented by you as to whether a man who is in the habit of getting "gloriously drunk" could get a license is one not de - termined by statute, but is one which presents a question that must be determined by the licensing officials. If the licensing officials are of the opinion that the. applicant is not a proper person to have a license, they have the authority to refuse the granting of such license. A petition objecting to the granting of a license for the sale of beer, as above referred to, is in full force and effect from the date of its filing until after the next general municipal election. At the holding of a general municipal election all remonstrance petitions on file are of no force and effect. i ■ ' . ■ ■ PAUL. P.

Sometime ago you asked for my opinion as to the conduct of certain county attorneys in this state in requiring the inspectors of the Liquor Con - trol Commission to sign complaints on cases presented by them to the county attorney. You ask if the county attorney should not sign these himself, rather than to force your inspectors to do so. I agree with you that it would be a more efficient arrangement if the county attorney would sign the complaint and would have your men appear for trial as witnesses. I believe this arrangement would be better because then your men would merely be witnesses, rather than be prosecutors. Their testimony should have a better effect if this system were followed. The county attorney, of course, has the authority to sign the com - plaints if he wishes to do so. However, if he refuses to sign the complaints, and insists that your men must do so, there is no way that I know of to force the county attorney to sign the complaint himself. He will always answer that your men obtained the evidence and that he himself does not know the true facts and, therefore, could not sign the complaint. He is within his rights if he does take this viewpoint, and we cannot very well require him to personally sign the complaint, even though we might feel that it would be a better system. I feel, therefore, that if you are able to have the county attorney sign the complaint you should do so, but if he will not sign it, and asks that your </seg>

SHIPMENTS OF LIQUOR FROM NEBRASKA WHOLESALER TO AN ARKANSAS WHOLESALER— STAMPING— ETC. March 26, 1936. Nebraska Liquor Control Commission. I have your letter of March 19th, in which you ask about shipments of liquor from a Nebraska wholesaler to a wholesaler in Arkansas. In your letter you say: "We have consistently interpreted the law that the Nebraska whole - saler of liquor must sell to a Nebraska retailer." You ask: "Are we going beyond our authority when we authorize Nebraska wholesalers to ship unstamped liquor to a licensed wholesaler out - side the state, other than the wholesaler from whom they originally purchased the liquor?" It is my opinion you are acting entirely within your authority when you permit the shipment of unstamped liquor to a licensed wholesaler out - side the State of Nebraska, even though that wholesaler does not happen to be the one from whom the liquor was originally purchased. Section 25 of the liquor law, in setting out the authority granted to a licensed distributor in this state, provides: - "(b) An alcoholic liquor distributor's license (except beer) shall allow the wholesale purchase, importation and storage of alcoholic liquors and sale of alcoholic liquors (except beer) to licensees in this state and to such persons without the state, as may be permit - ted by law; * * * ." This section definitely gives the authority to a Nebraska wholesaler to ship liquoi to an out-state wholesaler. The question then arises as to whether or not the liquor shipped out - side of the state to a licensed wholesaler must bear the Nebraska stamp. Section 50 of the liquor law provides that there shall be certain gallonage taxes paid on alcoholic liquors manufactured or imported for sale in this state by the distributor. Section 51, relating to the payment of tax, provides </seg>
            <seg id="p144">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL that the tax shall be evidenced by tax stamps which are to be affixed to each original package of alcoholic liquor for use in this state. Section 18 requires a distributor to give bond that he will pay the tax required by law before the liquor is removed from his warehouse, when said liquors are sold or furnished to duly licensed dealers or distributors within the State of Nebraska. It is required by this section that the tax stamp be affixed before the liquor is withdrawn for delivery to Nebraska dealers. It is my opinion, therefore, that when liquor is shipped out of the state by a Nebraska wholesaler to a licensed wholesaler outside the state, that such liquor need not have the Nebraska stamp affixed thereto. The situation is exactly the same as shipments by a Nebraska wholesaler of beer to an out-state wholesaler. You will recall we recently gave you an opinion upon this question, in which we stated that such beer should not be taxed in Nebraska. The same will hold true as to shipments of alcoholic liquors other than beer. If a tax were required on such shipments, there would be no way that the Nebraska wholesaler could recover that tax. Therefore, no such tax should be required on shipments out of the state. WM. H. WRIGHT, Attorney General. i. • i ■ DRIVING WHILE INTOXICATED, SEC. 39-1106 C. S. S. 1935 March 23, 1936. Mr. Leo M. Bayer, County Attorney, Alliance, Nebraska. I have your letter of March 19, in which you state that you have filed a complaint against one Amos Abley charging him with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor; that a demurrer .has been filed to this complaint raising the question as to whether or not the complaint states an offense against the laws of this state. In particular, you state that Section 39-1106 C. S. S. Neb. 1935 does not expressly declare it to be an offence to drive a motor vehicle while under the influence of in - toxicating liquor, although it does contain a penalty clause. The question which you raise is whether or not this statute is sufficiently broad to con - stitute drunken driving an offense which is punishable in this state. The 1935 regular session of the Nebraska Legislature amended section 39-1101 C. S. S. 1931 which provided that it was unlawful for any person under the influence of intoxicating liquor to operate a motor vehicle. In amending this section, the Legislature failed to include any reference what - ever to drunken driving. I In Section 39-1106, however, it is provided that any person found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor </seg>
            <seg id="p145">OPINIONS ■ ' ■ - ■ shall be punished. The statute then proceeds to recite the punishment. One observes, therefore, that the Legislature in amending Section 39-1101 supra omitted that part which constitutes drunken driving an offense al - though it did not omit the penalty provisions which appear in Section 39-1106 C. S. S. 1935. We appreciate the general rule which holds that criminal laws are to be construed strictly in favor of the offender and against the State, and that every criminal offense must be definitely made so by express statutory declaration. Thus in the case of State v. DeWolf, 67 Neb. 321, our Supreme Court held that in this state all public offenses are statutory and no person can be punished for any act or omission not made penal by the plain import of the written law. However, we are also aware of the fact that the situation at hand is of great importance also, and that the Legislature clearly did not intend to repeal the law constituting drunken driving an offense against the laws of this State. ■'■"'.. ■ We have examined a number of cases which appear to hold rather conclusively that an express statutory declaration that an act is an offense is not necessary if it is gatherable from the law itself that the Legislature has constituted that act a criminal one. In a number of these cases a situation almost identical to the one at hand was present, yet the courts held that a penalty clause was sufficient to constitute the act a criminal offense. I do not know whether or not you have access to these books in Alliance, but if you do not, at your request I will prepare a memorandum on this question for you. If, however, you do have access to these books, you will find these cases in the following volumes: Dyer v. Placer Co. (Calif.) 27 Pac. 197. Grey v. State (Ga.) 65 S. E. 191. State v.

'.;■■ .'•'•; MILTON C. MURPHY, Assistant Attorney General. May 15, 1936. TO ALL COUNTY ATTORNEYS: This office has received a large number of inquiries from county attorneys with reference to prosecutions for drunken driving. As it appears tha't this question is of a high interest, we are mailing all county attorneys the following memorandum which this office prepared in response to a request some time ago. The Question The 1935 Regular Session of the Nebraska Legislature amended Section 39-1106, C.S.S. 1931, which provided that it was unlawful for any person to operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. In amending this section, the Legislature failed to include any reference whatever to drunken driving. In Section 39-1106, C. S. Supp. 1935, however, it is provided that any person found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor shall be punished. This section then proceeds to recite the punishment to be imposed. Section 39-1106, supra, does not. however, expressly constitute drunken driving an offense against the laws of the state. One observes, therefore, that the situation is as follows: Drunken driving is not expressly declared to be a criminal offense, although a penalty is provided for one who is convicted of it. The question presented by the mounting number of inquiries which this office is receiving is whether or not the penalty clause contained in Section 39-1106, supra, is sufficient to authorize the institution of criminal proceed - ings against drunken drivers. This office is inclined to the opinion that" it is. </seg>
            <seg id="p147">OPINIONS ■■':'■■':■ ■ '." ■ ■'■ '■'•.. .■■■' ■ ] The Memorandum (Note: In the following memorandum we have abstracted only those cases to which county attorneys are not likely to have access.) In the case of People v. Brown, 16 Wend. (N. Y.) 561, the first point of the syllabus reads as follows: "The selling of spirituous liquors without license, is punishable as a misdemeanor under the statute upon that subject, although it contains no other prohibition than the imposition of a penalty, and a provision that all offences against the provisions of the act shall be deemed misdemeanors." The facts of the case, as outlined in the opinion of the court, disclose that the defendants were indicted for selling spirituous liquors without a license, and that the court sustained the demurrer which they interposed to the indictment, on the ground that the matter charged did not constitute an indictable offense against the laws of the state. From this ruling of the trial court the state's attorney removed the record to the appellate court for review, the defendants insisting in support of the judgment of the lower court that the statute under which the indictment was found contained no express prohibition against the sale of spirituous liquors and that there - fore the matter complained of in the indictment was not an offense against the laws of the state. The statute provided "all offenses against the pro - visions of this title shall be deemed misdemeanors punishable by fine and imprisonment." The court concluded that the language of the statute was sufficient to constitute the act complained of a criminal offense and reversed the ruling of the trial court. Unfortunately the opinion in the Brown case, supra, is not very complete. However, the syllabus clearly discloses the statute in question went no further than to impose a penalty for the commission of an act and to provide that it should be deemed a misdemeanor. In the case of State v. Ostwalt, (N. C.) 24 S. E. 660, the syllabus reads as follows: ■ "Acts 1879, C. 92. Chp. 2, providing that, in bastardy proceedings, when the issue of paternity is found against the putative father, he shall be fined, etc. for the benefit of the school fund, constitutes bastardy a criminal offense, within the meaning of Code, Sec. 1237, limiting the right of appeal by the state in criminal actions." </seg>
            <seg id="p148">J REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL The question presented in this case was whether or not the North Carolina statute relating to bastardy constituted it a criminal offense, and further, whether or not the State had the right to appeal. ! The facts of the case disclose that proceedings in bastardy were com - menced against the defendant in a justice court; that he was acquitted; and that the prosecutrix then appealed to the superior court. On the trial in the superior court the defendant pleaded former acquittal and not guilty, but was convicted, and appealed. The court entered a judgment of reversal. The statute in question provided "when the issue of paternity shall be found against the putative father or when he admits the paternity he shall be fined by the judge or justice not exceeding ten dollars, which shall go to the school fund of the county." It appears from the opinion of the court that in prior cases the court had ruled that bastardy was a criminal offense. The court said "We are now urged to overrule all of these adjudications, made upon full con - sideration of the question by two courts, the majority of the members of which were differently constituted, and declare that the imposition of a pecuniary fine as a punishment for a violation of law docs not ipso facto create a criminal offense. ° * * It is familiar learning that words in a statute must be construed according to their technical meaning, unless a contrary intent is apparent upon the face of the act. Under this rule, what must be the interpretation of the provision that, on the admission that the defendant is the father, or the finding of the issue of paternity, 'he shall be fined by the judge or justice of the peace not exceeding ten dollars, which shall go to the school fund of the county:' " The court then proceeded to consider some of the standard definitions of the word criminal and concluded "If a crime is an act or wrong punishable by law in a proceeding conducted in the name of the state, it would seem that there can be controversy about the fact that this proceeding, originally conducted in the name of the state, in order to carry out a police regulation, became a crime when made punishable by law, by a fine appropriated to the school fund, as are all other fines imposed on conviction for crime. It seems never before to have been doubted that the legislature creates a criminal offense whenever it prescribes that a certain act shall be punishable either by fine or imprisonment, or forbids it generally, and by implication empowers the courts to impose either a fine or imprisonment, as is the case where the law simply declares that a certain act shall be deemed a misdemeanor without providing how it is to be punished." 1 The court then concluded that bastardy was made a criminal offense against the laws of the state and that, therefore, the right of the prosecutrix to appeal from an acquittal of the defendant no longer existed, as her right to recover money upon a favorable judgment was merely incidental to his conviction and not a civil right in and of itself. </seg>
            <seg id="p149">OPINIONS In the case of State v. Pierce, (N. C.) 31 S. E. 847, the second point of the syllabus reads as follows: "Code, Sec. 985, Subsec. 2, providing merely that every person convicted of, inter alia, the willful burning of a gin house, shall be imprisoned for not less than five nor more than ten years, creates an offense, notwithstanding it does not expressly state that such - person shall be guilty of a felony." The facts of the case disclose that the defendant was convicted of setting fire to and burning a gin house. Upon appeal he cited as one point of error that the statute did not constitute the act complained of an offense against the laws of the state. The following language will disclose the disposition which the court made of this contention of defendant: "The defendant, however, insists that subsection 2, Sec. 985, does not create an offense, because it merely prescribed that 'every person convicted of the acts therein described 'shall be imprisoned in the penitentiary not less than five nor more than ten years,' and does not expressly add that such person shall be guilty of a felony. The objection is without force. Convictions, under subsection 2, were expressly sustained in the two cases last cited, and its validity has also been directly recognized in State v. England, 78 N. C. 552, and State v. Wright, 89 N. C. 507. Indeed, the doctrine is well settled that where the statute either makes an act unlawful, or imposes a punishment for its commission, such act becomes a crime, without any express declaration that it shall be a crime or of its grade. In the former case it is a misdemeanor, and in the latter a felony Or a misdemeanor, according to the nature of the punishment prescribed. Laws 1891, c. 205; State v. Parker, 91 N. C. 650; State v. Bloodworth, 94 N. C. 918; State v. Addington, 121 N. C. 538, 27 S. E. 1007. Indeed, the court has held recently that the bare addition to section 35 of the Code of a provision that one found to be the father of a bastard child, upon an issue of paternity, shall be 'fined' not exceeding $10, which shall go to the school fund, •: of itself, nothing more being said, made the father guilty of a crime, and charged the proceeding from a civil action, as it had always there - tofore been recognized, into a criminal action, with all the incidents following such change. In State v. Ostwalt, 118 N. C. at page 1212, 24 S. E. 661, the court says: 'It seems never before to have been doubted that the legislature creates a criminal offense whenever it prescribes that a certain act shall be punishable either by fine or imprisonment, or forbids it generally, and by implication empowers the court to impose either fine or imprisonment.' The dissenting opinions in State v. Ostwalt, supra, and in State v. Gallard, 122 N. U. 1024, 29 S. E. 899 (which hold bastardy a criminal offense), do not </seg>
            <seg id="p150">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL controvert that as a general proposition, but rest upon the ground that the bastardy act, taken as a whole, and the construction the courts had uniformly placed upon it, and the nature and purpose of the proceeding, negative the inference of any intention in the legislature to change the proceeding into a criminal action, with its grave inconveniences, from the incidental provision (in one section of the chapter on bastardy) of $10 for the school fund,— a doctrine analogous to that of State v. Snuggs, 85 N. C. 541; but the majority of the court settled the law otherwise. If the incidental imposition of 'not exceeding $10' for benefit of the school fund creates a crime, a fortiori a provision that 'every one convicted of the willful burn - ing of a gin house * " * shall be imprisoned in the penitentiary not less than five nor more than ten years' creates a crime." J In the case of Gray v. State, (Ga.) 65 S. E. 191, subdivision (a) of the second point of the syllabus reads as follows: "The indictment being drawn in the language, of the statute, the offense charged could properly be denominated as a felony, because the statute declares the punishment to be by imprisonment and . labor in the penitentiary. The statute, therefore, is not void by reason of the fact that the Legislature failed to declare the inhibited acts to be a crime." The facts of that case disclose that the defendant was convicted under a certain provision of the penal code of the state, which declared that if a person shall by any counterfeit letter or writing made in another person's name obtain money or other valuable thing with ihtent to defraud, he shall be punished as therein described. Upon conviction in the trial court he appealed to the Georgia appellate court and as one point of error urged that the trial court erred in overruling a demurrer to the indictment. The court, however, upheld the ruling of the trial court on this point and in affirming the judgment, said: "The defendant demurred to the indictment generally upon the ground that it failed to charge a felony under any statute declaring the acts therein alleged to be a felony, and upon the further ground that section 247 of the Penal Code of 1895 fails to declare that the acts therein embodied or penalized constitute a felony. Section 247 of the Penal Code (which was originally section 14 of the 7th division of the Penal Code, as contained in 'An act to reform, amend and consolidate the penal laws of the State of Georgia,') Approved December 23, 1833 (Acts 1833, p. 170) declared that: 'If any person shall designedly, by color of any counterfeit letter or writing, made in any other person's name, or fictitious name, obtain from any person money, or other valuable thing, with intent to defraud any </seg>
            <seg id="p151">OPINIONS person, mercantile house, body corporate, or company of the same, he shall be punished by imprisonment and labor in the penitentiary for not less than two nor longer than seven years.' The point is made that the statute nowhere declares the commission of the forbidden acts to constitute a felony or gives any other denomination to the offense. Inasmuch as the generic term 'felony' is defined in the Code (as it was originally in the thirteenth section of the first division of the act of 1833 (Acts 1833, p. 145) to which we have referred), and as the punishment prescribed in section 247 of the Penal Code comes within the class of punishments which dis - tinguish felonies from misdemeanors, the declaratory part of the act is necessarily implied from the punishment inflicted, and the words 'shall be guilty of a felony' must necessarily be supplied in connection with the punishment. While, as insisted by counsel for plaintiff in error, there may be an omission of the declaratory part of the law prescribed by Blackstone as one of its essential in - gredients, the ellipsis is so inevitably supplied from the context that the validity of the law is not affected. Indeed, the same peculiarity is found in sections 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, and 251; all of these sections being taken from the Penal Code en - acted in 1833 (Acts 1833, pp. '168-170, div. 7, Sees. 5-13). The indictment conforms to section 929 of the Penal Code, and was therefore sufficiently technical to withstand the demurrer." Although the statute in the Gray case, supra, was not exactly the same as the one in question here, one observes that it went no further than to impose a penalty. In no place did it expressly denounce the act or declare it to be unlawful. That is the situation here. , To the same effect, see: Dyer v. Placer, 27 Pac. (Calif.) 197. Hcdderick v. State, (Ind.) 1 N. E. 47. State v. Allen, 129 La. 733, 56 So. 855, Ann. Cas. 1913 B 454 State v. Peterson, (Utah) 17 Pac. 2nd 925.

            <seg id="p152">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL LICENSE TO CORPORATIONS July 15, 1935. Nebraska Liquor Control Commission. You inquire whether a corporation, which has applied for or has been granted a manufacturer's or distributor's license, under the Nebraska Liquor Control Act, may have such license, where a stockholder thereof is a retail licensee or applicant, or is a stockholder or is directly or indirectly interested in a corporation which has applied for or has been granted a retail license; and whether, where a person owns stock in two separate and distinct cor - porations, can both of such corporations be licensed, one for manufacturing or distributing liquor, and the other for retailing liquor? Section 29 of the Nebraska Liquor Control Act prohibits a retailer from borrowing or receiving money or anything of value from a manufacturer or distributor and prohibits such manufacturer or distributor from lending or giving money or anything of value to a retailer, directly or indirectly. Section 30 of the Act provides that no manufacturer, distributor or wholesaler shall, directly or indirectly, furnish any equipment, license, or lend money to any retailer, and that such manufacturer, distributor or wholesaler shall not be directly or indirectly interested in the ownership, conduct or operation of the business of any retailer, not in the premises, furniture or equipment of such retailer; and that no person licensed as a manufacturer or distributor shall be permitted to receive a retailer's license arid that no retail licensee shall receive a manufacturer's or distributor's license. We construe the word 'wholesaler' in these sections to mean distributor. It will be observed that these sections, and especially section 30, prohibit manufacturers and distributors from being directly or indirectly interested in the retail liquor business. So that the question is, when is a manufactur - ing or distributing corporation directly or indirectly interested in the busi - ness of a retailer, — corporate or otherwise? Where an individual is licensed as a manufacturer or distributor in this state, or is applying for, such license and he individually has been licensed or has applied for a license as a retailer, obviously one of such licenses must be denied him. But where corporations or a corporation may be involved, we are con - fronted with the general rule that corporation is a legal entity, separate and distinct from its members or stockholders, but this corporate fiction will be disergarded when it is urged to an intent not within its reasoning and purpose. It was disregarded in the case of Riggs v State, 84 Neb. 335, 121 N. W. 588, where all of the stock of a corporation was owned by the de- </seg>
            <seg id="p153">OPINIONS fendant, his wife and his sister, and he managed and controlled the business of the corporation. He was prosecuted for violation of the liquor laws, al - though all of the transactions involved were carried on in the corporate name by the corporation. The court disregarded the corporate fiction and sustained the conviction of the defendant as an individual. See also 33 C. J. 608; 14 C. J. 52 to 63 incl. and 873. The test in matters of this kind seems to depend upon the control which an individual stockholder may exercise over the corporate business. Some basis must be found to define the amount of such control, which will dis - qualify a manufacturing or distributing corporation licensed or applying for a license in this state, from dealing with such stockholder as a retailer or from dealing with a retail corporation in which such individual owns stock. If such corporate manufacturer or distributor is disqualified from so dealing, then it could not be licensed while such situation continued. It occurs to us that the legislature has defined the amount of control above mentioned. In Section 28 (10) of the Act it is provided that no license of any kind shall be issued to a corporation if any officer, manager or director thereof, or any stockholder owning in the aggregate more than 25 per cent of the stock of such corporation would be ineligible to receive a license, for any reason other than citizenship and residence. From these provisions it appears that the Legislature intended that the fiction of corporate entity should be disregarded in each case of an officer, manager or director, or of a stockholder owning more than 25 per cent of the stock of any corporation, and that, in each of such cases, the corporation should be treated in the same manner as the officer, manager, director or stockholder owning more than 25 per cent of the stock, would be treated, were he an individual licensee or applicant. I Using this test, it is our opinion that where a stockholder of a corporate manufacturer or distributor, licensed, or applying for a license, owns in the aggregate more than 25 per cent of the stock of such corporation, or where he is an officer, manager or director of such corporation, regardless of the amount of stock which he may own therein, or where he actually devotes the most of his time to the business of the corporation, regardless of the amount of stock which he may own, or where he actually exerts such control over the affairs of such corporation as he might exert were he the owner of more than 25 per cent of the stock thereof, then either that corporation or any other corporation in which he may be a stockholder and which seeks or has a retail license, regardless of the amount of stock which he may own in such retail corporation, may not have a license. Both cannot be licensed while such control in the manufacturing or distributing corporation, as above defined, and such interest in the retail corporation of such stock - holder continue. </seg>
            <seg id="p154">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL On the other hand, it is our opinion that an individual owning a retail business, or in the case of a corporation retailer, controlling that corporation, as above defined, may have stock in a manufacturing or distributing cor - poration to the extent of 25 per cent of the total stock thereof, so long as he does not otherwise have control in such corporation, and neither of such licensees or applicants would be disqualified. It will be seen from the above that we consider that any stockholder, regardless of the amount of stock which he may own, or any officer, manager or director of any corporation engaged in the liquor business, is directly or indirectly interested in that business, within the provisions of the above sections of the act. It is only where there is control of a manufacturing or distributing corporation, as above defined, that the above prohibitions of the Act apply. If application for a license is made by a manufacturing or distributing corporation, in which an individual has control as above defined, and if such individual is directly or indirectly interested in a retail business for which license has been issued, then the application of such manufacturer or dis - tributor should be denied. If such retailer has not been licensed at the time of the application of such manufacturer or distributor, then one of the applications should be denied; ordinarily, the one last in time, — unless the applicants arrange for a change in their organization or withdrawal of such application. Where such manufacturer's or distributor's license has not been issued, and such retailer's license has been issued, then the former should be denied. In cases where both of such licenses have been issued, and viola - ! tion of the provisions above set forth occurs, both licenses should be revoked ■ and the violation should be punished. With reference to partnerships, it is clear that one who is a partner in one class of licenses could not be a partner in another. See section 28 (9) I Nebraska Liquor Control Act. Neither could a partner in a manufacturing or distributing business in this i state secure an individual retail license; nor could a corporation of which he was a member secure a retail license. However, a partner in a retail business could own anything under a controlling interest in a manufacturing or distributing corporation and such corporation would not be disqualified to hold a license. In other words, members of partnerships should in all cases be treated and regarded the same as individuals, since it is our opinion that the act, at least for licensing purposes, disregards the legal fiction that a partnership is a distinct entity from the members of which it is composed.

I have your letter of April 30th, in which you say certain high school students chip in and give the money collected to certain parties who buy wine for them at a liquor store and who then give the wine to the boys for consumption by them. You state also that the liquor was drunk on the school campus at a supervised high school class play. You ask if the men are liable for legal action, and if so if the school board would have to pay for such legal proceedings. Section 53-338, Supplement of 1935 to Compiled Statutes, 1929, provides as follows: "(a) No person, who holds a license to sell alcoholic liquors as a retailer, manufacturer or distributor, shall permit the sale or gift to, or procuring for, any such liquors to any minors, to any perfeon who is mentally incompetent, or to any person who is physically or mentally incapacitated due to the consumption of such liquors, knowing them to be such, (b) No minor shall represent that he is of age for the purpose of asking for, purchasing or receiving any alcoholic liquors from any licensee mentioned in subsection (a) of this section, except in cases authorized by law. Any person, violat - ing any provision of subsections (a) or (b) of this section, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not more than fifty dollars, or by imprison - ment In the county jail or detention home not to exceed; ten days, or by both such fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court" Unfortunately, this law relates solely to sale by the licensee to a minor, . or to a person who is procuring liquor for a minor, and also forbids purchase or receiving liquor by a minor from a licensee. It does not relate to receiv - ing liquor by a minor from a person who is not a licensee. If the licensee knew that the person buying the liquor for the minors was actually purchasing it for such minors, and intended to give it to them, he could not lawfully sell such liquor to such person. So far as the liability . of the person buying the liquor for the minors is concerned, I believe that about the only way any action could be brought against him would be through a prosecution for contributing to the delinquency of a minor.

I have your letter of May 14 relating to the power of a village to grant :a beer license when a petition signed by 250 persons has been filed which protests the granting ofj such license. In your letter you state that only 56 of the signers were men and very few of them are businessmen. You state further that a majority jof the signers of the petition are persons who do not ! vote and did not vote' at the last election. You ask if the council has authority to ignore such a petition. Section 53-398, 1935 Supplement to the Compiled Statutes of 1929. provides: "The city council or city commission in cities or the board of trustees in villages, unless objected to by a sufficient petition signed by the qualified electors of any city or village of such number as shall equal fiityone percent of the votes cast at the last general municipal election held thereon, * * • may recommend that the commission issue licenses * * • for the sale of beer ' * ." You did not state the number of votes cast at the last general municipal election, so I do not know whether the 250 names signed to the petition mentioned in your letter is equal to 51 per cent of the total vote cast at ; such municipal election. If the petition is signed by 51 per cent of the j number of voters casting votes at such election and if the persons who ' signed such petition are duly qualified electors of your town, your council ; would not have any authority to ignore such petition. It makes no difference if only 56 of the signers are men if the rest of the signers are qualified voters. Neither does it make any difference that many of the signers on such petition did not actually vote at the last general municipal election if such '■ signers are qualified to vote. If, however, names appear on the petition of : persons who are not qualified voters, their names need not be counted. The number of such signers should be deducted from the total number of signers in determining whether or not the petition is signed by sufficient qualified voters. If, after deducting such names from the petition, the number of names of qualified electors still equals 51 per cent of the total </seg>

The filing of a petition objecting to the granting of liquor licenses does not prevent the Liquor Control Commission from granting a license for the sale of alcoholic liquors by the package. The legislature determined that package sale of alcoholic liquors other than beer should be universal throughout the state until April, 1937. After that date the voters of the cities and towns are given the right to decide whether or not they ;wish to continue with the sale of liquor by the package in their city. WM. H. WRIGHT, Attorney General. SALE OF LIQUORS IN PREMISES WITHIN 120 FEET OF A CHURCH June 9, 1936. Mr. J. R. Garber, Talmage, Nebraska. I have your letter of June 8th, in which you state that certain restaurant property owned by you is within 120 feet of a church and you ask, therefore, if it is possible for you to obtain a beer license in such premises. Section 53-335, 1935 Supplement, Compiled Statutes, 1929, provides: i "No license shall be issued for the sale at retail of any alcoholic liquor within one hundred and fifty feet of any church, school, hospital, home for aged or indigent persons or for veterans, their wives or children or any military or naval station: Provided, that this prohibition shall not apply to hotels offering restaurant ser - vice, regularly organized clubs or to restaurants, food shops or other places where sale of alcoholic liquors is not the principal business carried on, if such place of business so exempted shall have been established for such purposes prior to the taking effect of this Act. No alcoholic liquor, other than beer, shall be sold for con - sumption on the premises within three hundred feet from the campus of any college or university in the state." You will note that there is an express exemption from the provision that no license shall be issued for the sale of alcoholic liquors within 150 feet of any church, etc., in such cases where the license is held by hotels, restaurants, food shops or other places where the sale of alcoholic liquors is not the principal business carried on. Therefore, if you conduct a bona fide restaurant in the premises described by you, and if the sale of beer is not the principal business that is being carried on in the premises, and if the restaurant was established prior to the time the liquor law went into </seg>

While in your letter you state that you did operate a restaurant in these premises sometime ago, from the facts I have before me I cannot tell whether or not such restaurant was established before the liquor law was passed, or whether the operation of the restaurant had been sufficiently continuous to justify the village board in granting the beer license to you in premises less than 150 feet from a church.

We are in receipt of your letter of April 27 which contains a punch board which you say is similar to boards used by you to promote the sale of certain candy bars. You ask for our opinion as to whether or not the use of these boards by a merchant constitutes a violation of the statutory laws. It is our opinion that the displaying of a board such as the one you en - closed constitutes a violation of the gambling laws of this state and subjects the merchant to prosecution under our statute. Under the terms and wording of our statute, all persons buying a given article must receive the same amont of merchandise as the money paid for them. The plan as presented by you gives every one making a 5c deposit a package of Sifers Valomilk Dips, but also the purchaser has the opportunity of receiving from two to four extra packages without charge. Of course, many would receive no extra packages. Your letter further makes inquiry as to the legality of so-called marble games. It is our opinion that a merchant who pays the operator of the machine either cash, merchandise or a privilege to re-play the machine with - out further cost deposit, said benefits or awards being dependent upon the score obtained on the original play of the machine, is guilty of a violation of the statutory laws of this state and subject to prosecution thereunder.

In your letter of March 9, addressed to the State Treasurer, which has been referred to this department for reply, you say: "If it is the law for a wholesale tobacco dealer to have a license to sell tobacco in Nebraska, kindly send us the necessary blanks application." If your business consists of filling orders taken in or received from Nebraska by shipment from Colorado into Nebraska, the license fee pro - visions of Section c of Article 10, Chapter 28 C. S. Neb. 1929 would not apply and you would be required to obtain no license. See: Real Silk Hosiery Mills v. City of Portland, 59 L. Ed. 325 and Nash-Finch Co. v. Beal. 124 Neb. 835, but if you send cigars, cigarettes and tobacco into Nebraska and have an agent sell them in Nebraska, making delivery at the time and place- of sale, you would have to obtain a license therefore. Wagner v. Covington, 64 L. Ed. 157. Section 28-1025 C. S. Neb. provides that every person, partnership or corporation desiring a license shall file with the clerk of the city, town or village where his, their or its place of business is located, if within the limits of a city, town or village, or with the clerk of the county where such place of business is located outside the limits of any city, town or village, a written application stating the name, the exact location of the ; place of business of the applicant and a deposit with such application of the amount of the license fee. . We assume that you have no place of business in Nebraska, and there - fore believe that by obtaining one license in any county, city or village, in which you do the business mentioned, you would comply with the law. If you are doing business as last above suggested, you would also be a peddler within the meaning of Sections 77-1434 to 77-1436 inc. C. S. 1929, and would have to obtain a peddler's license in each city in which you carried on such business, in addition to the tobacco license mentioned. The county clerks of the respective counties would be the proper officials to whom you should make application.

C. I have your letter of March 6th, asking about the Nebraska law relating to carrying of fire arms in a car. Nebraska has a rather peculiar law relating to carrying concealed weapons. This law is set-out in Section 28-1001, Compiled Statutes of Ne - braska, 1929, which provides: "Whoever shall carry a weapon or weapons concealed on or about his person such as a revolver, pistol, bowie-knife, dirk or knife with a dirk blade attachment, brass or iron knuckles, or any other dangerous weapon, shall on conviction be fined in any sum not exceeding one thousand dollars or imprisoned in the state peniten - tiary not exceeding two years: Provided, however, if it shall be proved from the testimony on the trial, or at a preliminary hearing of such case that the accused was, at the time of carrying any weapon or weapons as aforesaid, engaged in any lawful business, calling or employment and the circumstances in which such person was placed at the time aforesaid was such as to justify a prudent person in carrying the weapon or weapons aforesaid, for the de - fense of his person, property or family, the accused shall be acquitted or discharged." You will note that under this law anyone carrying a concealed weapon may be arrested and subjected to prosecution. The burden of showing that the weapon was carried for a legitimate purpose rests upon the defendant As a matter of practice, however, if the person could establish a legitimate reason for having the gun, no prosecution would be started. This state has no act similar to the Sullivan Act, which provides the manner, in which a gun may be carried. WM. H. WRIGHT, Attorney General </seg>

Speaking with reference to the notice required to be given land owners under the provisions of Sections 26-712 and 713 C. S. Neb. 1929, where the state is taking land for a public highway and cannot, agree with the owners of the land as to the price to be paid, you ask: "A. From your interpretation of said sections what notices and what length of time is required as to the following classes of, owners, to-wit: 1, Resident owners within the county. 2. Owners within the state but residing outside the county. • 3. Nonresident owners. "B. Must these notices be served on all parties prior to the hearing upon the application for appointment of the appraisers or after the appointment but before the appraisement? "C... Can a nonresident waive the service of the statutory notice by entering his voluntary appearance the same as in any other pro - ceedings?" In answer to your questions, I will say. . 1. The statute does not seem to require that notice be given a resident owner within the county, of the time when an application for the appoint - ment of appraisers will be made. The law provides that; "The county, through its county board upon the refusal of any record owner or guardian of any record owner of such j land to agree upon the damages to be paid for the acquisition thereof for the public use of the county, as .aforesaid, shall give such record owner or guardian, if a resident of said county, ten days notice in writing of the time when application for the appointment of appraisers was made in the county court, the court's determination thereof and of the time and place of the appraisers' meeting to inspect the land and assess the damages. Service of such notice on the resident owners, as aforesaid, shall be made by the sheriff of such county either by personal service or by leaving a copy therof at the usual place of residence of such record owner or guard - ian.

If the land owner is a nonresident of the state, the law provides' that "* • * the. county board shall give four weeks' notice to such record owners or guardians by service by publication directed to said record owners or guardians in fee simple by name or by description of such real estate in some newspaper published in the county where such land is situated, or if none is published therein, then such notice shall be published for the same time in some news - paper of general circulation in such county, that the county board of such county have selected real estate to be appropriated for public use which real estate includes his or her lands, and that the same will be taken and appropriated for such purposes, and if such owner shall not within thirty days thereafter apply to said county judge to have the damages assessed in the mode hereinbefore prescribed, said county board may proceed as herein set forth, to have the damages assessed, * * *." Sec. 2C-713 C. S. Neb. 1929. I do not believe that in either case the law requires that a second notice be given. The notice given to a land owner residing in the state, whether he resides in the county or not. is a notice of the time when and the place where the appraisers will meet to determine the amount of damages to be paid for the taking of the land. If the land owner is a nonresident of the state, the notice is given before the appraisers are appointed. He is notified that his land (describing it) has been selected for public use and that if he does not within thirty days thereafter apply to the county judge for the appointment of appraisers, to' have the damages appraised in the manner provided by statute, the county board (Department of Roads and Irrigation in this instance) may proceed to have the damages assessed as set forth in the law. 3.

You ask for an opinion as to whose duty it is to maintain county line roads in counties under township organization. I am of the opinion that it is the duty of the respective counties to maintain county line roads, whether the county is under township organiz - ation or not. Section 39-134 C. S. Neb. 1929 reads as follows: "The establishment, vacation or alteration of a public road, either along or across a county line, may be effected by the concurrent action of the respective county boards in the mode hereinbefore prescribed. The commissioners appointed to locate the road in such cases must act in concert, and the road will not be; deemed established, vacated or altered in either county until it is so in both. All expenses incurred under the provisions of the preceding section, and all expenses in keeping public roads on county lines in repair, shall be paid equally by the counties interested." It will be noted that nothing in the above quoted provision 6t statute indicates that it is not applicable to counties under township organization. This section was passed in 1879. At the same session of the legislature and as a part of the same act there was passed what is now Section 39-1204 Compiled Statutes, which provides that: "Where a public road is located on township lines the county board shall allot the part of such road which such town shall keep in re - pair and the part so allotted shall be considered as wholly belonging to such town." I do not believe this is meant to apply to roads on county lines, for nne-half of the width of any such road would be altogether outside the limits of the county in which the township is situated. I think that provision of statute is applicable to public roads | between townships where the entire width of the road is within one county. GEO. W. AYRES, Assistant Attorney General. </seg>

You say: "I would like an opinion on House Roll No. 438 of the 1935 Legisla - ture. This act repeals Section 33-114 of the 1929 Statutes. It is confusing inasmuch as it is not clear concerning the filing of chattel mortgages or other instruments with assignments attached. "Our County Attorney has ruled that this new law does not re - quire the 25c filing fee on assignments which are made a part of the instrument but if a subsequent assignment is filed, he rules that the fee should be 25c and the auditing firm, who audits our records rule that the fee for filing a chattel mortgage or other instrument with an assignment attached would be 10c for filing and 15c for indexing the instrument and 15c for indexing the assignment." House Roll No. 438 amends section 33-114, C. S. 1929 as amended in 1933. It reads in part as lollows: "Provided, further, he shall receive lor filing every chattel raor - gage, or assignment thereof, or copy therof, ten cents; for entering the same or assignment thereof, in a book, fifteen cents: and for certified copies of such instruments so filed as aforesaid, for every one hundred words, ten cents." You will note the statute provides that a county clerk "shall receive for filing every chattel mortgage and assignment thereof, ten cents." I am of the opinion this means that where the chattel mortgage and the assignment are filed as parts of the same instrument, the filing fee is only ten cents. I am the more inclined to this opinion because of the fact that section 33-114, as amended in 1931, provided a filing fee of ten cents for filing a chattel mortgage or assignment. It seems to me that the Legislature by substituting the word and for the word or between the words "chattel mortgage" and the word "assignment" meant to say that when a chattel mortgage and its assignment are written or printed on the same zhect, and are filed as one instrument, the filing fee should not be more than ten cents. . .'■ Section 33-114, does not name a fee for filing or indexing a conditional salea contract, but section 36-209, C.

We think your answers are correct. ' You also say: . "Section 29 states that the old age pension rate will be $2.00 per person beginning at once, which will make the 1935 tax $2.00 Is this correct?" Our answer is yes. Your third inquiry is: "About 15 old age pension certificates have been filed ordering the payment of pensions for a period of one year. Do these payments stop at once? I am wondering if the pensions ordered to be paid under the old law, would be considered as spent and whether they could be deducted from the amount that the treasurer is to trans - fer to the State Commission." Since the old age pension bill repeals the former law, we believe that all payments should be stopped at once, whether certificates have been issued or otherwise. Your 4th question is: "Is the County Board sitting as a Board of Equalization composed of the County Assessor, the County Commissioners, and the County Clerk, the same as the Equalization Board which meets the 2nd Tuesday after the first Monday in June of each year?" No. The Board of Equalization, mentioned in H. R. 90 is simply the board of county commissioners; while the ordinary county Board of Equaliz - ation, provided for in Section 77-1701 C. S. Neb. 1929 has also the County Assessor, if any. and the County Clerk as additional members. MILTON C. MURPHY, Assistant Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p167">OPINIONS DEFINITION OF "HIGHWAY" AS USED IN S. F. 32. September 1G, 1935. Department of Roads &amp; Irrigation. You have requested this department to define the word "Highway" as the same is used in S. F. 32, Fiftieth Session of the Nebraska State Legis - lature. We are unable to find where the Supreme Court of Nebraska has denned the term but the question has been before numerous other tribunals and a few of the definitions are set forth: "A highway is defined as a public road or passage, a way open to all passengers by either land or water. The approved legal definition of highway is a passage through the country for the use of the people. It is a generic name for all kinds of public ways, and includes city streets. Northwestern Tel. Exch. Co. v. City of Min - neapolis, 86 N. W. 69, 71, 81 Minn. 140, 53 L. R. A. 17; Abbott v. City of Duluth, (U. S.) 104 Fed. 833, 837." "The term 'highway' is a generic term for all kinds of public ways, including county and township roads, streets, and alleys, turn - pikes and plank roads, railroads and tramways, bridges and fer - ries, canals and navigable rivers. In short, every public thorough - fare is a highway. Southern Kansas Ry. Co. v. Oklahoma City. 69 Pac. 1050, 1054, 12 Old. 82; Union Pac. R. R. v. Colfax County Com'rs. 4 Neb. 450, 456; Shelby County Com'rs. v. Castetter, 33 N. E. 986. 987, 7 Ind. App. 309." "A highway is a public road or street over which all citizens may go at will on foot or horseback or in carts or carriages; thoroughfares over which people travel from one part of the country to another. State v. Cowan, 29 N. C. 239, 248."' "The term 'public highway" includes all kinds of thoroughfares in which the public has a right of way or passage. It clearly includes graded and ungraded or finished and unfinished streets. Parsons v. City and County of San Francisco. 23 Cal. 462, 464." In our opinion, a highway is a public road, including city or village streets, open to all persons as a way of passage from one point to another. PAUL P. CHANEY, Assistant Attorney General. </seg>

In your letter of September 2 you inquire whether the County Board can hold your assistance payments for your debts and in reply thereto will advise that it would be unlawful for the County Board to do so. In an opinion of this office., issued on July 9, 1936, it was said, in part. "It is our opinion that where a county clerk or other officer delivers an assistance check to any one other than the payee thereof, oi the duly authorized agent or representative of such payee, and the proceeds of such check are thereby lost to the payee, such clerk oi other officer is liable upon his official bond for the amount lost. "We are further of the. opinion that such clerk or other officer is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a fine and imprisonment under the assistance acts for making such unlawful delivery of an assistance check. See, for example, Sec. 21 of H. R. 19, Fiftyfirst (Special) session. "Section 17 of the same act provides that no assistance shall be alienable by assignment or transfer, or subject to attachment, garnishment or other legal process for any reason or for any debt or obligation whatsoever. </seg>

LEGAL SETTLEMENT OF DEPENDENT CHILDREN January 24, 1936. Mr. Clinton Belknap, Administrator for Assistance Board, Grand Island, Nebraska. In your letter of January 20th you say: "Mr. and Mrs. C. had not lived together for about three years al - though they were not legally separated. Mr. and Mrs. C. had three minor children. The children remained in Hall County with the mother but Mr. C. went to another county in the state and there established a legal settlement. "Because of need, the mother and children were given relief in Hall County where the mother had a legal settlement. As a result of an accident the mother died. The father came and took the children to the county in which he had established a legal settle - ment. After a couple of months, he finds that he is not able to support the children without some assistance. "Do you interpret Section 68-115 Compiled Statutes of Nebraska. 1929, as amended in 1933 as placing the responsibility for this sup - port on Hall County or does the responsibility fall upon the county in which the father has established legal settlement and where he and the children are now living? Or would part of the support become the responsibility of Hall County and part the responsibility to the second county?" </seg>
            <seg id="p170">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL In our opinion, the legal settlement of these children is now in tie county of the residence of the father, where he has established legal settk - ment. The above section of the statute provides, "Every minor • • • .* shall have the same legal settlement as tie parents with whom he has resided * * *." Under the above facts, it seems to us that the father would be deemt d the parent with whom the minors in this case have resided. Under section 14 H. R. 19 of the special session the settlement of these children for the purpose of that act would be deemed to be the county &lt;&gt;i the home of the father with whom they are living. WM. H. WRIGHT. Attorney Gener.- 1 RESIDENCE NECESSARY FOR RELIEF PURPOSES September 28. 19.!i&gt;. Mr Harry D. Elmore, State Director. Nebraska Emergency Relief Administration. # You submit that an apparent conflict exists between (wo of our opinions upon the above subject, and ask for clarification. Section 68-115, C. S. S. 1935 provides, in the first place, that a residence of one year in any county is required to constitute a legal settlement for purpose of relief. The statute further provides, however, that upon i residence of one year in the state, not all of which has been spent in on.' county, then the legal settlement shall be in the county where residence ha&gt; been maintained six months. Consequently, in the event a person has lived in only one county during his entire residence in this state, one year is necessary for a legal settlement, it is therefore impossible in such instances to acquire legal residence in another county in less than an additional yea : in that county. This is the case referred to in our opinion dated Decembe • 18, 1935, to Malcolm R. Smith, county attorney at Dakota City. Residence for legal settlement for relief may be established in a count} in six months only in the case where a person has resided in the state for one year but not in any county for that length of time. In this latter case legaJ residence is established in the county where the person has resided six months. You inquire further whether a person who had established a lega settlement in this state and then left the state for over one year still main - tains his legal residence in this state. Whether he does or not is a question </seg>

DANIEL STUBBS, Assistant Attorney General. DELIVERY OF ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS ■ . July 9, 1936. Mrs. Maud E. Nuquist, Director, State Child Welfare Bureau. We return herewith file of correspondence relative to the case of Clara Kush, 49-C-9, from which it appears that the County Clerk of Howard County delivered the above client's assistance check to a local grocer to whom the client was indebted and who refused to deliver the check to her unless she would endorse the same to him and permit him to retain a large part of it to apply upon the debt. It also appears from this correspondence that this same county clerk delivered a second assistance check to the same grocer upon the strength of a written order from the client the order having been secured from the client by the grocer as a condition to supplying groceries on credit!. It is our opinion that where a county clerk or other officer delivers an assistance check to anyone other than the payee thereof, or the duly author - ized agent or representative of such payee, and the proceeds of such check are thereby lost to the payee, such clerk or other officer is liable upon his official bond for the amount lost. We are further of the opinion that such clerk or other officer is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a fine and imprisonment under the assistance acts for making such unlawful delivery of an assistance check. See, for example, Sec. 21 of H. R. 19, Fiftyfirst (Special) Session. Section 17 of the same act provides that no assistance shall be alienable by assignment or transfer, or subject to attachment, garnishment or other legal process for any reason or for any debt or obligation whatsoever. It is, therefore, our further opinion that even when a creditor secures a written order or assignment from a debtor, whereby the debtor attempts to transfer or assign an assistance payment or any part thereof to the creditor, such assignment or order, whether in writing or otherwise, is </seg>
            <seg id="p172">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL j . absolutely void and must be disregarded by the county clerk and all other, officers administering the assistance laws; and if they fail to disregard the same and fail to deliver the payment, or the check or warrant representing the same, to the proper person, they will be liable upon their official bonds and also criminally liable as aforesaid. It appears from the correspondence mentioned that the client in question, under some duress and compulsion on behalf of her creditor, settled with him after his receipt of the checks from the. county clerk. The client, had she been advised of her rights, could if she had desired to do so have insisted on receiving the checks or the full proceeds thereof, and was not obliged to pay the grocer any sum or sums whatsoever. She waived these rights, how - ever, and we doubt that she could make a civil recovery from the county clerk in these two instances. However, it is our opinion that the county clerk remains subject to and liable for criminal prosecution under the section above mentioned. However, we believe that once the seriousness of his misconduct hts been called to his attention, he will in the future deliver assistance payments to the persons to whom the grants have made, and no one else, even though some debtor secures what purports to be an assignment or transfer thereof from a client. We should appreciate it if you call to our attention any further violations of the law in this regard in order that we may direct the county attorneys of the proper counties to proceed with prosecutions. . MILTON C. MURPHY, Assistant Attorney General. 'RECOVERY FROM ESTATES OF DECEASED RECIPIENTS OF OLD AGE ASSISTANCE August ll.'193(&gt;. Mr. Irl D. Tolen, Director of Assistance. With reference to the letter. of Mr. Tracey T. Frost, which you handed us for reply, will advise that the estate of a deceased recipient is liable for the payment of a claim by the county for old age assistance payments and money expended for funeral and burial expenses of such recipients under the Old Age Assistance Act. The estate might also be liable for a claim for county funds expended for the benefit of the deceased under the pauper laws, although we know of no specific provision therefor. In any event, we would say that the relatives of the deceased mentioned in the pauper law would be liable to repay any amounts advanced by the county, aside </seg>
            <seg id="p173">OPINIONS from the sums paid under the Old Age Assistance Act, and the shares of such relatives in the estate of the deceased would be subject to levy therefore, the same as any other property of such relatives. From Mr. Frost's letter it appears that he may have the impression that the county can simply take over a deceased's property to satisfy its claims. Of course this is not true, — the law requiring that the decedent's estate be administered in the probate court the same as in all other cases, and that the claims for reimbursement of assistance payments be filed the same as any other claims against such estate. In many cases it is quite probable that the value of the estate is so small and the claims of other creditors so numerous and great that very little, if anything, could be realized by the county by filing a claim. If no relative or other creditor applies for administration of the estate, it is up to the county to do so. The costs of administering the estate would, uf course, have to be paid. All of these things should be considered before the matter is pressed, because it might frequently happen that the county would be expending more money in an effort to recover something than it would eventually actually recover. MILTON C. MURPHY, Assistant Attorney General. SETTLEMENT FOR OLD AGE ASSISTANCE John Anderson — Lucinda Mang, Scotts Bluff and Banner counties July 9, 1936. Mr. V. L. Taylor, Supervisor Old Age Assistance. In reply to your letter of June 23rd, will advise that we have had similar inquiries from the county attorney of Scotts Bluff County and from "the county attorney of Banner County, to whom we are forwarding copies of this opinion. We believe that the answer to such inquiries may be found in our opinion under date of March 26, which deals with the question of legal settlement of applicants for old age assistance and blind assistance. We are also sending copies of this opinion to the county attorneys above mentioned. With reference to John Anderson, who moved from Banner County to Scotts Bluff County in April 1935 and made application for assistance in Scotts Bluff County in February 193G, and whose application was filled out and sent to Banner County by the authorities of Scotts Bluff County, where - upon Banner County commenced paying old age assistance to applicant, </seg>
            <seg id="p174">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL it is our opinion that when Anderson had completed one year's actual and bona fide residence in Scotts Bluff County, that county thereupon be - came responsible for further assistance payments to him and that Banner County was relieved of further obligation to Anderson. It is contended that Anderson having been on relief in Scotts Blufi County from April 1935 until January 1936, the provisions of Section 68-115 C. S. S. 1935 apply and therefore Anderson lost that time in gaining a legal settlement in Scotts Bluff County. However, it is our opinion, as expressed in the former opinion above referred to, that the provisions of the pauper law, including Section 68-115. have no application whatsoever in the matter of old age assistance, and that the legal settlement referred to in the assistance acts has no relation to the legal settlement referred to in the pauper laws. They are entirely inde - pendent of each other and deal with independent subjects. The settlement provisions in the assistance acts refer as well to residence prior to the passage thereof as to that subsequent thereto. In other words, we may say that the position taken by the county attorney of Banner County is the correct one, in our opinion. : The same remarks would apply to the case of Lucinda Mang. mentioned in the letter of the Scotts Bluff county attorney. MILTON C. MURPHY. Assistant Attorney General LEGAL SETTLEMENT OF APPLICANTS FOR OLD AGE AND BLIND ASSISTANCE March 26. 1936 Mr. Irl D. Tolen. Director of Assistance. You have handed to us for opinion a letter from the Director of Assis - tance of Colfax County, a part of which is as follows: "I recently took the application of Mrs. Eunice Harris who has the following residence history: Richland, Colfax County, Nebraska— 12-26-35 to 3-12-36. Madison, Lake County. So. Dakota— 10-1-35 to 12-26-35. Harrison. Sioux County. Nebraska— 4-15-35 to 10-1-35. Neligh, Antelope County. Nebraska— 4-1-34 to 3-1-35. </seg>
            <seg id="p175">OPINIONS Page, Holt County, Nebraska— 1883 to 1933. In other words Mrs. Harris has always lived in Holt County, Ne - braska, with the exception of the last few years, she has visited at different places with her various children." In our opinion the applicant in question has a legal settlement in Holt County, Nebraska, under the facts above stated. Therefore, her application should be made in Holt County and not Colfax County. To clarify the confusion which has arisen with reference to Section 25 of H. R. 17 or Section 27 of H. R. 5, will advise that it is our opinion that the provisons of these acts relative to settlement are exclusive so far as administration of assistance to the aged and blind is concerned. Any person who has at the time of making application resided in a given county for a full year is deemed to have a legal settlement in that i-uunty. If the applicant has never resided for a full year in a given county in Nebraska and is otherwise qualified as to residence, then he has no legal settlement and may make application for assistance in the county in which he resides at the time of making application. A person resides in the place which he regards as his domicile or home, that is, the place where he lives with the intention of continuing to live there and of not removing therefrom in the immediate future. A person acquires a new residence by removing from the place where he has been living, with the intention of not returning thereto, but of going to the new place and making that his domicile and home. Residence is a question of intent. In some instances it will be seen that residence and legal settlement may be the same thing, but in other cases they may be entirely different. One may have a legal settlement, as in the example at the beginning of this letter, and leave the county of such settlement and reside temporarily in a number of different counties without losing the legal settlement; and so long as the legal settlement is retained in the given county, that is the county which must furnish the assistance. The acts provide that a new legal settlement shall be acquired after one year's residence in a given county. Therefore, until a person has re - sided for a full year in a given county, the legal settlement obtained in another county continues. When the year has expired, the old legal settle - ment has been lost and a new one acquired in the new county. To summarize: . J 1. One has a legal settlement in the county in which he has last resided for one year or more. </seg>
            <seg id="p176">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 2. Said legal settlement is not lost until he has resided in a new county for one year or more. 3. No legal settlement can be acquired in any county without at least one year's residence therein. 4. One who has never resided for a full year in any given county of this state may receive assistance in the county where he resides at the time of making application. . The above applies to cases where the applicant has been outside of Nebraska, subject of course to the provisions as to residence in this state, and subject to the provision that if one has no legal settlement in any county in this state he shall receive assistance from the county where he resides until legal settlement in some county is acquired. A mere temporary absence from the state, such as a visit to relatives, where leaving the state is not done with the intention of acquiring a new residence outside of the state, does not preclude one from qualifying as to residence. However, if one has actually resided outside of the state during the periods mentioned in the acts, then the provisions relative thereto apply. Of course, removal from and residence outside of the state for a year require cancellation of a certificate, and under Section 2 of H. R. 17 and Section 2 of H. R. 5, continuous residence in this state for one year is one ol the qualifications as to residence which an applicant must have. Temporary absence from the state during said year, where there is no intent to reside outside the state, would not affect the qualification. MILTON C. MURPHY, Assistant Attorney General. INSPECTION OF RECORDS CONCERNING OLD AGE ASSISTANCE March 16. 1936. Mr. M. T. Liewer, Osmond, Nebraska. In your letter of March 14, you ask whether a citizen and taxpayer of ; county may be prevented from viewing the records showing the names o persons to whom old age assistance has been granted and the amounts of the respective grants, and from making a copy thereof. It is our opinion that he can not be prevented from doing so, since these are public records and any taxpayer of the county is specifically permitted by the statute to appeal from any order or finding of the County Assistance Committee. </seg>
            <seg id="p177">OPINIONS Permission should be granted to any citizen and taxpayer to view these records and make copies thereof at all reasonable hours when to do so would not materially or unreasonably interfere with the business and duties of the officials in charge of the records. v MILTON C. MURPHY, Assistant Attorney General. DELEGATION OF DUTIES AND AUTHORITY OF COUNTY ASSISTANCE BOARD March 6, 1936. Mr. Irl D. Tolen, Director of Assistance, Lincoln, Nebraska. I have the question which you submitted to this office for an opinion: which is as follows: I ■ . "Can the County Assistance Committee accept any agency other than their own to carry out the clerical and technical duties for the County Assistance Committee?" This question is not as clear as it might be, but I assume that what is meant is, "Can the County Assistance Board delegate to some organization such as the Community Chest or the N E R A or some other similar organiz - ation the authority and duties granted to and placed on the County Assist - ance Board by the statutes relating to assistance to the aged, the blind, etc?" It is my opinion that the County Assistance Board does not have the power to delegate to any other agency the power or authority to carry out the duties which have been delegated to the County Assistance Board by the Legislature of the State of Nebraska. Of course, the County Assistance Board has the authority to employ its own agents to assist them in performing these duties, but under no circum - stances can they relinquish their control over this matter by turning the entire job over to some other agency. WM. H. WRIGHT, Attorney General. H. R. 17 SPECIAL SESSION, CLAIMS AGAINST ESTATE OF OLD AGE ASSISTANCE March 11, 1936. Mr. Irl D. Tolen, Director of Assistance. In reply to your suggestion that the Nebraska Old Age Assistance Act is claimed by some persons to impose a lien upon the property of recipients </seg>
            <seg id="p178">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL of old age assistance and that the act requires applicants for old age assist' ance to transfer or convey their property to the county or state in order to secure such assistance, will advise that there is no provision in the old age assistance act for any such lien or conveyance whatsoever. Neither the county nor the state acquires any lien on any property of any applicant who receives assistance under the old age assistance act. A person receiving assistance can handle and manage his property without any restriction whatsoever. He can sell it; he can mortgage it or exchange it for other property. He is expected to use his property or the proceeds thereof to supplement the aid received from the state for his living and other ex - penses. Upon the death of one who has been receiving old age assistance, the law requires the county board to file a claim against his estate for the amount of assistance which he has received, but no such claim can be enforced against any real estate of the deceased while it is occupied by the surviving spouse or by any dependent child of the deceased or such surviving spouse In other words if one who has been receiving old age assistance dies and leaves an estate consisting of real or personal property, or both, it is the duty of the county board to file a claim in the county court where the estate of the deceased is being probated, for the amount of assistance which has been paid to the deceased during his lifetime. If none of the heirs or executors of the deceased have commenced probate or administration pro - ceedings for the estate of the deceased, the county board as a claimant should cause administration or probate of the estate to be instituted in the proper county court; and after the appointment of an administrator or executor, the Board should file the claim in the same manner as any other claim against an estate is filed. Once the claim is allowed, the property belonging to the estate is subject to sale for the satisfaction of the claim, the sale to be held, of course, by the administrator or executor of the estate under auth - ority of the proper court. However, so far as a claim of the county for old age assistance is con - cerned, the same cannot be enforced against any real estate of the deceased while it is occupied by the surviving spouse or by any dependent child of the deceased or such surviving spouse. The dependent child must have been dependent upon the recipient or spouse for more than one year prior to the death of the recipient or such surviving spouse. The county treasurer is the proper officer to present the claim of the board to the court. All administrators, executors, referees and trustees of estates subject to the payment of claims above mentioned are by the law personally liable for </seg>
            <seg id="p179">OPINIONS the proper settlement of such claims and the proper application of the proceeds of such estates. The following are three examples of situations which commonly may arise: 1. A man dies leaving property, but leaving no widow or child who has been dependent upon him during the year immediately preceding his death, surviving him. His heirs, or the executors named in his will, if any. make application to the county court of the county in which he resided for administration of his estate, or the probate of his will, as the case may be. Upon admission of the estate to administration, or of the will to probate, the county treasurer files a claim with the county court where the proceedings have been commenced for the full amount of assistance received by the deceased. If no heir or executor has applied to the court for administration of the estate, the county treasurer should make application therefore and file his claim, after securing the appointment of an administrator. At the first claim day after the claim is filed, the treasurer with the county attorney appears and makes proof of the payments of assistance to the recipient. The law requires the court to allow the claim, if proved. If there is money in the estate sufficient to satisfy the claim and other claims against the estate, the administrator or executor pays the same. If there is personal property, the same is sold and the proceeds applied to the payment of the! claim. If there is real estate, the administrator or executor makes application to the district court for a license to sell the real estate and, after proper proceed - ings, applies the proceeds of the sale to the payment of the claim! Many volumes have been written on the detail proceedings and any county board can ascertain what they are by consulting the county attorney and the statutes in such cases made and provided. 2. Where a recipient dies leaving a spouse surviving him and leaving real estate which is occupied by such surviving spouse, the procedure is the same, except that the real estate cannot be sold for the satisfaction of the county's claim until the death of such surviving spouse. 3. Where the recipient dies leaving a surviving spouse and a child who is dependent upon the recipient or upon such surviving spouse, the pro - cedure is the same, except that any real estate occupied by such surviving spouse and/or such dependent child cannot be sold until the death of both the surviving spouse and the dependent child. - The claim mentioned in the act is not a lien upon any property of the recipient and never becomes a lien upon any such property, although when it is once allowed and adjudicated by the probate court, after the death of the deceased, the estate of the surviving spouse becomes liable for the payment </seg>
            <seg id="p180">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL of the amount allowed by the court, as provided by H. R. 17 and the general probate laws of this state. MILTON C. MURPHY, Assistant Attorney Genera] . COUNTY ASSISTANCE COMMITTEE March 3, 1936. Mr. Julius D. Cronin, County Attorney, O'Neill, Nebraska. We shall try to answer the questions contained in your letter of February 27 in their order. Your first question is; "Are members of the County Board, while acting as members of the County Assistance Committee, entitled to a per diem?" Yes. One of the duties of the office of a county commissioner or super - visor is to serve as a member of the County Assistance Committee and Section 33-128 C. S. S. 1935 provides that members of the county board shal be allowed, for the time necessarily employed in the duties of their office. the sum of $5.00. per day, and 5 cents per mile shall be paid out of the general county fund for traveling. The per diem would have to be paid out of the county general fund and could not be paid out of the assistance fund. Your second question is: "Are members of the County Board, while acting as members oi the County Assistance Committee, entitled to mileage or expense?' Our answer is yes. Mileage and expenses could probably be paid out of either the general fund or out of the assistance fund. The third question is: "Are members of the Board of Public Welfare, while serving as a member of the County Assistance Committee, entitled to expense, mileage and compensation?" In our opinion they would be entitled to necessary expenses and mileage, but no wages or salary. The expenses and mileage could be paid from the Assistance fund. Your fourth question is: "Are members of the County Board entitled to compensation, mileage or expense while serving as members of the Blind Assist- </seg>
            <seg id="p181">OPINIONS ance Board or County Relief Board or Old Age Assistance Board or County Child Welfare Board?" The answer to this question is exactly the same as our answer to the first and second questions. The County Assistance Committee is designated as the Old Age Assistance Board, Blind Assistance Board, etc, or merely as the Board in the various acts mentioned, merely as a stenographic and administrative convenience. They are identical in every respect, except name. Your fifth question is: "Are members of the Board of Public Welfare entitled to compen - sation, expense or mileage while serving as members of the Blind Assistance Board or County Relief Board or Old Assistance Board or County Child Welfare Board?" The answer to this question is the same as the answer to your third question. It will be understood that no member of the County Assistance Com - mittee can receive any compensation for his services as a member of the com - mittee. The only reason that members of the Assistance Committee, who are likewise members of the County Board of Commissioners or Super - visors, can receive a per diem compensation is that they are employed in the duties of their office of County Commissioners or Supervisors when they are acting as members of the County Assistance Committee. The County Treasurer receives no more or no less compensation than before, although a part of his time must now be devoted to serving as a member of the County Assistance Committee. MILTON C. MURPHY, Assistant Attorney General. PRO-BATING PAYMENTS HOUSE ROLL NO. 17 I February 28, 1936. Mr. Van Taylor, Division of Old Age Assistance. With reference to the letter, dated February 26, addressed to Mr. Frank Perry, Assistant Supervisor of Old Age Assistance, by Mrs. I Minnie R. Hewitt, County Director of Webster County, which you have submitted to us and which suggests that the Director of Webster County desires to pro - rale payments of old age assistance each month, without changing the amounts shown on the individual certificates and without approval of the Stati- Director of Assistance, will advise that the law permits of no such action by the County Boards or their Directors. </seg>
            <seg id="p182">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Section 4 of H. R. 17 requires the County Board to ascertain the pros - pective average monthly income of each applicant, based upon his income for the 12 months immediately preceding the date of his application and to 'subtract the amount of such prospective average monthly income from $30.00 and the remainder thus obtained shall be the amount in money which the applicant shall be paid as old age assistance each month if qualified for such assistance; provided, if the funds at the disposal of or which may be obtained by the Board for the payment of old age assistance * * * shall at any time become insufficient to pay the full amount of old age assistance to each person residing in the county entitled thereto, then the amount of assistance of each shall be reduced pro rata in proportion to such deficiency in the total amount available or to become available for such purpose * * •." Section 7 provides that the old age assistance certificate shall remain in full force and effect until death of the holder thereof or until and unless some change in the financial condition of the holder appears, or unless and until the circumstances mentioned in the proviso clause above quoted shall °?TL and tHat d SU ° h circumstances do occur, the amount of assistance shall be changed accordingly and notice of such change shall be given to the holder of the certificate. Appeal from any increase or decrease in the amount of any certificate is allowed. It is our opinion that these and other provisions of the act require that an applicant for old age assistance be allowed each month the full amount shown on the face of his assistance certificate, and that no change therein can be made from month to month or at any time except in the event of death when payments, of course, cease, or in the event of some material change in the financial condition of the recipient or in the event that the total monthly payments shown on all of the certificates in the county exceed the funds available for the payment thereof. Then only may the pro rata reduction mentioned in the Act be put into effect. If this occurs, the amount shown on each certificate must be. proportionately reduced after a finding by the County Board, with notice thereof to each recipient, and necessarily with like notice thereof to the director of Assistance, and with the approval of tiie Director of Assistance. And not until the approval of the Director of Assistance has been obtained can the County Board lawfully alter the amounts set forth on the individual certificates. The new amounts of these certificates should be checked and computed by the Director of Assistance and his written approval, with the names numbers and amounts, should be sent to the Board, whereupon the in - dividual certificates would be changed by the Board, pursuant to the order of the State Director. </seg>
            <seg id="p183">OPINIONS In other words, all that the County Board can do is ascertain the fact that there is a deficiency in the funds available, which prevents payment in full of old age assistance grants; to compute the amount of such deficiency anil the approximate reduction which must be made from the individual certificates; notify the recipients and the State Director thereof and, upon approval of such finding by the Director, modify the individual certificates and make payments thereafter accordingly. MILTON C. MURPHY, Assistant Attorney | General. RESIDENTS OF MASONIC HOME APPLYING FOR OLD AGE ASSISTANCE February 12, 1936. Pau! Vandervoort. II., County Assistance Director, Plattsmouth, Nebraska. In your letter of February 8 you state that there are possibly 1 100 resi - dents at the Masonic Home in Plattsmouth, many of whom can undoubtedly qualify as to residence and settlement in Cass County, and all !of whom receive free board and lodging from the Home, as well as clothing and small allowances for pocket money; that none own any personal property or real estate; and you inquire whether these persons should have computed as income the free board and lodging received from the Home. In our opinion a person who receives free board and lodging, or other charity, from a private charitable institution, should not have charged against him as income such free board and lodging or other charity, since the last clause of Section 2 H. R. 17 of the 1935 Special Session specifically excludes such private charity in the computation of income of applicant. We believe that the people in this home would for the most part be regarded as having their settlement in and being entitled to receive assist - ance from Cass County. However, it is our understanding that in this and similar charitable and religious institutions, where a person entering a home furnished by such institution, is the owner of any real estate or personal property, he is required to convey such property to such home, under a contract whereby such home agrees to keep, care for and support him for the remainder of his life. Any residents in the Masonic Home at Plattsmouth, who have entered into any such contract, or whose relatives have entered into ! any such contract for them, or any other contract whereby there is a legal obligation upon the Home to care for and support the aged persons during! their life- </seg>
            <seg id="p184">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ■ : time, could not qualify to receive old age assistance. Their income should be regarded as the equivalent of thirty dollars per month, and no part of same should be regarded as charity. MILTON C. MURPHY, Assistant Attorney General. ALLOCATION OF ASSISTANCE FUND UNDER H. R. 3 December 12, 1935. Honorable R. L. Cochran, Governor of the State of Nebraska. The question is submitted whether in the distribution of the assistance fund to the several counties the payment in any one month is restricted to any specified maximum. The method of distribution is provided in section 9 of H. R. 3, 1935 Special Session. This section provides first that the distri - bution of the amounts allocated to the several counties shall be made in "monthly installments." The amount of each monthly installment is specified as follows: "The amount of each monthly payment to each county shall be determined by the State Assistance Committee and shall be based upon the monthly report and requisition of the county for each activity mentioned herein. * * *." Up to this point there seems to be no restriction fixing a maximum payment for any one month. Rather, within the limits of the allocation for the entire period to any county, the distribution for any month is fixed in amount by the State Assistance Committee based on the requisition of the county and this, if the needs of the county be great enough to support it under the laws appertaining thereto, may be greater than the aliquot monthly division of the whole fund apportioned to a county. Of course, the amount is restricted in that money sufficient to pay the distribution must have been covered into the treasury. The latter part of the section following the portion above discussed provides: "Provided, however, if the amount or amounts requisitioned by any county for any one or more of the said activities for any month be less than the amounts which might be paid therefor for that month on the basis of population as above set forth * * *." This language and particularly that part which is underscored implies that there exists a maximum for any one month. This leaves the proviso and all the provisions relative to the transfer of funds from one activity to </seg>
            <seg id="p185">OPINIONS ■ ■ • another in rather an indefinite status. Without a maximum it is impossible to determine any surplus or deficiency in any fund prior to the expiration of the biennium when it will do no good. Of course, the section, and indeed, the act, must be construed as a whole, and if any other language could be construed as imposing a maximum it should, perhaps, be given if thereby the legislative intent seems to be made clear. Two possibilities here arise. Either the language which precedes the quoted part may be construed to impose a maximum, or the maximum may be found in the inherent restriction that no county may receive more than its pro rata share based on population and than there are funds in the treasury to distribute. The only language which is capable of a meaning which fixes a maximum is that which provides that payments shall be made in "monthly installments." This might be said to mean equal monthly in - stallments. This is considerably weakened however by the language im - mediately following which expressly fixes the amount of each monthly payment in a sum to be fixed by the state committee based on the requisition of the counties. Further, the part which implies a maximum exists also implies it is the total amount to which any one county is entitled for the restriction is that if any requisition be less than the total amount which might be paid to a county for a month "on the basis of population as above set forth." The basis of population is used only to determine the total amount of the dis - tributive share of any one county. I am therefore inclined to the opinion that the only restrictions on the amount which may be paid in any one month upon a proper requisition are that the amount cannot be more than the total amount allocated to the county and the funds actually in the treasury. One is faced with inconsistencies no matter which view is taken. The construction here given will, as a practical matter, obviate any transfer of funds from one activity to another as I have shown. But the maximum which is necessary to make the transfer, when needed, effective, I cannot find in any language of the act. DANIEL STUBBS, Assistant Attorney General. OLD AGE PENSION. SOCIAL SECURITY BILL May 17, 1935. 'Honorable C. D. Green, State Senate, Lincoln, Nebraska. Pursuant to your request, we have examined H.

That the State shall have approved by the Social Security Board a plan for old age assistance, which must provide; (a) That it shall be in effect in all political subdivisions of the State and, if administered by them, be mandatory upon them. (b) That the State shall participate financially in old age assist - ance. (c) That the State must establish or designate a single state agency to administer the plan, or establish or designate a single state agency to supervise the administration of the plan. (d) The plan must provide for granting to any individual whole claim for old age assistance is denied an opportunity for a fair hearing before the State Agency. (e) It must provide such methods of administration as are pre - scribed by the Social Security Board. (f) The State agency must make such reports as such Board may require. ' (g) It must provide for division with the State of amounts col - lected from the estate of any recipient of old age assistance. (h) The plan must not place the age limit at more than 65 except that until January 1, 1940, it may be as much as 70. (i) Residence requirements which exclude any resident of the State who has resided therein 5 years during the 9 years im - mediately preceding the application for old age assistance, if the applicant has resided therein continuously for one year immediately preceding his application, are forbidden. (j) Any citizen of the United States otherwise qualified is eligible to participate, regardless of the length of his citizenship. 2.

The amounts to be paid by the Federal government will be computed upon reports filed by the State, containing its estimate of the total sum to be expended in the following quarter, showing the amount of money ap - propriated or made available by the State and its subdivisions, and if such amount is less than ', •= of the total of estimated expenditures, the State report must show the source or sources from which the difference is expected to be derived. ■ 4. If the said plan shall be changed with reference to age, residence or citizenship requirements, as set forth above, or if the administration of the plan makes such changes, or if there is a substantial failure to comply with the provisions of the Federal act, Federal payments will be withheld. In our opinion the proposed Federal act contemplates that the said plan shall be of a permanent and definite nature and shall not be a temporary or emergency plan. We have examined H. R. 675 and the proposed amendment thereto contained in S. F. 367 and the amendment to said amendment, and S. F. 363 and find that they do not meet the provisions of H. R. 7260 in a number of respects, some of which are as follows: 1. The acts in question show they are emergency measures. ■ 2. They make no reference to the present old age pension act. found in Article 2 of Chapter 68 Comp. Stat. 1933 Supp. and, there - fore, do not place the administration or supervision of the adminis - tration of the old age pensions under a single state agency, as re - quired by the act of Congress. 3. They do not fix the residence, citizenship, age limit and other qualifications of the applicants for assistance. 4. They do not fix the amount of the pension to be paid. ' '{■■ : 'I 5. They do not provide for a hearing before the said agency pre - scribed for an individual whose claim for assistance has been de - nied. 6. They do not provide for division of collections from estates of deceased recipients. 7C' S.

            <seg id="p188">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL no Federal funds will be allotted for old age assistance until the State Funds are available under the said plan. In examining the present Nebraska county old age pension act, being Article 2 of Chapter 68 Comp. Stat. Neb. 1933 Supp., we find; 1. That it fails to comply with the proposed Federal act in that no State agency to administer or supervise the administration of county old age pension funds is designated or established. 2. That the provisions of that act are not mandatory as to what applications shall be approved by the county board (68-203). 3. Or as to the amount of the pension (68-204). 4. There is no provision for state-wide uniformity of pensions. 5. There is no provision for appeal to a State agency. 6. It makes no reference to reports or co-operation and compliance with the Federal acts or rules and regulations of the Social Security Board, or for participation of the United States with the State in estates of deceased recipients. 7. It does not conform with the residence and citizenship pro - visions of the Federal act. We have also examined S. F. 137 in its engrossed form and find that in many respects it complies with the proposed Social Securities Act. but 1. Has an improper citizenship requirement; 2. Does not conform entirely with the residence provisions; 3. Does not place the administration or the supervision of ad - ministration entirely within a single State agency (See Section 13): 4. Does not contemplate the procurement of funds after the ex - piration of the emergency measures of H. R. 675 and S. F. 367; • 5. Section 20 does not clearly provide for cooperation with and reports to the Social Security Board and that part of the section which provides for decreasing of the amount to be paid by the State to recipients by the amount to be received by the Federal govern - ment, which violates the Federal act. With reference to S. F. 367, we believe that it might be held to be unconstitutional for the reason that it attempts to delegate to the State Assistance Committee and to the Congress of the United States power to enact legislation for the State of Nebraska, and that power is reserved by our Constitution to the sovereign state of Nebraska through its Legislature </seg>
            <seg id="p189">OPINIONS We believe that if this state is to enact old age assistance legislation, the act should be full and complete in itself and should not delegate to any state agency or federal agency legislative powers. In our opinion any legislation to be adopted by this State should as clearly and strictly as possible conform to the provisions of the Social Security Act; but should, so far as possible, be independent of the Federal Act.

Srb, Attorney at Law, Dodge, Nebraska. • You ask for an opinion from this department as to whether! it will be legal for the Board of Education of the school district in which the Village of Dodge is situated, to purchase text books for the pupils attending the Saint Wenceslaus School of Dodge with money belonging to the district. In my opinion it will not be lawful to use public money for such a purpose. As I understand it, Saint Wenceslaus School is a sectarian school, and Section 11 of Article VII of the Constitution of Nebraska says, among other things, that: "Neither the State Legislature nor any county, city or other public corporation shall ever make any appropriation fund, * * in aid of any sectarian school * * which is not exclusively owned and con - trolled by the state or a governmental subdivision thereof." The school district in which the Village of Dodge is situated [is a public corporation and the money belonging to it is a public fund. Saint Wenceslaus School of Dodge is a sectarian school and it is not owned and is not ex - clusively controlled by the state or any governmental subdivision thereof. For a statement of the position taken by the Supreme Court of Nebraska upon the construction to be given to the above quoted provision of the Constitution, see State v. Taylor, 122 Neb. 454. GEO. W.

            <seg id="p190">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL TRANSFER TO NEARER SCHOOL December 3, 1935 Mr. John E. Newton, County Attorney, Ponca, Nebraska. You say: "I would like your opinion on the effect which a transfer of certain pupils and premises from one high school district to another may have upon free high school tax. That is, are the premises trans r ferred for free high school tax purposes as well as for general school tax purposes?" I assume you mean a transfer that is made to a nearer school, when there are children in the family who have not completed the eighth grade of school. In such a case it is within the discretion of the county superintendent to grant or not to grant the transfer, but if it is granted, it is the duty of the county superintendent "* * * to place the school taxes except for the payment of special levies for building purposes or existing bonds or interest on the same, of the parents or guardians and of the real estate on which they reside, not exceeding a quarter section of land, for the year next ensuing, in the adjoining district instead of in the district ol their residence, • * *." I take it from this that when a temporary transfer is made for school purposes the entire family are temporarily transferred and that if the transfer is made to a school district maintaining a high school, the children of the family who are in the high school grades may attend the district high school without paying tuition. I am therefore of the opinion that property which has been temporarily transferred to a district maintaining a high school is immune from the pay - ment of a county high school tax while the transfer is in force. GEO. W. AYRES. Assistant Attorney General. TRANSFER FROM ONE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ANOTHER . September 14. 1936. Mr. Maynard Grosshans, County Attorney, York, Nebraska.

            <seg id="p191">OPINIONS from the district of their residence to another district, whose school house is nearer their place of residence, you say: "The party desiring the transfer resides on 160 acres of land, 40 of which contain improvements and upon which he lives. The remaining 120 acres lies across a section line road. Query: would only the 40 acres upon which the improvements lie be transferred, or would the full 160 acres be transferred by the County Clerk? In other words, does the phrase 'real estate on which they reside" limit the number of acres transferred to the particular tract upon which the improvements stand?" I do not believe the law limits the real estate to the particular forty acres on which the buildings are situated. I believe the real estate on which they reside includes the entire farm on which they reside, if it consists of contiguous land and does not exceed one hundred sixty acres in extent. I assume, when I make this statement, there is nothing to show that when the county superintendent made the transfer she made it with any under - standing or agreement that less than the entire farm of one hundred sixty acres should be transferred. GEO. W. AYRES, Assistant Attorney General. TRANSFER FROM ONE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ANOTHER November 2, 1935. Mr. Edwin Moran, County Attorney, Nebraska City,' Nebraska. In answer to the question asked in your letter of the 29th ultimo, I will say that in my opinion if a taxpayer residing in a school district, having a bonded indebtedness, is transferred with his land to another school district, the land transferred will still be liable to the bond tax levied in the district from which the transfer was made, provided it was in that district when the bonded indebtedness was incurred. "The phrase and expression 'school district', as used in the preced - ing section, is hereby declared to mean, intend, and refer to the school district as it existed immediately prior to and at the time of the issuance of any bonds by said school district, including all lands and property and inhabitants comprised and contained in said school district at the time of the issuance of any bonds, and including all and any portions of said district subsequently sepa - rated from said district, whether by the formation of a new dis- </seg>

RECIPROCAL FREE HIGH-SCHOOL TUITION September 16, 1935. Honorable Charles W. Taylor, State Superintendent, Lincoln, Nebraska. In discussing a letter which you received from State Superintendent Markham of Kansas, you ask: "Is it legal for Nebraska to give free high school tuition in counties in Kansas, — in fact all counties except two, and then refuse to give high school tuition to those two counties?" In answer to the question you ask I will say that in my opinion it is legal for a high school in Nebraska to furnish instruction to a high school pupil from Kansas without either the pupil or his parents or guardian paying his tuition, provided the county in which that pupil resides can pay his tuition under the Kansas law and will pay it. I am of the opinion that it is legal to do this, although there may be two border counties in Kansas from which pupils will not be received upon such terms, because of the fact that under the laws of Kansas those two counties do not have money which can be used for the payment of tuition of pupils residing therein, but are attending high school in this state.

You say: "Last winter when the problem of housing the relief clients came up, we built two shelters on our poor farm in Dakota County.

It seems the State Superintendent, or our County Superintendent gave the school board to understand ■ that they did not need to take these children because the shelters were located on land that was not taxed. ■ "The relief committee here would like an opinion from you as to whether this school board has to take these children, or whether the county would have to pay tuition." If the children's parents have no other place of residence, than the shelter upon the poor farm in which they are now staying, I am of the opinion they are entitled to attend school in the district in which their place of residence is situated. The fact that they are residing upon county land \. r hich by reason of its ownership is non-taxable, does not bar them from school privileges. When this state was first settled, many families resided upon the govern - ment homesteads which were not subject to taxation as long as the title to same remained in the United States Government and no one had resided on them long enough to prove up. The children of the families residing on such homesteads were n3t barred by the fact of such residence from attending the public schools. GEO. W. AYRES.

You say you have received a letter which reads in part, as follows: I "At a special called meeting of our Board of Education j held on , Friday Eve, July 19, there was a motion duly made and seconded and a roll call was asked, after a discussion of the motion the roll was called. The results were as follows. Three members! did not wish to vote and passed. Three voted for the motion. The question has come up, did the motion carry or lose? As President of the Board I said the motion carried." I am of the opinion that the President of the Board ruled rightly, unless the question involved was a question where an affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the school board was required by statute, as is the case in the matter of the election of a teacher. </seg>
            <seg id="p194">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL In the matter of the determination of a question by a city council it is said: "It has generally been held that the number of lawful votes actually cast decides the question and that if a quorum is present, an election or measure is determined by the majority of the votc^ actually cast, although an equal or even a greater number refuse or fail to vote." 43 C. J. 510. I do not know of any reason why the same rule should not obtain in the case of a board of education. GEO. W. AYRES. Assistant Attorney General. TRANSPORTATION OF HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS July 22, 1935 Honorable Charles W. Taylor. State Superintendent. Lincoln. Nebraska. You call attention to H. R. No. 105, passed at the last session of the Legislature, which provides that "• ''■' • who shall transport or cause to be transported at public expense any non-resident high school pupil or pupils from any point nearer another school offering high school courses * And you inquire whether this should not be construed as meaning thai distances are- to be measured over "practicable traveled highways open to the public". You say: "We have a specific case in mind where a child is actually only some five miles from a certain high school district, whereas it is - some nine miles to another high school district. However, the nine-mile distance is over a surfaced highway, and the other high school is separated from the residence of the children by deep ravines and gullies, with only the poorest of highways available." In answer to your question I will say that inasmuch as the law does not say the distance shall be measured over "practicable traveled highways", 1 hesitate to put that construction upon it. In many cases there may be a decided difference of opinion as to whether a certain highway is a practicable traveled highway. This is especially true in cases where at infrequent intervals and for short periods of time a part </seg>
            <seg id="p195">OPINIONS of the highway is under water.

You say also: ■ "We have a specific case in mind where a child is actually only some five miles from a certain high school district, whereas it is some nine miles to another high school district. However, the nine-mile distance is over a surfaced highway, and the other high school is separated from the residence of the children by deep ravines and Kullies. with only the poorest of highways available." I am of the opinion that the transportation of such pupils any part of the way by the use of the money of a high school district whose school house is situated farther from their home than is the school house of some other high school district, will be a violation of law. I think the law is intended to forbid the transportation of pupils at public expense by a high school district where they live nearer the school house in some other school district, rather than merely to provide that their transportation by a high school district shall not begin until a point on their road to school is reached, that is somewhat nearer the school house to which they are being transported than it is to the school house in some other district. GEO. W. AYRES, Assistant Attorney General. .••.'■■"■■■" CONSTRUCTION OF WATER SYSTEM BY ART. VI SCHOOL DISTRICT April 8, 1936. Honorable Charles W. Taylor. State Superintendent, Lincoln. Nebraska. You ask how an Article VI school district may finance the construction of a system by which it may furnish needed water for its pupils and for other purposes. In answer to your question. I will say that ;n my opinion it may pay the costs of such a system out of the general fund of the district, if there is money enough in that fund to pay such costs, after taking care of other matters which are properly payable out of such fund or, it may create a tax for the purpose of constructing some system for supplying water to the school. </seg>
            <seg id="p196">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL The law does not in express terms clothe such school district with power to issue bonds for the purpose of digging a well and putting up a windmill or constructing a water system in some other way, although it does say "The board of education may borrow money upon bonds which they are hereby authorized and empowered to issue:" without specifying for what particular purpose such bonds may be issued. Whether this authorizes the issue of bonds for the purpose of providing a supply of water for the district is not entirely -free from doubt, but I am inclined to the opinion that it does. In the case o{ State v.

I am of the opinion that supplying a school with water ior drinking and other uses is a proper school purpose. I beiieve, however, that inasmuch as the right to issue bonds ior such a purpose is not free from doubt, the district had better raise the money in some other way if possible. GEO. W. AYRES.

A member ol the county board may be the moderator of a school district. The two offices are not incompatible. 4. In order to transfer a child from one school district to another, under the provisions of 79-2101, it is necessary that the parent or guardian of the child notify the county superintendent of the facts which will authorize a trai\sfer of a child for school purposes from one district to another for the ensuing school year. It is necessary that the notice be given by| not later than the second Monday in June. I am of the opinion that it is now too late to make such a transfer for the present school year. GEO. W.

State Superintendent, Lincoln, Nebraska You submit to this department for answer a letter you have, received from Superintendent A. H. Staley of Hastings in which he says: , / </seg>
            <seg id="p198">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "Section 79-2523 states that 'and if fifty-one per cent (51%) of the ballots cast at such election shall be for issuing bonds . . . .' The question is the interpretation of the fifty-one per cent. Does thai mean fifty-one per cent of the ballots cast on the bond election, or does it mean fifty-one per cent of the ballots cast in the city - election? You understand, the bond election for the school district is being conducted at the same time as the regular city election April 2, 1935. We wish to know when the bonds cany. It might very easily be fifty-one per cent of the ballots cast on the bond issue, but not fifty-one per cent of the total ballots cast at the city election. "I, personally, feel that it must be fifty-one per cent of the ballot: - cast in the school election because there are many people who vote in the city election and could not vote in the school election. How - ever, the Board here wish to have a ruling on this matter that is authentic." I am of the opinion that it requires fifty-one per cent of all the vote.- - east at the school election to carry the bonds rather than just fifty-one pei cent of the votes cast upon the question of the bond issue. I would think meant fifty-one per cent of the total votes cast at the city election if it were not for the fact that some are qualified voters at the city election who are not qualified voters at the school election. To illustrate: some who arc qualified voters at the city election are not taxed and are not qualified voters at the school election because they in no sense stand in a parental relation to any child of school age residing in the school district, and on the other hand some are legal voters of the school district but not of the city because they reside outside the corporate limits of the city but within the school district. ■ ■ . ■ . i - . ■ ■ GEO. W. AYRES. Assistant Attorney General. PAYMENT OF IRRIGATION TAXES | July 5, 1935. Mr. E. E. Richards, County Attorney, Oshkosh, Nebraska. In you letter of June 18th, you inquire: "Does Chapter 134 of the Session Laws for 1933 which provides for the payment in installments of taxes, as amended by Senate File No. 6 of the 1935 Legislature, include irrigation taxes? That is. are such Irrigation taxes payable in two installments the same as other taxes?" </seg>
            <seg id="p199">OPINIONS Our answer is yes. See Sections 46-120 and 46-131 C. S. 1929 and 46-122 C. S. Supp. 1933, which provide that irrigation assessments shall be collected in the same manner as general taxes. You also inquire: "On lands included in an irrigation district on^which there are irrigation taxes legally levied and assessed, can the county; treasurer accept the payment of the general state, county and school taxes without requiring the payment at the same time of the irrigation taxes?" i The answer to this question is not quite so clear, but we think that so lung as under Section 77-1903 irrigation district assessments can be paid without payment of other general taxes, the converse is and should be true. In the case of Flansburg v. Shumway, 117 Neb. 125, irrigation assessments were held to be taxes, but since they are separate and distinct from other taxes, we cannot see any objection to permitting them to be paid at separate and distinct times from other taxes, and cannot see what difference it would make as to which were paid first. MILTON C. MURPHY, Assistant Attorney General. ■ '. ■ . ■ DELINQUENT IRRIGATION DISTRICT TAXES May 1, 1935. Mr. Rush C. Clarke, County Attorney, ScottsblufF, Nebraska. In reply to your inquiry as to whether taxes and special assessments of an irrigation district for the current year can be paid without payment of the delinquent taxes and special assessments on the same real estate in the district, it is our opinion the current taxes can be so paid. We believe that Section 77-1814 Comp. Stat. Neb. 1929 and Section 77 - 1815 Comp. Stat. Neb. 1933 Suppl. do apply to irrigation taxes and assess - ments but that they apply only to such taxes and assessments when they have been delinquent for more than ten years prior to 1930, and that the provision in the latter section ■'That all taxes shall be paid in the order of priority of delinquency" refers to such taxes and assessments as are included in the consolidated list required by the above sections of the statute. Section 77-1903 Comp. Stat. Neb. 1929 provides for payment of special assessments of any kind including those levied for the use of any jirrigation </seg>

Neb. 1929, in requiring the issuance of tax receipts provides that the receipts shall show for what year taxes are paid and the amount of unpaid taxes, and the date of unredeemed tax sales, if any, for the previous year or years upon the land. Section 46-122 Comp. Stat. Neb. 1933 Suppl. provides that all assessments for irrigation districts are a lien against the property assessed and that "it shall be the duty of the county and township treasurers to collecl such assessment in the same manner as other taxes against real estate are collected, and the revenue laws of the state for the col - lection and sale of land for such taxes are hereby made applicable' to the collection of assessments under this article, ' * *" Section 77-203 Comp. Stat. Neb. 1929 provides that taxes on all real prop - erty shall be a first lien thereon. Section 77-206 Comp. Stat. Neb. 1929 provides that all general taxes due the State and its governmental subdivisions shall be a first lien on the real estate on which levied, and takes priority over all other incumbrances and liens thereon. Section 77-207 Comp. Stat. Neb. 1929 provides that all special assess - ments shall be a lien on the real estate on which assessed, subject to the general taxes mentioned in 77-206. In the case of Fiansburg v. Shumway, 117 Neb. 125 it is held that irriga - tion districts are quasi public corporations, with power to assess property within their boundaries; that irrigation district assessments are taxes, within the meaning of Section 77-206. 1 Section 46-109 Comp. Stat. Neb. 1929 authorizes the board of directors of an irrigation district by the adoption of appropriate by-laws to provide for the suspension of water delivery to any land in the district upon which the irrigation taxes levied and assessed thereon shall remain due and unpaid for two years. It is our opinion that all of the foregoing sections of the statute, when considered together, permit the payment of current irrigation district taxes and assessments without payment of the prior and delinquent irrigation taxes and assessments; that such taxes and assessments fall within the scope of the sections on consolidation of tax lists for certain delinquent taxes and that the provisions permitting the suspension of water delivery in the section last above mentioned are simply supplementary to the other provisions for collection of irrigation district water taxes and assessments, which in no way affect such other methods of collection.

In your letter of January 18th you state that the city of Grand Island has purchased a section of land in Hall County for a municipal airport, the purchase having been made in November 1935, after the property had been assessed for taxation for the year 1935, and before said 1935 taxes became a lien on the property; and inquire whether such taxes are now a lien upon the property, which can be enforced as against the city in the usual manner. In our opinion the moment the city acquired the title to the real estate it became impossible for any lien for any taxes to attach thereto, and that there is no way in which the county can collect the taxes for 1935 upon said real estate, and said taxes should be cancelled on. the books of the county officers, said cancellation stating the reason therefor. Section 2 of Article 8 of the Constitution of Nebraska and Section 77-202 C. S. Neb. 1929 expressly provide that the property of the state and its governmental subdivisions shall be exempt from taxes and taxation. Under the decision in the case of In Re Droll, 108 Neb. 85, 187 N. W. 876, a city is a governmental subdivision of the state and in our opinion airport property owned by cities for public purposes is owned for a governmental purpose and is exempt from taxation. In tact, we know of no property owned by any city which would not be so exempt under the Constitution and statute above mentioned. It should be observed that such property is not exempt from the pay - ment of special taxes, as assessments for local improvements, for example, an airport lying within a drainage district, which might be subject to assess - ments for district purposes. Returning to the original point that where taxes have been assessed upon real estate which is afterward acquired by a municipal corporation, especially where the lien of the assessment has not attached to the property at the time of the time of equalization thereof, such an assessment cannot be collected. Authority for this position is found in 26 R. C. L. Section 263. as follows: "When however, real property acquired by the state or by a munic - ipal corporation for exclusive public purposes is, when so acquired, subject to a lien for unpaid taxes, all proceedings taken to enforce such lien after the property is so acquired for public purposes are void, and in any event after the transfer takes place after the </seg>

You advise us that all counties of Nebraska except Lancaster Coumy.v.. - have remitted to the treasury of the State of Nebraska for the state assist - ance fund all moneys collected under the fifty-cent head tax imposed by Section 20 of Chapter 117, Laws of 1933, pursuant to the provisions of Sec - tion 29 of Chapter 135, Laws of 1935, and Sections 27 and 30 of House Roll No. 17 of the Fifty-first (Special) Session, and that although demand ha.s been duly made the officers of Lancaster County refuse to remit to the State money in the sum of approximately $9,000.00 now on hand in the county old age pension fund established under said 1933 Act. The history of the acts referred to. and the terms and provisions thereof. satisfy us that said money should be immediately remitted by Lancaster County to the State, and that if further delay occurs an action should be commenced for the recovery of the same. In 1933 the legislature enacted Chapter 117 of the Session Laws of 1933. this being a county old age pension act, and provided, in Section 20 thereof, that the county boards should annually levy and collect an old age pension head tax of fifty cents, to be placed in the covinty old age pension fund and used to pay costs and expenses of administration of the act and grants ol assistance to pensioners, — the fifty-cent tax to be the only tax levied and collected for that purpose. In 1935 the regular session enacted Senate File No. 137, which is Chapter 135 of the Session Laws of 1935. and in Section 29 thereof provided that all funds collected for the purpose of old age pension under any prior law of this state should be transferred by the officers or persons having control thereof to the state old age pension fund created by said Senate File No. 137, and that said funds should be available for use for payment of old age pensions created by the new act. Section 30 of the 1935 act repealed the county old age pension act of 1933. The Fifty-first (Special) Session of 1935 enacted House Roll No. 17 as an old age assistance act. and in Section 27 thereof appropriated moneys in </seg>
            <seg id="p203">OPINIONS ihe approximate sum of $61,000.00, which had theretofore been paid in by the counties frcm the county old age pension fund to the new state old age pension fund for old age assistance purposes, and specifically provided that all funds collected for the purpose of old age pensions under any prior law of this state should be transferred to the state assistance fund, to be used as pro - vided in the act, and specifically appropriated said funds for the uses and purposes of the state assistance fund. Section 30 of said House Roll No. 17 repeals the 1933 and 1935 old age pension laws, but provides that said repeals shall in no wise affect the collection of any tax due, delinquent or for any reason unpaid under the provisions of the acts repealed. Taking these provisions together,- it appears clearly that the legislature has required that all of the county old age pension funds be transferred to the state assistance fund for the uses and purposes thereof, and there can be no question as to the power of the legislature to make such a requirement and, therefore, Lancaster County, as well as all other counties, should im - mediately turn over to the state assistance fund all of said fifty-cent head tax.

Answering your letter of August 10th. This office recently advised the State Tax Commissioner as to taxation of stocks of goods warehoused in this state, but from which orders were filled taken by salesmen. Possibly you have reference to this opinion. The only state law relating to direct salesmen is Section 77-1434, Com - piled Statutes, 1929, imposing an occupation tax on peddlers outside corporate limits. This does not apply to interstate commerce. (Menke v. State. 70 Neb. &lt;&gt;fi9: Rosenbloom v. State, 64 Neb. 342.) There are various city ordinances, however, which apply to direct salesmen. We note you state: . "It is called to my attention that you are taking steps to bring down pressure upon the Direct Salesmen, and to require of these men and women a license for operating within the State of Nebraska." </seg>

"The above section, of course, provides this corporation is a publii - corporation, or a political subdivision of the State of Nebraska Article 8, Section 2, Constitution of Nebraska, and 77-202 both provide that the property of the State and its governmental sub - divisions is exempt, and I was wondering whether or not in your opinion a political subdivision is the same as a governmental sub - division. From what I can find, it would seem to me these are noi the same kind of corporation, and that probably such a corporation is not actually a governmental subdivision."

            <seg id="p205">OPINIONS I Lincoln, Nebraska, January 20, 1936. TO ALL COUNTY ATTORNEYS ANP COUNTY TREASURERS: The following questionnaire has been prepared to collate and clarify information previously furnished by this office as to the proper construction of Senate File No. 4, (Special) Session, 1935 Legislature. QUESTIONNAIRE Q. What was the purpose of Senate File No. 4? A. To amend the law so as to provide 'for the payment of certain taxes by owners of motor vehicles before the same may be registered. &lt;-j. Does the law require that the tax on the motor vehicle be paid, or that the owner shall have paid his taxes? A. The law regards, primarily, the personal tax obligation of the owners as to motor vehicles, and not necessarily the tax on the particular car. If the owner owned the car on April 1st of the previous year, he must show he paid taxes on it. If he bought it afterwards (ex - cept in cases of exchange for cars brought into the state before July 1st, as hereinafter explained) he must show he paid taxes on any other motor vehicles for which he was liable for assessment on April 1st of the preceding year. If he owned no car on April 1st of the preceding year (except in cases of purchases of cars brought into the state before July 1st, as hereinafter explained) he is entitled to register the car on proof of that fact. Q. It the owner purchased the car from a manufacturer or distributor out - side the state and brought it into the state after April 1st but before July 1st of the preceding year, must he pay the taxes on it? A. Yes, unless he can show that he listed the money he paid for the car in his tax schedule as on hand April 1st. and paid taxes on the money. Q. Suppose he traded in an old car? A. If he traded in a car assessed to him as of April 1st, he is entitled to a deduction in the assessed value of the. car brought in but must pay taxes on the difference. Q. If he can show that he listed the money that went into the car and/or the old car exchanged, as of April 1st. is he liable to be assessed on the car brought in? A. No. </seg>
            <seg id="p206">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Q. Is he liable on any difference between the amount of money and/or the value of the old car exchanged as listed April 1st and the value of the new car brought in? A. Yes. Q. Suppose an individual purchases a car after April 1st from a dealer who brings it into the state before July 1st, who pays the tax on the new car? A. The dealer. Q. Must the purchaser show that the tax has been paid by the dealer before he can register the car? A. No. Q. Suppose a" car is bought after April 1st, from a dealer or another in - dividual in this state who had title and possession on April 1st. is the present owner liable for the taxes on the car for that year? A. No. Q. If such taxes are unpaid, must he pay them before registering the car? A. No. J Q. If a car is brought into this state after July 1st. is it subject to assess - ment for that year? A. No. Q. Can the present owner be compelled to pay taxes on it before registering it for the ensuing year? A. No. Q. If an owner fails to list a car owned by him April 1st, can he be com - pelled to pay taxes on it before getting it registered for the next year? A. Yes. It can be added to his assessment as omitted property. Q- Do delinquent taxes accrued prior to 1935 have to be paid before a car is registered for 1936? A. No. The law covers only taxes assessed the previous year. Q. In case owner moves from one county to another in which county should, he pay taxes on his car? A. His car (as well as his other personal property) would be subject . to assessment in the county where he resided April 1st. </seg>
            <seg id="p207">OPINIONS * Q. If he pays taxes on the car in the county where assessed as of April 1st. may he register it for the next year in another county where he is then resident? A. Yes. Q. If a non-resident of Nebraska moves into the state, must he pay taxes on the car which he brings in before he can register it for the ensuing year? A. Yes, — if he resided here on April 1st and brought the car in before July 1st. No, — if he did not reside here April 1st, or did not bring the car in until after July 1st. Q. When a car is sold or traded, should the seller give the purchaser his tax receipt? A. No. The law regards the purchaser as the owner and it is his status as to taxes and not the status of the seller which controls, as to the matter of registration. Q. Does this mean that the law releases the property of the seller from any lien for the payment of personal taxes? A. No. The lien still subsists, and although the purchaser may register the car. it might still be taken from him on distress warrant against the seller for delinquent taxes. Q. Should, then, a purchaser, for his own protection, ascertain if there is a lien for taxes on any car he may purchase, even though it is not necessary to show their payment in order to register the car? A. Yes, he should be careful in this regard in order to save himself a possible financial loss. In construing Senate File No. 4, it should be borne in mind that House Roll No. 70, passed by the Regular Session of the 1935 Legislature, was de - signed for the purpose of following each particular motor vehicle and ascer - taining whether the tax upon that particular motor vehicle had been paid before the same should be admitted to registration. Senate File No. 4, passed by the (Special) Session of the 1935 Legislature, amended said House Roll No. 70, passed by the Regular Session, and changed the general purpose of the law so that regard was paid rather to the matter of whether or not the individual owner had paid any taxes which might have been assessed to him against any motor vehicle or vehicles whith he might have owned dur - ing the previous year which were subject to assessment, than to the matter of the payment of taxes upon specific vehicles.

            <seg id="p208">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL MOTOR VEHICLE FUELS, TAXATION OF September 21. 1935. Mr. Jesse L. Dougherty, County Attorney, Columbus, Nebraska. You ask our opinion as to whether a liquid such as kerosene which is not subject to the motor vehicle tax becomes subject to the tax in the hands of a consumer when blended with a taxable liquid so that the compounded product may be and is used to operate motor vehicles. Our opinion is that the consumer becomes liable to pay the motor vehicle fuel tax upon any part of the compounded product upon which a tax has not previously been paid. The tax, in the first place, is an excise tax upon the use of motor vehicle fuels and not a sales tax. Burke v. Bass. 123 Neb. 297 (1932). "Motor vehicle fuels" upon which the tax is laid, are defined in sub - section b of section 66-401, C. S. 1929 to include in addition to the usual gasolines, "And such other volative and inflammable liquids as may be pro - duced or compounded for the purpose of, or as may be used for, operating or propelling motor vehicles * ' *." When non-taxable liquid is mixed with gasoline so that the result is a compound which may be used for operating motor vehicles we believe that it falls within the definition in the quoted section. The same section defines a dealer as one, among others, who com - pounds a motor vehicle fuel as above defined and section 66-405, C. S. 1929 as amended requires such a dealer to pay the four cent (4c) tax on all such fuels so compounded. In addition to the tax on dealers as defined, section 66-416, C. S. Suppl. 1933 (1931 Session Laws p. 363) imposes the same tax on users of the fuels referred to where the tax has not already been paid by a dealer. In our opinion upon the facts you submit the one who compounds the fuel is subject to the tax upon the untaxed part of the compound produced both as a ' dealer under section 66-405, above, and under section 66-416. supra.

            <seg id="p209">OPINIONS MOTOR VEHICLE LICENSE AND TAX November 26, 1935. Mr. Carroll Thompson. County Attorney, Fullerton, Nebraska. The taxation of motor vehicles is not changed under the present law from the provisions that have long existed. AH cars are assessed as of April * 1st. Under section 77-1410 Comp. Stat. 1929, it has always been possible to assess property later brought into the state if it was not exchanged for property already assessed. In case it was so exchanged no new assessment need be made. The new bill enacted by the special session requires production of a tax receipt on the car or cars assessed to the person desiring the license before license may be issued regardless of whether the license sought is on the same or a different car.

We are in receipt of your letter of August 23th, in which you ask r certain questions relative to the collection of delinquent personal taxes. You ask, first, does the fact that a mortgage is given prior to the assess - ment of the taxes due give the mortgagee a first lien ahead of the County. If the mortgage is given before the taxes become a lien, it is superior for that year up to the time the taxes become a lien, and then becomes inferior; it becomes inferior to the taxes for each successive year, as they become lienb. Woolsey v. Chamberlain Banking House, 70 Neb. 194. You ask. second, if taxes are assessed on property which a man owns in 1923 and no effort of collection is made until 1936, does the county lose any of its rights against the personal property which the debtor holds in the year of 1936? The answer is no. You ask, third, should the officer levying under a distress warrant levy only upon an amount of property sufficient to pay the tax lien or should he levy upon all property in the name of the debtor? He should levy upon only sufficient property to pay the tax. You ask, fourth, if a mortgagee were to replevin personal property upon which there is unpaid personal taxes, has the county the right to intervene </seg>
            <seg id="p210">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL and claim a first lien upon the property? We do not understand that there would be a right of intervention for such purpose in the replevin suit. The mortgagee takes the property subject to the payment of taxes, according to the rule laid down in Woolsey v. Chamberlain, supra. We would state further that the lien of taxes upon personal property attaches not only to the property which a taxpayer owned on the 1st of April, but to any property which he may have acquired since that date. It subsists until payment. EDWIN VAIL, Assistant Attorney General. TIME OF FINAL NOTICE BY VILLAGE PURCHASER UNDER SCAVENGER SALE July 22. 1936. Mr. A. P. Coleman, Village Attorney, Walthill. Nebraska. You inquire during what period a village which has purchased a tax sale certificate under a scavenger suit may make final notice and move for confirmation as provided in section 77-2133, Comp. Stat. 1929. We believe that section 77-2144 controls the time limit without any reference to section 77-2136 in the first instance. In other words, if the village elects to take a deed, final notice may be made during the year following the original period of redemption which may be either two or three years depending on the number of years included in the sale. Section 77-2127. This you did not reveal in your letter, so I cannot tell whether the original period is two or three years. If the village fails to make final notice during the first year following the original period of redemption, then under section 77-213G it may do so in the next following year. In other words, if the original period of re - demption was two years in your case, the final notice may be made either during 1935 or 1936 as the village please. DANIEL STUBBS.

The claim against the county did not accrue until after the law became effective and is therefore subject to the law.

Your second question relates to the manner of conveying real estate belonging to the county. As suggested by your letter, this procedure is set forth in Sections 26-104 and 26-105 of said statutes. Where the cost of the real estate to the county does not exceed $3000 and the county board desires to sell the property, it should adopt a resolution reciting the facts and authorize the conveyance, and a deed of conveyance should then be ex - ecuted by the board to the purchaser. If the sale is made upon terms of credit, the resolution should provide therefore and the proper notes and mortgages should be obtained from the purchaser or purchasers. Of course, if the real estate cost the county more than $3,000, the matter of sale would have to be first submitted to the electors of the county. Section 26-105 was amended in 1933 as shown by the Supplement, with the para - graph dealing with sale by the county board remaining practically un - changed. The deed of conveyance should be signed by all of the members of the board, setting forth their official titles. The third question in your letter is whether a county which has purchased at private sale tax sale certificates can obtain title by the pro - cedure set forth for a treasurer's deed. We know of no reason why the county, the same as a private individual. can not obtain a treasurer's deed. Your suggestions in this regard appear to us to be correct. The procedure for the conveyance of real estate so acquired would be the same as outlined above, with reference to real estate acquired by regular tax foreclosure proceedings. MILTON C. MURPHY. Assistant Attorney General. LIQUIDATION OF STATE BANKS March 11. 1935. Department of Banking, Building. We beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of February 19th, in which you propound certain interrogatories with regard 'to the liquidation of state banks. </seg>
            <seg id="p213">OPINIONS It appears that certain banks have voluntarily liquidated and have complied with the provisions of Section 8-169, Compiled Statutes, 1929. The said section provides, amongst other things, that after certain prerequisites have been complied with: "The bank shall cease to be subject to the pro - visions of this article." It would be our opinion, therefore, that where compliance has been made with the provisions of Section 8-169 that your department would have no further regulatory jurisdiction over, nor any liability in connection with such banks. This does not mean, however, that the banks themselves would cease to be governed by such provisions of law as exist with regard to dissolved corporations. They would, in our judgment, have the right to make dis - solution under the provisions of Section 24-211, Compiled Statutes, 1929. by the consent of two-thirds of the stockholders entered upon the records. However, even after such dissolution the Board of Directors would be con - tinued as trustees of the corporation, with full power to settle its affairs under the provisions of Section 24-107, Compiled Statutes, 1929. We do not know of any provision in the statutes for a dissolution notice. In fact, the dissolution of a corporation in this state is rather a misnomer, as so long as there are any liabilities outstanding they may be enforced against any existing assets which may remain under the control of the trustees above referred to. These matters do not, however, affect the mat - ter of regulation, with which your department is concerned. It would ap - pear that it was the purpose of the Legislature to provide for relieving the Banking Department of the duty of regulation upon compliance with the provisions of Section 8-169, and that the matter of adjustment of other .» liabilities than those therein provided for would be a matter of adjustment within the corporation, and without regard to the matter of its character as a banking institution. 1 EDWIN VAIL, Assistant Attorney General. '■;.- • ASSESSMENT OF PERSONAL PROPERTY FOR TAXES; AND REDEMPTION FROM TAX SALES December 3. 1935. Mr. E. E. Richards. County Attorney, Oshkosh, Nebraska. Replying to your letter of November 22nd, with regard to the taxpayer whose cattle were assessed in 1932, and who now claims that taxes were paid in another state before they were shipped into this state, will say that as we take it this is a matter which should have been presented to the </seg>
            <seg id="p214">REPORT OP ATTORNEY GENERAL Board of Equalization, and we do not believe that the county beard tan correct the same at this time. • • ■, With reference to the proper construction of the term "redeem" in the statute relating to foreclosure proceedings instituted by an irrigation dis - trict on a certificate for delinquent taxes purchased by it on lands in said irrigation district, will say that the Constitution requires a two-year period of redemption to be allowed the owner of the land. If this has been allowed after the administrative sale, it is not necessary that it be allowed after the sale in the foreclosure proceedings, but if no two-year period has been allowed after the administrative sale, two years must be allowed the owner to redeem before the foreclosure sale may be confirmed and deed issued. The Nebraska decisions with regard" to the application of the con - stitutional provision (Section 3, Article VIII), providing a period of two years for redemption from sales of real estate for the non-payment of taxes, are well summarized in Dysart on Foreclosures in Nebraska. Sections 243 to 247. inclusive. These sections are too long to quote here, but we would call your attention to the following excerpt from Section 24G: "If there has been a valid administrative tax sale, and the certificate issued thereunder is foreclosed instead of having a Treasurer's deed issued thereon, and all proceedings in connection with such foreclosure are regular, two years having elapsed after the ad - ministrative sale, no right of redemption exists, after the deed is issued. A foreclosure of this kind is as binding on all the parties to the action as any other court action, and is final unless appealed from. If, however, there has been no previous administrative sale. or the action is brought before two years from the expiration of such sale, as allowed by law in certain cases, an absolute right of redemption exists for two years after the sale, even though all proceedings are regular, for the constitutional right of redemption for two years after a sale for taxes cannot be denied (see infra Sec. 244). This two years must be given either after an adminis - trative sale or after a judicial sale, if no administrative sale has been had (see infra Sec. 244)." EDWIN VAIL, Assistant Attorney General. COUNTY TAX LEVY— H. R. 424, 1935 SESSION November 25. 1935. Mr. Dallas S. Gibson, County Attorney, Aurora, Nebraska. We are in receipt of your letter of November 15th, in which you say: "The question has been raised by the Northwestern Railroad Co. on this county's tax assessment rolls, as to the amount of levies </seg>
            <seg id="p215">OPINIONS made in certain instances. The question raised is under House Roll number 424, Serial number 113, of the Nebraska session laws for 1935, which amendments, Section 77-1801 of the Compiled Statutes Css. 1933, in the second sentence of the 1935 law 'In counties having a population of over thirty-five hundred, the rate of tax for county purposes shall not exceed thirty-five cents per hundred dollars, actual valuation, as determined by the assessment rolls; etc. For ordinary county revenue, including the support of the poor, not more than three mills on the dollar valuation; pro - vided, etc."' , - "By the wording of the above quoted part of that section, the question is raised whether thirty-five cents per hundred dollars is all that can possibly be assessed by the county in all instances inclusive, or whether the levy for said ordinary county revenue including the support of the poor, of the blind, and of the county bridge fund and the like, as listed therein, can be made separately and apart from the thirty-five cents on the hundred dollars as provided immediately prior thereto. "It has been the county's attitude, that the wording 'for ordinary' county revenue' is separate and distinct from the following items thereafter set out, which would make it possible for the county to levy a tax of more than thirty-five cents per hundred dollars with the various items therein set out being considered. "I would very kindly appreciate your interpretation on this point, would it meet with your convenience. Kindly thanking you for this information," Please be advised that our office has previously held, in a number of opinions given to other county attorneys, that the maximum levies permit - ted in House Roll No. 424 applied to all counties. Your county, being over 3500 population, would be entitled to a maximum levy under this bill of 3.5. to which, of course, the half mill for relief may be added, making a tola! of 4 mills. Within this total maximum amounts not in excess of the imitations provided in the bill may be levied for purposes as specified. You are probably correct in your assumption that the wording "for ordinary county revenue, etc.," is separate and distinct from the items specifically enumerated thereafter. However, the total of all items should not and must not exceed the maximum limit. . . EDWIN VAIL. Assistant Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p216">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL TAXATION OF OFFICERS AND ENLISTED-' MEN ON MILITARY RESERVATIONS February 17, 1936. Mr. Farley Young, Deputy County Attorney, Court House. Lincoln. Nebraska. We have your letter of February 14th, in which you say: "Our county assessor would like an opinion as to whether or not members of the military service who are stationed in Lancaster County, are exempt from the payment of personal taxes. "The question has been raised by members of the military service stationed at the University of Nebraska who have been refused automobile licenses by the county treasurer unless the personal tax on the automobile is, or has been paid. "Is it your opinion that the County Clerk is justified in removing from the tax rolls any assessments made against soldier or member of the military service residing in this county." Under date of March 27, 1935, we gave an opinion to Max Kier. City Attorney, covering this subject-matter of which we enclose you. herewith. a copy. The matter which iis troubling the military men in this regard is. I think, the fact that we are holding that those officers and enlisted men who reside upon a military reservation within the state are not liable to taxation upon their personal property when located upon a military reservation. This we hold, however, not because they are in military service, nor because their military status in any way affects the right of the state to tax their personal property. The military reservations in question were ceded by the State to the United States Government, and no jurisdiction over taxation was reserved. It is just the same as though they were outside the state. so- far as regards taxes. The State reserved the right to go upon the military reservations to execute civil and criminal process, but that is all. The State does not even have the right to punish for crimes committed upon military reservations, but that power resides in the United States, as was recently held by the United States Supreme Court with regard to a crime committed upon the Ft. Robinson Military Reservation. There is an action pending in Omaha in the Federal Court, where the United States Government is seeking to enjoin the taxing officers from assessing property of officers and enlisted men upon military reservations. It is also sought to enjoin the assessment of intangible property to officers and enlisted men residing off the reservations and in the cities of Lincoln and Omaha. This case has not come on for trial. </seg>
            <seg id="p217">OPINIONS ■■.■-' ■ ■• ' ' ■ " It is to be noted that the United States Government in the Omaha case is not contending that there should be no personal property assessment ugainst officers and enlisted men living off the reservations, but only that there should be no intangible property assessment against them. I do not know whether the Government will insist on including the issues as to intangibles in the suit or not. If they do, we will be obliged to resist that portion of it. Of course, as to the property of officers and enlisted men residing on the military reservation, there can be no doubt that their personal property cannot be taxed under the case of Surplus Trading Company v.

You inquire whether the county board may distribute the printing of thr; delinquent tax list among the various newspapers of the county and publish a part of the list in each newspaper. In bur opinion the statute provides that such list be published in its entirety in one newspaper. Therefore, it cannot be split up among the various newspapers of the county. DANIEL STUBBS, Assistant Attorney General. i ■ ' PAYMENT OF DELINQUENT TAXES October 21, 1936. Mr. John C. Gewacke, County Attorney, Geneva, Nebraska. In reply to your letter of October 20th, referring to statement issued by the State Auditor as to the payment of delinquent taxes, I am advised that the statement referred to is based upon an opinion from this department to the effect that a taxpayer may pay his taxes for the year 1936 without paying any delinquent taxes, and that he may pay any year's delinquent taxes without paying delinquent taxes for other years, provided that ihe delinquent taxes which he attempts to pay have not been placed upon the consolidated tax list. ■ j </seg>
            <seg id="p218">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL We wish to reiterate this opinion. We are familiar with the provisions of Section 77-1815, Compiled Statutes Supplement for 1935. which provides that all taxes shall be paid in the order of priority of delinquency, and can readily see how this language may be construed as applying to all de - linquent taxes. However, an examination of the act of which this section is a part discloses that the subject-matter of the act is only delinquent taxes which are to be, or have been, placed upon the consolidated list provided for in this act. Under this act all delinquent taxes for years prior to a given date are required to be placed upon the consolidated list, and we construe the act to mean that only such taxes as are found upon such consolidated list must be paid in the order of the priority of delinquency. We think this is the intent of the legislature, and from a practical standpoint is the proper construction to be placed upon the statute. i ■': ■•- Another reason why current taxes, as distinguished from delinquent taxes, might be paid without payment of any of the delinquent taxes is that nowhere is there any restriction in regard to such payment of current taxes. In your letter you inquire: "First, is a taxpayer, whose general real property taxes are de - linquent for the years 1930 to 1935 inclusive entitled to pay the delinquent tax together with interest for the year 1932 or any subsequent year without first paying the delinquent tax for the years of 1930 and 1931? In other words, can a taxpayer pay any year or years that he chooses regardless of order of the delinquency of the tax, or must the taxpayer pay his taxes in order by years and can the County Treasurer apply money advanced to the oldest tax?" Our answer to this is that the taxpayer can pay taxes delinquent for any - one year with interest thereon without paying the delinquent taxes for any other year or years, and that the treasurer must apply the taxes so paid to the year designated by the taxpayer. The treasurer could not apply such a payment to the oldest delinquent tax without the consent of the taxpayer. In your letter you also inquire: "Second, can a taxpayer redeem property from a tax sale certificate. issued either to a private person or to a county, by paying one year at a time, or must he pay all of the delinquent taxes, interest and costs at one time? In other words, suppose that a given tax - payer has let his taxes become delinquent from 1929 to 1935 in - clusive. A tax sale certificate was issued at Treasurer's sale in 1931 for the 1929 and 1930 taxes. Can the taxpayer come in at this time and pay the 1929 and 1930 taxes and interest thereon without tendering payment of all subsequent taxes to date? Would it make </seg>
            <seg id="p219">OPINIONS . any difference if a private person purchased the certificate and has paid to the county all taxes to date or whether the county purchased and no money has been paid in?" Where a tax sale certificate has been issued, whether to a private person or a municipality, it can only be redeemed by payment of the full amount of the taxes covered thereby, with the interest and costs provided by law, and he cannot make payments thereon whether by years or otherwise. We think the language of the sections relating to such tax sale certificates so pro - vides. With reference to sub-taxes upon tax sale certificates, the same rule would apply, but if no one has paid the sub-taxes, they should be treated the same as any other delinquent taxes and the taxpayer should be permitted to pay them for any year or years covered thereby. In a case where the county or other municipality has purchased the tax sale certificate, but, of course, has paid no money and has done nothing to include the subsequent taxes under the original certificate, we would say that the taxpayer could pay such subsequent taxes by years or otherwise without redeeming the original certificate. ; :■-... You further inquire: "Third, supposing that in the preceding instance a taxpayer did pay the 1929 and 1930 taxes and the treasurer accepted it, would that cancel the certificate, or could the county still foreclose on that certificate for the 1931 and subsequent taxes, even though only the 1929 and 1930 taxes were set forth on the certificate at the time it was issued?" i Yes, such payment of the tax sale certificate would cancel the same, and there would be nothing for the county to foreclose upon by virtue of such certificate, although, of course, foreclosure could be proceeded with under the other collection statutes. Pending decree, however, under such other proceedings, we believe that the taxpayer would be entitled to pay the de - linquent taxes for any given year. And, you further inquire: "Fourth, it is my understanding that a taxpayer may pay de - linquent general property tax without paying delinquent special assessments or the other way round as long as no tax sale cer - tificate has been issued to anyone. Now is the same thing true after a tax sale certificate has been issued?" We believe you are correct in your understanding as to payment of delinquent general taxes or delinquent special assessments without paying the other before tax sale certificate has been issued. After the issuance of tax sale certificate, we do not think that the general and special taxes can be </seg>
            <seg id="p220">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL so split. We think there is only one way to redeem and that is by paying the total amount covered by the certificate. Again you say: "Heretofore it has been my understanding and 1 have so advised that, first, all delinquent taxes must be paid by years according to the priority of delinquency in all cases where no tax sale cer - i tificate has been issued. Second, in all cases where a tax sale certificate has been issued, then the owner could pay taxes only in the event that the total amount due and delinquent was paid at one time. In other words that there couldn't be any part pay - ments made on the certificate." i The first sentence above should be limited to delinquent taxes upon the consolidated list. The second sentence, in our opinion, is absolutely cor - rect. As we recall it, we have issued opinions covering all of your questions, but since your questions are so clear and direct, we are attempting to make our position with reference thereto equally clear and direct, and are sending a copy of this opinion to the State Auditor with the request that he forward it to all county treasurers.

You ask if a county attorney has the authority to destroy duplicate lax receipts within the meaning of H. R. 555, 50th Session, Nebraska State Legislature. It is our opinion that the above referred to statute does not include duplicate tax receipts but is strictly construed and refers solely to triplicate tax receipts as provided by section 77-1906, C.

We are in receipt of your letter of November 26th, in which you say: "Your attention is directed to Section 77-2129, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska — 1929, having to do with Scavenger tax suits. "This section provides that the owner or holder of a certificate issued upon a sale held upon the decree in a Scavenger tax suit may surrender the same to the County Treasurer and have the same cancelled and such cancellation shall have the effect of redemption from such tax sale. - ■ "Now the question presented to me here is this: A is the owner of a piece of land against which decree has been entered in the Lax foreclosure suit. At the sale subsequently held B purchases the </seg>
            <seg id="p222">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL property and obtains a tax sale certificate from the County Treas - ' urer. After the premium period has expired B sells his certificate, and by endorsement thereon, transfers same to A. "Query; Is A entitled under Section 77-2129 to return the cer - tificate to the County Treasurer and have the same cancelled and thereby effect a redemption from the tax sale? "The section of the statute does not seem to except from its pro - visions the owner of the property. Upon the face of the statute if the owner of the property becomes the holder of that tax certificate by assignment he would have the right to make such redemption." I would see no reason why this certificate might not be transferred back to the owner of the land, providing that the transfer was bona fide and for value. It is not the intention of the scavenger act to penalize the owner of real estate for the non-payment of his taxes, but merely to provide a method whereby property on which taxes have accumulated in excess of the value of the land may be freed from the lien of such taxes and placed in such position that taxes may be paid upon such land in the future. No personal liability attaches to the owner of land which has been sold under a scavenger tax suit, and if after a sale has been made and the land has been sold to a bona fide purchaser the certificate provided for by statute is as - signed back to the owner for value. I could see nothing objectionable in the proceeding, particularly since it is not forbidden by statute. You will understand, of course, that it is hard to exhaust the possibilities of a general proposition, and that there might be considerations which do not occur to my mind at the time of this writing which might operate to cause a decision to the contrary should this matter be raised in court proceedings. I, how - ever, am simply giving you the benefit of my conclusions as the matter is presented, and as a matter of first impression. EDWIN VAIL, Assistant Attorney General. EXEMPTION FROM REAL ESTATE TAX OF THE AKSAKBEN EXPOSITION COMPANY July 29. 1935. State Board of Equalization, Building. With regard to the request now pending before the State Board of Equalization for exemption from real estate tax of the Aksarben Exposition Company, will say it has been thought wise to submit the following princi - ples of law for your guidance, and to call attention to the questions of fact which must be resolved. </seg>
            <seg id="p223">OPINIONS The instant case is not ruled by the Lincoln and Omaha Y. M. C. A. cases recently followed and approved by the Supreme Court in the North Plattc tax cases, for the reason that in those cases property owned by a fraternal or charitable institution was leased in part to a third party having no connection whatsoever with the fraternal or charitable institution, and employed by such third party for commercial purposes. For example, in the North Platte tax cases a building was owned by a fraternal order and the entire first story rented out to a bank, which used that story for banking purposes. Here the property in question is employed for a use which may be said to be commercial, but is so employed by the organization itself. Our Supreme Court has held in a number of cases, to-wit: The St. Elizabeth's Hospital Case, the House of Good Shepherd, and the Union College case, that property may be used by a charitable or educational institution for commercial purposes,! providing the commercial purpose is connected with the charitable or educational feature and is not the primary purpose of the organization but incidental to its charitable or educational purpose. 1 If the property of the Aksarben Exposition Company is to be exempted from taxation, it must be brought within this rule, and it must appear, first, that the exposition company is in fact an educational institution; and. second, it must appear that if any property of the company is being used for a commercial purpose that such purpose is allied to its educational character. and is only an incidental and not the primary use of the property. ■ You should examine such evidential matter as may be submitted by the Association and should determine as a question of fact whether or not the Aksarben falls within this classification. If it does, it should be exempted. If it does not, then it should be placed upon the tax rolls. In this connection will say, however, that it occurs to us that the question of exemption is not properly presented to your Board for decision at this time. As we understand it, the County Board of Equalization has met and adjourned, having failed to act on the question of the assessment of this property, which has been omitted from the tax rolls in Douglas County for several years. This puts the matter up to the County Clerk and should he fail to act the matter might then be properly presented 'to the State Tax Commissioner under the provisions of Section 77-304, Compiled Statutes. 1929. There is, as we understand it, a considerable amount of fraternal, charitable and educational property in Douglas County which has been omitted from the tax rolls and which may be complained of to the Tax Commissioner in case the local authorities should fail to act. </seg>
            <seg id="p224">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL When and if this is done, the matter of exemption of this property would be proper to be determined and not before. However, as the matter was presented at this time, and as a conference was had between representatives of the Aksarben and the State Tax Commissioner, and a representative of the Attorney General's office, we considered it to be as well to address a letter embodying the proper priniciples for consideration at this time as to wait until the matter is finally presented. EDWIN VAIL, Assistant Attorney General. TAXATION OF AK-SAR-BEN EXPOSITION COMPANY June 1. 1936. Hon. Wm. H. Smith, State Tax Commissioner, Building. It is our understanding that the property of the Ak-Sar-Ben Exposition Company in Douglas County has been accorded an exempt status, and you have asked us for an opinion as to whether this was justified under the law. Feeling that the matter turned on questions of fact, we have asked for a statement of the objections and purposes of this company, and particularly a copy of their Articles of Incorporation, in which the same are reflected. This information has been furnished us by the company in the form of a written brief, which is herewith transmitted, and we have given the matter very careful consideration: It appears from Article IV of the Articles of Incorporation of this com - pany, that they have an authorized capital stock of one million dollars, of which 7,651 shares have been fully paid for and have been issued. It is. however, further provided in this article: "The net earnings of the corporation shall be retained and used to enable the company to develop its plans, and carry out more fully its obligations to the public; and no dividends shall be de - clared or paid thereon or therefrom." It would thus appear that the company is in fact a non-profit corpora - tion, and that the payment for and issuance of stock evidences no more than a subscription by the general public for the use and purposes of the corporation. It is, therefore, to be classed as a non-profit corporation. To discern the purpose for which the corporation is organized, we must have reference to Article III, in which it is stated: "The general nature of the business to be transacted is the pur - chasing, owning, improving, leasing, mortgaging and selling of real estate in Douglas County; the promotion of agriculture, the </seg>
            <seg id="p225">OPINIONS improvement of the breed of horses, cattle and other live stock, the encouragement of calf clubs, and the development of dairying, in Nebraska: the holding and conducting of expositions, stock shows, agricultural and industrial ' exhibitions, automobile shows, conventions, concerts, fairs, horse races, carnivals, parades, and other forms of public entertainment." We take it that the expressed purpose of purchasing, owning, im - proving, leasing, mortgaging and selling of real estate in Douglas County is incidental and in aid of the other expressed purposes. Section 2 of Article VIII of the Constitution of the State of Nebraska provides as follows: ■ "The property of the state and its governmental subdivisions shall be exempt from taxation. The Legislature by general law may exempt property owned by and used exclusively for agricultural and horticultural societies, and property owned and used ex - clusively for educational, religious, charitable or cemetery purposes, when such property is not owned or used for financial gain or profit to either the owner or user. * * * " Section 77-202. Compiled Statutes, 1929, is as follows: "The following property shall be exempt from taxes: (1) The property of the state and its governmental subdivisions. (2) Prop - erty owned by and used exclusively for agricultural and horti - cultural societies, and property owned and used exclusively for educational, religious, charitable or cemetery purposes, when such property is not owned or used for financial gain or profit to either the owner or user. • ' ■ The questions with which we have to do here are: A. Whether or not the property of this company is to be taken and regarded as either (1) property owned by and used exclusively for an agricultural society, or (2) property owned and used exclusively for (a) charitable or (b) educational purposes; B. If we find such property to be exclusively devoted to any one of the use:; t,pecined. we must then determine whether such property is owned or used for financial gain or profit to either the owner or user. It seems clear to us that the general purpose of the company, as ex - pressed in the Articles of Incorporation above set forth, is no other or different than the purpose of the State Fair, or of the County Fairs which nrr&gt; held within the various counties throughout the State. </seg>
            <seg id="p226">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL The expressed purpose of the Articles of Incorporation, to which we refer, are the: "promotion of agriculture, the improvement of the breed of horses, cattle and other live stock, the encouragement of calf clubs, and the development of dairying in Nebraska; the holding and con - ducting of expositions, stock shows, agricultural and industrial exhibitions, automobile shows, conventions, concerts, fairs, horse races, carnivals, parades, and other forms of public entertainment." We conceive that the objects and purposes expressed have to do with the promotion of agriculture, — either directly or indirectly. Agriculture is the basic industry of our state.- We have no other resource and practically all of our business and industry are based upon agriculture. The_ use of the term in this broad sense is not anomolous. Sections 2-201 and following, C. S. 1929, provide for the formation of agricultural societies in the various counties of the State, and for the holding of County Fairs under their auspices. With regard to the objects and purposes of such county agricultural societies, it is provided, in Section 2-201 : "All county agricultural societies organized pursuant to law shall annually offer and award premiums for the improvement of soil, crops, tillage, manures, implements, stock, articles of domestic industry, and such other articles, products and improvements as they may deem proper, and perform all such acts as they may deem best calculated to promote the agricultural ;md manufacturing interests of the county and state." • For these purposes each society is empowered to "acquire, take, hold and appropriate so much real estate as may be necessary, not exceeding 160 acres of land for the purpose of holding county fairs." (Sec. 2-204. C. S. 1929) It will thus be seen that there is a great similarity between the purposes of the Ak-Sar-Ben Exposition Company, as expressed in its Articles of Incorporation and those of the County Agricultural societies as defined in the statutes. It is contended by the Ak-Sar-Ben Exposition Company that their objects and purposes are also such as are embraced under the terms "charitable" and "educational", reference being made to the recent cases decided by our Supreme Court, where various fraternal orders were held to be within that category. This contention may be well founded, but we do not believe that it will be necessary to discuss it at length, in view of the broad scope which the term "agricultural society" should be given. </seg>
            <seg id="p227">OPINIONS It is entirely possible that the term '"charitable." as used in the .ex - emption statute, should be defined quite broadly. The connotation of almsgiving or aiding the needy is but a single phase of the meaning of the word, "charity." The primary sense of the word, as defined in the Shoi-ter Oxford English Dictionary, Vol. 1, page 294, is "Christian love; especially the Christian love of our fellow men." Considering a charitable institution as one designed for the public or community welfare, it is not to be thought that the makers of our Constitution, or the framers of our statutes, should have harbored the idea that any institution admittedly designed not for the good of the individual, but for the welfare of the public as a whole, should bo* denied exemption from the burden of taxation while that benefit is conferred upon other property. The same considerations apply to the use of the term "educational." For a more detailed discussion of these terms, see Ancient &amp; Accepted Scottish Rite v. County Commissioners. 122 Neb. 586. We now come to a consideration of the further question as to whether Or not the company's property is "not owned or used for financial gain oi profit to either the owner or user." In this connection, we have in mind particularly the use which is made of the property for the holding of racing meet;' pach year. In the recent case of Masonic Temple Craft v. Board of Equalization, 129 Neb. 293. this office appeared for the State of Nebraska as amicus curiae. In that case it appeared that a certain building in North Platte was owned by a fraternal order, but that a portion of it was rented out to a third party who wai employing it for a commercial use. The position taken by this office is indicated by the following propositions of law, which were set out in our brief: "It is the exclusive use for the purpose named in the Constitution and statute and not the ownership of the property which determines whether the property is subject to the burden of taxation or not." i Scott v. Society of Russian Israelites, 59 Neb. 571. First Christian Church v. City, of Beatrice, 39 Neb. 432. Y.M.C.A. of Omaha v. Douglas Co., 60 Neb. 642. "A fraternal or benevolent organization, whose property is de - voted exclusively to religious, educational or charitable purposes, and not for gain or profit, is entitled to exemption from taxation under Article VIII, Section 2, Nebraska Constitution, and Section 77-202, Compiled Statutes! 1929."

" St. Elizabeth Hosp. v. Lancaster Co.. 109 Neb. ](M. Central Union Conf. Ass'n of College View v. Lancaster Co., 109 Neb. 106. House of the Good Shepherd v. Bd. of Equalization of Douglas Co., 113 Neb. 489. Y.M.C.A. of the City of Lincoln v. Lancaster Co., supra. The question presented in the instant case is whether the use of the company's property for the holding of race meets is a necessary or proper incident to the carrying out of the dominant purposes of the organization. which is, as we have pointed out, the fostering of agriculture and connected activities. It will be observed in the inception that in the North Platte lodge case which we have just referred to, the property was rented to an outsider who was using the property for a private commercial purpose. In contradistinction to that case, we might refer to the case of Central Union Conference Ass'n of College View v. Lancaster County, 109 Neb. 106. In that case, Union College, located at College View, operated a dairy farm in connection with its agricultural department and it was held that this use was incidental to the dominant educational purpose of the institution. We do not regard the fact that the proceeds received from the racing meets are devoted to defraying of the expenses of the Exposition Company, </seg>
            <seg id="p229">OPINIONS . ■ ■ ■■■,'■.■ ■ ■ ■-.■•,' nor oven the fact that the Exposition Company could not exist if it were not [or there races, as beiv&gt;&lt;.&lt; controlling. We must consider, therefore, whether racing r-.eets, or trials of rpeed, as they are sometimes termed in the Ltatute", constitute either a necessary or a proper incident to the promotion &lt;:i agricultural activities. Referring again to the sections of the statute with regard to county agricultural societies, we find that trials of speed are expressly authorized to be held in connection with the various county fairs over the state. While we do not find any such express authorization with regard to the State Fair, we do find that the legislature made express appropriation for the construction of a grandstand at the State Fair and the issuance of some S250.0G0 in debentures to aid in the construction thereof, and this grandstand, according to common report, is used in a large measure lor the convenience of spectators who view racing contests of different characters at the annual State Fair. It seems to be generally conceded by the opinion of the lawmakers of the state that racing meets are, if not a necessary, at least a proper incident to agricultural fairs and expositions, ami that the income derived therefrom may properly be applied to their support. In fact, the recently enacted provisions of law governing the State Racins Commission and the operation of pari-mutuel devices (Sec. 2-1501 and following, C. S. Supp. 1935) provide for the distribution amongst tlie various counties holding agricultural fairs or expositions of the net availb derived from the pari-mutuel devices for the purposes set out in Section 2-202. C. S. 1929. above referred to. We are. therefore, of the opinion that the use of the property by the Association itself for the purpose of conducting race meets is but an inci - dental use of the property and not its dominant use. By reason of the premises, we are brought to the conclusion that the county assessor of Douglas County was correct in granting exemption to the property owned by the Ak-Sar-Ben Exposition Company.

You inquire how large a tax levy an Article III school district may make for the purpose of raising money without the issue of bonds to build a school house. The act providing for a ten mill levy for that purpose was passed before the law was amended in 1921 to provide that the assessed value of </seg>
            <seg id="p230">REPORT OK ATTORNEY GENERAL property should be one-fifth of its actual value as it had been for some years prior to 1921, and section 77-1201, Compiled Statutes was passed for the purpose of adjusting the matter of taxation so that no greater amount of tax could be levied against property than could have been levied before the law was changed so as to make the actual value instead of one-fifth the actual value of property the assessed value. A levy of two mills on the actual value is equivalent to a levy of ten mills on one-fifth of the actual value. GEO. W. AYRES, Assistant Attorney General. j December 31, 1&lt;J35. Mr. W. E. Mumby. County Attorney. Harrison. Nebraska. You say the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company, which has heretofore paid taxes upon property owned by it within the limits of the Fort Robinson Military Reservation, now demands a return of the taxes paid upon the ground; that the property upon which it demands a return of the tax paid lies within territory which is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States and is therefore not taxable by the state of Nebraska. The act in question, by which jurisdiction over the Fort Robinson Military Reservation was ceded to the United States, was passed in 1887. It constitutes Chapter 83 of the Session Laws of 1887 and reads in part as follows: "Sec. 1. That the jurisdiction of the state of Nebraska in and over the military reservations known as Fort Niobrara and Fort Robin - son be and the same are hereby ceded to the United States. "Provided, That the jurisdiction hereby ceded shall continue no longer than the United States shall own and occupy said military reservations. "Sec. 2. The said jurisdiction is ceded upon the express condition that the state of Nebraska shall retain concurrent jurisdiction with . the United States in and over the said military reservations so far as that all civil process in all cases, and such criminal or other process may issue under the laws or authority of the state of Nebraska against any person or persons charged with crime or misdemeanors committed within said state, may be executed therein in the same way. and manner as if such jurisdiction had not been ceded except so far as such process may affect the real and personal property of the United States: </seg>
            <seg id="p231">OPINIONS Provided. That nothing in the foregoing act shall be construed so as to prevent the opening and keeping in repair public roads and highways across and over said reservations." In the case of United States v. Unzueta, 281 U. S. 138, the Supreme Court of the United States said: "Rijhts of way for various purposes, such as for railroads, ditches, pipe lines, telegraph and telephone lines, across Federal reservations, may be entirely compatible with exclusive jurisdiction ceded to the United States." It appears, therefore, there is no inconsistency in the state granting jurisdiction to the United States Government while it retains the right to open and repair roads over and across the reservation, which I take it is not entirely severed from the state. In other words, the reservation is still a part of the state of Nebraska, although the state has granted the United States jurisdiction over it. I do not know of any reason why the assessment and collection of taxes by the state against a private party residing or being on the reser - vation should interefere in any way with the jurisdiction granted the United States. In any event, it appears that in this case the taxes have been as - sessed and collected and the only question is whether they shall be returned. Although the question may not be. entirely free from doubt, no good reason occurs to me why they should be returned and I am of the opinion therefore, that the treasurer of your county will be justified in declining to return said taxes, unless and until he is ordered so to do by a court of competent jurisdiction.

DANIEL' STUBBS. Assistant Attorney General. POWER OF COUNTY BOARD TO REVISE SCHOOL DISTRICT TAX LEVY September 27. 1935. Hoagland. Carr. &amp; Hoagland. Attorneys at Law. North Plalte. Nebraska. You ask our opinion as to whether the county board is authorized to ascertain the amounts on hand by a school district at the end of the fiscal year and subtract that amount from the estimate of funds necessary for the ensuing year before levying the school district taxes. In the first place, it is clear that the school district may lawfully levy only the balance left after subtracting the amount on hand from th? estimate for the next year. U. P. v. Troupe. 99 Neb. 73. This amount is primarily for the school district to determine. Section 79-604. C. S. 1929 provides that the school district shall certify to the county clerk the amount of the taxes voted by the district. This certification is presumably a lawful levy. If. upon the face of the certification irregularities appear, it is the duty of the county board to correct them. We do not believe, however, that the county board is authorized to examine the history of the levy to ascertain if it is in all respects regular. To do so would impose a tremendous burden and responsibility which we could expect to find in express language if intended to be authorized by the legislature. If the county board attempted to go behind the certificate which was regular on its face, it would necessitate an examination of the records of the school district as well as of the county treasurer. It is only the unen - cumbered balance on hand which must be deducted from the total estimate and only the records of the school district will disclose whether the funds in possession of the county treasurer are encumbered. In the absence of express direction for the county board to review all proceedings by the school district board, we do not believe it is their duty nor that they are authorized to do so.

            <seg id="p234">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL NEBRASKA UNIFORM NARCOTIC ACT July 12, 19a5. Dr. P. H. Bartholomew, Director of Health, Lincoln, Nebraska. Pursuant to your request, we have examined H. R. No. 147 relating to narcotic drugs and have also examined the forms and regulations and the Federal Narcotic Act which you submitted to us. In our opinion, Section 3 of the former Act requires the licensing of manufacturers and wholesalers of narcotic drugs by the Department of Health. Other persons referred to in the Act are not required to be licensed by the Department. All of the records and reports required to be made under this Act are required to be made under the Federal Narcotic laws and the regulations of the Bureau of Prohibition; so that compliance with such Federal Narcotic laws and regulations, in our opinion, constitute a compliance with the pro - visions of the state law. Section 9 (5) of H. R. 147 provides that the form of records shall be prescribed by the Department of Health. It further provides that the keep - ing of a record required by or under the Federal Narcotic laws, containing substantially the same information as is specified above, shall constitute compliance with this section, except that each record shall contain a de - tailed list of the narcotic drugs lost, destroyed or stolen, etc. These same re - quirements are made under the Federal Narcotic laws. Therefore, a general rule requiring all records to be kept by all persons to whom this Act applies, to conform with the Federal requirements, should be sufficient. We enclose herewith a form which might be used for applications of manufacturers and wholesalers of narcotic drugs for license from the De - partment of Health. You will note that under 'instructions to applicants' it is stated "The sum of 25 cents should accompany each application for printing, postage," etc. We believe that it is within your power to require the applicants to pay these expenses, and we think' there will be no objection thereto, although the Act does not prescribe any license fee or other charge whatsoever. The form of license to be issued should be very simple and should follow similar forms used by your Department. The term of the license is not prescribed by the Act and in your discretion you could fix any reasonable term. </seg>

' : FEES OF WITNESSES AT CORONER'S INQUEST March 28, 1936. Mr. Carl Peterson, County Attorney, Hayes Center, Nebraska. In your letter of March 25 you inquire: "Will you kindly advise what, if any, per diem pay witnesses at an inquest held by the coroner are entitled to? "Should such fees be paid by the county treasurer on certificate of the coroner, as in the case of coroner jurors? "Should there be no provision for the payment of such fees, would the treasurer and/or the coroner be liable to the county upon their respective bonds, in the event payment of fees at the same rate the jurors are paid by certificate of coroner directed to the county treasurer?" In our opinion witnesses called at a coroner's inquest are entitled to fees in the same amount as the fees paid to jurors serving at the inquest, to-wit: $2.00 per day, plus mileage, and such fees should be paid by the county treasurer on certificate of the coroner. We have been unable to find any specific provision of statute as to the amount or method of payment of fees of such witnesses, but there are certain portions of the articles dealing with coroners which indicate that such fees arc intended to be paid and the case of Moore v. Box Butte Co. 78 Neb. 561, holds that witnesses can draw fees. We have examined the statutes in force at the time that case arose and then as now there was no express provision for the amount or method of payment of such witness fees. We believe that there would be no liability upon the treasurer or coroner for payment of such fees even with this slight authority to rely upon. The law relating to inquests would be quite ineffective if there were no means of payment of fees and mileage to the witnesses and we doubt that they could be compelled to attend should they demand payment of their fees in advance.

Nebraska. You ask whether a licensed chiropractor is authorized to use diathermy in the treatment of patients in this state. In our opinion it is not authorized and is a violation of law if it is done. Diathermic is the treatment of body tissue by the use of electrical radiant heat which penetrates to the inner fibres of the tissue. Section 71-1101 defines the practice of chiropratic as follows: "2. Persons who treat human ailments by the adjustment by hand of any articulation of the spine." In our opinion the use of diathermic is not included within the above definition and is the practice of medicine so that no one but a licensed doctor of medicine may use it in the treatment of human ailments. In St. Bd. v. DcBaun (N.J.) 147 At!. 144, the court said: "Electricity is a dangerous instrumentality with the ever-present capacity to do serious bodily harm unless restrained within proper limitations. It is essential that its use as applied to the human body should be under the direction of authorized persons. Its use in the instant case was a part of the art of healing. The specific - use above referred to in no wise involved the function of hand manipulation. We are unable to conceive of any hypothesis in the proofs in the case upon which the use of electricity in the manner stated is a part of the practice of chiropractic." See also: Larson v.

We also acknowledge receipt of the memorandum brief which you submitted in support of your conttntirn that this statute, in so far as it excludes aliens from practicing dentistry, is inoperative by reason of the treaty of our country with Ger - many, which was signed on December 8. 1923. and thereafter ratified and proclaimed on October 14. 1925. The memorandum which you have submitted discloses that Walter J;iL-c;b Lowenstein was born at Wiesbaden-Schierstein, Germany, of German parents, on January 27, 1912. and that he attended the public schools of his home town for three years, was a student at the Gymnasium of the famous Riehl-School in Wiesbaden-Biebrich. Germany, and that he was graduated in March. 1930 from this Gymnasium. He thereafter studied at the Uni- . versities of Frankfurt and Bonn in Germany, and in March, 1934. completed his dental studies at Frankfurt' and thereafter successfully passed the Prussian State Examination. He continued his Continental studies by doing research work at the University Hospital at Frankfurt, and received chfj degree of Doctor of Dental Surgery from the Goethe University of Frankfurt. Shortly thereafter he emigrated to America and went to Denver, Colorado, where, on October 10, 1934, he made application for his first citizenship papers which were granted to him. From August 24, 1934 to January 2(i. 1935, he was employed at the National Jewish Hospital in Denver, and during that time he attended the Opportunity School in Denver, where he learned the English language and was granted a cer - tificate from that school which is the equivalent of a high school diploma. After completing his work at the Opportunity School in Denver, he went to Omaha and entered the Dental College of Creighton, from which he was graduated in June. 1936. In the summer of this year he took the examination given by the State Board of Dental Examiners, and was notified by this examining board on July 9, 1936, that he had passed the examination and thai his license to practice dentistry would be issued promptly by the proper authorities. He was, however, later told by the secretary of the examining board that no license to practice dentistry in Nebraska could be issued to him by reason of section 71-202. supra, as he was still a German national. There appears to be no dispute that he has complied with all of the acts of Congress and the applicable regulations pertaining to the entry of aliens into the United States. The only question presented appears to be whether or not section 71-202, which prohibits an alien from practicing dentistry in the State of Nebraska, is inoperative so far as German nationals are concerned by reason of our treaty with that country. We believe that this question is disposed of by reason of the provisions of our treaty with Germany. This treaty was proclaimed by the President </seg>
            <seg id="p238">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL of the United States on October 14, 1925. This treaty, vntitled a Treaty of "Friendship, Commerce and Consular Rights" between the United States and Germany, provides by Article I that: "The nationals of each of the Hi«h Contracting Parties shall be permitted to enter, travel and reside in the territories of the other: to exercise liberty of conscience and freedom of worship; to engage in professional, scientific, religious, philanthropic, manufacturing and commercial work of every kind without interference; to carry on every form of commercial activity which is not forbidden by the local law; to own, erect or lease and occupy appropriate buildings and to lease lands for residential, scientific, religious, philanthropic, manufacturing, commercial and mortuary purposes; to employ agents of their choice, and generally to do anything incidental to or necessary for the enjoyment of any of the foregoing privileges upon the same terms as nationals of the state of residence or as nationals of the nation hereafter to be most favored by it. submitting them - selves to all local laws and regulations duly established." (Emphasis ours). One observes that Article I. supra, expressly provides that the nationals of each of the high contracting parties shall be permittted to engage in pro - fessional work of every kind without interference. Although the language of Article I, supra, in our opinion confers upon aliens the right to engage in the practice of dentistry without question, it is of interest to note the con - struction placed upon this article by Charles M. Barnes. Chief of the Treaty Division of the Department of State, who in a letter of July 15. stated as follows: "Your attention is invited to the first paragraph of Article I, which relates to the rights of nationals of each country to engage in pro - fessional work in the territory of the other." If Article I can be said to be ambiguous or susceptible of varying con - structions, it is well to recall that the administrative construction of a treaty is entitled to great weight in arriving at the meaning of the treaty itself. See: Goos v. Brocks, 117 Neb. 750. And it is of course axiomatic that a treaty is not to be construed in a narrow or academic sense, but should receive a liberal construction which seeks to effectuate the apparent purpose of the contracting parties. See for example: Hyde, International Law, sec. 531. Geofry v. Biggs, 133 U. S. 258. Hauenstein v. Lynham. 100 U. S. 483. Santovinccnzo v. Egan, 284 U. S. 30. Factor v. Laubenheimer, 290 U.

            <seg id="p239">OPINIONS As .section 71-202, C. S. 1929. insofar as it limits the right to practice dentistry to citizens of the United States, is in apparent conflict with the provisions of Article I, supra, the former is rendered inoperative by the provisions of the latter. This is in accord with the rule that any conflicting law of a state must yield to the provisions of a treaty within the scope of the treaty making power. Sec: Missouri v. Holland. 252 U. S. 416.

In conclusion, it is our opinion that section 71-202, insofar as it denies aliens the right to engage in the practice of dentistry, is inoperative by reason of our treaty with Germany.

Suppl. of Nebraska, 1933, in so far as the same applies to your profession.

House Roll 473, 47th session, Nebraska State Legislature (1931) amended this law only to shorten the time that the applicant had to be in the pro - fession in another state. This was shortened from five years to one year. Senate File 126, 49th session, Nebraska State Legislature (1933) amended this law again, the added amendment being a proviso which does not effect your profession. It is our opinion that section 71-501 of the Nebraska statute, as amended, is an authorization to the Department of Public Health and Welfare and that the department may, without examination, issue a license to practice embalming to a citizen of the United States who has been active in the practice of that profession in some other state for a period of one (1) year when such applicant shows that he is licensed in another state and that his license has never been suspended or revoked. Provided, the state from which the applicant comes 'shall have standards regulating his profession at least equal to those maintained in Nebraska; that he took a written ex - amination and received grades when his license was issued: that he has been active in his profession since the issuance of his license: and. that he is of good moral character. It is our further opinion that section 71-503 of our statute, which has not been amended, is authority for the department to refuse to issue a license without examination to an applicant coming from another state, even though the applicant may have all the statutory qualifications, if the state issuing applicant's original license refuses to grant the same privileges to Nebraska licensees.

            <seg id="p241">OPINIONS , . ■ ■■ ■ ■ ■■■■. The statutes material for our consideration in determining the questions presented by you are as follows: Section 71-1G01. C. S. of Nebr. 1929. "For the purpose of this article the following classes of persons shall be dee"med to be en - gaged in the practice of optometry: 1. Persons who employ any means other than drugs for the measurement of the powers of vhion of the human eyes and adapt lenses for aiding the same. 2. Pereons who allow the public to use any mechanical device for such purposes. 3. Perroni who publicly profess to be optometrists and to assume the dutijs incident to said profession." Section 71-1602, C. S. Nebr. 1929. "This division shall not be con - strued to include the following classes: 1. Merchants or dealers who sell glasses ai merchandise in an established place of business and who do not profess to be optometrists or practice optometry as herein defined. 2. Licensed practitioners of medicine." Suction 71-1603. C. S. Of Nebr. 1929. "Every applicant for a license' to practice optometry shall: 1. Present satisfactory evidence of the completion of a four year course in an accredited high school or an equivalent thereto as the term equivalent has been here - tofore defined in this article. 2. Present proof that he is a graduate of an accredited school of optometry. Provided that this shall not apply to students who are now taking a course in optqmetry. 3. Pass an examination prescribed by the Board of Examiners in subjects of theoretic optometry, theoretic optics, practical optics, anatomy and physiology and opthalmology." Section 71-201, C. S. Supp. of Nebr. 1935. "No person shall engage in the practice of medicine and surgery, osteopathy, chiropractic, dentistry, pharmacy, chiropody, optometry, embalming or veter - inary medicine and surgery as denned in the following sections of this article unless he shall have obtained from the Department a license for that purpose." Section 71-905, C. S. of Nebr. 1929. "The opening of an office for the practice of any profession for which a license is required by this article, the announcing to the public in any way the intention to practice such profession, the use of any professional degree, or designation or any sign, car, circular, device or advertisement as a practitioner of any such profession or as a person skilled in the same, shall be prima facie evidence of engaging in such profession." By virtue of the provisions of our statute no person is now permitted to practice optometry unless he shall have completed and fulfilled certain educational requirements. He must successfully pass a state board ex- </seg>
            <seg id="p242">REPORT OF ATTORN KY GENERAL animation covering, various subjects in relation to the eye. The obvious purpose of these statutes is to protect the public from unscrupulousness. ignorance, unskillfulness, deception and fraud. The practice of optometry may be carried on only by those persons who have complied with the statutes and have met the required qualifications as to fitness. Therefore, the right to practice optometry is a personal one con - fined to real persons. A corporation is not a real person so as to meet the statutory requirements; it cannot complete an educational course; it cannot pass a state board examination. As stated by the court in Stern v. Flynn. 278 N. Y. S. 598. 154 Mis. (MM: "The relationship between an optometrist and his patient is of a personal and confidential nature, not unlike the relationship be - tween an attorney and client, or physician and patient. The ex - amination of an optometrist may not only indicate an eye condition, but may disclose other ailments and bodily afflictions of a more or less personal nature. Tvue, Ihu optometrist may no\ \awiu\\y treat his patient [or these ailments, but his patient is entitled to the assurance tYvat tY\e kv\ow\edRe obtained in such examination shall be held inviolate and not become it record in the files of a business corporation." In reaching a conclusion of the questions presented we have carefully studied the decisions of courts of last resort, a few of which are: State v. Kindy Optical Co., 216 La. 1157, 248 N.W. 332. State v. Goldman Jewelry Co.. (Kan.) 51 Pac. (2d) 995. Eisensmith v. Buhl Optical Co., (W. Va.) 178 S.E. 695. Rowe v. May Co.. (Ohio) N.E. Stern v. Flynn, 154 Misc. 609, 278 N. Y. S. 598. It is our opinion, that both questions presented by you, as set out in the first paragraph hereof, must be answered in the negative. PAUL P. CHANEY, Assistant Attorney Gene . .. July 9. 1936. Honorable C. Smrha, Director of Insurance, Building. We are advised that you have approved an insurance contract described by the company issuing the same as "Surgeons Compensation Contract" </seg>
            <seg id="p243">OPINIONS which contract is issued upon the payment of an $8.00 per annum premium rnadi* by applicants approved by the company. This policy provides in part as follows: "SURGICAL BENEFITS" "Section 1. If the insured shall require any one of the following operations and for which a Surgeon's fee is payable under the terms of this policy, the Company will pay the Surgeon's fee, direct to said Surgeon, provided the insured places himself or herself under the care of one of the company's reHularly appointed Surgeons." In so far as the came is applicable hereto, Section 71-201, C. S. Supp. of Nebraska, 15)35, provides as follows: "No person shall engage in the practice of medicine and surgery, ■ ' unless he shall have obtained from the Department a license for that purpose." By virtue of the provisions of our statute, no person is now permitted to practice medicine and surgery unless and until he has fully completed the educational and other requirements of our statute. The purpose of the statute is por/ectly obvious, so it will not be further discussed by us. We believe further it is perfectly obvious that a corporation is not a real person so as to meet the statutory requirements of education and qualifications as to fitness. Therefore, the right to practice medicine and surgery is a personal one confined to real persons. The question presented is whether an insurance corporation is practicing medicine and surgery when they offer for sale and do sell a contract con - taining the provision as set out herein. The laws relative to the licensing of any of the other professions, such as law, dentistry, or optometry, are similar to the Jaws relative to the licensing of medicine and surgery. Our courts have almost unanimously held that a corporation is guilty of practicing law if it employs a lawyer who acts for others and turns the fees received by him into the corporation. One of the numerous court decisions so holding is In re Otterness, 181 Minn. 254. 232 N. W. 318, 73 A.L.R. 1319, wherein that court said: "Corporations cannot practice law by hiring attorney to conduct general law practice for others for pay under agreement whereby fees received become income of corporation." The majority of our courts have held that a corporation which hires a registered optometrist to conduct an optometry department for them, is practicing optometry. One of the more recent decisions on this question is Stern v. Flynn. 278 N.Y.S. 598, 154 Misc. 609. </seg>
            <seg id="p244">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL In an action presenting a question almost identical to the one under consideration herein, the Supreme Court of California handed down ;i decision on December 12, 1935, in the case of Pacific Employers Insurance Co. v. Carpenter, 52 P. (2d) 992. The contract of insurance under discussion in that cause was in substance and effect the same as the provision lirst referred to herein. The California court said: "Proposed 'medical service policy" providing that insurer would furnish, in consideration of premiums paid by insured, services of doctors and dentists who were to be appointed or employed by insurer for purposes of furnishing such services, held, invalid, since issuance of such policies would result in insurer engaging in unlaw - ful practice of medicine and dentistry." In view of the decisions of our courts as we have found them to be, it is our opinion that an insurance company or corporation issuing a policy agreeing to delegate a surgeon to perform a needed surgical operation on their insured, the company to pay the surgeon's fee, is guilty of practicing medicine and surgery contrary to law. We suggest that you notify all companies licensed in this state, whose policies are as set out herein, of this opinion and further notify them thai the approval heretofore given their said policy is now withdrawn. PAUL P. CHANEY. Assislan 1 Attorney Genera! UNAUTHORIZED PRACTICE OF LAW BY INSURANCE ADJUSTERS October 2. 1930. Mr. Luther C. Martin. Attorney at Law. Brandeis Theatre Building. Omaha. Nebraska. We thank you for your letter of September 22d relative to certain un - authorized legal practices by laymen, and particularly by laymen who en - gage in the adjustment of property damage and public liability claims for insurance companies. We agree with you that where the adjustment business involves the practice of law, no layman can lawfully engage therein and no lawyer en - gaged therein can solicit or advertise for such business. We can see where a layman or lawyer might undertake merely to in - vestigate the facts of an accident and report the facts, as found by him, to a client without in any manner engaging in the practice of law, but we know that as you suggest such is not the common practice'Tif the laymen and </seg>
            <seg id="p245">OPINIONS lawyers now engaged in the* adjustment business. We know that they solicit this business from insurance carriers; that ordinarily they contact both pa: Has to an acidont, take statements from them and from witnesses who may not be parties thereto, and then attempt to advise the insurance carrier with refeience to the legal rights or liabilities of the parties involved. Acting upon this advice, the client authorizes an adjustment to be made, receipts and releases to be drawn and caused to be executed, the parties to be advi •.■«! us to their rights and liabilities; and these acts, in our opinion, constitute the practice of law. Any layman who engaged in business as above described is subject to criminal prosecution and to contempt proceedings. Any lawyer engaged in the adjustment business who solicits or advertises for such business is subject to discipline by the Supreme Court. Another common practice of adjusters which has come to our attention is the securing of the services of lawyers by laymen adjusters for the in - surance carriers, and the acting as go-between for said lawyers and said carriers. This also constitutes the unlawful practice of law, carrying the kamc liabilities. MILTON C. MURPHY. Assistant Attorney General. PRACTICE OF LAW WITHOUT A LICENSE March 16, 1936. Guaranty Trust Company. Kearney, Nebraska. The first question in your letter of March 11 is as follows: "Will you please advise me if it is permissible and legal for a man to draw his own will?" Our answer is yes. Your second question is as follows: "Would you also advise me if it is legal and permissible for another party to draw a will for a party providing that party tells him what he wishes to put in the will and requests him to draw the will for him?" ■ I Our answer is no, unless the person drawing the will is an attorney at law duly admitted to practice under the provisions of Chapter 7 C. S. Neb. 1929. </seg>
            <seg id="p246">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Section 7-101 provides: "No person shall be admitted to practice as an attorney or counsel - lor at law, or commence, conduct, or defend any action or proceed - ing to which he is not a party, either by using or subscribing his own name, or the name of any other person, or by drawing plead - ings, or other papers to be signed and filed by a party, in any court of record of this state, unless he has been previously admitted to the bar by order of the supreme court of this slate. And no such paper shall be received or filed in any action or proceeding unless the same bears the endorsement of some admitted attorney, or is drawn, signed, and presented by a party to the action or proceeding. It is hereby made the duty of the judges of such courts to enforce this prohibition. Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this section shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof, shall be fined in any sum not exceeding one hundred dollars, or imprisoned in the county jail not exceeding thirty days; but this section shall not apply to persons admitted to the bar under preexisting laws." It is our opinion that the drawing of a will constitutes practice as an attorney or counsellor at law, within the meaning of the above section. It is further our opinion that drawing a will is the drawing of n paper to be signed and filed by a party in a court of record of this state, which is also prohibited by the above section, unless the will is drawn by the parly executing it, or unless the draftsman has been admitted to practice as an attorney or couscllor at law. Furthermore, the Supreme Court and other courts of record of this state have the inherent power to define the practice of law, and are not limited in their definitions by any statute, and we are of the opinion that our courts would hold that the drafting of a will for another person constitutes the practice of law and would hold in contempt anyone not a duly licensed and practicing attorney who attempted to draw and prepare a will for another person.

We are advised that it has become a common practice for certain cor - porations, trust companies, banks and their officers and agents, as well as certain laymen engaged in real estate, insurance and other business, to draw and prepare wills and other legal documents for other persons, although they are not licensed to practice law in this state. In Rhode Island Bar Assn. et al v. Automobile Service Assn. et al, Atl the Rhode Island court recently defined the practice of law. A part of the opinion is as follows: "Admission to the Bar meant admission to practice law, and ad - mission to practice law comprehended all the activities of a lawyer in advising and assisting others in all matters of law both in and out of court. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has recently — (1935), Opinion of the Justices to the Senate, Mass. 343, at page 349 — expressed itself most fully on this point as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p248">248 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ■ :.■ ■ ■•■! ■ '.'••: "Practice of law under modern conditions consists in no small part of work performed outside of any court and having no immediate relation to proceedings in court. It embraces conveyancing, the - giving of legal advice on a large variety of subjects, and the pre - paration and execution of legal instruments covering an extensive field of business and trust relations and other affairs. Although these transactions may have no direct connection with couit pro - ceedings, they are always subject to become involved in litigation, They require in many aspects a high degree of legal skill, a wide - experience with men and complex situations. These "customary functions of an attorney or counsellor at law" — bear an intimate relation to the administration of justice by the courts. No valid distinction so far as concerns the questions set forth in the order, can be drawn between that part of the work of the lawyer which involves appearance in court and that part which involves advice and drafting of instruments in his office. The work of the office lawyer is the groundwork for future possible contests in courts. It has profound effect on the whole scheme of the administration of justice. It is performed with the possibility in mind, and other - wise would hardly be needed. It is of importance to the welfare of the public that these manifold customary functions be performed by persons possessed of adequate learning and skill, of sound moral character, and acting at all times under the heavy trust obligation to clients which rests upon all attorneys. The under - lying reasons which prevent corporations, associations and in - dividuals other than members of the Bar from appearing before the courts apply with equal force to ! the performance of these custom - ary functions of attorneys and counsellors at law outside of courts. Decisions of the courts, some of which deal with statutes, are unanimous on these points, so far as we are aware.' "We see no reason to limit or narrow the scope of this language in applying it to the question of what constitutes the practice of the law in Rhode Island. This broad view of what is practice of the law is held by the United States Supreme Court and generally by the State courts. In re Duncan, 83 S.C. on page 189, 65 S. E. 211. the court says: 'It is too obvious for discussion that the practice of law is not limited to the conduct of cases in courts. According to the generally understood definition of the practice of law in this country, it embraces the preparation of pleadings and other papers incident to actions and special proceedings and the management of such actions and proceedings on behalf of clients before judges and courts, and in addition conveyancing, the preparation of legal instruments of all kinds, and in general all advice to clients and all action taken for them in matters connected with the law. An </seg>
            <seg id="p249">OPINIONS . . attorney at law is one who engages in any of these branches of the practice of law. The following is the concise definition given by the Supreme Court of the United States: "Persons acting professionally in legal formalities, negotiations or proceedings fey the warrant or authority of their clients may be regarded as attorneys at law within the meaning of that designation as employed in this country."' And so in Fitchette v. Taylor, supra, also it was said: "The conduct of litigation is by no means all of legal practice. A lawsuit is but one process of settling an issue of legal right and wrong. Many are disposed of without suit. But the disposition of such issues for others, by advice and negotiation, for hire, is as much the practice of law as though process and pleadings, with or without trial, were necessary. Counsel as to legal status and rights, and conduct in respect thereto, are as much a special function of the English solicitor and the American lawyer as diagnosis, prognosis, and prescription are in the field of medicine.' " It is the duty of this Department to investigate such unlawful practice ;md to institute proper proceedings in the proper courts for the punishment of such unlawful acts, and to prevent their continuance; and we would greatly appreciate any information which we may receive which would furnish evidence of such violations of the law. MILTON C. MURPHY. Assistant Attorney General. DRAFTING OF LEGAL INSTRUMENTS BY REAL ESTATE BROKERS May 18, 1936. Mr. L. B. Maupin. Assistant Real Estate Commissioner. Department of State, Building. ■ ■ ■ . In your letter of May 5 you say in part: "The question uppermost in the minds of the Real Estate men is whether or not they are to be deprived of the right to draw their own leases and earnest money contracts. For example, several real estate brokers are agents for Omaha office buildings and they wish to know when leasing office space or rooms, if it is necessary to employ an attorney to draw the short form leases, which they use in such cases." It is somewhat difficult to draw a line along the border of what con - stitutes the practice of law by real estate brokers and what does not. The example given in your letter probably does not constitute the unlawful practice of law. </seg>
            <seg id="p250">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL The following is a copy of the opinion of the committee on unauthorized practice of law of the American Bar Association, rendered on February 1 1936, after a conference with a representative of the National Association of Real Estate Boards: "It is the opinion of the Committee on Unauthorized Practice of the Law of the American Bar Association that it is not against public interest or contrary to public welfare for one not licensed to prac - tice law, to appropriately fill in the blanks of a legal instrument which, within a reasonable time of its use, has been selected, or prepared, specifically for that particular use by one licensed to practice law who has. also instructed such a user of the instrument fully regarding the essential details requisite to execution and creation of a valid, legally operative, instrument and regarding any further act of filing, recordation, or similar step, prerequisite to protection of the parties and their rights. "Except as above stated, it is. in the Committees opinion, not in the public interest for one not licensed to practice law to select, to adopt, adapt, draft, shape or otherwise prepare or shape, a legal instrument for use for a particular purpose, or under particular circumstances or conditions, or in a transaction or dealing, or as appropriate to the accomplishment of specific objectives. "This is equally true whether the occasion for giving the advice, or rendering the service, or preparing the instrument may seem to concern something simple, or that it seems to be done without compensation, or that it seems to be incidental or ancillary to the actor's business, trade or profession. "Particularly, does the Committee consider it contrary to public - welfare and substantially to the public injury for one not licensed to practice law, and who has an interest adverse to. or in con - flict with, that of the parties to a transaction, or either of them, and to the instrument evidencing it (or an interest which may be or become so), to select, adopt, adapt draft, shape or otherwise prepare such an instrument. "These principles, in the Committee's judgment, apply to a real estate dealer, real estate agent, real estate broker, or similar representative and intermediary, who, when his compensation de - pends upon the successful closing and conclusion of the transaction gives legal advice, renders legal services, or selects, adopts, adapts' drafts, shapes or prepares, the legal instrument used to consum - mate and evidence the deal.

Cochran, Governor of the State of Nebraska, Building. You inquire whether a member of the legislature who has accepted a position with the WPA or the HOLC is eligible to continue in the state office. We do not believe so. Sec. 9. Art. Ill of the Constitution provides that, "No person holding office under the authority of the United States '* * J shall be eligible to, or have a seat in the legislature." In case any member of the legislature occupies such a position, his legislative office is vacant - and steps should be taken to fill it. Section 32-1701, C.

In order to fill the vacancy, section 32-1705, C.

The only law. applicable to the call of a special session oi the legislature is section 8, Art.

Assistant Attorney General. January lo. lS):ili. Mr. John J. McMahon. 4515 Florence Blvd.. Omaha. Nebraska. This will acknowledge our receipt of your letter of recent date, wherein you inquire if Section 16 of Article III of the Constitution of Nebraska disqualifies you from holding the office of Director of the Employment Bureau at Omaha, as provided by Chapter 107. Laws of Nebraska. 1935. by reason of the fact that you are now a meriiber of the Nebraska Legislature. At the outset it may be well to observe the constitutional and statutory provisions upon which the answer to your question turns. By Section 1G of Article III. supra, it is in pertinent part provided as follows: "No person elected or appointed to the Legislature shall receive any civil appointment to a state office during the term for which he has been elected or appointed, and all such appointments shall be void; 8 * ° " Chapter 107. supra, was enacted by the Legislature at its 50th Session to enable this state to accept the provisions of the Act of Congress approved June 6, 1933, and which now appears as 29 U.S.C.A. Sections 49 to 49 1 in - clusive. By this Act of Congress provision is made for the establishment and maintenance of a national system of public employment offices. By Section 49c of the Act it is provided that a state must, in order to obtain the benefits of appropriations apportioned under Section 49d of the Act, through its legislature, accept the provisions of the Act, and designate or authorize the creation of a state agency vested with the powers essential to cooperation with the United States Employment Service (29 U.S.C.A. </seg>
            <seg id="p253">OPINIONS Sections 49 to 49 1, inclusive). Section 49d of the Act speaks of the con - templated state plan as: I" A State-controlled system of public employment offices; By its title, Chapter 107, supra, purports to accept the provisions of this Act of Congress; to create an agency to be known as the Nebraska State Employment Service; to provide for the establishment of free employment bureaus: to designate said service; • as the agency of the State of Nebraska : * *," and to appropriate a certain sum of money for the use of this agency. A review of Chapter 107, itself, discloses that Section 1 thereof author - izes the Commissioner of Labor to organize and establish free employment bureaus in this state, such bureaus to be included in a division to be known as the Nebraska State Employment Service, and which division shall be under the supervision of the Commissioner of Labor. Section 2 provides for the appointment by the Commissioner of Labor of the Director of the Service and other officers of the Service. Section 3 recites in part that: "The Nebraska State Employment Service is hereby designated and constituted the agency of the State of Nebraska * * *." Section 4 authorizes the Commissioner of Labor to set up and maintain public employment offices in such parts of the State as he may deem necessary. Section 5 provides that the State Treasurer shall be the custodian of the funds allotted to this State from the appropriation made by the Act of Congress. Section 6 appropriates a sum of money to be used for the purpose of maintaining the public employment offices in the State. And finally. Section 7 amends Section 26-108, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska. 1929, to provide that it shall be the duty of the county boards to provide suitable rooms in the county court houses for the accommodation of the Commissioner of Labor in conducting and operating the State Free Employment Service. We have been at some length to review the foregoing provisions in order that the approach to our answer might be better understood. Now, to refer again to Section 16 of Article HI, supra, one observes that members of the Legislature are barred from holding another state office </seg>
            <seg id="p254">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GKNERAL by appointment during the term for which they have been elected or ap - pointed. It is very clear, therefore, from a consideration cf this provision, that only one question presents itself, viz.: Is the office of Director of the Employment Bureau at Omaha a state office within the meaning of Section 16 of Article III. supra? •i In 22 R.C.L., at page 386, it is said: "In a popular sense, a state officer is one whose juiiidiction b coextensive with the state. In a : more enlarged legal sense, a state - officer is one who receives his authority under the laws of the state, and performs some of the governmental functions of the state. For example, the office of levee commissioner ha; been adjudged to be a civil office under the state, within the meaning of a constitutional limitation that no senator or representative shall be appointed to any civil office or profit under the state." and at page 387: "The established rule is that officers, when their powers and duties are defined by acts of the legislature, are none the less civil officers* under the state because their functions are confined to the ad - ministration of city affairs. Accordingly, it has been held that an election commissioner is an officer who exercises an important function of the state government, affecting not alone the city in which his duties are performed, but the whole state, and therefore for certain purposes he is to be considered as an officer of the state, and not of the county in which he performs his duties." Likewise, the same general rule is expressed in 59 C.J. at page 104. where it is said: :: state officers, strictly speaking, are officers whose duties concern the state at large, even though their powers are to be exercised within defined limits." In the case of Murtha v. Lindsay, 153 N.W. (Mich.) 245, it was held that the office of judge of the recorders court of Detroit was a state office, and that a member of the legislature was not eligible to be appointed to it under a constitutional provision similar to the one which is under consideration here.

Curley. 5 Colo. 419. 1 Dillon Municipal Corp., (4th Ed.) Section 58. It is true that no exact precedent can be found to govern the answer to the instant query, yet it may be studied in the light of the deductions which may be drawn from the foregoing authorities, and which are as follows: - 1. A state officer is one who exercises a part of the delegated sovereignty of the state; 2. Irrespective of whether or not his duties are to be exercised within certain defined limits; ■ ■ . ■■ I ■.•■-,: .-V 3. And whose duties concern the state at large. Let us examine the instant office in the light of these criteria. First one observes that Congress sought to provide for a federal em - ployment service to work in conjunction with a: ".* * * State-controlled system' of public employment offices; * ? * " (29 U.S.C.A., Section 49d) The Nebraska Legislature, in accordance with the mandate of Congress, provided for the establishment of the Nebraska State Employment Service and designated it an agency of the State of Nebraska; it provided that employment bureaus should be set up and maintained in such parts of the state as the Commissioner of Labor deemed necessary; it appropriated certain funds to provide for the maintenance of these bureaus; and it authorized the Commissioner of Labor to appoint a Director and other officers to carry out the purposes of the legislation. Now, the Director of the Employment Bureau at Omaha will enjoy the powers which he will exercise by reason of the delegation of sovereignty effected by the enactment of Chapter 107, supra. He will owe his appoint - ment to the Commissioner of Labor whose power to appoint was effected by Chapter 107, supra. He will be paid from an appropriation of state funds coupled with an allotment of federal funds in accordance with the Act of Congress. The office which he will fill may be abolished if the Commissioner of Labor should deem it unnecessary that it be further maintained. In short he will be but an arm of an: </seg>
            <seg id="p256">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "* * * agency of the State of Nebraska ° ." (Sec. 3 of Chapter 107) And the duties which he will perform will concern the state as a whole, even though they will be exercised within certain defined limits. They will concern the public welfare of the state generally, and will, in no sense, be of a purely local nature. One observes, therefore, that the Director will be almost wholly divorced from the governing powers of the City of Omaha and the County of Douglas. He will exercise no powers conferred by them. He will not be elected by their people or appointed by their officers. He will receive no salary from either of them. And he will in no way rely upon their pleasure for his continuance in office. In short, he will be an officer of the state exercising his duties within their limits. We have had no intention, by what we have said, to dispute the well - accepted fact that many public offices are of a purely local nature, and arc - not state offices. In the instance, however, we are inclined to the opinion that the office of Director of the Employment Bureau at Omaha is a state office, and that your election to th&gt;.' Nebraska Legislature bars you from holding this office. WM. H. WRIGHT. Attorney General ;;_:. . . . ±___ ' . ■ UNICAMERAL LEGISLATURE SENATE FILES NO. :i(&gt;4 &amp; 385 February 1. l'JSG. Honorable Geo. H. Meiten. 303 Patterson) Bld.U.. Omaha. Nebraska. Pursuant to your letter of January 24th. we have carefully examined S. Fs. No. 364 and 363, and particularly S. F. 3G5. in an effort to ascertain whether such acts are valid and constitutional. Study of S. F. 365 discloses a number of mistakes and ambiguities and apparent omissions of territory in the sections of the act which purport to divide Douglas County and the city of Omaha into legislative districts. These errors, discrepancies and ambiguities appear prominently when the words of the act are compared with 1 a map of the territory in question. The defects in the districting of the city of Omaha and county of Douglas, which have been called to our attention are as follows: 1. District No. 4 under the act includes all territory in the city of Omaha North of Ames Avenue between Florence Boulevard and the eastern corporate limits: while district No. 5 includes the territory north of Charles </seg>
            <seg id="p257">OPINIONS Street to Ames Street between 16th Street and the eastern corporate limits; and East Omaha. We understand that some officers and some private individuals contend that East Omaha, which is a rural precinct is not contiguous to District No. 5 and is contiguous to District No. 4 and should therefore, despite the express words of the statute, be attached to and included in District No. 4. 2. The act described District No. 6 as including a strip of territory north from Farnam Street to Indiana Street between 24th Street and 40th Street. As a matter of fact, Indiana Street terminates at its intersection with 30th Street. The western boundary of District No. 6 between Farnam and an imaginary extension of Indiana is thus given as 40th Street, while the eastern boundary of District No. 9 as described by the act between Farnam and Cuming street is 30th street, and a part of the eastern boundary of District No. 5, as given by the act, is 30th Street between Cuming Street and Indiana. When visualized on a map, these conflicting descriptions show that District No. G overlaps Districts 5 and 9, so that two parcels of territory are by this error included in two districts. 3. The act describes District No. 7 as including as a part of its territory, that lying north from G to Center Street between the Burlington railroad east to the corporate limits and north from H to G Street between the Burlington railroad and 27th Street, and all South of G Street to the corpor - ate limits between 24th street and its extension to the Burlington on U Street east to the corporate limits. Reference to a map discloses that the Union Pacific and Burlington rail - roads parallel one another for some distance through the city of Omaha, but diverge at a point about where B Street would intersect with the rail - roads, and the Burlington railroad angles off to the southwest leaving the corporate limits at a point near 42 and Q Street; whereas the Union Pacific angler, to the south-east from the said point of divergence and leaves the corporate limits on the south near 15th and Harrison Streets. Twenty-fourth Street runs north and south, east of the Union Pacific railroad tracks and intersects said railroad tracks at a point between U and W streets which is the termination of said 24th Street. It is impossible to extend 24th Street to the Burlington railroad on U Street; while the extension in fact occurs on the Union Pacific railroad at said point. In the statute, district No. 8 includes the following territory, among other territory; North from F to Center between 42nd Street and the Burlington railroad; and that north from H to F, between -12nd Street and the Burlington railroad; and that North from H to G between 24th and 27th Street, which streets, by the way, are several blocks to the east of the Union Pacific rail - road which, in turn, is many blocks east of the Burlington railroad at the point in question. District No. 8 also includes the territory north from </seg>
            <seg id="p258">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Madison to H Street between 42nd and 24th, and its extension to the rail - road. The only railroad to which 24th Street extends, as above stated, is the Union Pacific railroad. District No. 8, under the statute, also includes the territory north from Harrison to Madison Street between 45th Street and the Burlington railroad. The Burlington railroad runs to the west of 45th Street some distance, and 45th Street constitutes the western boundary of the city; so that a literal reading of the statute as to this last call would extend District No. 8 into rural territory and would leave the territory between 45th Street and the Union Pacific railroad and between Harrison and Madison Streets unincluded in any district, unless under the misdescription referred to for District No. 7 it could be said to be in District No. 7. Furthermore, the territory between Madison and U Streets between 42nd Street and the Union Pacific railroad would, under the above calls, be included in both Districts 7 and 8. as would also a triangular strip between the Union Pacific and Burlington railroads bounded on the south by H Street. 4., District No. 10, according to the statute, includes all of the rural precincts of Douglas County, in addition to a properly described part of the corporate area of Omaha. It has been contended that the language "all of the rural precincts" would include East Omaha and that there would, there - fore, be a conflict between the description of Districts 10 and 4 and 5. The inclusion of all of the rural precincts in District 10 creates an apparent con - flict between some of the descriptions of Districts 7 and 8. 5. | The act describes District No. 9 as including, among other territory. the territory between the western corporate limits and 56th Avenue, between Pacific and Charles Streets. There is no 56th Avenue on the map of Omaha, although there is a 56th Street, which runs very near to a part of the western corporate limits and which, in part, is a circular street. There is, however, a 46th Avenue and the next call in the statute, after the one last mentioned. refers; to the territory between 46th Avenue and 42nd Street between Leavenworth and Charles Streets. As the act makes no reference to the territory between 56th Street and 46th Avenue between Pacific and Charles Streets, a literal reading of the act excludes said territory from any district. 6.! The language of the act fails to include in any district that territory in the city of Omaha which lies between 46th Avenue and 42nd Street and Pacific and Leavenworth Streets. This territory is contiguous to both District No. 9 and District No. 8 as defined by the act. It! will be noted that the calls given by the act are not by metes and bounds, but by strips. Such a crude and primitive method of description </seg>
            <seg id="p259">OPINIONS cannot be commended as a method of legislative drafting, except perhaps for its originality and alleged expediency. In this act it has no doubt contributed greatly to the many and manifest errors and discrepancies above pointed out. It would have been almost impossible for the Legislature and the draftsmen who prepared this bill and adopted the same to have made it more erroneous and confusing, in the description given of the various districts. However, it is our opinion that none of these errors are of so serious a character as to render the act or any part thereof unconstitutional and void. We believe that to read the act as a whole and compare it with a map is to demonstrate the true intention of the Legislature and the true bounda - ries of the various districts; and if this is possible, we believe that no court will hold the act invalid and refuse to give effect to the clear legislative intent. Section 2 of Article 3 of the Nebraska Constitution provides that at the regular session of the Legislature of 1935 it shall by law determine the number of members to be elected and divide the state in legislative districts. Any county that contains population sufficient to entitle it to two or more members shall be divided into separate and distinct legislative districts, as nearly equal in population as may be composed of contiguous and com - pact territory. The basis of apportionment shall be the population, exclud - ing aliens, as shown by next preceding Federal census. When necessary to ;&gt; correction of inequalities in the population of such districts, the state may be redistricted from time to time, but no oftener than once in ten years. Section 6 of said Article provides that the legislature shall consist of no more than 50 and not less than 30 members. The one chamber legislature is by section 1 to commence with the 1937 regular session. Pursuant to these provisions of the Constitution, the regular 1935 session of the Nebraska legislature enacted S. Fs. 364 and 365, and by the former provided that the Legislature shall consist of 43 members, and by the latter provided for the division of the state into 43 legislative districts, each to have one member. No fact has been called to our attention which would indicate any gerrymandering of the districts. They appear to be as nearly equal in population as may be composed of contiguous and compact territory. For the present, we are concerned, therefore, solely with the formal aspects of the apportionment. In the case of State ex rel Harte v. Morehead, 99 Neb. 527, the court said: "The court will not inquire into nor consider the motive that may .have actuated the legislature, except as those motives appear in their public acts or journals. The validity of an act does not depend upon the motive for its passage. * * * There is no doubt </seg>
            <seg id="p260">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL that the legislature may exercise a reasonable discretion in selecting the method of securing practical equality." In the case of State ex rel Norton v. Van Camp, 36 Neb. 91, the court held: "It is contemplated by our constitution and the election laws enacted in pursuance thereof that every qualified elector of the state shall be entitled to vote at some precinct or voting place for the respective state and county officers at each election. Hence, a construction will not be adopted which would have the effect to disfranchise a considerable number of voters or to deprive a county of representation in the legislature unless such construction is rendered necessary by express and unequivocal language of the statute or constitution." And on page 99, the court said: I "It is a rule of construction, universally recognized, that acts which confer or extend the elective franchise should be liberally con - strued. * • * In Sutherland, Stat. Con., sec. 323, it is said: 'But : an interpretation of a statute which must lead to consequences which are mischievous and absurd is inadmissible, if it is suscep - tible of an interpretation by which such consequences may be avoided.' " And in the case of State v. Schnitger, 95 Pac. 698, the Supreme Court of Wyoming in the 14th point of the syllabus held as follows: "The court will not declare a legislative apportionment act un - constitutional when there is no prior valid apportionment act to fall back on." We refer to this case by reason of the fact that the 1934 constitutional amendment above referred to abolishes, as of January 1, 1937, the existing apportionment laws; and if the court should declare the new act invalid, there would be no apportionment law to fall back on. As sustaining the above rules see the annotations in 2 A.L.R. 1337. No. li As to East Omaha, which is a rural precinct, the act fails to include it in district No. 4; but expressly includes it in District No. 5. It is contiguous to both District 4 and District 5. The description of District 5 includes the municipal aviation field, which is to the East of Carter Lake. A strip of territory belonging to the state of Iowa intervenes between the main body of District 5 and the municipal aviation field, and a strip of land to the south thereof within the corporate limits, to all of which East Omaha is contiguous, </seg>
            <seg id="p261">OPINIONS and as a matter of fact, a greater portion of East Omaha is contiguous to the part of District 5 mentioned and the strip of Iowa than is contiguous to Dis - trict 4. The fact that the strip of Iowa separates parts of District 5 does not prevent those parts from being contiguous under the law. In the case of Houghton County v. Blacker, (Mich) 52 N.W. 951, 16 L.R.A. 432, it was held that convenient and contiguous territory does not mean con - tiguous, in contact by land,' when applied to counties which are insular or peninsular in character, and that certain counties separated by the lake might be declared to be contiguous, although another county was more nearly proximate. The New York court has made similar decisions. In view of the clear and unambiguous language of S. F. 365, which places East Omaha in District 5, no room is left for any officer or court to say either that East Omaha is or should be a part of District 4 or of any other district than District No. 5. The fact that District No. 10 includes "all of the rural precincts", in those words, when read together with the description of Dis - trict No. 5 in which East Omaha is expressly included, can be construed to mean only that all of the rural precincts except East Omaha are included in District No. 10. We believe that no other construction is possible, especially in view of the rule that a specific description controls over a general one. No. 2. As to tlie overlapping of Districts 6 and 5 and Districts 6 and 9, it will be observed that the act first describes District 5 and fixes a part of its southern boundary as Cuming street between 36th Street and 30th Street, and a part of the boundary of said District 5 runs along 30th Street between Cuming and Indiana streets. Passing on to the description of No. 9, we find that a part of the northern boundary of said district is Cuming Street be - tween 36th and 30th streets, ' identical with the part of the southern boundary of District No. 5 above mentioned, and a part of the eastern boundary of District No. 9 is given as 30th Street from Cuming Street south to Farnam Street, thereby connecting directly with that part of the boundary of 5 which lies on 30th Street and connecting at Farnam Street with a boundary of District 6 set forth in the act and clearly defined. That part of the boundary of District 6 which is clearly in error and which reads "north from Farnam to Indiana between 24th and 40th streets" is clearly shown, by the above fact, to be a patent error of description, 40th street being used where 30th Street was intended to be used. This is further shown by the fact that the said Indiana Street terminates at 30th Street and does not run through to 40th Street, and in fact there is no street on the extension of Indiana Street between 30th and 40th streets. Indiana Street runs between 24th and 30th streets only. No other district has 40th street for a boundary. Such an obvious error on the face of the statute itself yields in favor of the true intent of the legislature as ascertained from the face of the act itself. </seg>
            <seg id="p262">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL No. 3. With reference to the boundaries and territories of Districts 7 and 8, further obvious and patent mistakes appear on the face of the act as above set forth. In the territory in question the map designates the Burlington railroad as the C B &amp; Q R R, while the Union Pacific is given the name Union Pacific. However, at the point on the map where that name appears and immediately to the right of it appears the word Buckingham, meaning Buckingham Avenue, which was evidently carelessly misread by the drafts - man as Burlington. Higher upon the map where the Burlington and Union Pacific railroads run parallel to each other, the word Burlington is used. Throughout the description of districts 7 and 8, the word Burlington is used where the railroad in fact referred to was the Union Pacific. Any other interpretation of the act would show the most ludicrous outline of these districts, with part of them overlapping and part of District 8 being entirely omitted unless covered by 7; and part of 7 omitted, unless covered by 8; and part of both 7 and 8 extending into rural territory which is expressly covered and included in District No. 10. When the Union Pacific railroad line is followed in place of the C B &amp; Q R R line, every discrepancy and ambiguity falls away and the map is left with a clearly defined boundary between 7th and 8th, with no over - lapping territory and with no territory in any rural precinct and with no territory unincluded in any district. A -more compact and contiguous and more evenly populated districting is bound to exist when this interpretation of the intention of the Legislature is applied. Reading the act as a whole would impress any reasonable mind with these patent errors and with the actual and real intent of the legislature, when the same is visualized on a map. No. 4. As to the area in District No. 9 between 56th street and 46th Avenue, between Pacific an9 Charles streets, it seems to us that there is again but one answer, and that is that this area is in law and in fact included in district 9 by the terms of the act, and the obvious intention of the Legislature. There being no 56th Avenue 56th Street lying where it does, it seems clear that the Legislature meant 46th Avenue when it said 56th Avenue. We think this is shown by the fact that the next description following the er - roneous one mentioned commences with 46th Avenue and proceeds on to the east. The southern boundary of the area in question is absolutely and clearly defined by the northern boundary of District No. 8. The northern boundary of said area is clearly and distinctly denned by a part of the southern boundary of districts 5 and 10. There is no other district in which the area in question could be included, under the language of the act, and we believe that a court would hold the area to be included, even though the call which attempted to define that area had been entirely </seg>
            <seg id="p263">OPINIONS omitted from the act. When our construction is given to the act, complete contiguity and compactness in District No. 9 result. Without it, they fail. We think that this error can afford no basis to declare the act or any part thereof unconstitutional. No. 5. What we have said above we believe covers any question as to the rural precincts included in District No. 10, and excludes East Omaha and any rural territory which might be thought from a casual reading of the statute to belong to District 7 or District 8. No. 6. A more serious and doubtful question arises with reference to the area between Pacific and Leavenworth streets, and between 46th Avenue and 42nd Street, which is not in any way referred to or covered by any of the provisions of this act. This is an area about 4 to 6 blocks in dimensions, with a population of approximately 1000. It is contiguous only to Districts 9 and 8 as described in the act. Under the terms of the act it is bounded on the north and west by District No. 9 and on the south and east by District No. 8. Its western boundary is about equidistant between the western boundary of No. 8 and the eastern boundary of No. 8. The same may be said of the area with respect to the eastern and western boundaries . of No. 9. The territory immediately adjacent to it on the west is in District No. 9 by the terms of the act, while the territory directly to the east of it is placed by the act in District No. 8. While we are aware of the rule that the court will not undertake to legislate where the legislature has failed to act, yet we think it would require no legislation to construe this act in accordance with the intention of the Legislature and with the provisions of the Constitution, that all of the territory of this state should be placed in some district, in order that no voter of this state should be disfranchised. This apportionment should not be permitted to fail because of the apparent omission of a territory inhabi - ted by approximately 1000 people in a state with a population of 1,377,963 people, if by any reasonable construction such area is in fact included in some district. Our court and other courts have gone to great length to prevent the failure of apportionment acts, as shown by the authorities above cited. In the case of State v. Van Duyne, 24 Neb. 586, the second paragraph of the syllabus is as follows: "The legislature eannot deprive the population of a county of representation in the legislature. Therefore, where in an apportion - ment act a county is omitted, it will retain its representation under the preceding act." </seg>
            <seg id="p264">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL In that case an apportionment act failed to include in any representative district the county of Sarpy. It was entirely omitted from the act. In the prior apportionment act Sarpy County had been Riven representation. The court held the new apportionment act invalid insofar as it omitted to include Sarpy County, but valid in all other respects; but that Sarpy County might justly claim representation under the preceding statute. The court held that there was no constitutional inhibition against so doing. The court could not have been engaged in legislation in the rendering of this decision. If so, it would have exceeded its power. In the instant case, the area in question cannot fall back on some previ - ous legislative apportionment because of the new constitutional provision above mentioned. But the Sarpy County case does show the interest which the court takes in cases of this kind in seeing that representation is given and that apportionment does not fail. ■'• '.-••■■■■ i In the case of Smith v, Patterson, (Texas) 242 S.W. 740, a county omitted in the redistricting of the state of Texas, was held a part of certain districts in view of the legislative intent which the court gathered from the act as a whole. In that case the county in question was contiguous to one county in one district and was contiguous to three counties in another district. The county was contiguous to only two districts. By adding the county to one district, which would be the more compact one with such county, such district would have a population nearer to the ratio of apportionment than would the other district have had if the county were added to such other district. Upon the three foregoing grounds the court held that the intention of the Legislature was to include the county in the district where it would be contiguous to three counties of such district rather than only one, and where its population added to the district would more nearly approach the ratio of apportionment than would the other district with such county added to it. Applying these principles of these cases to the area in question, we find that by placing this area in district No. 8, as we believe the Legislature fully intended, the strip of territory between Pacific and Leavenworth streets between 66th street and 30th Street is practically evenly divided in area and population, and compactness and contiguity results. Furthermore, by adding the population of approximately 1000 in the area in question to the population of the balance of District No. 8, the ratio of apportionment which is approximately 31,581, is more nearly approached than it would be if that population were added to the population of District No. 9, and, there - fore, under the Constitution and the terms of this act, the area in question is in District No. 8. </seg>
            <seg id="p265">OPINIONS We recognize the gravity of the questions involved in this matter, especially as to the last point above, but we believe that genuinely reason - able doubt exists as to the unconstitutionality of this act. ■ . We are advised that this particular S. F. 365, when reported, out of its last conference committee, which report is found in the journals of the Legislature in the same language which is used in the act. said report was accompanied by a map of the city of Omaha and surrounding territory with the district which we have discussed, drawn into that map in exactly the same detail which we have construed the act to include, with the possible exception of the assignment of East Omaha; that this map was signed by every member of the conference committee; that the said map so signed was in fact a part of the conference committee report and should have been included in the journals of the Legislature of such report, but that through some oversight, mistake or inadvertence, the officers charged with the recording and printing of said conference report omitted therefrom the map in question which, as aforesaid, was signed by the members of the committee. If this be true, it is our opinion that the map is and should be con - sidered as a part of the conference committee report and a part of the legislative journals and should and could, therefore, be considered in the construction and interpretation of the act itself, to show the true intent of the Legislature and to clear up the patent ambiguities appearing on the face of the act. As before stated, the map delineates the several districts in the manner which we have suggested shows the intent of the Legislature, and the area which was omitted is, as we are told, shown on that map to be included in District No. 8. With that map as evidence in such a condition, no one could question what the intention was. Some specious and frivolous contention has been advanced that the Legislature by these acts repealed itself and did away with the Legislature of 1935. Time and space will not permit further discussion of this point than to say that in our opinion it cannot be true under the Constitution. The apportionment of Lancaster County and the city of Lincoln has been called to our attention and the suggestion made that it violates the Constitution in that it has been gerrymandered and that it is not divided into compact contiguous territory with a population basis as nearly equal as possible, but we have examined the act and the map of the territory in question and can find no substantial grounds for these assertions, and believe that the act is invulnerable to any attack from that angle. In conclusion, it is our opinion that S.Fs. 364 and 365 are constitutional and valid and will be upheld if subjected to any attack in any court; that the proper officers should give it full force and effect, as above construed, </seg>
            <seg id="p266">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL and that it would be unnecessary to convene the Legislature in special session to correct their careless errors. MILTON C. MURPHY, Assistant Attorney General. AMENDMENT TO SEC. 1 ART. IV CONSTITUTION OF NEBRASKA December 3, 1936. Honorable R. L. Cochran, Governor of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska. At your request we have examined the amendment to Section 1 Article IV Constitution of Nebraska proposed by the Legislature of 1935 under H.R. No. 404 of that Legislature, in an effort to determine the following: 1. Whether the proceedings for the adoption of said amendment were conducted according to law. 2. Whether it is a canvass by the legislature or by the state canvassing board which ascertains the result of the vote upon the amendment. 3. When said amendment would become effective if lawfully adopted. 4. The operation and effect of the amendment. I. Section 1 of Article XVI of the Nebraska constitution provides that either branch of the legislature may propose amendments to the constitution and if the same be agreed to by three-fifths of the members elected to each house, such proposed amendment shall be entered on the journals with the yeas and nays, and published once each week for four weeks in at least one newspaper in each county where a newspaper is published, immediately preceding the next election of members of the legislature. At such election said amendments shall be submitted to the electors upon a separate ballot. If a majority of the electors voting on such amendment adopt the same, it shall become a part of the Constitution, provided the votes cast in favor thereof shall not be less than 35 per cent of the total votes cast at the election. Article 2 of Chapter 49 Comp. Stat. Neb. 1929 is devoted entirely to the subject of adoption of constitutional amendments and closely follows the above constitutional provisions, although it is somewhat more detailed. From a check of the House and Senate journals of 1935, it is our opinion that the amendment in question was proposed and agreed to and properly journalized in the legislature, in accordance with the Constitution and laws above mentioned.. </seg>
            <seg id="p267">OPINIONS Our attention has been called to the fact that the proposed amendment was not entered at large upon the journals of the legislature and that merely the name and title of House Roll No. 404, by which the proposed amend - ment was submitted in the legislature, appears in the journals. It is suggested that the provision of Section 1 of Article XVI which provides that the proposed amendment shall be entered on the journals is mandatory and means that the proposed amendment must be entered at large upon the journals. It is our opinion that this provision is mandatory and not merely directory, but that it does not require entry of the proposed amendment in full or at large in the journals of the legislature, but on the other hand, any entry in the journals which constitutes an identifying reference to the measure sufficiently complies with the constitution. The better practice would be to set forth the entire body of the proposed amendment in the journals of both houses, but it was not done in this case. An examination of the history of the submission of other constitutional amendments discloses that the same practice has been followed by the legislature as in this case; that is, the legislature conducts the proceedings for the proposal and agreement to submit a constitutional amendment to a vote of the people by introducing a bill therefor in one of the two houses in the same manner that ordinary legislative bills are introduced and they are considered and passed under the same rules as a regular bill for an act. Printed copies of the entire measure are before the members of the legis - lature at all times and when the engrossed bill is finally adopted, it is en - rolled, signed by the presiding officers, attested and presented to the Gov - ernor and filed in the permanent records of the Secretary of State. As a matter of law, such measures are not legislative bills. The legis - lature acts in a capacity analogous to that of a constitutional convention. Wcstmi v. Ryan, 70 Neb. 218. The rules of law applicable to title, to passage, to approval by the governor, and the like, have no application to proposals of constitutional amendments by the legislature. The provision of the Constitution requiring the proposed amendment to be entered on the journals is, of course, for the purpose of publicity and avoiding secrecy. This aim is satisfied when the procedure as followed in this case is had. Although there is some conflict in the authorities, the great majority of cases upon this subject hold that where the journals of the legislature contain an identifying reference to the amendment as a whole, it is unnecessary to set forth more therein, in order to satisfy the constitutional provision. 12 C.

            <seg id="p268">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL In the case of In re S. F. 31, 25 Neb. 864. it was contended that the clause in the Constitution requiring the proposed amendment to be entered on the journals of the legislature contemplates that the proposed amendment in the completed form shall be entered at large upon the journal of each house, but the court, relying upon and specifically approving the language in the leading case on this subject, towit, Constitutional Prohibitory Amend - ment, 24 Kans. 709, overruled this contention. The Kansas case approved by our court went so far as to hold that the constitutional provision in question was merely directory and not manda - tory. Our court has repeatedly heldl that a substantial compliance with constitutional provisions as to proposed amendments is sufficient, the theory being that the self-imposed limitations on the power of the people to amend the Constitution should not be so construed as to defeat the will of the people, if the requirements are substantially obsers'ed. State v. Winnett. 78 Neb. 379. In that case the proposed amendment was not entered at large upon the journals of the legislature. This point was apparently not raised in the case, the question in that case being the sufficiency ol the publication of the notice of the amendment. The same rule is recognized in Slate v. Cline, 118 Neb. 150. We are informed that due publication of the proposed amendment was made in each county of the state tor four weeks immediately preceding the November third election, but that pi oofs of such publications from fourteen counties have not been received and filed in the office of the secretary oi state. We are further informed that these proofs of publication will be forthcoming, and assuming that this be true, a proper and substantial com - pliance with the requirement of the Constitution as to publication will be 1 shown. We arc therefore of the opinion that although the legislature failed to enter the proposed amendment at large upon the journals of each house. there has been a substantial and sufficient compliance with the constitutional provision in regard to submitting th? proposition to the voters at the last election. 2 Owing to a conflict in the statutes, it is difficult to determine whether the result of the vote upon this amendment should be canvassed by the legislature upon its organization next month, or whether the canvass should be made by the state canvassing board on the third Monday after the election, or as soon thereafter as the returns from all counties are received by the secretary of state. </seg>
            <seg id="p269">OPINIONS As stated above, Article 2 of Chapter 49 is a complete act dealing specifically with the matter of adoption of constitutional amendments. Section 49-204 of this act provides, in part, as follows: : "The several county clerks in the different counties shall make return to the board of state canvassers provided for in Section 32-923 in the same manner and within the same time that they are required to make return of votes cast for officers mentioned in Section 32-924, and all such returns shall be directed to the Secretary of State and transmitted to him in a separate envelope from the one containing the abstract and return of votes cast for the officers named in said last named section." It is further provided by said section that the returns of the election shall be canvassed by the county canvassing board, who shall foot up the returns in such a manner as to show the number of electors voting, the number voting for the amendment and the number voting against the amendment, and enter their findings in the book of election returns, and from such findings make the returns to the state board of canvassers as above provided. t The history of this section of the statutes discloses that it was originally passed in 1877 and at that time provided that the returns should be canvassed by the same officers who canvassed the votes for executive state officers, to-wit: the legislators, because the Constitution then provided, as it now provides (Section 4 of Article IV), that the vote for executive state officers shall be canvassed in the legislature. The section was amended in 1895 and the provision last above quoted and referred to have been substantially the same as now since 1895, any changes which have been made being immaterial to the instant question. Prior to 1917 there was no other provision of statute relating to can - vassing of votes on constitutional amendments, and prior to such time the votes for some of the state officers were required to be canvassed by the state canvassing board, while the votes for the executive state officers mentioned in Section 1 of Article IV of the Constitution were required by both Section 4 of Article IV of the Constitution and by statute to be can - vassed by the legislature. Meanwhile, and in 1909 the Supreme Court of Nebraska in the case of State v. Dean, 84 Neb. 344, had occasion to decide that what is now section 49-204 "Requires the returns of an election upon proposed constitutional amendments to be made to the board of state canvassers, directed to the Secretary of State." and that: </seg>
            <seg id="p270">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "There being no specific provision for the canvassing of the re - turns of election on constitutional amendments and no provision for such returns to De transmitted to or lodged elsewhere tlTan with the board of state canvassers, held it was the duty of said board to canvass the returns." At that time, it will be remembered, the section of statute in question was substantially in the same language as now. The effect of the courts decision was that said section of statute provided that the state canvassing board, and not the legislature, was the proper body to canvass the returns. In passing, we call attention to the fact that at least ever since said decision, the state board has canvassed returns upon constitutional amend - ments. For example, in 1934. the votes upon the three amendments adopted in that year were canvassed by the state board, and the Governor proclaimed the result on December 17. 1934. As above stated. Section 4 of Article IV of the Constitution requires that returns on the election of officers of the executive department are to be canvassed in the legislature. This provision has always been in our Constitution. In the various election laws passed since the adoption of the original Constitution, provisions have been made for canvassing of votes for certain officers, and particularly constitutional executive officers, by the legislature, while other provisions have provided for canvassing the votes for other state officers, such as judges, regents and presidential electors, by the state canvassing board. Section 32-922 Comp. Stat. Neb. 1929 provides that immediately upon the completion of the canvass by the county board, a copy of the abstract of the votes cast for president, vice-president. United States senator, congress - men, all state officers, regents, judges of the supreme and district courts and all questions under the Constitution voted upon by the whole people' shall be sealed up and addressed to the speaker of the House of Represent - atives. The clause in said section as to questions under the Constitution voted upon by the whole people was first inserted in this section in 1917 (p. 108 Session Laws 1917). Section 32-923 provides that the county clerk shall at the same time send a duplicate copy of the same abstracts, together with the sealed conv - oy the abstract for the Speaker of the House of Representatives, to the Secretary of State " * * who shall preserve the ones addressed to the speaker of the House of Representatives unopened, until the meeting of the legislature, and from the duplicate copies prepare a tabular sheet of the votes cast for such officers and preserve the same for the </seg>
            <seg id="p271">OPINIONS use of the legislature in making the official canvass, as required by the Constitution." (Constitution refers only to canvass of votes for executive officers) This last section has been unchanged since 1879. Section 32-924 provides, in part, "The votes cast for president and vice-president shall be canvassed by a board of canvassers, consisting of the governor, secretary of state, auditor of public accounts, treasurer and attorney general." This particular provision of that section was adopted in 1917 (p. 108 Session Laws 1917). Although it has always been the section creating the state canvassing board, prior to 1917 other officers than president and vice-president were mentioned in the section: for example, in 1913, Section 2084 Rev. Stat. the slate board was required to canvass the votes cast for presidential electors, judges of the supreme and district courts, regents of the university and executive state officers chosen in the odd-numbered years. In 1913 and prior to 1927 what is now Section 32-930 provided for a canvass by the state legislature of the votes cast for constitutional state officers (naming them) for railway commissioner, for electors of United States sen&amp;tors, president and vice-president and for members of Congress. It will be observed that even then there was a conflict in the two sec - tions last mentioned. In 1917, as shown by Section 32-924, the canvass by the state canvassing board was apparently limited to the votes cast for president and vice-president, and what is now Section 32-930 was changed to provide that the votes cast for United States senator, congress - men, regents, judges of the supreme and district courts, all state officers and "all questions under the Constitution voted upon by the whole people" shall be canvassed by the legislature. From the confusion found in these changes in the various sections referred to, the clause which gives rise to our present question is that which requires a canvass by the legislature of the votes upon "all questions under the Constitution voted upon by the whole people." It seems to us that this clause is certainly broad to include votes upon proposed constitutional amendments, as well as votes upon initiated and referred measures, and the like. This being true, there is apparently a direct conflict between the pro - visions of Sections 32-922 and 32-930 and Sections 49-204 and 49-205, which provide that the Governor, within ten days after the result of the vote on the amendment is ascertained shall make proclamation declaring the proposed amendment to be a part of the Constitution. </seg>

            <seg id="p273">OPINIONS We arc of the further opinion that even though the state canvassing board failed or neglected to act, and the governor failed to proclaim the result as ascertained by that board, that the result of the election has at this time been ascertained by the county canvassing boards; lhat said result is known: that a mere mechanical tabulation of the returns from the county canvassing boards conclusively shows the result of the election and therefore the amendment has, in law and in fact, been adopted. It would be immaterial to the adoption of the amendment and its effectiveness whether the state board or the legislature were the proper body to canvass this vote; or whether any provision existed in the statute for proclamation of the result by the governor. Section 1 of Article XVI is self-executing to the extent above indicated, because it specifically provides that "If a majority of the electors voting on any such amendment adopt the same, it shall become a part of this Constitution, * * *." Under this clause it must be immaterial as to how the result is ascer - tained, if in fact the required vote for the amendment was cast. No officer, board or legislature can interfere by inaction or conflicting action with the result of the vote. Weston v. Ryan, 70 Neb. 211. In that case it is said (p. 217): '"The only requirement named in the constitution itself is that the amendment shall have been submitted in the manner prescribed, and shall have received a majority of all the votes cast at that election. * * * it seems to us clear that the question of the adoption and the consequent validity of this amendment depends upon the number of votes it received, and that after sixteen years it is too much to ask us to set it aside, not on the ground of any actual lack of votes, but on the ground of the irregularity, infirmity and impropriety in the manner in which the vote was counted and the result declared. * • * the amendment would still remain a de facto poition of the constitution until it should be affirmatively shown that the alleged recount was false and that the ballots declared by it did not exist, and that the amendment did not in fact receive a majority of all the votes cast at that election. * * *" i ! ' ' " '■ ■ i "' Sec also, State v. Winnett, supra. 3. If this be the law, it is clear that the only answer to the question as to when the amendment became effective, if lawfully adopted, would of necessity be the date of the election at which the proper majority voted for its adoption, to- wit, November 3, 1936. Regardless of the time when the result of the election was or will be ascertained and proclaimed, and regard- </seg>
            <seg id="p274">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL less of by whom it is ascertained, we believe it is the law that if the amendment was adopted by the proper majority, it went into effect on November 3, 1936. In the case of State v. U'innett, 78 Neb. 379, what is now Section 20 of Article IV of the Constitution, creating the railway commission, was the constitutional amendment under consideration. The proposed amendment was submitted by the legislature at the election in 1906. The legislature had also provided that at the same election members' of the proposed rail - way commission should be elected. Thus the people were creating a con - stitutional office and on the same day voting for men to fill it. It was objected that the legislature had no power to provide for election of officers for an office not yet in existence. The court said: "Constitutions and amendments thereto are created by the vole of the people and not by a canvas:, of that vote, nor by the official declaration of the result. If this amendment was adopted it was when a majority of the electors had voted In its favor, and, when that occurred, it became a part of the Constitution and the office of state railway commissioner's existed. By the same act of the people that made the amendment a part of the fundamental law. and created the office, these respondents were elected to fill that office. Both matters might properly be submitted to the electors at the same election." In the case of State v. Dean, 84 Neb. 314, the people had voted for tho adoption of an amendment to the Constitution increasing the number of judges of the supreme court. The amendment was submitted to the vote of the people at the general election of 1908, held November 3d, and was duly adopted by the vote of the people. The returns were duly certified to by the several county clerks and forwarded to the state board of canvassers. Said board canvassed the vote and the result was announced by the proper proclamation by the governor, who soon thereafter appointed four members of the court. When the legislature assembled the following year and a new governor took office, the legislature attempted to canvass the vote and the new governor likewise appointed judges, and the contest was as to whether or not a judge appointed by the old governor was entitled to the office. The court, in holding that the canvass by the state board and the proclamation and appointment by the old governor was lawful, that the canvass by the legislature and proclamation by the new governor were unlawful, and that the judges appointed by the old governor were entitled to hold the office, said: "It will be seen therefore that it is conceded that the constitutional amendments were duly and regularly adopted by the necessary majority of the votes cast at the election in November 1908 and </seg>
            <seg id="p275">OPINIONS i that the amendments submitted are now and have been since the casting of votes on election day a part of the constitution." Under the foregoing authorities, it seems to us indisputable that this enactment abolishing the office of commissioner of public lands and build - ings, if voted for by the proper majority, went into effect on November 3, 1936, and that there has been no such office in the state of Nebraska since that date. 4. If the amendment became effective on November 3, 1936, the extremely serious questions arise as to what effect it had and now has upon the office of the commissioner of public lands and buildings, the incumbent thereof, the employes of the office, their acts and doings, and upon the property and records of the state formerly entrusted to them. The only changes in Section 1 of Article IV of the Constitution to be found in the amendment are that in two places the words "commissioner of public lands and buildings" are omitted from the section where they formerly were found, and the omission of the words "senate and house of representatives meeting in joint session" and insertion in lieu thereof of the word "legislature." The amendment is silent as to when it shall take effect, as to what shall become of the property of the state and the records of the office which is to be abolished, as to the duties with which said office was charged and as to the laws and other constitutional provisions which would be affected by abolition of the office in question. - Although we have attempted to discover some rule of law which would justify us in expressing the opinion that the commissioner of public lands and buildings and his employes could continue to function and carry on the duties formerly imposed upon the office of the commisisoner, as a de facto officer, until such time as some provision could be made therefor, or some rule of law which we could conscientiously say would authorize us to ex - press the opinion that the amendment is not self-executing, our research has resulted only in strengthening the belief that because of the abolition of this important office, without any provision made for the carrying on and performance of its functions, the result has been the removal from office of the commissioner of public lands and buildings, the discharge of all employes of his department, the lapse of the unexpended moneys In the appropriation for that department into the general fund, the termination of the member - ship of the said Commissioner as a member and secretary of the Board of educational land:; and funds, and of any and all other boards or commissions, all as of date of November 3, 1936; and it is our opinion that all acts, instru - ments, certificates, votes, conveyances, contracts, and in fact everything done or performed by the personnel, from the commissioner on down, in the former office of commissioner of public lands and buildings since November 3, 1938, have been unconstitutional, null and void. </seg>
            <seg id="p276">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL The proposition voted upon by the people in the election was the abolition of the office of commissioner of public lands and buildings. Section 1 of Article IV in its form as adopted by the vote upon this proposition abolishes the office. In our opinion it must be held to be self -executing. Without an office de jure, there can be no de facto officer. Norton v. Shelby Co. 30 L. Ed. 178, lays down the above rule and that case is specifically cited and approved in the case of Baker v. State, 112 Neb. 654. It is a general rule, almost without exception, that without an office there can be no officer, either de jure or de facto. . Boyer v. U. S. 69 L. Ed. 1011 State v. Blancett (N.M.) 174 Pac. 207 City of Elyria v. Vandemark (Oh) 126 N.E 314 Coyne v. State (Oh) 153 N.E. 876 City v. Ind. Comm. (Ill) 171 N.E. 167 Kirk v. Keen (Okl) 255 Pac. 690 Smith v. S. D.

In the state of Missouri there have been some cases holding that even where the office has been abolished, the person assuming to act will be held to be a de facto officer to prevent great public injury, but from an examination of those cases, it will be seen that they are not in point with our case, because in them there was a mistake of fact as to the result of the election and furthermore there was no other officer who might take charge to prevent what would otherwise be irreparable injury. Moreover so far as we can ascertain, Missouri does not follow the supreme court of the United States as Nebraska does, as to the dating back of unconstitution - ality to the time of its inception, rather than its discovery. Minnesota and one or two other states under entirely different circum - stances have held persons assuming to act, when no office was lawfully created, to be de facto officers, but such cases are entirely different from this case. In the case of State v. Winnett, 78 Neb. 379, our court said: "It will be conceded that, where there is no office, there can be no officer." Our Constitution provides in Section 6 of Article IV, </seg>
            <seg id="p277">OPINIONS ■■'•"'.■ . ■ ■ ■'■'. ' ■ ■ - '.' "The supreme executive power shall be vested in the governor, who shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed and the affairs of state efficiently and economically administered." Section 84-101 Comp. Stat. Neb. 1929 provides: "The governor is hereby constituted the legal custodian of all the property of the state not specifically entrusted to other officers by law; and he is hereby authorized and empowered to take summary possession of such property of the state without any process of law, and to adopt such measures as he may deem proper to preserve it from injury or deterioration." Section 14 of Article IV of the Constitution makes the governor the commander in chief of the military forces of the state and authorizes him to call them out to execute the laws. We therefore deem it the duty of the governor to take charge of all the property, records and official instruments of the state, formerly entrusted to the commissioner of public lands and buildings, even though there be no appropriation of money available ' to delray the expenses thereof at the present time. It is our opinion that the amendment to Section 1 of Article IV of the Constitution has repealed the provision in Section 1 of Article VII making the commissioner of public lands and buildings a member of the board of educational lands and funds and likewise part of Section 3 of Article XVII fixing the salary of the commissioner of public lands and buildings, since those parts of said sections are inconsistent with it. Likewise all statutes inconsistent with the amendment have been repealed. i . ' ■ . . . -■■-. .'.■■. The fact that at the same election when the amendment was adopted there was elected a commissioner of public lands and buildings, can make no difference as to the date of taking effect, the operation and effect of this amendment, since at the same time he was elected, the office was abolished by the Constitution. State v. Winnett, supra. SUMMARY 1. The amendment 1o Section 1 of Article IV was lnwully adopted and is constitutional. 2. The returns of the vote upon said amendment should be canvassed by the state canvassing board and the result thereof should be proclaimed by the governor within ten days thereafter; but the canvass and proclamation can have no effect upon the adoption of the amendment if in fact sufficient vote:; were lawfully cast at the election for its adoption. </seg>

There appearing to be no question but what a sufficient number of votes were cast for the adoption of the amendment, it went into effect on November 3, 1936, the date of election. 4. There has been no office of commissioner of public lands and build - ings since November 3, 1936; there has not been since that date any such office to be occupied by anyone; and anyone elected to such an office at the last election finds himself with no office to occupy. All acts done by anyone so assuming to occupy such office since November 3, 1936 are void and of no effect. All parts of the Constitution and laws of this state in conflict with the amendment have been repealed or nullified by the provisions of the amended section. The commissioner of public lands and buildings and the employees of his department and the expenses of his department cannot bo paid from and after November 3, 1936, because the appropriation therefore lapsed under the amendment to the constitution.

You have asked for my opinion in connection with House Roll No. 218, which creates the State Commission for the control of feeble minded persons, and also creates county sub-commissions for the handling of feeble minded persons. You state in your letter that some judges and county attorneys are of the opinion that this law provides for the commitment of feeble minded persons to the feeble minded institute by the county sub-commission. You desire our opinion in order to furnish that opinion to county authorities who might possibly be in error in their construction of this law. In construing House Roll No. 218 of the 1935 legislative session, we must bear in mind that this is not an independent act in itself, but that it merely supplements Article IV of Chapter 83 of the 1929 Compiled Statutes. The new act does not in any way amend the existing statutes relating to the commitment of feeble minded persons to the institutions for the feeble minded. As I see it, House Roll No. 218 merely creates the commission for the control of feeble minded and county sub-commissions whose duty it is to supervise such feeble minded persons as might not be committed to institutions, as well as to see to it that such feeble minded persons do not marry and propagate their kind. • Section 83-404, 1929 Compiled Statutes, provides the manner in which feeble minded persons shall be committed to the feeble minded institute. This section expressly states that the feeble minded institute shall receive only such feeble minded persons as may be transferred to the institution by the Board of Control, or may be committed thereto by a juvenile court- of this state under the provisions of the juvenile court law, or may be com - mitted thereto by a county court of this state in the manner provided by law. Under this section, which was not in any way amended or changed by House Roll No. 218, your institution could not receive a feeble minded person unless he were committed to your institution by one of the three methods set out above. The state commission for the control of feeble minded persons could not commit a person to your institution, nor could a county sub - commision do so. </seg>

Section 7 of House Roll No. 218 (Sec. 83-412, 1935 Supplement) on its surface apparently gives the county sub-commissions the power to commit feeble minded persons to the feeble minded institute. However, when wo take into consideration the sections that I have quoted above, and when we realize that the institution cannot receive any persons except those who have been committed there either by the juvenile court, the county court, or the Board of Control, we must come to the' conclusion that the commitment of feeble minded persons provided for in Section 7 applies only to the com - mitment of feeble minded persons to the control of the state commission. « Jd hlS iQ« n = USiO , n " b ° rne ° Ut by Sectiori 9 of House R °&gt;' N »- 218 (Sec stnt S f UPPl T ent) ' Which P r ° vid &lt;* the county sub-commission' £t T) hf a " d f Xamine a11 P ersons "h°se names are contained in the list O f feeble minded persons sent to such sub-commission by the state commission, and that if the investigation of such county sub-commission and its examination shows any such persons contained in said list to be feeble minded, that the county sub-commission shall commit such persons to the .superv,s.on and control of the state commission. It is apparent from this section that it was not intended by House Roll No. 218 that the county sub^ commission should have the power of commitment of feeble minded person. to the institution for the feeble minded. Instead of that, the county sub - commission merely determines that a person is feeble minded and certifies that fact to the state commission.

You ask an opinion from this office as to whether the Governor has authority to remove the chief of police of the City of Omaha or of any other city in the state without court action. In answer to the question you ask I will say that in my opinion he does not have such an authority where the chief of police is appointed by some other city officer or officers and is not elected by the votes of the electors of the city. The Governor does have statutory authority to suspend officers who come under the general designation of peace officers during the time that proceedings are pending in court for their removal.

S. 1929, which gives such authority, reads as follows: "The attorney general of the State or a special attorney designated by the governor under the provisions of Section 3281 and 4832 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, when directed by the governor, shall institute and prosecute quo warranto proceedings in the supreme court against any such county attorney or prosecut - ing officer, sheriff, police judge, police officer, or police commission - er, mayor or other officer, who holds his office by a vote of the people, and during the pendency of such proceedings such officer may by the governor be suspended from performing the duties of his office, and temporary appointment may be made by the gov - ernor for the performance of the duties of such office, and if the court shall find that such suspended officer has wilfully failed or refused to enforce any law which it is his duty as such officer to perform, then the court shall render judgment of ouster against such officer and the office shall thereby become vacant." GEO. W. AYRES, Assistant Attorney General. SALARIES OF CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS September 30, 1935. Honorable George E. Hall, State Treasurer, Building. You submit for our opinion that since S.F. 52, 1933 Session, was declared void, two constitutional officers are entitled to salaries under the law relating to the same for which the appropriation is insufficient. You ask what amounts should be paid to these officers. </seg>
            <seg id="p282">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL The officers are the tax commissioner and one member of the board of control. The tax commissioner's salary is fixed by section 77-301, C. S. 1929. at $5,000 per year. The 1935 appropriation bill provided only $4,000. (1935 Session, p. 649). The question is whether the appropriation bill may effect a reduction in the said officer's salary arid whether the full salary may bo paid even though no appropriation has been made. In our opinion the salary should be paid at the rate of $5,000 per year regardless of the amount of the appropriation. In Western v. Herdman, 64 Neb. 24, the supreme court reporter, a constitutional officer, had no ap - propriation made for his salary. This salary was not fixed by the constitution but by the legislature. The constitution, section 8, art. VI, 1875 constitution provided that the compensation of the reporter should be fixed by law rot to exceed $1,500 per year. Section 17, Chapt.:i9 of the Compiled Statutes fixed the salary. Weston v. Herdman, supra, pp. 27, 28. As pointed out in the Wcston case, if the legislature may through the appropriation bill change the amount of an officer's salary, it may do indirectly what it can not do directly. It could by withholding any appropriation, abolish the office, or by appropriating a different amount than provided by law. increase or decrease an officer's salary during a term of office. The same reasoning is true in the case of a member of the board of control. In addition, we call your attention to the fact that it is impossible to ascertain from the appropriation bill which member of the board of control is to receive the lower amount. This is not important, however, in view of the reasons expressed above, which impel; us to hold the members of the board of control in the same position as the tax commissioner. DANIEL STUBBS, Assistant Attorney General. DATA FOR COUNCIL OF STATE GOVERNMENTS— APPOINTMENT AND SALARY OF ASSISTANT ATTORNEYS GENERAL April 3. 1936. Hon. Clarence V. Beck, Attorney General of Kansas, Topeka, Kansas. We have a letter from Henry W. Toll, containing 'a statement of questions submitted to the Council of State Governments by your office. In your letter you ask for information relating to the appointment of Special Assistant Attorneys General, particularly as to the statutory au - thority therefor. Our statutes are rather peculiar in this connection. Formerly the statutes permitted the Attorney General to appoint a deputy and such </seg>
            <seg id="p283">OPINIONS ■ ■■'."■ regular and special assistants as he deemed advisable. For some reason that part of the statute relating to the appointment of regular and special assistants was dropped from the law. We do have some statutes permitting the employment of special counsel in certain cases. Section 84-203, Compiled Statutes, 1929, authorizes the employment of counsel in case action is brought against a county, person, corporation or association for damage on account of the infringement of any patent where the state engineer has drawn plans and specifications for the construction of bridges or other public structures for counties within the state, and where such plans have been adopted by the county. Section 84-205 forbids state departments from employing special counsel unless the employment of such counsel is authorized in writing by the Governor or the Attorney General. Section 84-209 authorizes the Attorney General to employ assistants or special counsel in connection with irrigation suits. In the case of In re Estate of Creighton, 91 Neb. 654, when the statute was somewhat different than its present form, our court held: "When it is the duty of the Attorney General to appear in an action or legal proceeding he may authorize other members of the bar to appear for him, and pleadings or other papers executed in his name by responsible members of the bar of this court will not be disregarded upon the sole ground that the Attorney General must appear in person and with no suggestion that such appearance was not duly authorized." Recently, in the case of C. C. Carlscn v. The State of Nebraska, 254 N.W. 744. the above case was cited and approved. This was a criminal case in which an attack was made upon the participation of an Assistant Attorney General in the prosecution of the case. I happened to be the Assistant that was aiding in this prosecution. Our Supreme Court ruled that I was au - thorized to participate in the case as a representative of the Attorney General. In Lower v. State. 106 Neb. 666, our court held: "The assistant attorney general is the agent of the attorney general, and not an independent officer, and his official acts must be per - formed in the name of his principal." Sections 84-201 and 84-202 create a department of justice within this state, with the Attorney General at its head, and gives that department general control and supervision of all actions and legal proceedings in which the state may be a party, or may be interested. </seg>

            <seg id="p285">OPINIONS VALIDITY OF SPECIAL FUND FOR COMPENSATION COURT PROVIDED BY S. F. 219, 1935 SESSION September 18, 1935. Honorable Frank M. Coffey, Judge, Workmen's Compensation Court, Lincoln, Nebraska. You inquire whether the proceeds of a premium tax imposed on com - pensation insurers (section 43, S. F. 219) and self compensation insurers (sec. 31, S. F, 219) may validly be applied to the expenses of the compen - sation court in the absence of a general appropriation therefor. The legislature has provided in each instance above referred to that the proceeds of the taxes shall be set apart by the state treasurer "in a special fund to be known as the compensation court fund for the use and benefit of said compensation court," Sees. 31 and 43, S. F. 219. '.' and the act purports to appropriate this fund for the designated purpose. (Sec. 43, S. F. 219). 'I ' • '■. : ': The question is whether such an appropriation which does not specify any definite amounts is valid in view of the constitutional provision, sec. 25, Art. Ill, which provides: "No money shall be drawn from the treasury except in pursuance of a specific appropriation made by law * *." The question is set at rest by the case of State v. Hall, 99 Neb. 89, in which it was held that the constitutional provision was applicable only to appropriations from the general fund and that the legislature might create a special fund to be kept separate and apart from the general fund and that payments for purposes of such special fund need not rest on a "specific appropriation" made each biennium. In the case of State v. Hall, supra, the treasurer was compelled to pay warrants issued against such a special fund for the purposes of the fund despite the absence of a "specific appropriation." The case controls in this case and we believe the funds referred to are available although no specific appropriation has been made. DANIEL STUBBS, Assistant Attorney General. </seg>

Lobdell, Department of Roads &amp; Irrigation. Acting State Engineer, Building. You ask our opinion as to whether the state is responsible for maintain - ing irrigation structures on the state highway systems. We are of opinion that bridges and other structures erected to permit an irrigation canal to intersect a highway must be maintained by the irriga - tion company. There is no doubt that this is true as to county highways under county supervision. State ex rel Dawson County vs. Dawson County Irrigation Company. 125 Neb. 838. Section 46-619. Compiled Supplement. 1933, enacted after the above case was decided, places the responsibility in the premises upon the irrigation companies. The only doubt is as to whether that section is applicable only to county i highways, thereby excepting state highways. However, if this is true, it is also true of all other laws upon the subject, and the question is left unregulated by statute. In that case the common law is applicable. Dawson County v. Dawson County Irrigation Co.. 104 Neb. 137. and the commoii law imposes the instant duty upon the irrigation company. Dawson County Irrigation Co.. supra: Stale ex rel County of Dawson v.

Board of Education of State Normal Schools/ You submit for our opinion as to its authorization a contract by which the Board of Education of State Normal Schools undertakes to employ the Kirkpatrick-Pettis-Loomis Company to aid in! marketing refunding contracts for the construction of dormitories at the state normal schools. We do not believe the Board is authorized by law to execute such a contract. A former contract was submitted to this office covering the same subject matter in which compensation for Kirkpatrick-Pettis-Loomis Company was provided in the sum of 1%% of the principal of the bonds refunded plus one thousand dollars. This amounted to: 86,287.50. We advised that no authority existed for the Board to pay normal school dormitory rentals to </seg>
            <seg id="p287">OPINIONS an investment company for commission. The present contract prepared by the company now offers the same service for compensation to be paid by detachment of interest coupons from the refunding contracts. And that compensation has been raised, if our mathematics is correct, to $9,463.75. Although the contract does not in express terms provide for the de - tachment ol coupons by the above named company, Mr. Pettis of that com - pany informs me that such is the agreement with the Board. I do not need to call your attention to the fact that a supplementary oral agreement is as much a part of the contract as the written contract which it supplements. Section 85-402, C. S. 1929, which permits the Board to pledge the dormitory rentals for construction purposes, is the only section giving the normal board power in the premises. It authorizes the use of the rentals to pay construction charges and interest only. Using the rentals to pay a com - mission to an investment house in refunding operations is not contained in this authority. It is a cardinal rule in this state that governing authorities of a govern - mental sub-division are limited in their powers to those expressly provided by the legislature. Ahem v. Richardson County, 127 Neb. 659. Paragraph 2 of the contract in connection with paragraph 1 provides that the investment company shall advance funds necessary to pay off the present outstanding bonds. This amounts to a loan by the company to the board and the board is not authorized to borrow money for this purpose. Under these paragraphs the outstanding contracts are to be called but not cancelled and held in full force as security. This is unauthorized. If the bonds are called as they provide they must be cancelled. In paragraph six the contract requires the board to refund only those bondt. which may be redeemed leaving other bonds of the same issue un - redeemed. This severable feature is unauthorized. Either all or none of the bonds may be refunded. In strict language the contracts now outstanding are not bonds. They are merely contracts which pledge the rentals of the dormitories. In making new contracts we do not believe that the statutory language in the referred to section will support authority in the board to appoint a financial agent with or without compensation with the powers delegated by the submitted contract. The contract is therefore disapproved. DANIEL STUBBS, Assistant Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p288">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL SALE OF DISEASED LIVESTOCK AT PAVILLION SALES September 12. 1935. Honorable J. S. Anderson, State Veterinarian, Building. You submit to this department for answer a letter received by you from Doctor Walter D, Jensen of Grant, Nebraska, in which he says: "In case of incomplete address pf a person disposing of livestock through the Pavillion Sales Ring, which is found to be diseased. are the sales operators responsible for being negligent in that re - gard, in case the seller cannot be; located? Also is it permissible for the Sales Company to cover up the name of the seller with a John Doe so that in case I wish to look up the party who has disposed of diseased livestock no such individual can be found? "It seems as though the Sales Law is taken rather lightly by the Sales Company. They think it just another N.R.A. Won't you please inform them that they must comply with the law or have their license revoked? At the last sale I found a bunch of sick pigs and ordered them out of the yard. I was informed that they wouldn't be placed on sale. When I was inspecting the incoming livestock those pigs were sold anyway. As a result I have several adjustments to make." I do not know of any law which makes it the duty of sales operators to obtain the complete address of any and all persons or of any person for that matter, who dispose of livestock through the Sales Pavillion. In the absence of any statute requiring it, I do not believe the sales operators can be held financially responsible for not obtaining it or com - municating it to others. I do not now recall any statutory provision which authorizes your office to revoke a license already issued for some violation of the law governing the sales of livestock. If such power exists, which is a matter not entirely free from doubt, the removal can only take place after a hearing and after the licensee has been given an opportunity to defend himself against the charge that he has been guilty of a violation of law. It is provided, however, by section 54-946, Compiled Statutes that: "It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly harbor, or sell or otherwise dispose of, any domestic animal or any part thereof affected with an infectious, contagious or otherwise transmissible disease, except as provided by this act, and the rules and regula - tions prescribed by the Department thereunder and any person so </seg>
            <seg id="p289">OPINIONS ■ ■ ■ offending shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and punished as in this act provided." It is further provided by section 54-947, Compiled Statutes that: "It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any rule or regula - tion prescribed and promulgated by the Department of Agriculture, pursuant to authority granted by this Act, and any person so of - fending shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and punished as in the act provided." Suction 54-950. Compiled Statutes provides that: "Any person violating any of the provisions of this act is hereby deemed to be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be fined in any sum not less than $50.00 nor more than $1,000.00 or by imprisonment in the county jail for a period of not less than thirty days nor more than one year, or both." And section 54-951. Compiled Statutes, provides that: -!■'..■ - ■ " • ■ * the district courts of this state, in the exercise of their equity jurisdiction, shall have power, by injunction, to compel the observance of. and by that remedy enforce the provisions of this act and the rules and regulations established and promulgated by the Department." These are all parts of an act passed in 1927 and are not a part of the act governing public sales of livestock which was passed in 1933 and pro - vides for the licensing of sales operators conducting public sales of live stock. Its provisions are applicable, of course, to sales operators, and it occurs to me that by a resort to its provisions sales operators may be punished for a violation of statutory provisions intended to safeguard the health of domestic animals or for a violation of the rules of the Department of Agriculture adopted for a like purpose. Each county attorney L; charged with the duty of conducting prose - cutions ol lav/ in his county and cases where you have reasonable grounds to believe that violations of law have occurred in any county you or the Department of Agriculture may notify the county attorney of that county and request him to investigate and prosecute if he finds the facts warrant a prosecution.

            <seg id="p290">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL FUND FOR NEBRASKA AERONAUTICS COMMISSION— S. F. NO. 30 September 30. 1935. Honorable C. J. Campbell, Chairman. Nebraska Aeronautics Commission. Lincoln, Nebraska. You ask for an opinion from this office as to whether or not the money paid in as an excise tax in conformity with the provisions of Section 16 of S. F. No. 30, passed at the last session of the legislature and now known as Chapter 3 Session Laws of 1933, may be used ;for the purposes for which the act creating the fund says it shall be used, even though it is not included in the sums mentioned in the biennial appropriation bill. I am of the opinion it may. Section 16 of said act reads, in part, as follows: "There is hereby imposed a tax of four cents per gallon upon fuels purchased for and used in aircraft within the state of Nebraska. the same to be levied, collected and remitted in the manner pro - vided in Article 4, Chapter 66, of the Compiled Statutes of Ne - braska, 1929, and Article 4. Chapter 66, C. S. Supp., 1933. and subsequent amendments and additions thereto, in reference to other motor fuels, save and except that the State Treasurer shall place the aircraft tax so collected and remitted to him in a special fund to be known as the Aviation Fund. Such fund, upon filing of proper vouchers, shall be disbursed as other moneys in the State Treasury by the Nebraska Aeronautics Commission, for the pur - poses set forth in this Act. The dealers defined in said Article 4. Chapter 66 and subsequent amendments and additions thereto, shall collect said four cents tax and keep an account thereof separately from other fuel tax and remit the same accordingly i&lt;&gt; the State Treasurer. No other or different tax .shall be imposed for fuel bought 'for and used in aircraft excepting the said four cents per gallon tax as herein set forth, and the use thereof shall be for the purposes set forth in thus Act." Section 18 of the same act provides that: "Nothing herein shall be construed to give the commission the right to incur indebtedness or liabilities chargeable against or 'Collected from the State of Nebraska, and the commission shall be limited in its expenditures and liabilities to the amount derived from the aircraft fuel tax herein provided." And Section 19 of the Act reads, in part, as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p291">OPINIONS -.■■'.■■ ■ : ■■'-■■." "AH acts and parts of acts in conflict with this act, ' 5 " * are hereby repealed. • • -" The Nebraska Aeronautics Commission has certain expenses to meet. It may on.ploy a oecretary at a salary of not lo exceed four thousand dollars per annum. It is authorized by statute to purchase one aircraft, and it is required to inspect all proposed airports, landing fields and aviation schools. The only money that the Commission can use to pay its various expenses is the amount derived from the aircraft fuel tax, provided for by the act creating the Commission and that act specifically provides that the aircraft fuel tax. provided for by it. shall be used for the purposes set forth in the Act. I do not believe a biennial appropriation is needed in this case, but if needed. I am of the opinion that need is supplied for the present biennium. inasmuch as the act. including the part appropriating the money raised by the collection of the excise tax which it authorizes was passed at the last session of the legislature. In the recent case of Burke v. Bass, 242 N. W. 606, a similar tax was held to be an excise tax and its levy was held to be constitutional; and in the case of State v. Hall, 155 N. W. 228, it was held that a fund created by statute and set apart for the maintenance of the office of State Fire Commissioner and the expenses incident thereto, might be paid out by the State Treasurer on warrants properly drawn by the Auditor of State for the purpose for which the fund was created, without a biennial appropriation by the legis - lature. I take it that a like rule is applicable in the instant case. GEO. W. AYRES, Assistant Attorney General. ■ . [• . ;.■'■;■■ LIABILITY TO PAY INTEREST ON CLAIMS FILED January 14. 1935. Board of Control, Building. You have asked this department whether or not you are bound to pay interest upon claims filed with you for the payment of submitted bids, which claims have not been paid by reason of lack of funds. It is our opinion that if and when a claim cannot be paid before de - linquency if a delinquency date has been fixed, or if a claim has not been paid in the course of regular office routine, that interest is a proper charge and may be properly paid by your department. </seg>
            <seg id="p292">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL The question as to the time when interest begins to run is one that cannot be determined generally but must be determined on each individual case. On merchandise which is purchased upon bids, we are of the opinion that interest should be charged from a date after the delivery and approval of the merchandise, taking into consideration the length of time that a warrant would be withheld by reason of office routine. PAUL P. CHANEY. Assistant Attorney General. June 15, 193G. Board of Control, Building. We are in receipt of your letter dated June 4, 1936. wherein you advise that a patient was duly committed to a state; hospital, was received at the hospital, was treated until she regained her health and was then discharged as provided by statute; that she then temporarily left this state for a visit and while away again suffered a recurrence of her previous mental disability. You ask if the hospital where she had previously been a patient could accept her without an order of tho proper authorities of the county of her residence. The statutory law of this state fixes .the procedure to be followed in order to properly commit a patient to a state hospital. Chapter 8!!. Article 7, C. S. Nebr. 1929. This procedure must be strictly followed. At the time a patient is discharged from; a state hospital, the hospital loses all jurisdiction and control of the person who had been a patient. If, that person again later suffers from a mental deficiency, he must be re - committed as provided by statute, before the hospital may properly receive him. It is therefore our opinion that when a properly discharged patient of a state hospital suffers a recurrence of a mental disability that the hospital is without authority to accept said person until he has been committed in the manner provided by statute.

You have handed us a letter received by you from the State Home for Dependent Children dated November 16 to which was attached a letter from the State Home for Dependent Children bearing date of November 22. In discussing this matter with Mr. Walter E. Hager, chairman of your board, we were advised that it was your desire to have an order from a proper court before transferring members of the Home for Dependent Children to any other state institution, particularly to the institution for feeble minded at Beatrice. We call your attention to section 43-226, Comp. Stat. Neb. 1929, which provides in substance that when a minor has been committed to a state institution, that the Board of Control may at its discretion transfer the minor to any other state institution when such transfer appears to be proper to the Board. This section of the statute provides the procedure that must be followed by the Board of Control before such transfer may be made. We particularly call your attention to the provision which requires the passing of such an order when the board is in executive session, and also the fact that notice must be given to the person who had custody of the minor immediately prior to the time of his commitment. </seg>
            <seg id="p294">REPORT OF ATTORNEY; GENERAL When we discussed this matter with Mr. Hager in our office a few days ago, we suggested that before the Board of Control makes an order trans - ferring any minor from the Home for Dependent Children to any other state institution, that the minutes should be supported by affidavits of persons having full knowledge of all the facts; pertaining to said minor, who are qualified to reach the conclusion upon which the transfer is made. In other words, if you are sending a report of the Home for Dependent Children to Beatrice by reason of the fact that the dependent child is feeble minded, the records of your office should be complete and contain the affidavits of qualified doctors relative to the mental condition of the minor. It is our opinion that by reason of the statute above referred to, that this is a matter vested in the Board of Control and one which need not be called to the attention of the county court; that the matter is vested entirely in the Board of Control. The correspondence indicates that the matter has been discussed by the superintendent of the Home for Dependent Children with Judge R. R. Reid of the county court of Lancaster County. Nebraska, and that he has refused to assume any jurisdiction in the matter for the reason that the statute vests jurisdiction in th6 Board of Control. In discussing this matter with Mr. Hager, he advised that your body was hesitant in making transfers as herein described without an order from the court for the reason that as individuals you might be liable in damages. It is our opinion that if in each case of transfer the statute above referred to is strictly complied with, and if the suggestions herein contained are fol - lowed, that action for civil damages could be successfully defended.

We are in receipt of your letter wherein you ask the opinion of this department as to whether the Board of Control of the State of Nebraska may exchange merchandise with the Colorado Prison Industries. You advise that overalls, jackets and outer garments are made in Nebraska prisons and that socks and underwear are manufactured in Colorado prisons, and that if you can properly do so, arrangements will be made for an exchange of these separate items of merchandise. </seg>
            <seg id="p295">OPINIONS Section 83-966 of our statute provides in substance that the selling of merchandise manufactured in any penal institution in the State of Nebraska is prohibited. The question presenting itself is whether the exchange of merchandise by the State of Nebraska and the State of Colorado constitutes a sale within the meaning of the statute above referred to. As is stated in 2.T C. J. page 185: "The term sale may be construed as including an ex - change, and indeed exchanges are frequently denominated sales." In view of the above it is our opinion that you may not legally exchange prison made merchandise with the Colorado Prison Industries. PAUL P. CHANEY, Assistant Attorney General. January 24, 1936. Mr. Ivan S. Gallant. Commandant. Soldiers' &amp; Sailors' Home. Grand Island, Nebraska. This will acknowledge our receipt of your letter of January 20 wherein you set forth a statement of fact as follows: "We have in this institution a mental patient who is drawing a pension of $40.00 a month. There are only two known heirs, sons. With an understanding with them I am depositing this money each month, less what she might need for her personal expenses, in a savings account in the First National Bank of Grand Island, Ne - braska. This account is carried: "Ivan S. Gallant, Trustee.' Would it be proper for me, with the consent of both heirs, to draw on this account for either one of them? In case of her death would it be proper for me to pay her funeral expenses? This account has grown quite large, something over $2000.00." You advise us that the case stated covers a mental patient but you do not advise whether the party has been judicially determined incompetent. A person who to your knowledge is incompetent would of course not be a person to direct you, as competent, to care for his or her property, whether it be real or personal. If the person has not been judicially determined incompetent, and is in possession of property, you or some other person interested should take immediate steps to have a guardian appointed for such person at the place of his or her residence. When a guardian has been appointed, he will of course be required to give bond for the preservation and protection of his ward's estate. He, the guardian, is the only person who may act legally for the incompetent person. Although there may be nothing legally wrong with your taking the money of a patient and depositing the same in a trust account, your action </seg>
            <seg id="p296">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL is subject to some criticism. There would probably never be criticism so long as all parties interested in the estate of the incompetent person under - stood the true conditions. However, one dissatisfied heir could cause con - siderable expense and trouble even though you could successfully defend yourself in any action that might be brought against you. It is for this reason that we advise against the practice above stated. In our opinion it would be both unwise and improper for you as trustee of a patient's property to withdraw any part thereof for the benefit of any of the patient's heirs even though all of the heirs might agree thereto. By following this practice you would be assuming more authority than a duly appointed guardian who is under the jurisdiction of the court. It is our suggestion that the commandant of a home should confine his activity solely and entirely to the duties prescribed upon him by statute. If there is a patient in his home who is incompetent and in possession of any real or other property he is then charged with the responsibility of having a guardian appointed in the proper court. If the patient is not incompetent, it would be much more advisable for him to keep himself free from assum - ing any responsibility in the affairs of the members of the home. PAUL P.

You have asked for the opinion of this department as to whether mem - bers of the prison band may be given the benefits of diminution of time from their sentences under the provisions of section 83-955. C. S. Nebr. for 1929. ■ The above section of statute permits the granting of diminution of time from sentences to prisoners making satisfactory progress in the prison school. In discussing this matter with you personally, we concluded that the prison band should properly be considered as a part of the educational set - up within the prison. In view of this conclusion of fact, it is our opinion that members of the prison band come within the meaning of section 83-955, supra, and that those members may be given extra time for their studies.

We are in receipt of your letter dated June 20, wherein you ask if a patient may be committed to a state hospital by a board of commissioners of insanity of any county other than the county of the patient's resi - dence. It is our opinion that any board of commissioners of insanity may hold a hearing to determine the sanity of a person in their county whether that person is a resident of the county or not.

Nebr. 1929, being a part of Chapter 83, Article 12, of the Laws of Nebraska, provides that the laws governing the Boys In - dustrial School are applicable to the Girls Training School. Section 83-1109, which is part of Chapter 83, Article 10 of our law, deals with the Boys In - dustrial School. The section of our statute last above referred to authorizes the superintendent, by and with the advice and consent of the Board of Control, to adopt sufficient by-laws for the promotion, paroling and final discharge of inmates as may be considered mutually beneficial for the inmates and the institutions. If the superintendent, by and with the consent of the Board, has not made by-laws providing for the release and parole of inmates, said inmates shall be released and discharged upon his or her arrival at the age of twenty - one. If by-laws have been adopted, they of course govern relative to the discharge or parole of inmates, but in no event can an inmate be kept after his twenty-first birthday. PAUL P. CHANEY.

            <seg id="p299">OPINIONS known as the Hawes-Cooper Act, which divested prison-made goods of interstate character. On July 24, 1935, President Roosevelt approved what is known as the Ashurst-Sumners Act (49 U.S.C.A. 61). which constitutes it a federal offense for one to (a) knowingly transport or cause to be transported in any manner any goods, wares or merchandise manufactured in whole or in part by prisoners into any state where such convict-made goods are intended to be received, possessed, sold or in any manner used in violation of the laws of the state into which they are transported; or (b) ship prison-made goods, unless the name and address of the consignee, the nature of the goods, and the name of the prison where the goods were made, can be ascertained readily by an inspection of the package. At this day the State of Missouri has not enacted legislation which in any way qualifies the privilege of one to manufacture, distribute or sell prison-made goods. Consequently, it would not be a violation of the federal law for one to ship prison-made goods into the State of Missouri and sell them. It would, of course, be necessary, in order to comply with the federal law, that the name and address of the shipper, the name and address of the consignee, the nature of the contents, and the prison where the goods were made, be readily ascertained from an inspection of the package. It follows that unless Section 83-966. Compiled Statutes Supplement, 1935, acts as a bar, the State of Nebraska may sell its prison-made goods in the State of Missouri. An examination of this section, especially that part which has been set out heretofore, discloses that it does not in any way purport to prohibit the shipment of prison-made goods, nor does it prohibit the sale in other states of goods produced in local prison industries. Con - sequently, we are of the opinion that the State of Nebraska may ship goods manufactured by its prison industries into the State of Missouri and offer them for sale there. As Section 83-966 provides that no person shall offer for sale any prison-made goods in this State, it follows that the offer of sale must be made in the State of Missouri, and that the sale must be actually consummated at that point, or at some point outside the State of Nebraska. In other words, Section 83-966, supra, is not a bar. to the shipment to Missouri of the prison-made goods of this state, and so long as the actual offer of sale is made at a point foreign to this State, we believe that this Section is not a bar. It must be borne in mind, however, that the goods must be identifiable in accordance with the provisions of the federal act which has been cited heretofore. The manner in which Section 83-966 is cast does not make it clear that its language impedes the privilege of the State to manufacture, distribute, offer for sale or sell prison-made goods. Its language appears to be directed toward persons, firms, corporations and their employees, agents or servants. </seg>
            <seg id="p300">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL But we are not prepared to say at this time that the State as a sovereignty would not fall within the prohibition of this language. LESTER A. DANIELSON, Special Asst. Atty. Gen. SHIPPING OF PATENTED DEVICE MADE BY PRISONER IN MICHIGAN INTO STATE OF NEBRASKA February 15. 1936. Mr. Edward Dumas. 1796. Box 1025. Marquette, Michigan. This will acknowledge our receipt of your letter of February 9th, where - in you ask for the opinion of this office upon the following matter: You state that you are an inmate of Marquette Prison, and that you hold a patent right upon a wire bird nest holder which you make in your cell during your free periods; that you employ no other inmates to make or assist you in making this device; that you purchase the material used in manufacturing this device out of your personal funds; and that the State of Michigan profits in no way from the sale of the device. The question which you ask is whether or not any law of this State would prevent you from shipping this device into this state. The Act of Congress of January 19, 1929, (49 U.S.C.A. 60) divests prison made goods of interstate character. This Act in substance recites that all goods, wares, and merchandise, manufactured, produced, or mined, wholly or in part, by convicts or prisoners, except convicts or prisoners on parole or probation, or in any penal or reformatory institutions, shall, upon arrival in any state for use, consumption, sale or storage therein, be subject to the operation and effect of the laws of such state to the same extent and in the same manner as though such items were produced in such state. • By reason of such holdings of the Supreme Court as the Child Labor Case (Hammer v. Dagcnhart, 247 U.S. 251) it is clear that Congress could not have barred prison made goods from the channels of interstate com - merce. Nor could the states have prohibited the sale of prison made goods of other states insofar as such goods might be offered for sale in the original package. Here then was an area which was free from governmental inter - ference. The purpose of Congress in enacting the Act in question was un - doubtedly, therefore, to enable the states to patrol this free area by divesting prison made goods of interstate character. Pursuant to this Act of Congress, the 1935 Regular Session of the Ne - braska Legislature enacted certain laws to prohibit commerce in prison made goods in this State. These provisions now appear as Sections 83-965 </seg>
            <seg id="p301">OPINIONS and 83-966 of the Compiled Statutes Supplement for 1935. To summarize, these provisions provide as follows: (1) Prison made goods of other states are subject to the laws of this state to the same extent as though they were produced in this state. (2) "'No person • • • may sell, expose for sale or offer for sale any goods, wares or merchandise, except farm supplies, machinery and equipment, manufactured * * * wholly or in part by convicts or prisoners (except convicts or prisoners on parole or probation) or manufactured ' * * wholly or in part in any penal or reform - atory institution * * " ." A penalty clause then follows. What the purpose of the Legislature in enacting this legislation was, is not, of course, discernible from the face of the legislation itself. It is a matter of common knowledge, however, as evidenced by the repeated declarations of the courts, that prison made goods are not dangerous or un - safe, but are legitimate articles of commerce. And we think it to be a mat - ter of common knowledge also, that the design of legislatures in enacting laws like the one in question here, is to reduce the competitive hazards in the business world occasioned by the influx of prison made goods. The device which you propose to ship into this state would not, of course, be a product of a prison industry within the meaning usually accorded to those words. And, as your device is patented, it is unlikely that it could be seriously urged that it would be a competitor of devices of a like nature which are not manufactured in prison. In other words, in your instance the purpose of the law would not be thwarted by permitting you to market your products in this state. We believe the proper con - struction of the statute in question condemns commerce in products of prison industries, but does not extend to the purely personal labors of an inmate himself. A contrary construction would, of course, also condemn commerce in works of polite letters and of the plastic arts, for the words "goods, wares, or merchandise" receive a broad construction by the courts (See Words &amp; Phrases) and an inmate of a penal institution would not, therefore, be able to market a manuscript of a novel, a canvass, or a piece of sculpture, even though such items were the products of his purely person - al efforts. We are inclined, therefore, to the opinion that Section 83-966, Compiled Statutes Supplement, 1935, does not extend to what may be described as the purely personal efforts of an inmate of a penal institution as distinguished from the products of prison industries. However, as no decision of any court is available as a precedent for this situation, there is grave doubt as to what the ruling of our Supreme Court would be if this question were presented to it for determination. The fact that both the federal and the </seg>
            <seg id="p302">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL state laws except the products of convicts on parole or on probation might be held to be suggestive of the fact that no other exceptions were con - templated. It may also be well to note that the Act of Congress of July 24, 1935. (49 U.S.C.A. 61) makes it a federal offense for one to knowingly transport or cause to be transported any goods, wares, or merchandise, produced by convict labor or in any penal institution, into any state in violation of any law of such state. As the question which you 'present has not been answered, so far as we know, by any federal court, there is grave doubt also as to the interpretation which a federal court would give to Section 83-966, supra, if such federal court were called upon to construe this section (Section 83-966, supra) in advance of a ruling by our own court. In short, there is grave doubt as to whether or not Section 83-966. supra, does extend to the purely personal efforts of an inmate of a penal institution, although we are inclined to the' opinion that it does not. In the absence of a ruling by our Supreme Court, this question remains con - troversial. I In conclusion, Section 83-966, supra, would not, however, prohibit you from merely shipping your products into this state, but believing, as we do, that you intended a broader question than that, we have answered your query in greater detail. LESTER A. DANIELSON. Special Asst. Atty. Gen. . |_ ■.-.'•.■ April 18. 1936. Hon. Renus Kargo. Chiel State Probation Officer, Building. This will acknowledge our receipt of your letter of recent date relative to the matter of Roy Roberts. No. 7037, of the Nebraska State Penitentiary. A brief resume of the history of his case would be as follows: On De - cember 5, 1911, he was sentenced to the State Penitentiary for a term of from three to fifteen years upon a plea of guilty to a charge of robbery. On" December 26, 1913, he was granted a furlough, which was converted to a parole on June 25, 1914. While on parole he was convicted of first degree murder and was sentenced to death. He appealed to the Supreme Court, but while awaiting the disposition of his case by that tribunal, was confined in the State Penitentiary from December 29, 1914 to January 3, 1917, on which date the Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case for further proceedings (See Roberts v. State, 100 Neb. 199). He was then sentenced to the penitentiary for a period of twenty-five years on a plea of guilty to a charge of second degree murder. While </seg>
            <seg id="p303">OPINIONS serving this sentence, he escaped from the penitentiary on the 14th day of June, 1925, and was not returned until February 8, 1930. He is now confined in the penitentiary and is serving the remainder of the twenty-five year sentence for second-degree murder. The questions which you present for our consideration may be stated as follows: 1. Is Roberts entitled to apply the time which he was confined in the penitentiary pending the disposition of his appeal by the Supreme Court, on the twenty-five year sentence which he is now serving? 2. What disposition should be made of the robbery sentence under which he was first committed? He violated his parole by commit - ting the murder for which he was sentenced. I shall answer your questions in the order stated. First. It appears to be the general rule that, in the absence of a statute to the contrary, one who appeals from a sentence to a term in the peniten - tiary is not entitled to be credited on his term of imprisonment with the time he is detained while awaiting the determination of his appeal. See 16 Corpus Juris, 1372. Although it does not appear that our Supreme Court has been called upon to pass upon this point, it appears that this rule is well settled by the decisions of other courts. In the case of People v. Walsh. 5 N. Y. Cr. Rep. 524, the facts of the case, as outlined in the opinion of the court, disclose that the relator was convicted of larceny and was confined in a penal institution during the pendency of appeal proceedings. He then sought a writ of habeas corpus and averred in .support thereof that he has served his sentence as the time served by him during the pendency of the appeal proceedings should lie applied toward the satisfaction of the sentence. In dismissing this contention, the Court of the Special Term declared: "The relator seeks his discharge on the ground that he has in fact served his sentence, allowance being made for good behavior, but it is perfectly clear from the return and from his admission in the traverse that he has never begun to serve his term under the - judgment of the Court of General Sessions. All proceedings under it have been stayed. He has been in a place of detention, that is all, pending appeals taken by himself upon which he has obtained stays of proceedings. Had he boen bailed and in the hands of his bondsmen, he would not have been any more free from the service the term of his imprisonment than he is now. Because he did riot </seg>
            <seg id="p304">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL give bail he has not physically been free from restraint. It cannot be said therefore that he has served out his sentence." In the case of Ex Parte Hudspeth, 280 Pac. (Calif.) 179, the petitioner sought to be released from the city jail of Los Angeles on a writ of habeas corpus. The facts of the case disclose that he was convicted of a mis - demeanor and was sentenced to jail for a term of seven months. He there - upon gave notice of appeal and the court ordered that he be admitted to bail in the sum of $2500. No undertaking of bail was filed and he con - sequently remained in the custody during the pendency of the appeal pro - ceedings. The judgment was affirmed. It was the contention of the petitioner that the time which he was detained while the appeal proceedings were pending should be applied toward the satisfaction of his sentence, and that if this were done his sentence had been satisfied. The court, how - ever, refused to accept this contention, and said: "A detention during pendency of the appeal subject to his right to be admitted to bail, is of the satne character as a detention on the charge made against him during the pendency of the action in the trial court down to the time of pronouncement of judgment and taking of the appeal." And in the case of Clemens v. State. 21 S. W. 525 (Tenn.) the court held that one who appeals from a judgment sentencing him to a term of years in the penitentiary is not entitled to serve on his time in the penitentiary pend - ing the decision of his appeal. In the case of McCormick v. Slate, 71 Neb. 505. our Supreme Court considered a cognate problem. The second point of the syllabus reads as follows: "Confinement in the penitentiary under a void or erroneous sen - tence, because of the failure of the accused to obtain a suspension of his sentence during the pendency of his proceedings in error, is in no sense a part execution of a legal sentence; and by the rendition and execution of a legal judgment, the accused is not twice punished for the same offense." The facts of the case disclose that the defendant was convicted of murder and was sentenced to serve a term of twenty years in the state penitentiary. He thereupon appealed to the Supreme Court which affirmed the con - viction, but held that the judgment was invalid by reason of the fact that the trial court failed to inform him of the verdict of the jury and ask him if he had anything to say why judgment should not be pronounced against him. For this reason the judgment was reversed. (McCormick v. State. 66 Neb. 337). The court issued its mandate and directed the trial court to render a proper sentence and judgment on the verdict of the jury. This was done. </seg>
            <seg id="p305">OPINIONS It further appears that during the pendency of the appeal proceedings, the defendant was confined in the penitentiary for failure to furnish bail and obtain a suspension of the sentence. He urged that he should be credited with this time on his sentence. Our Supreme Court, however, refused to accept this contention, and said; "Plaintiff also insists that notwithstanding the former judgment and sentence of the district court were erroneous and void, yet he had served a portion of his time thereunder; or, in other words, the sentence had been partly executed, and therefore he is entitled to his discharge. To this we can not give our assent. It is true that the plaintiff, during the pendency of his first proceeding in error, was confined in the penitentiary, but section 518 of the criminal code provides that 'Every person sentenced to the penitentiary shall, within thirty days and as nearly as practicable after his sentence, unless the execution thereof be suspended, be conveyed to the penitentiary of this state, by the sheriff of the county in which the conviction took place, and shall there be delivered into the custody of the warden of said penitentiary, together with a copy of the sentence of the court ordering such imprisonment.' The failure of the plaintiff to procure a suspension of the erroneous sentence rendered it necessary to confine him in the penitentiary of the state during the pendency of his proceedings in error. And, as before stated, such confinement was no part of the execution of a legal sentence. If he had obtained a suspension of the sentence, this question would not have arisen, and it would be absurd for us to hold that, by failing or neglecting to obtain such suspension, he could render the courts powerless to punish him for his offense." The foregoing authorities incline us to the opinion that one is not entitled to credit the time which he spends in confinement during the pendency of appeal proceedings on his sentence. This is also indicated by the fact that our legislature has provided for the discharge of the defendant during the appeal proceedings if the offense of which he is convicted is a bailable one. In all events, however, the execution of the sentence itself is suspended during the disposition of the case by the appellate court. In the instant case the sentence was death. The execution of this sentence was suspended when Roberts appealed to the Supreme Court. The time which he spent in prison while his case was being considered by the court was not, therefore, spent to satisfy the sentence of death imposed upon him. And there was no sentence for a term of years. He was merely being detained pending the disposition of his appeal. If the offense were a bailable offense he could have obtained his release by filing the proper undertaking. That the offense was not a bailable one, does not, in our opinion, alter the general rule. </seg>
            <seg id="p306">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL It is our opinion, therefore, that Roberts is not entitled to credit the time which he spent in prison during the pendency of his appeal proceedings on the sentence which he is now serving. Second. By section 29-2G28, C. S. Nebr. 1929, it is provided as follows: "If any prisoner in the judgment of , the board shall violate the conditions of his parole or release as fixed by the board of pardons, he shall thereafter be treated as an escaped prisoner owing ser - vices to the state and shall be liable, when arrested, to serve out the unexpired term of his maximum possible imprisonment, and the time from the date of his declared delinquency to the date of his arrest, shall not be counted as any portion or part of time served; and any prisoner at large upon parole or conditional release, who shall commit a fresh crime and upon conviction thereof shall be sentenced anew to the penitentiary, shall be subject to serve the second sentence after the first sentence is served or annulled; said second sentence to commence from the termination of his liability upon the first or former sentence." A provision to this effect has appeared on our statute books for some time. (See Section 9159, R. S. Nebr. 1913. and Section 10256. C. S. Nebr. 1922). On June 25, 1914, Roberts was paroled. While on parole he committed the crime of murder. The facts which you have given us do not disclose whether Roberts' parole was ever formally revoked. If his parole was formally revoked, it is very clear that the statute commands that he serve the remainder of the robbery sentence under which he was first committed. It is true that the court should have ordered that he serve the remainder of the first sentence first (if this was not done), but "Such an erroneous sentence, from which error is not prosecuted, does not nullify a prior sentence by another court for a different crime." Mercer v. Fenton, 120 Neb. 191. In the case of Sanclacr v. State, 111 Neb. 473, the facts of the case dis - close that the defendant was convicted of a felony and was sentenced to a term of years in the penitentiary. He was paroled prior to the expiration of his sentence, and, during the parole period, committed a fresh crime in the State of Iowa. After serving a term of years in the Iowa Reformatory he was returned to the penitentiary, and after serving a short period sought his release on a writ of habeas corpus. He averred that as the pardon board failed to promptly revoke his parole, the time prior to formal revocation must be credited to him. Our court, however, declined to accept this view and said: </seg>
            <seg id="p307">OPINIONS "The argument that the 'declared time' of the section (Section 29-2628, C. S. 1929) means the time when declared is ingenious but not persuasive. The statute should be construed as if it read from the date of his delinquency, as afterward declared, •■'.••. The matter of the declaration is comparatively a matter of bookkeeping, which should be done speedily, but may be done at leisure. The statute prescribes no time for making it." This case, (Sanclacr v. Slate) indicates that the delinquency of a parole violator need not be declared at any specific time. It is our opinion, in view of the foregoing cases, that Roberts may be held to serve the remainder of the sentence for robbery as well as the sentence for murder. We believe that a formal declaration of parole de - linquency should and may be made at this day, although section 29-2628, supra, provides that a paroled prisoner who commits a fresh crime shall serve the first sentence before he serves the second sentence. We are in - clined to the opinion that by reason of this provision a formal declaration of delinquency is not necessary if a paroled prisoner is convicted of a fresh crime committed during the parole period. To summarize, it is our opinion that: 1 . Roberts is not entitled to credit the time spent by him in prison during the pendency of his appeal proceedings on his sentence for murder. 2. Roberts may be held to serve the remainder of the robbery sentence. If so, it might be prudent that a formal declaration of his parole delinquency be made. A problem such as the one which you present, is, of course, one which .should be considered with the greatest of care. If we have made an in - correct recitation of fact in any particular we suggest that you advise us of it. LESTER A. DANIELSON, Special Asst. Atty. Gen.

            <seg id="p308">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ■ changed for federal lands where the state lands lie within a federal game reserve. ■ Section 72-231, Comp. Stat. 1929 as amended in 1931 (1931 Session Laws, p. 350) empowers the state board of educational lands to exchange any state lands lying within any federal game reserve for lands of equal area and value belonging to the United States. We consider this section sufficient to empower the board named to make an exchange under the premises of the statute. And where land has already been patented a deed from the United States'would be the proper and therefore the sufficient means of conveying title to the state. The procedure is that provided in the statute — namely, an agreement between the state board and the United States, and would be effective to convey whatever title the state had. It would not, however. relieve the land of any encumbrance by way of lease or contract of sale that might exist. These would have to be disposed of by the United States and probably, could be condemned by the United States. We do not believe that section 72-233. Comp. Stat. 1929 which permits condemnation by the state of these adverse interests in the case of exchange of lands lying in forest reserves broad enough to authorize state condemna - tion in the case of land within game reserves. Certainly the language ex - pressly limits the application of the section to forest reserve lands. The amendment to section 72-231 by the 1931 legislature cannot be construed to also amend section 72-233. Amendments by implication are not possible under our constitution. Sec. 14, Art. Ill, Constitution of Nebraska. And there is force in the argument that if the legislature had intended to extend section 72-233 they would have amended it as they did section 72-231. We are of the opinion, therefore, that lands may be exchanged but that under existing legislation the state is not empowered to dispose of existing encumbrances. ■ DANIEL STUBBS.

Section 81-5404, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929, provides: "No person either as principal or through brokers or agents or otherwise shall issue, sell, assign, transfer or offer or negotiate for, the issuance, sale, assignment, transfer or by any means or through any medium, offer or attempt to take subscriptions for or promote the offering, issuance, sale, assignment or transfer of any securities not specifically exempt from the provisions of this article, and within this state, until there shall have been filed with the depart - ment of trade and commerce a verified written application, * * • and until and after said applicant shall have received from said department a written order authorizing it to proceed with the proposed offer, issuance, sale, assignment, or transfer of said securities." While the Blue Sky Law has to do with the sale or transfer of securities, the section with which we are concerned deals with the issuance of secur - ities. The power to regulate the sale of securities is an exercise of the police power of the state. The power to regulate the issuance of securities is the exercise of a different power, to-wit: That of the visitatorial power of the sovereign </seg>
            <seg id="p310">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL over corporations which have been formed :by virtue of a grant of power from such sovereign. Assuming, without discussion since the imatter is not involved, that a state may validly regulate the sale of securities of non-resident corporations within its borders, under its general police powers, it is very plain that the powers comprised under the designation "visitatorial" are very different from the powers exercised by the state in its general regulation of the sale of securities. I The state authorizes the creation of corporations; it calls them into be - ing; it grants them such powers as it may see fit to grant and withholds such powers as it may see fit to withhold: it regulates and defines the powers granted as it may choose. It may, and usually does, reserve the power to change the grant of the corporate powers which it has bestowed and where such power is reserved, a change in corporate powers does not impair the obligation of contract. (12 C.J. 1024) It seems to be quite well settled that the state under the laws of which a corporation is organized, and from which ; it derives its corporate powers may, in the exercise of its visitatorial powers, require such corporation to submit to a proper state tribunal the question of the issuance of securities and exact the approval of such tribunal aS a condition precedent to the validity of such securities. It must be apparent, however, that an entirely different question is presented where a state other than the one from which a corporation derives its existence seeks to exercise visitatorial powers and to control the issuance of its stocks and securities. This question was presented squarely in jthe case of Re Fryeburg Water Co. (N.H.) 106 Atl. 225, 18 A.L.R. 1375. In: that case the Fryeburg Water Company, a public utility incorporated under: the law of Maine and furnish - ing water to the public in both Maine and New Hampshire, had been authorized under the laws of Maine to issue a stock dividend of §8.000 to take up a surplus which it had used in improving its plant in both states. It applied to the Public Service Commission of New Hampshire for the approval of so much of the stock dividend as| was represented by investment in the Company's plant in that state. The New Hampshire Commission, being uncertain of its jurisdiction, submitted to the Supreme Court of New Hampshire two questions: First, whether its approval was necessary to validate the stock dividend referred to, and; Second, if such approval was necessary, whether it hatl authority to approve such dividend. In discussing this matter, the Supreme Court of New Hampshire said: "Little doubt, however, can be entertained that the issuing of stock is a corporate act which is regulated and controlled by the laws </seg>
            <seg id="p311">OPINIONS of the incorporating state, and which relating to the internal con - duct and management of the corporation, is exclusively subject to the local laws. 'From the nature of corporate stock, which is created by and under the authority of a state, the right or duty to issue it, like the other attributes of the corporation, is governed by the local law of the state from which it derives its existence, and not by that of any other state.' Kansas &amp; E.R. Constr. Co. v. Topeka, S.&amp;W.R.Co., 135 Mass. 40, 46 Am. Rep. 439, supra; North State Copper &amp; Gold Min. Co. v. Field. 64 Md. 151, 20 Atl. 1039. "Although the language of the statute (Laws 1915, Chap. 115), conferring power upon the public service commission to control the issuing of stock by a corporation doing business in this state, is sufficiently broad to include within its provisions foreign cor - porations, it is not to be presumed that the legislature intended to give the commission power to regulate the internal affairs of such corporations. The fact that a foreign corporation is engaged in business in this state, and owns property located here, brings it within the jurisdiction of our courts in suits against it upon its contracts, or for fraud practiced by it in the conduct of its business, but does not, also, subject it to legislation purporting to regulate the exercise of the inherent corporate powers conferred upon it by the legislative power of the incorporating state. North State Copper &amp; Gold Min. Co. v. Field, supra; Howell v. Chicago &amp; N.W. R. Co., 51 Barb. 378. If the amount of its capital stock is limited by the act of incorporation, the legislature of another state, where it happens to be engaged in business, has no power to increase or diminish the amount of stock thus fixed and established. One of the apparent reasons for this proposition is 'the impropriety and futility of interfering in the internal affairs of the corporation.' (Beale. Foreign Corp. Sec. 307.) The petitioner's request for the approval by the commission of an increase of its capital stock, which has been authorized by the laws of Maine is misconceived, and is an application for the exercise of power by the commission which it does not possess. The effect of its approval of a domestic corporation's increase of stock is to render the stock legal; while its disapproval has the opposite effect. Laws 1915, chap. 115. But no one would claim that its disapproval in this case would render the stock authorized under the laws of Maine illegal or void. "In view of the foregoing discussion, the second question submitted by the Commission, whether it has power to approve a stock divi - dend (see Pub. Stat. chap. 273, Sec. 11) which appears to represent actual value, becomes immaterial in this case, and, therefore, is not considered." </seg>
            <seg id="p312">REPORT OF ATTORNEY! GENERAL It may be interesting to compare Rogers; v. Guaranty Trust Company, 288 U.S. 123, where the Supreme Court of the United States discusses the matter of the control and management of the internal affairs of a corporation and states: "It has long been settled doctrine that a court • • * will as a general rule decline to interfere with or control by injunction or otherwise the management of the internal affairs of a corporation organized under the laws of another state, but will leave con - troversies as to such matters to the courts of the state of the domicile." While the Nebraska statute is perhaps broad enough in its terms to cover the stock or security issues of a non-resident corporation, we are of the opinion that it cannot legally or constitutionally be so construed, for by so construing it, it would unquestionably come^ into conflict with the Federal Constitution, both as to the full faith and credit clause and the due process clause. If, however, the statute be construed as applying only to Nebraska corporations, no such effect follows. That such a construction is a proper and necessary one is evident from the case of Public Service Com. v. U. P. R. R. Co. (Mo.) 197 S.W. 39. See also Laird v. Railroad Company. (Md.) 88 Atl. 347. I It follows from the above discussion that the Commission should assume visitatorial powers under Section 75-1201 only as to corporations organized under the laws of the State of Nebraska. EDWIN VAIL. Assistant Attorney General. ■.-■;•. ■- i.- ..' ; ■ ■ . L_ September 4, 1935. Honorable George E. Hall, State Treasurer, Building. I acknowledge receipt of your letter of August 23 enclosing a letter from Mr. Leon S. Hirsh, relative to certain unpaid car line taxes originally assessed against the American Steel Car Lines, Inc., for the years 1932 and 1933. It appears that the American Steel Car Lines, Inc. has been adjudged insolvent and its assets sold to the Inland Car Lines. You ask whether this tax may be collected by distress warrants against the Inland Car Lines. As we view it, this car line tax is not an excise tax but is a property tax based on and levied against property, to- wit: cars operated within the State of Nebraska. Since these cars have no definite locus, it is provided that their value for purpose of assessment shall be determined by the State </seg>
            <seg id="p313">OPINIONS Board of Equalization, as set out in sections 77-513, and following, Com - piled Statutes, 1929. The value of the cars for purpose of assessment is computed by a method prescribed in the statutes. To this value is applied a percentage based on all the personal property levies within the state and the tax resulting is paid into the state treasury. This is, as we view it, an attempt on the part of the legislature to levy a general property tax upon the property of these companies for the benefit of the state as a whole. Section 77-204, Compiled Statutes of 1929, provides: "Taxes assessed upon personal property shall be a first lien upon the personal property of the person to whom assessed from and after the first day of November of the year in which they are assessed, until paid." It is provided in section 77-515, Compiled Statutes, 1929, that the car line taxes shall become delinquent on December 1 of the year in which levied and if not paid by the first of February following, shall be collected by distress and sale. As we view it, the law imposes a lien upon the personal property of the car line company, including of course the cars assessed, upon which the subsequent distress and sale is predicated. In the case of Foster &amp; Smith Lumber Co. v. Leisure, 3 Neb. Unoff. 237, the court had to do with a stock of lumber and also office furniture which had been sold and transferred by the owner without the payment of personal taxes assessed. The decision of the court is reflected in the first paragraph of the syllabus, which is as follows: "Taxes, assessed on personal property, are a lien, not only on the personal property assessed, but on all such property subsequently acquired, from the time the tax-list is delivered to the county treasurer, and subsequent purchaser of such property takes it sub - ject to such lien." Although this is a commissioner's opinion, the court approved the con - clusion and adopted the finding made as a correct disposition of the case. Our case was based on a similar statute, and it would seem that the de - cision would be controlling here. It is pointed out by the court that in a number of prior cases it had been held that the lien of personal taxes was superior to the lien of a chattel mortgage executed after the taxes became a lien. Farmers Loan &amp; Trust Co., v. Mcmmingcr, 48 Neb. 17; Reynolds v. Fisher, 43 Neb. 172. The court argued that if a subsequent chattel mortgage were inferior to the lien of the taxes, so also would be a transfer of the title to the property. </seg>
            <seg id="p314">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Applying these principles to the instant case, the lien of the car line tax would attach to the personal property of the company on November 1 of each respective year, and would remain thereon until satisfied by pay - ment or otherwise. I Mr. Hirsh, in his letter, calls attention to the fact that proceedings in bankruptcy have been had in which this property was sold. We take it. however, that in order for the State of Nebraska to be bound by these bankruptcy proceedings it must have been listed as a creditor and served with notice. If Mr. Hirsh can point out to us that this has been done and this tax divested through operation of the ' proceedings had in the bankruptcy court, we should be pleased to be advised of the fact. We suggest that you call these facts to the attention of Mr. Hirsh by sending him a copy of our letter. In our opinion these taxes would still subsist in the property owned by the American Steel Car Lines, Inc., at the time the tax was levied, unless they have been discharged as above indicated. EDWIN VAIL. Assistant Attorney General. 1. STATE OWNED STREAMS February 12. 1936. Mr. Ernest Ruby, 501 East 4th St., McCook) Nebraska. This will acknowledge our receipt of your letter of recent date wherein you make the following inquiries: 1. What watercourses in this state are .state-owned and which are owned by the United States? 2. Is the Republican River a state-owned stream? 3. Is a small island in the middle of the Republican River state prop - erty? 4. How much land on either bank of the Republican River may be cleared of flood debris against the wishes of the owner of the land adjoining the river? I shall answer your questions in the order above stated. 1. Ownership of watercourses rests with the sovereignty in a sovereign and not in a proprietary capacity. By this, we mean that the watercourse itself is not subject to absolute ownership by anyone. The sovereignty </seg>
            <seg id="p315">OPINIONS merely acts as a trustee for the people to make certain that the water - course, a public thing, will be reserved for the enjoyment of all. Under the early common law the King was the sovereign — the trustee. In this country, however, this conception of single sovereignty has been displaced by the conception of dual sovereignty. By this we mean that both state and Federal governments are sovereignties within the spheres of their respective powers. We have observed that ownership in watercourses is in the nature of a trusteeship. With the Federal government, by reason of its commerce powers and as has often been said, its admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, rests the superior power over interstate navigable streams and intrastate navigable streams which are a necessary adjunct to interstate commerce. With the states rests the superior power over innavigable streams and intra - state navigable streams which are not necessary adjuncts to interstate com - merce. In passing, it may be well to observe that comparatively recent de - cisions of the United States Supreme Court indicate that the powers of the states with reference to interstate innavigable streams are subject to what Mr. Justice Brewer has designated as a body of interstate common law. The body of law is experiencing an increasing development. Of course, the superior power of the Federal government in its aforeobserved sphere of power, is limited to the preservation and develop - ment of the streams for commerce. By reason of this fact a dual federalism exists to the extent that the states may exercise police powers with reference to such streams if the exercise of such powers does hot impinge upon the powers delegated to the Federal government. By applying the above criteria to the watercourse in question, you will be able to ascertain the sovereignty (state or Federal) which is vested with its guardianship, and the extent of power which the sovereignty enjoys. 2. The Republican River, not being a navigable stream (Clark v. Cambridge &amp; Arapahoc Irrigation &amp; Improvement Co., 45 Neb. 798) would be subject to the guardianship of the state, and this guardianship would be subject only to the aforeobserved body of interstate common law. If, how - ever, it could be shown that the use of this river, as a tributary, impaired the navigability of a navigable river acceptable for interstate commerce, a basis for federal intervention might arise. 3. An island in the center of the Republican River is subject to private ownership. Prior to the organization of the state, it was, at one time, part of the public domain. If private ownership did not intervene prior to the time that the land on the adjoining banks was taken by private owners, and if it was not surveyed prior thereto, its ownership passed to the owners </seg>
