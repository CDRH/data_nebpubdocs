            <seg id="p003">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 233 NEBRASKA SOLDIERS' AND SAILORS' HOME, BURKETT, NEBRASKA To hi* Excellency, Honorable Keith Neville, Governor, and to the Honorable Members of the Board of Com - missioners of State Institution*, Henry Gerdes, Silas A. Holcomb, and Eugene 0. May field. (!&lt; ntlcmcn: Introductory to our general review of operation for the past biennium, we have to say that conditions have not been favorable for the greater part of the period, in matters economic and natural. War conditions have brought a great advance in prices, thereby creating a deficiency. The weather, having been excessively dry, has curtailed our power to produce much of our needed sup - plies. The scarcity of labor and the high cost of same has been quite a handicap as compared with former years, but, notwithstanding, many improvements have been made. The new commissary and ice plant have been com - pleted, with refrigerating of the storage rooms that join the commissary. This itself is a great economy in prevent - ing spoilage, to say nothing of the saving in the distribu - tion of ice, which, during the warm season, amounts to about twelve dollars per day. The new commissary is a great improvement. It is sanitary, convenient and eco - nomical. The power house has been greatly improved and en - larged. A new roof has been put on, and the boilers have been re-set. A 150 horse-power engine and a new switch - board are improvements that will soon be in use, putting the plant in good shape for a long time to come. The new root house is a building with dimensions 30 by 80 by 12 feet, and is so arranged that about 2 and 2/3 times the area can be used for storage. This improvement, according to cost, is of more value than any other im - provement recently made. It is frost proof, and can be perfectly ventilated. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">234 THIKD BIENNIAL REPORT OF The library is a part of the Institution that is well patronized and enjoyed. Our State Library Commission has taken great interest in its welfare, and has seen to it that plenty of good books and current literature have been supplied. The Hospital of the Home has been well managed, and the patients well looked after by the different physicians who have had charge. The building, considering its age and use, is in fairly good sanitary condition. The death rate has not been above normal. The laundry is in good condition, up-to-date, and is adequate for the service needed. The new bake shop is certainly one of the best and most needed improvements made on the premises. The old bakery was a filthy, unsanitary hole, without any conven - iences worth mentioning. But now we have a good room, clean and wholesome, with a new electric oven, a new dough mixer, a new steel trough and metal bread raising closet and all other equipment necessary for an up-to-date bake shop. There have been a number of needed improvements made in the Administration building. New shower baths have been added to our wash-room, and the old unsanitary toilet arrangements have been removed. The room is now used solely for a toilet room. A new and up-to-date toilet has also been erected in the old jail room. This place was formerly used as a dumping ground. The new arrangement is, of course, a great improvement. Our old bakery has been entirely overhauled, having been re-floored, plastered and painted. This has been con - verted into a ward, accommodating 8 beds. The old brick walks that were on the north and east sides of the main building, were in bad repair and danger - ous for the old people. These have been replaced with good cement walks. The old frame shanties that were used as vestibules were out of repair and unsightly. They have been removed, and new brick vestibules erected. All walks that were in bad repair have been fixed, </seg>
            <seg id="p005">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 235 and new ones laid, where needed. The lawns have been kept mowed and the flower beds cultivated, so that the place has been fairly presentable. All other buildings have been cleaned up and put in fair shape. The garden has been an important factor in the wel - fare of the Home. We have produced a large part of our best living from our garden, especially were products abund - ant last year. This year was excessively dry, yet we raised an abundance of early vegetables. We have increased our garden acreage from about 4 to 18. The results of our farm and dairy industries will be fully covered in our statistical reports. We also beg to submit the following estimates as rec - ommendation for the biennium 1919 and 1920: for general maintenance; including groceries, flour, and fuel, $260,519, for freight, express, and transportation, $32,934, other maintenance and replacements, $3,850, and for general repairs, $8,500. The most important thing in the way of improvements that we have to recommend is a new hospital. At the present time this home is nearly full to the limit, with the membership of nearly six hundred, and in view of the consequences of the war just ended, and estimating the same at a minimum of 2% of the 40,000 troops from Nebraska becoming incapacitated, would mean a probable increase in membership of not less than 800, and therefore we urgently recommend this hospital. The rooms in this should not be less than 10 by 12 feet, with full toilet arrangement, except bath. In our opinion, this building should be built on land west of the present hospital. The old hospital could be used very nicely and profitably in bringing in the outside colony that was established by the legislature four years ago. This colony is the most expensive proposition in connection with the Home, and if the appropriation for the new hospital should be allowed, the act establishing the above-mentioned colony ought to be repealed. </seg>
            <seg id="p006">236 THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OF According to architects' estimates, the cost of erecting this hospital would be approximately $149,050. We further recommend the erection of two hollow tile silos, with a capacity of 200 tons each. We look upon this matter as a very profitable investment, as more feed can be gotten off the same ground and all of it saved by means of silos. With this farm of 640 acres, we believe that these silos are both necessary and profitable. It is believed that they can be built for about $1500. A commandant's residence, which would contain the offices, is further recommended. This should be of brick, and at a cost not to exceed $10,000. Every Soldiers' Home, that we know of in the United States, except Burkett, has this necessary convenience, which conduces to the peace of the place and the discipline therof. We also recommend the purchase of a parcel of land, situated on the southwest corner of the Home section, the same to be used for a cemetery. This is badly needed as the old cemetery is nearly full and this is the only high ground that is fit for the purpose. The cost of this land would be about $2800. We further recommend an extension to our green - house, which at present is inadequate for our purposes. We find it necessary to propagate thousands of early plants for the garden, and at present we have scarcely room enough for even the flowers and flowering plants, to set out on the grounds. We have no means of knowing exactly the cost of this expenditure, but name it at $1500. This is based upon a similar improvement at the State Penitentiary. We have covered the cost of two new stair-ways in our estimate for general repairs. The stair-ways on the south side of the main building are old and need replacing. If the improvements above suggested are provided for, the Home will be put in very good shape. Yours very truly, J. F. Walsh, Commandant. Burkett, Nebraska, November 30, 1918. </seg>
