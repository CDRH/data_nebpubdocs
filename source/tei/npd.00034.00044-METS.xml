            <seg id="p003">rnty Co-operative Farm Demonstration Work January 1, 1914 BY C. W. PUGSLEY AND A. I". AXDER8ON I This report embodies the actual work accomplished by the four perative county farm demonstrators in their respective counties the year 1913. It includes the annual reports made by each of demonstrators to the county farm management associations having work largely in control. None of the demonstrators have been at -k a full, consecutive year. Gage county started the work February derrick county March 1, Thurston county May 1, and Seward county h a regular man July 1, 1913. HISTORY OF THE WORK. I Cooperative county farm demonstration work in Nebraska began the summer of 1912. when an association of men employed Mr. S. Culver, then teaching agriculture in the Central City College, ipend the summer months in the field with the farmers of Merrick nty. Merrick county, at the close of Mr. Culver's summer work, ered into a new contract with him to devote all of his time to the lonstration work beginning March l. IMS. Last spring three more nties. Gage, Seward, and Thurston. employed farm demonstrators the year. In these counties the United States Department of Agriculture has rendered valuable aid by giving funds to assist in the work, and by giving the demonstrator all of the privileges of employees of that department, such as technical assistance and the free use of the mail. Some of the county farm management associations accepted funds from the Crop Improvement Committee of Chicago and from the C. B. ft Q. Railroad to help in establishing this work in their respective counties. I The farm practices such as rolling winter wheat in the spring, t treatment of seed oats, and early plowing in the fall for winter at have proved so to increase yields under practical farm con - &gt;ns that they will be adopted by a large number of farmers in the re. Proper and timely methods in pruning, spraying, and caring orchards were demonstrated to be highly profitable practices. The le of alfalfa as a medium for restoring fertility to the soil, as a entative of soil erosion, and as a highly profitable crop was pointed in so many instances that many farmers are now planning to make lfa one of their chief farm crops. In combating and controlling hog cholera alone, the demonstra - tors have saved thousands of dollars for their respective counties. By the4r vigilance in looking for outbreaks of this disease, their prompt action in applying the serum treatment, and more important still, by enlisting the entire neighborhood in proper methods of sanitary con - trol and preventing its spread, hog cholera has in many cases been confined to the original disease centers. Where the infection has been widespread, they have, both in cooperation with local veterinarians </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 and alone, vaccinated several thousand hogs for the farmers. They have waged an incessant campaign of education relative to hog chol - era, and to them -is due large credit for the effective results that have been secured. tThe farm demonstrators have been instrumental in getting more better live stock into communities where it was needed. They ■ assisted in selecting better sires for farmers. Communities also cooperating in buying sires much better than the individuals d afford to own. Cow Testing Associations have been formed to i out the unprofitable cows. Balanced rations for the feeding of stock have been worked out. and. having been put into practice by iers, have both decreased the cost of feeding and increased the luCtB. tThe demonstrators have also assisted in the construction of silos the best conservation of crops in the drouth stricken sections of state. They have been instrumental in the proper selection of corn. They have assisted in the organization and work of boys' girls' clubs. They have taken part in the program of farmers' s, rural literary societies, and rural schools, and have arranged farmers' meetings in fields, orchards, and homes, to point out iiples of successful farm practices. I Each county has had its specific problems, which have varied the k undertaken by the different demonstrators. In most instances i and plot demonstrations have not been in progress long enough secure results for publication. Many demonstrations were started could not be completed due to various causes such as hail, exces - ' drouth, and changing of plans by farmers. Where results are ;n on the value or on the impracticability of methods demonstrated y are for one season only and should be accepted merely as an ication and not as a fixed determination. It is necessary in most ances to have several years' trial before definite conclusions can drawn. These demonstrations, therefore, will be continued for a es of years, which should establish whether or not the methods ocated are practicable for farmers under their respective con - ons. tin the demonstrations undertaken by the various county men. work has been under the direction of. or aid has been given by. various departments having the corresponding work in charge at College of Agriculture. Dr. Gain, head oh the Veterinary Depart - t and of the State Serum Laboratory, held a school of instruction the farm demonstrators giving them information and practice le latest and best methods of hog cholera control. In their work he past season with this disease the farm demonstrators were inually advising with Dr. Gain regarding the best method of tin the formation of Cow Testing Associations and other dairy lopment work within the counties, the Dairy Department gave able assistance and direction. Similar assistance, direction, and ial information were given by the Department of Agricultural iny in the control of smut and other plant diseases; by the De - ment of Horticulture in proper pruning, spraying, and care of ards; by the Department of Agricultural Engineering in laying drainage systems and planning of farm buildings; and by other irtments of the College of Agriculture in their respective lines ■ork. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">DEMONSTRATORS' REPORTS. The yearly reports were submitted to members of the farm man - agement association in each county as follows: Central City, Merrick County, Dec. 31, 1913. Dear Members: t Since March 1. 1913. your farm demonstrator has visited 543 farms, of these farms at the request of their owners. Four hundred and mty-eight farmers have called upon your agent at his office up to uary 1, 1914. Nineteen meetings have been held with a total at - lance of 800. Your agent has traveled 9.040 miles by team or imoblle in bis work during this past year, and l.:t35 miles by train. A Cow Testing Association has been organized with 16 members. This association has been very successful in showing the efficiency of the individual cows, and in getting the members more interested in their work. They have studied how to feed cows more economic - ally, how best to care for their cows, and the class of cows to buy or to keep. They have kept records of the exact earning capacity of each individual cow, for in this way only can they know whether each cow is kept at a profit or a loss. The association for 1914 has been reorganized with 22 herds, and a total of 367 cows. In this work, records of feed consumed and milk produced by each cow are kept by the clerk, or cow tester, as he is called. Subtracting the cost of feed from the value of her product, the tester is able to find out her efficiency. Two clubs, one of boys and one of girls, have been organized in the county. It is planned, during the week beginning the 16th of February, to hold 12 meetings thruout the county, to perfect organiza - tions in boys' corn growing clubs, hog raising clubs, and girls' tomato growing clubs. Because of the size of the county, it is impossible for your agent to visit personally each farm, or come in personal contact with all the farmers. To overcome this, it has been necessary and advantag - eous to use the local press thruout the county by writing weekly articles on timely subjects, telling what has been done in the work, and giving suggestions and plans for the future. During the past year, 180 such articles have been written. I Seven hundred and seventy-nine letters have been written by your nt. During this past year, 98 farmers have actually cooperated in ious lines of field work. Three farmers' excursions have been 1 at places where demonstrations were being conducted. The most lortant of the excursions, perhaps, was that called the Central Ne - ska Dairymen's Rally, held in Central City on June 18. An ex - dingly attractive and useful exhibit was arranged. The Dairy De - tment of the College of Agriculture furnished an attractive and lprehenslve educational exhibit including types of cows represent - the four chief dairy breeds. Practical speakers on dairy subjects e obtained. An attendance of about a thousand farmers showed erest in the work. It is planned to hold a similar meeting this ling summer. Each member of this association should endeavor attend, and urge upon his neighbor the benefit he may receive. Your demonstrator is willing to help any person who wishes to rearrange his fields, or to plan new rotation in order to keep up the productivity of his soil. Tile drainage is one of the big subjects along which we should work during the coming year. Much of the Merrick county soil would be greatly improved by the use of tile. At the pres - ent time, arrangements are being made with our State Agricultural </seg>
            <seg id="p006">First Annual Report 6 Engineering Department to give some tiling demonstrations upon the farms of Mr. Fred Harsh near Archer and Mr. Ed. Potter of Silver Creek. These engineers will determine the depth at which to lay tile, the level at which it should be laid, whether proper outlet can be obtained, and also the efficiency of such work. In regard to field crops, a considerable amount of work has been started during the past year. Sixteen different farmers cooperated in corn growing experiments. They tested in the same field, deep as compared with shallow cultivating, especially in laying-by the corn. They also tested the value of cultivating corn after it has been laid - by. and fall versus spring listing. Fifty-five farmers have cooperated in wheat growing experiments. They tested the value of rolling winter wheat in the spring, the value of harrowing in the spring, the value of a compact seed bed in the fall, the value of early versus late plow - ing, and deep compared with shallow plowing. Seven farmers have cooperated in the growing of oats. They compared plowing versus disking in the spring and the value of rolling after the plow. Three farmers are testing the value of clover in rotations while twelve are demonstrating whether or not it is valuable to inoculate alfalfa seed at the time of sowing. Hall, dry weather, and changed plans have prevented the completion of many of these demonstrations. The re - sults we have obtained have not been sufficient in number to prove that any certain method is always best on all types of soil, tho they have been very suggestive to the farmers making the tests. tFor example, the following few instances will give an illustration ime of the work of the past season. On the College Farm at Cen- City in July, 1912. a field of eight acres was plowed 4 inches deep the exception of the center two acres which were plowed 8 inches i. The entire field received the same subsequent care. The wheat sown on September 12, at the rate of 1 bushel and l peck per acre, shallow plowing returned a yield of 21 bushels per acre, while deep plowing gave :!4 bushels per acre. tMr. Will McCullough of Central City plowed a portion of his ind for wheat early in August. The remainder was plowed in the die of September. The entire field was plowed 6 inches deep and ed with a heavy corrugated roller. The early plowing gave 52 dels while the late plowing made 35 bushels per acre. I Mr. Stanley Joyce of Archer had a field, a part of which had been alfalfa for four years previously, seeded to wheat and the entire d given identical treatment. The ground which had not been in ilfa gave a yield of 18 bushels, and the alfalfa ground gave 22 hels per acre. t field belonging to Mr. Frank Gregg had never received any manure, irt of the field was covered in August, l'J12, with manure at the of IS tons per acre, and a part left unmanured. The entire field plowed, harrowed, and seeded to wheat at the same time. The anured part returned a yield of 18 bushels, while the manured gave :n'i bushels per acre. I Your agent has helped in the selection of I] dairy cows, and of a herd sires. He is willing to give his best judgment to any who re his services along these lines. Perhaps the greatest amount of time and the largest results of the agent have been along the line of hog cholera and hog cholera vaccina - tion. l"p to January 1, your agent has personally vaccinated head of hogs, whose owners' estimated value was $17.O7."&gt;. The results have been very satisfactory. With a few exceptions they have been </seg>
            <seg id="p007">Farm Demonstration Work 7 above expectations. There have been vaccinated in Merrick county between 6,00() and 7.000 head of hogs during the year 1913, and of this number not over 200 head have died. Many of the hogs treated already had the disease. Much work has been done of an educational nature showing effective sanitary measures and proper management and feed of hogs to prevent disease. Your association has listed in its office a considerable quantity of good seed corn which is for sale. All members of this association should report all articles that they have for sale or that they wish to buy. The office can be used as a farm exchange to the mutual benefit of all. tFor 1914, I ask your hearty cooperation along all lines of work, re are 221 members In the association at the present time. It is &gt;d that more men will join for the coming year, because with rger number the work will be on a firmer basis and become more lent. I hope that the organizations in the various townships in county will be more nearly perfected than in the past and that ers along various lines of work may be developed. I hope that ay receive suggestions and criticisms from all the members. Yours sincerely, V. S. CULVER.

            <seg id="p008">8 I a February l, 1913. Since that time I have been busy studying litions and helping wherever possible. During this time. 52 meetings i been held, at which there were in attendance 6,675 people. About of these meetings were held on farms where alfalfa was discussed lfalfa fields, orcharding in orchards, dairying on dairy farms, hogs hog cholera in hog pens, etc. At a number of these meetings, ex - s on these various subjects came from the Experiment Station and ) us helpful information. tYour demonstrator has visited 254 farms, has had 815 office visitors, ived 1.623 direct inquiries on farm problems, sent 3,384 letters, eled 4,100 miles by automobile, and 2,590 miles by train in the rest of the county work, helped select 13 pure bred Holstein sires selected in Wisconsin 24 head of Holstein cattle for the Gage ity farmers. There has been distributed for trial a large amount eeds of various kinds. Many samples of seed and soil have been tip to this time your agent has vaccinated 1.150 hogs and has m a number of farmers how to do the work, so that they are now g their own vaccinating. Results, on the whole, have been very ifactory. The loss in healthy herds has been less than 1 per cent; in herds where there were only a few sick at the time of vacciua - , the loss has been less than 3 per cent. The double treatment given to all hogs vaccinated having a normal temperature, with exception of one herd, where only the serum was used. Dairying and the growing of more alfalfa are being emphasized, as we have very little of either but have ideal conditions for both. This is an alfalfa country, and alfalfa has proved to be the best pay - ing crop that can be grown on this land, yet there are hundreds of farmers in the county growing none. The alfalfa meetings and the distribution of alfalfa literature is stimulating the growing of more of this valuable plant. Better dairying has been promoted by bringing into the county a large number of first-class Holstein bulls and a number of pure bred cows of the same breed. Dairy meetings and demonstrations are being held at which various phases of the dairy business are discussed. The association has a dairy committee which is devoting much of its time to making that phase of farming more profitable in this county. The association is furnishing milk sheets to all who wish them. It is also testing milk and helping farmers keep records of their cows, so they can feed more economically and be able to determine the unprofitable and the profitable cows. A number of the farmers have taken this work up during the past summer and as a result have discovered that several cows of their herds were not even paying for their feed. They, of course, sold them to the butcher. What the county needs now is a Cow Testing Association. I The value of properly balancing the rations for dairy cows is shown the instance of Mr. S. P. Nichols of Beatrice. With a ration con - :lng of ensilage, alfalfa, and ear corn meal costing $6.90 per day 20 cows the average product for three days was 307 pounds of Ik valued at 3 cents, giving returns of $2.31 per day above cost of d. With the ration properly balanced by addition of oil meal and in and decreasing the ear corn meal, the cost of feed for the same rs was $6.76 per day. The average amount of milk given for three r-s was 379 pounds, which at 3 cents, gave a profit above cost of d of $4.61. The value of the balanced ration above that formerly fed s $2.30 per day in increased returns. Demonstrations in pruning, spraying, and proper care,, of orchards </seg>
            <seg id="p009">9 have been taken up in Gage county under the direction of the Horti - cultural Department of the State Experiment Station. In the orchard L. Bridenthal of Wymore, it was found by spraying that practically 'J2 per cent of the fruit picked was sound. The fruit on the tree* left unsprayed was so poor that it was all destroyed. The owners thought it useless to determine the percentage of sound fruit. In other demon - strations orchards in the state the past season, the average of sound picked fruit on unsprayed trees was in. 54 per cent. The boys' and girls' work has received a great deal of attention. Fifteen Boys' and Girls' Clubs were organized in the county last win - ter, and 500 boys and girls were enrolled in contest work. Six boys' and girls' picnics were held last summer. At these picnics the boys and girls received instruction in stock /lodging, milk testing, etc. These organizations and contests have stimulated many of the Gage county farm boys and girls to become more interested in better farming. To keep the boys and girls on the farms and get them interested in their work, is one of the most important problems in the development of better agriculture. Realizing this fact, we have made a special effort, by talking to a large number of the schools, to get in touch with as many of the boys and girls as possible and to interest them in agri - culture. We have arranged for many more schoolhouse meetings dur - ing the coming season. The office of the association has become a bureau of information and center of distribution. Hardly a day passes but that inquiries come for breeding animals or seed of various kinds, or information where there is an animal or some seed for sale. At the present time, we have listed for sale in the office about 1.500 bushels of good home grown seed corn and several hundred bushels of alfalfa seed. This seed will all be tested, so that the farmers will know just what they are getting. Next spring, when the farmers find they have less seed corn than they need, it will be an easy matter for the county associa - tion to tell them exactly where they can get good home grown seed at a reasonable price. Last spring there seemed to be enough good seed corn in the country, but about planting time the office of the association was swamped with inquiries. If you have anything for sale or wish to buy, let the association know. We may have listed Just what you are looking for. If you have some new practical equipment on your farm or have been unusually successful in some farm opera - tion, let us know so others can profit by it. Likewise, you may profit by someone's else experience. The county is so big and the membership of the association so large that it has been impossible for your agent to get in touch with all who are supporting this movement. At the very beginning I was aware that with a membership of O^er 600 it would be impossible to visit everyone at his Jfcrfi'. so a l#ge number of meetings are being held in various parts of the county. In this way every member is given a chance to get in touch with the work. Also, many articles and various notes of information have been published in our county news - papers from time to time. Hy time is usually spoken for several days ahead and sometimes several weeks. I am your hired man, and like a hired man I visit those who call for my services and really have something for me to do. Do not hesitate to call on me. I am yours for service. Very truly. OTTO H. LIEBERS • Mr. Ltobers, because of serious illness, was unable to carry on his work for two months during the summer.

Seward County. Dec. II, 1913 To Association Members: The work in Seward county was not started by your demonstrator until the first of July, altho Mr. Anderson was on the ground for some time previous getting the work organized. The time of starting was not at all favorable for the accomplish- ment of very much beyond getting acquainted and because of this late start, the work was not carried on in detail in the county as it will be from now on. Much of my time has been spent in studying the existing conditions and in getting a definite bearing for the future In the course of my work, 2. son miles have been traveled by auto- mobile and 500 on the train. During this time 284 farms have been viBited. Five meetings have been held with a total attendance of 1,400 people. A meeting had been scheduled for almost every town in the county, but as very bad weather made it impossible to get over the roads, it was deemed advisable to hold them a little later. Two meet- ings were postponed because it was impossible to secure speakers at ftime. More meetings will be held in the next two weeks. Ninety farmers have called at the offlce. Of late, they have aver- aged about five a day. Telephone calls are almost innumerable, which is evidence that interest is taken in the work. I regret, however, that </seg>
            <seg id="p011">Farm Demonstration Work 11 it has been impossible to reach all of the members in so short a time. It is purposed to get into personal touch with every member during the winter months. In spite of the late start some work was taken up that has given good results. That in pruning and spraying of orchards showed a decided need of such work over the county. The treating of seed oats for the prevention of smut, started earlier in the season, showed a decided advantage in the treated fields over those which were not treated. On the farm of G. F. Eberspaecher of Milford, in a fourteen - acre field, one-half of which was sown to treated, the other to untreated seed, the increase in yield in favor of the treated seed was 12 bushels per acre. The cost of material and labor was about 5 cents per acre for treating this oat seed. Finding that there has been in the past a great deal of trouble encountered in getting a good stand of alfalfa, it was thought beat to determine some of the methods employed. Twenty-four farmers arranged to cooperate in the seeding of alfalfa last fall with an aggre - gate of l,:i~o acres. On account of the very dry weather, seeding was postponed. It is hoped all of these men will cooperate in seeding next spring or fall. Eight farmers are cooperating on the time and the depth of plow - ing for winter wheat. Their results will be reported next year. At present, a record is being kept on the moisture content of fields that have been fall plowed and on some that have been spring plowed. Twelve demonstrations were carried on in regard to the vaccina - tion of hogs for cholera. In these herds there were something over 600 hogs. Where serum alone was used and the work done in time, i. e., before many of the hogs were sick, the loss was a trifle over 18 per cent. Where virus and serum both were used on healthy herds, the loss was about 3 per cent. One case of serum alone and one case where the simultaneous method was used gave bad results. A large number of herds were found with cholera during the summer, and steps were taken to check the spread of the disease. From reports sent in from other parts of the country it would seem that this county has been unfortunate in having more than its share of bad results. On the whole, however, the use of serum has proved very effective in checking the spread of hog cholera. The value of the silo and the advisability of increasing the amount of live stock on the farm have been encouraged as much as possible. A number of meetings have been held in the county for the discussion of the silo, and many silos were erected the past season. Undoubt - edly many more will be erected next year. The demonstrator gave assistance in planning and constructing four pit silos during the sum - mer. All the pit silos have proved satisfactory. In parts of the county, dairying seems best adapted, while in other parts, beef breeds have been encouraged. Several herds of dairy cattle have been tested for production of butter fat. These tests have shown the profitable and the unprofitable cows. The demonstrator has tried to encourage the breeding of a better grade of live stock for the average farm and has aided in the selection for various members of the association — two male hogs, one bure bred Holstein sire, one pure bred Guernsey sire, one pure bred Shorthorn sire, and seven Holstein cows. The selection and the care of seed corn were given much attention, and, because of the shortage of seed corn this year, this has been a live subject. Fully M per rent of the farmers had selected their seed corn this year before the first killing frost. </seg>

For the teachers who are teaching agriculture in the schools, we have planned to hold during the spring an Agricultural Institute to aid in outlining and getting elementary agricultural work before the pupils in the best manner possible. It is planned to reach and address as many schools as possible and to hold some field days in the spring. when several schools can get together and go out with the demonstrator to identify trees, weeds, and insects; to study plant diseases, the care trchards, gardens, and field crops, and the judging of live stock. Demonstrations will be carried on in many phases of farm work. including the pruning and spraying of orchards, the rolling of winter wheat, and the smut treatment of oat seed. It is hoped also that many members will cooperate in the seeding of alfalfa as well as in the top- dressing of crops with straw and manure. The above are a number of the things which will demand your demonstrator's attention for the coming year. Much of his time will also be spent in answering calls on specific things. The more he is called the more he will feel that he is of service to the members of this association. Yours very truly. A. H. BECKHOFF. STATISTICAL REPORT FOR SEWARD COUNTY Total 6 mo. Av. per mo.

            <seg id="p013">13 Walthill, Thurston County, Dec. 31, 1913. To the Members: The Thurston County Farm Management Association was organ- ized at the Walthill Farmers' Institute in February, 1913. Thurston county is, agriculturally speaking, a new county. Most of the land is tenanted because much of it is owned by the Omaha and the Winne - bago Indians. All of it has been allotted, but the Department of the Interior still has supervision over much of the land, — patents being issued when the Indians qualify for full citizenship rights. When these patents are issued, the land soon passes into the hands of the white men. I'nder the Indian ownership, the rented lands are prac - tically unimproved with the exception of the shacks and sheds built by the renters. The rents have been very low until recently; and the tendency was to farm extensively. The work of demonstration began May 1. The season was rather late and backward. I was unacquainted with the farmers who had already planned their field operations for the year. Accordingly it was difficult to do much work in crop improvement. We managed, however, to start some comparative tests with corn, scattering these demonstrations over the county on different farms. Some variety tests showed that the shipped in. or imported seed, yielded a few bushels more corn but that it was immature. Fred Griffith, Walthill, N'ebr., comparing home grown native seed corn with large Reid's Yel - low Dent from Iowa secured 11 bushels more from the Iowa corn by measure but only 2 bushels increase by weight. The imported corn was immature. Mr. Sam Wilson, Walthill, Nebr., received 51 bushels per acre by measure of well matured corn from the native seed and 61 bushels per acre of rather immature corn from the large Iowa Reid's Yellow Dent. In planting, the deep listing proved to give better yields than did the surface planting, and the furrow opening. D. A. McQuistan, Walt - hill, Nebr., on bottom ground that was fall plowed, put in corn in the following three ways with the accompanying results: Drilled, or surface planted 28 bushels per acre. Furrow-opened, (small disks) 30 bushels per acre. Listing, (rather shallow) 32 bushels per acre. In the cultivation experiments, the value of harrowing in listed corn and the advantages of shallow cultivation in laying-by were very evident. The following results were secured by Wm. Wingett. Walthill, Nebr. In listed corn cared for in the usual way with "go-devil" and cultivator, the yield was 31 bushels. Another portion of the field was harrowed once after the corn had been gone over twice with the "go - devil" and last time thru, was given a deep cultivation, yielding 34 bushels. The third portion was treated the same as the second except the las.t cultivation was shallow. The yield in this portion was 37 bushels. All conditions were identical except the methods compared. A comparison of plots with stalks burned off as compared with those left on did not show much difference this year. Future years should show the results. To encourage further corn improvement, a corn Bhow was held at five different towns in the county. The winning exhibits were brought together at a county show, and the priie win- ners of the county show were sent down to the state show. Arrangements have been made with the Indian agencies to help improve the Indian lands and conserve the soil fertility. Thi« pertains especially to longer term leases, seeding of 20 to 25 per cent to alfalfa or tame grass, the checking of ditch washing, and the filling of ditches. </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 Since the land is rolling, the hilltops lose their organic matter. We are attempting to restore this by manuring. — spreading that which conies from the stables, and by growing heavy yielding leguminous crops, such as sweet clover, cowpeas, and alfalfa. These clay points are filled with lime. A little humus added gives excellent results. Alfalfa, as a whole, is comparatively new. and many farmers are un- familiar with curing and putting it up. 1 feel confident that much has been done to help improve the quality of the hay by raking and stack- ing before it is allowed to become too dry. In horticultural work, the demonstrator's assistance has been called for in setting out some orchards, and in showing how to prune. I have found considerable disease in some orchards. Much more work will be devoted to orchards next year. Most of my time has been given to fighting hog cholera. Sanitary measures are emphasized and closely watched, such as the proper dis- posal of carcasses. Under the immediate direction of the association. 4.787 head of hogs have been inoculated by the serum methods, and 85 per cent of these have been saved. Boys have been encouraged in the Acre Corn Contest, and I find much inquiry among the young people regarding agricultural educa- tion. Several are taking courses now in our State University school t college of agriculture, and many more are making plans. Editors of seven local papers of the county are cooperating by giving considerable space each week to articles relating to agricultural Many inquiries for corn have reached me. I have directed most of these to grain companies of the county, and am informed of much Thurston county corn reaching parts of the state suffering from a short crop. Excellent cooperation exists everywhere, and the organization which has been rather localized, is being extended at the wishes of those farmers who were not formerly members, but who are willing to cooperate and make the work of demonstration county wide.

S3 FINANCIAL KEPORTtt. Since this work has not been carried on a full consecutive year in any county in this state it is impossible to give an accurate state- ment of the cost of maintaining a demonstrator. From the expenses incurred up to January 1. 1914, an estimated cost is given of maintain- ing demonstration work in each of the counties. In the second and consecutive years the cost of maintaining the work will undoubtedly be increased'. There will be the raise of salary </seg>
