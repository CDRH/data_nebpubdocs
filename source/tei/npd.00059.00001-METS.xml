            <seg id="p011">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 11 CASES BEFORE THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION Corn Case, In our 1924 report reference was made to I. C. C. Docket No. 16322, a complaint which had been filed by this Commission with the Interstate Commerce Commission attacking rates on corn when moving from Nebraska points through Superior to destinations in Kansas and Oklahoma. As advised in our report, this case was set down for hearing at Lincoln, on March 2, 1925. Examiner Weaver heard the case. The St. Joseph Grain Exchange, the Kansas City Board of Trade, the Superior Traffic Association and the Public Utilities Commission of Kansas intervened, the Superior Traffic Asso - ciation and the Public Utilities Commission of Kansas in support of our complaint and the St. Joseph Grain Exchange and the Kansas City Board of Trade on behalf of the defendants. The carriers named as defendants were well represented. On August 19, 1925, Examiner Weaver submitted a tentative report suggesting that the complaint be dismissed. We filed exceptions to the proposed report as did also the Superior Traffic Association and the case has been set down for oral argument before the Interstate Commerce Commission at Wash - ington, and it is the hope of this Commission that the proposed report will be rejected and that the Interstate Commerce Commission will give us the relief sought for in the complaint. Class and Commodity Rates. As mentioned in our last report, the Omaha Chamber of Com - merce filed a formal complaint with the Interstate Commerce Com - mission attacking the proposed class and commodity rates suggested by that body on traffic moving from points east of the Illinois-Indiana state line to Omaha and other Missouri River cities. This case was known as I. C. C. Docket No. 16226. The scope of this case has been materially broadened. The Lincoln Chamber of Commerce has inter - vened and their petition has been given a sub number to the original docket. The Kansas City Chamber of Commerce has filed a like com - plaint which has been assigned to I. C. C. Docket 16913. This case has been consolidated with Docket 16226. Traffic organizations from all parts of the country have been permitted to intervene and from the data on file this case apparently is going to develop into a real class rate scrap and will probably affect the entire class rate adjustment in the Western Trunk Line territory. This docket was originally E;ned for hearing on July 1, 1925, at Omaha, before Examiner ers, but later was postponed to a date which has not as yet been itely fixed. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT In connection with our reference in the last report to the class rate adjustment in Nebraska, which is now known as I. C. C. Docket No. 14625, it might be well to state that, as yet, no definite date has been Bet for this hearing on account of other cases on the docket of the Interstate Commerce Commission. The Commission had hoped to be able to make a very favorable report on this case by the end of 1925 but under the conditions it will be impossible to make any re - port other than that we are still working on the case. Along this same line, however, we have authorized the cancellation of Nebraska Classification No. 1 and have permitted the carriers to put into effect Western Classification No. 4 in lieu thereof which order was issued Eer our Application 4934 and made the change effective as of April 1925. The Commission however, made a few reservations which known as exceptions to the Classification and will be found in d's Western Trunk Line Circular 17-E. Sugar Case, This case known as I. C. C. Docket No. 16341 came on for hear - ing March 3, 1925, at Lincoln, as indicated in our previous report. A number of witnesses presented testimony, some being in favor ot the requested adjustment and others opposed. Briefs were submitted and a tentative decision handed down by Examiner Weaver in which he found that the rates from the so-called Omaha-Lincoln-Fremont differential territory except Crawford and Scottsbluff, were not un - reasonable or otherwise unlawful. The Commission immediately filed exceptions to this report and requested oral argument. The case Eset down for argument November 17, 1925, but was later post - d to January 29, 1926, at which time it is the hope of the Com - ion that the tentative report of the examiner will be reversed and a favorable decision will be entered by the Commission. Coal Case. Referring to our 1924 report in connection with the coal case known as I. C. C. Docket No. 14855. On May 4, 1925, the Interstate Commerce Commission handed down its decision with the findings that the rates on coal from Colorado and northern New Mexico pro - ducing districts to Missouri River points and destinations In Kansas. Nebraska and Western South Dakota were unreasonable to a certain extent and prescribed maximum reasonable rates for the future. The result of this decision was to reduce the rates somewhat, especially In the southwest portion of the state. No order was entered but the carriers were given ninety days in which to file tariffs covering the suggested adjustment in the findings. Somewhat later the carriers </seg>
            <seg id="p013">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 13 filed tariffs carrying the proposed adjustment and shippers that the Commission was in touch with seemed to be fully satisfied with the rates now in effect. Coal Case. In our previous report we mentioned the fact that the Illinois Coal Traffic Bureau had filed a complaint with the Interstate Com - merce Commission attacking the rates on steam coal from points in Illinois to various territories but had asked permission to withdraw their complaint. This the Interstate Commerce Commission per - mitted them to do and on July 15, 192 5, the same bureau filed a complaint with the Interstate Commerce Commission complaining of the unjust, unreasonable and discriminatory practices, descriptions and rates applicable to bituminous coal from the state of Illinois to interstate destinations in Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas and other points and asked that the Interstate Commerce Commission define what is a proper description and basis on the various preparations of coal as between domestic and steam coal sizes and that a proper rate relation as between the various sizes be established and for such further relief as to the Commission seemed proper. It is the intention of the Ne - braska Commission to intervene in this case feeling that the shippers of Nebraska have an interest therein and should be represented. At this time no definite date has been set for the hearing. Ex Parte 87. Ex Parte 87 was a petition filed in April, 1925, with the Inter - state Commerce Commission by 59 roads comprising the carriers In the Western District in which they asked for an increase in revenues amounting to about 5 per cent which would permit the carriers to receive a sufficient revenue to yield a net return of 5.75% on their property, the carriers contending that the structure of class rates in Western Trunk Line territory was up on a depressed level and out of harmony with rate levels in territories contiguous thereto. Carriers further indicated that the present class rate structures were not on a uniform basis of relationship as between classes. In passing, it might be well to state that this same petition has been filed with the Nebraska Commission requesting that they be given an increase in class rates. The first hearing to be held on the Interstate case waa in September at Chicago. There have been several hearings since September and apparently the hearings will continue into the first part of 1926. The rate department of the Commission contemplates the Introduction of statistics and other information to prove that the carriers now enjoy a fair return on freight traffic. This case hat been consolidated with I. C. C. Docket 17000. </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT The Hoch-Smith Resolution. The Hoch-Smith Resolution passed by Congress required the Interstate Commerce Commission to institute a general investigation upon its own motion relative to the adjustment in the rate structure of the country so as to promote the freedom of movement by common carriers of the products of agriculture, including livestock. The Interstate Commerce Commission, under date of March 12, set this matter down for investigation, indicating that as far as possible it would avail itself of the assistance and cooperation of state authori - ties possessing rate-making powers and also the assistance of shippers and carriers. The title of this proceeding is "Rate Structure Investi - gation," I. C. C. Docket 17000. Everyone was given a chance to file briefs discussing the proper interpretation of the Hoch-Smith resolu - tion, such briefs to be filed not later than May 15, 1925. All of the state commissions agreed in view of the cooperative nature of the proceedings that it would be inadvisable for them to act as advocates in this case. Arrangements were made whereby rate experts and ac - countants in the employ of various commissions might participate in I case by preparing data that would seem helpful in determining the es. At a meeting of the executive board" of the National Associa - of Railway Commissioners, a committee consisting of nine rate ;rts was appointed to present testimony on behalf of all coramis - s, from this nine, three to be specially designated to sit under the ction of Director Hardie of the statistical department of the Inter - e Commerce Commission and will probably be required to devote a considerable amount of time to this service. Later, President Ainey of the National Association of Railway Commissioners, realizing the vast experience of Mr. U. G. Powell, rate expert for the Nebraska State Railway Commission, and the valuable information collected by him in various Interstate Commerce Commission cases, felt that it was almost imperative that he be placed on this committee sitting under Director Hardie and, accordingly, appointed Mr. Powell on this com - mittee of three, enlarging same to include four. The personnel of this committee consisted of O. O. Calderhead, Supervisor of Trans - portation, Department of Public Works, State of Washington; P. E. Fickenscher, Chief of Bureau, Public Service Commission, State of Pennsylvania; J. H. Alldredge, Chief Rate Expert, Public Service Commission, State of Alabama, and U. G. Powell, Rate Expert, Ne- R:a State Railway Commission, State of Nebraska. This Corn - on put a force to work gathering information and the exhibits y developed will be presented the first part of the year. Hear - on this investigation began at Chicago, in September. ThU ises to be possibly one of the greatest rate cases ever investigated te Interstate Commerce Commission. The papers have carried reference to this case at different times. The Commission feels that it is not necessary to devote more space to enlarging on what haa </seg>

Complainant contends further that defendant has discriminated its charges for service in that it charges certain subscribers at the rate of $15 per year and other subscribers receiving the same service at the rate of $12 per year, and that upon his refusal to pay $15 in the face of such discrimination his service was discontinued and his telephone disconnected. He also contends that certain subscribers are charged reduced rates on the theory that they own the portion of the line which connects their telephone with the main line or central office, and that such practice is discriminatory and should be discon - tinued. Hearing on this matter was had at Hastings June 18, 1924. As has been stated in previous discussions of the Glenwood Tele - phone Company's affairs, its organization is so loose and its manage - ment so haphazard that it is at times difficult to know just what practices are being followed. In December, 1917, the Commission </seg>
            <seg id="p129">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 129 issued an order requiring the Glenwood Telephone Company at all of its exchanges to charge a uniform rate for service to both stockholders and non-stockholders. On January 27, 1921, however, the Bladen exchange was authorized to modify that schedule so as to permit a discount of 25c per month to all subscribers who own and maintain their own telephone instrument. This is the rate legally on file in this office, and in effect at the present time and at the time of the filing of the instant complaint. It appears, however, that the Bladen dis - trict has never complied with this schedule. On the contrary it has charged all subscribers, both those owning their own instruments and those who received service through instruments owned by the com - pany, the same rate, viz.: $15 per year. Apparently it was the under - standing of the officers and stockholders that the rebate of $3.00 per year applied only to non-stockholders and that as to stockholders it could be allowed or not as the financial condition of the company Justified.- It appears from the record that one year the $3.00 was returned to stockholders more as a dividend than as a rebate. At other times it was decided at the stockholders meetings to retain the money and use it in repairs or betterments to the property. The rate as published does not warrant the company in assessing $15 per year to those subscribers who own their own telephone. In such cases the charge should be only $12 per year, the allowance being made at time of payment. Hereafter the company should rigidly adhere to this rule. If the revenues of the district are not sufficient to pay the running expenses and maintenance of the plant, the rates should be increased. It is not within the power of the stockholders to modify rates at annual meetings. This matter has been repeatedly explained to this company. In one instance (Resolution No. 62 14 N. S. R. C. 522-525) the Guide Rock district was cited to appear and show cause why it had increased its rates without securing authority from the Commission. The practice complained of in this case is tantamount to an increase of rates on those subscribers who own their own telephones. The director of the district, who is the local manager, justifies his refusal to allow the rebate by saying that he had no money in the treasury, and that if he had did not have authority from the stockholders to pay it out, particularly at those times when the stockholders had di - rected that the money be used for other purposes. The financial condition of the district is probably such that re - funds cannot be made to those subscribers who have paid the full $15 per year when they were entitled to a rate of $12 per year. The company should understand, however, that hereafter they have author - ity to charge only the legal rate on file with the Commission. A few of the subscribers, some eight or ten in number, enjoy a 5 </seg>
            <seg id="p130">EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 130 rate of $4.00 per year for service on residence telephones which are extensions from the main station, the wire, a portion of the poles and the instruments being owned by the subscriber. This is a practice of long standing, originating with the early days of the district. For instance, a banker having a telephone at the regular rate in his bank. builds a line from the bank to his residence, paying for the materials and thereafter maintaining that portion of the property. In such cases the company has been assessing a charge of $4.00 per year for this extension service. The residence telephones are in all cases con - nected through the main station with the central office and can re - ceive service to the same extent as any other telephone on the system. No rate has ever been filed for this service. Informally, the Commis - sion has approved the practice as not being discriminatory. While probably not unduly discriminatory it is of very doubtful propriety and the company would do much better to purchase the telephones and Instruments from the parties involved and assess the regular rate. In some instances, the company has assessed a rate of $4.00 to farmers who purchased the telephone and built the stub line to con - nect with the main farm lead. There appears to have been no justi - fication for this, since under the methods of construction all farmers built their stub lines, regardless of distance. Under the rates as now filed such farmer, if he owns the telephone instrument, would be entitled to a rate of $12 per year. As stated in the foregoing, com- Inant in this case has sustained his complaint in so far as establish - the fact that this company has been departing from its published i. We are of the opinion, however, that he has not been individu - discriminated against. If he still so desires he will be entitled i restoration of the service by the payment in advance of $12 per -, the record showing that he owns his own telephone instrument, company should reconnect him upon the payment of the rental should continue to furnish service to him at the legally published ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Bladen district of the Glenwood Telephone Company be, and the same is hereby, required at once to cease and desist from its practice of varying its charges for service from the rates legally on file with this Commission, viz.: $15 per year, except to those subscribers owning their own instruments to whom a discoust of 25c per month shall be allowed. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that defendant shall reinstate the complainant, John W. Koons, and continue to furnish him service at the rate of $12 per year as long as he complies with the legal rates and regulations. </seg>

Browne, Chairman. Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. (SEAL) August \V. Oye, et a!., Complainant, v. Glenwood Telephone Company, Defendant. Appearances For the complainant, A. M. Walters. For the defendant, C. T. Austin. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: Max Benker, John Oberlie, Harm Hoopen, George Rose, John Mulder, John E. Benker, Frank Barton, Dirk Hoppen and August W. Oye are patrons of the Rosemont exchange of the Glenwood Telephone Company. All of them are served by a farm line about five and one - half miles long which connects with the switchboard in Rosemont. The Rosemont exchange serves about 80 subscribers but has con - nection with all of the other exchanges of the Glenwood system. The subscribers above named complain of the service rendered to them by the Rosemont exchange. They also make complaint concerning certain features of internal management concerning which this Com - mission has no jurisdiction. All of them are stockholders of the Glenwood Telephone Company. The burden of their complaint is that for two years prior to the filing of the complaint in this case they were unable to signal the central operator and for much of the time were unable to talk satisfactorily over the lines even when the connection was put up by the operator. At one time they declined to pay their annual rental because of this alleged failure to secure service. The management discontinued their service but the rental which had been deposited in the bank was released by the subscribers and service resumed FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 501 </seg>
            <seg id="p132">132 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT within two days. At the hearing complainants testified in considerable detail as to occasions and circumstances under which it has been impossible for them to signal the operator and secure a good talking circuit. They insist that the trouble is in the switchboard which they contend is too old for good service. They also say that the line by which they are served is not in good condition, particularly a certain section of it. The director of the district and local manager of the exchange testified that while the switchboard is not new, having been secured from a neighboring company second-hand, it had been over - hauled by a competent line man and is in good condition. He stated also that new wire had been strung for the line serving complainants with the exception of about one mile and that it was his intention to complete the replacement of that section at an early date. The man - ager does practically all of the line work in that district but is unable to climb poles and has to use a ladder for that purpose. He has had limited experience in telephone work and cannot make repairs to instruments or switchboard except they are of the very simplest nature. In this connection it should be stated that the telephone instruments of complainants are owned by them and their repair and maintenance are not under the supervision of the company. These instruments are about tyenty years old and are of more than one make. The lineman for the Glenwood Telephone Company at Blue Hill testified that he had been called by the Rosemont manager to make an inspection of the switchboard and also of the telephones of com - plainant subscribers; that he did so and found the switchboard in fair condition, capable of rendering as good service to complainants as to any of the other subscribers on the exchange. He found a num- I' of the telephone instruments to be in poor repair, replaced two nsmitters and some cords. It was his opinion that complainants mid be able to get through to central and should also be able to k satisfactorily to the subscribers on the Rosemont exchange. He ted that the lack of uniformity in the type and make of telephone truments had considerable to do with the signalling of the operator and the transmission of messages. Subsequent to the hearing a representative of the Commission's engineering department visited Rosemont, examined the switchboard and drove over the line in question. His report is that the switch - board is very old but that it is in good condition throughout; that all cords and plugs are new and that the plugs fit the jacks with very little evidence of wear. He says also that line 32, which is the one involved in this complaint, originally had No. 14 iron wire conductor but that withi.i the past year this has been replaced with No. 12 iron wire conductor except for a branch line one mile in length which is still No. 14 wire. On this mile he found two poor connections an«i one where trees were interfering badly. The manager promised to </seg>
            <seg id="p133">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 133 make repairs on this line immediately. The Commission's representa - tive made a number of test calls on the line and through the board and found the line and switchboard to be operating efficiently. This report was submitted to attorney for complainants and he takes issue with its findings, stating that the service had not been improved; that the manager had made no repairs to the line following the visit ot the engineer and demanding further improvements. It is the opinion of the Commission, based on the testimony of all parties in this record, that the service rendered to complainants U not first-class but that it is as good as that furnished to all the other subscribers on the exchange. All of the equipment, both that owned by the company and by the subscribers, is old. It is, of course, grounded magneto type and considerably out of date. Up to date modern service cannot be expected from it. The rates charged, how - ever, are considerably below the average in the state. It is probable, therefore, that the subscribers are receiving all that they pay for. Apparently the majority of them are satisfied with what they get. It is manifest that the condition of complainants' instruments may have very much to do with the character of service rendered. The section of the line referred to doubtless had something to do with im - pairing the service and the management should at once proceed to make repairs if it has not already done so. The switchboard is old and will require very careful attention if it is to give satisfactory service. The company should have a competent lineman go over the board at stated intervals to see that it is kept in a good state of re - pair. Complainants should also see that their instruments are either replaced or improved if their service is not satisfactory. At one point in the testimony a controversy developed as to whether or not the manager had allowed a discount for prompt pay - ment of the annual rental. The company should understand that it has no discount on file with the Commission and is not authorized to charge other than the filed rate of $15 per year. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the complaint herein be dismissed with the exception that the Rosemont exchange of the Glenwood Telephone Company be and the same hereby is required, if it has not already done so. to at once repair the portion of line 32 which is referred to above, replacing the No. 14 iron wire with No. 12 iron wire so as to make the wire conductor uniform throughout the entire line. Within thirty days of the date of this order the manager of the Rosemont exchange shall make report to the Com - mission as to the performance of the requirement herein made. </seg>
            <seg id="p134">EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 134 Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this seventeenth day of January, 1925. NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Thome A. Browne, Chairman. Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. (SEAL) FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 5O2 Comstock Independent Telephone Company, Complainant, v. Crownover Telephone Company, Defendant. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner Section 7091, Laws of Nebraska 1923, or such portion as affects this case is as follows: "All long distance telephone rates in this state shall be based on air line mileage between points. Of any toll charge, at least 15 per cent shall go to the company where calls originated and 10 per cent to the company where message terminated, and the balance of such charge shall be divided between the different companies over whose lines and through whose stations it passed. etc.****and then it shall be the duty of the Commission to divide the amount of the charges for the different messages according to the provisions herein made and collect and deliver to each company its just share after taking out a sufficient amount for the actual expense of making' such a clearing as herein stated." Prior to 1923 this section was the same as quoted except that the words "at least" occurring before "15 per cent" in the third line were omitted. The effect of this amendment was to make the com - pensation for toll terminal service a minimum of 15 per cent on out - going messages and 10 per cent on in-coming messages. Upon com - plaint of any terminal company, the amount could be increased by agreement or by submitting the same to the Commission. The complainant in this case, the Comstock Independent Tele - phone Company, operates a small exchange with headquarters at Comstock. Aside from a portion of a line which it owns between Comstock and Arcadia, the company has no toll lines. A toll line from Sargent, nine miles northwest, connects with complainant's exchange and is owned by the Crownover Telephone Company ot </seg>
            <seg id="p135">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 135 Sargent. Complainant makes connection with this line at a point about one mile from its switchboard. The greater portion of the traffic over this line is that originating at Comstock or Sargent although some messages for Broken Bow, Taylor, Bur well and a few other points are handled over the line. For its general toll con - nection east, south and west, complainant is served by the North - western Bell Telephone Company through a connection at Loup City. The greater portion of its toll business is via this route. A flat rate of ten cents per message is in effect between Comstock and Sargent over the line in question. Under the statutory division, complainant thus receives 1 Vz cents for each out-bound message and one cent on each in-bound message. Traffic each way is about equal, with in-bound messages slightly preponderating. In the handling of traffic over this line, complainant is required to make a ticket for each out-bound message, collect all accounts and guarantee payment of same, keep account of traffic handled and charges accruing, furnish equipment in switchboard office and line to point of connection and provide necessary operators for handling the calls. For the use of equipment from the back of the switchboard to and including the subscribers' instrument, there is an undefined but recognized allowance in exchange rates. The service performed on in-bound messages is not so extensive. Not so much of the operator's time is consumed, collections are made by the originating company usually and the accounting is less extensive. As a substitute for the minimum compensation provided by statute, complainant asks for 40 per cent on out-going messages and a continuation of the 10 per cent on in-coming calls. At the time of the first hearing complainant had made no study whatever of the cost of handling toll traffic. He could not even make estimates as to the cost per message. He was convinced that he was not receiving money enough for the services performed but could furnish very little reason for his conclusion. At the request of the Commission, there - fore, he attempted to make a "peg count" of both exchange and toll messages for a short period, from which it was thought a ratio for the division of expense as between toll and exchange might be determined. By extending the result of this "peg count" for a period of a year the total number of messages was found to be 140,880. The total mes - sages between Comstock and Sargent for a like period would be 3100. The ratio, therefore, of the Comstock-Sargent calls to the total is 2.2 per cent. The property of complainant and his expenses were divided on this basis. As a result of this method a cost of 3.7 cents per message to the Comstock company is developed. The period of time covered by the "peg count" was too short to make the study reliable. The relationship between the exchange </seg>
            <seg id="p136">136 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT calls and toll calls over the line in question might fluctuate very materially at different seasons of the year. This fluctuation would affect the calculation as to cost. The study indicates, however, that the compensation now received is somewhat insufficient. It should be remembered that the study takes no account of Broken Bow business on which there is a minimum accrual to complainant of 5 cents and t cents per call on out-going and in-coming calls respectively, nor i it include traffic to other points where the rate is higher and the mission would correspondingly be greater. If the percentages asked for by the complainant, namely, 40 per cent on out-going and 10 per cent on in-coming, were applied to the business for September, October and November, 1924, it would result as follows: As contrasted with this amount, complainant actually received com - missions of $11.06. For the months of July, August, September, October and Novem - ber, 1923, for which figures are available, complainant would have realized as terminal compensation $33.94 on out-going and $9.02 on in-coming traffic, or a total of $42.96 out of a gross business of $175.05. On the present basis, he actually received $22.28. Complainant is satisfied with the compensation received from the business handled by the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company. This business involves on the average much longer hauls and corres - pondingly greater charges per message so that the commission is considerably greater in proportion to the number of messages handled. If there were common ownership of all toll lines with which com - plainant is connected, it might very well be argued that the larger compensation received on long haul business would offset any losses that might accrue on short haul traffic and that the average would probably result in a reasonable compensation on the whole. We are r routed in this particular case, however, with a relationship exist - between the terminal company and a toll line company where only short haul business is involved. If our conclusion is correct that this short haul business at the present time is being handled by com - plainant at a loss, it follows that the Crownover Telephone Company is the beneficiary of the arrangement. Whether the statute con - templates a segregation of ownership of toll lines and a distribution of compensation that will be equitable in each instance, appears to be a matter of considerable doubt. It is certain, however, that complain- tevenue, out-bound, $49.40 at 40 per cent $19.76 tevenue, in-bound, $51.55 at 10 per cent 5.15 'otal compensation $24.91 </seg>
            <seg id="p137">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 137 ant has but little opportunity to compensate itself for loss on the short haul business on this particular line, since the Crownover com - pany handles such a fractional portion of such traffic. We are by no means certain of the accuracy of the cost study made in this case. We are of the opinion, however, that on the parti - cular business involved, complainant is not being properly com - pensated. Having in view, therefore, the uncertain character of the evidence and the fact that it does not take into account any of the long haul messages transmitted over this line, we are of the opinion that the allowance asked for by the complainant is excessive and that a commission of 25 per cent on out-going messages with 10 per cent on in-coming messages would be reasonable. Applied to the business for the months of September, October and November, 1924, this would produce a commission of $12.35 on outgoing and $5.15 on in-coming, or a total of $17.50 for the three months period. This is equivalent to slightly over 2% cents per message. Shortly after this complaint was filed defendant asked that the hearing be postponed for several months. This was agreed to by complainant on condition that any adjustment made by the Com - mission should be dated back to the time of filing complaint. For this reason hearing was not had in the matter until November, 1924. It would appear reasonable, therefore, that adjustment on the basis to be prescribed be made back to the date of the filing of the com - plaint, which was February 25, 1924. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that on all toll business over the line of the Crownover Telephone Company between Sargent and Comstock originating and terminating on the switchboard of the Comstock Independent Telephone Company the said Crownover Tele - phone Company be and the same hereby is directed and required to allow to the said Comstock Independent Telephone Company a com - mission for- terminal service of 25 per centum of the charge on out - going messages and 10 per centum of the charge on In-coming mes - sages, said division or allowance to be made effective on and after March 1, 1924.

Appearances : For complainant, F. P. Voter, attorney. For defendant, Wymer Dressier, attorney. RANDALL, Commissioner: This complaint was made by Mary A. Lewis, owner of the east half of the southwest quarter of section 30 and the northwest quarter of section 31 in township 29, north of range 3, east, Cedar county. The complainant complains that the Chicago, St. Paul, Minne - apolis &amp; Omaha Railway company crosses the east half of the south - west quarter of said section 30, commencing at a point approximately ten rods north of the southeast quarter of said premises, thence in a northwesterly direction to a point on the west side thereof, approxi- Eily sixty rods north of the south line thereof, so that the said ilses are divided by said railroad in such manner that about y acres thereof lie to the south of said railroad and approximately acres to the north thereof, that the buildings occupied by the complainant consisting of a large dwelling, barns, sheds, outbuildings, groves and a complete system of waterworks are situated upon the thirty-acre tract to the south of said railroad, that the part of said premises lying to the north of said railroad is all bottom land and is suitable for pasture and hay purposes almost exclusively, that the defendant railroad for approximately thirty years has maintained said railroad across the above described premises, during all of which time it has maintained a culvert or bridge over a steep valley which is formed to the south and under said railroad, and this bridge or culvert was so constructed and maintained as to afford to the owner of said premises a runway for stock at all times, that the said bridge or culvert so constructed and maintained was more than seven feet above the low point of ground and provided a clear space for the passage of horses, cattle and hogs, and that the space so provided was capable of being divided and was divided by a fence so that the stock of plaintiff could be turned into different fields and pastures and kept separate at all times. Hearing was had on this complaint in the city Hall at Laurel, Nebraska, April 6, 1925. It was shown by undisputed testimony that the statements made by complainant in the formal complaint were </seg>
            <seg id="p139">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 139 substantially correct, that a trestle was put in place by the railroad company at the time the road was constructed, as shown by exhibit 1. Said trestle was a four-span trestle, and was built by said de - fendant company for the purpose of a waterway under said railway, and had also been used by the owner of the land as a passageway for stock from the south side to the north side of the farm. This trestle or bridge had become deteriorated to such an extent that it became necessary for the defendant railroad company to reconstruct it or replace it with a concrete structure, and in the summer of 1924 the defendant company placed a reenforced concrete tube 84 inches in diameter in the center of the opening under the railroad track and filled up the balance of the opening under the track so that this passage way was reduced in size but left sufficient opening to carry off the flood water and could be used by the complainant for a stock pass under the tracks to the pastures on the north side of the track, but could not be subdivided for different classes of stock as had here - tofore been done by complainant as the wide trestle was filled up. There is no question but that the wide trestle with the division as had been used by the complainant was more serviceable to the com - plainant, but it is also true that the present 8 4-inch reenforced con - crete tube gives ample passage way for stock to pass from the south side to the north side of the farm and also to carry off the flood waters. Complainant asks for an additional underground pass of sufficient size for brood sows and pigs to pass under the track from the pasture on the south side to the pasture on the north side. This undoubtedly would be a very great convenience to the complainant, but according to Section 5527 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, the Railway Commission is powerless to require railroad companies to furnish different sized underground passes for different classes of stock. Section 5527 reads as follows: "Section 5527. LAND OWNERS TO HAVE ONE CROSSING. — Whenever any person owns land on both sides of the right-of-way of any railroad, such railroad shall provide and keep in repair at least one adequate means for such land owner to cross the right-of - way. Any interested land owner with land on both sides of the right - of-way of any railroad may file written complaint with the State Railway Commission against any such railroad that the crossing is not adequate or is unsafe and dangerous to the life and property of those who use the same, and the Commission thereupon shall make such investigation and hold such hearing as may be necessary, and shall issue such orders as it shall deem necessary, proper and adequate. If circumstances warrant the Commission may require overhead, under ground or grade crossings and require wing fences at underground crossings or may require existing crossings to be relocated so as to be safe to those who use them, but where such special crossings involves an expenditure of more than seven hundred ($700.00) </seg>

It was shown by the testimony of the complainant, and also the defendant, that defendant company has provided one adequate Erground passage way which is used jointly for drainage purposes a stock pass, and that it is adequate for all classes of stock to through and while it is not as convenient as the old trestle had for the complainant's use, yet it is sufficient for the passage of : of all sizes.

J. B. Driggs, assistant general freight agent. For the Commission, U. G. Powell, rate expert. FINDINGS AND ORDER BY THE COMMISSION: This matter came on for hearing on a formal complaint signed by the Moffitt Sand &amp; Gravel company bringing in review the carload rate in effect on carload shipments of sand and gravel from the Moffitt sand and gravel pit located on the Burlington between Ashland and South Bend, to Ashland. Complainant contends that it is discrim - inated against by the defendant because of it having established a rate of $9.00 per car from Lyman Richey sand pit located on defend - ant's line of road between Ashland and Melia to Ashland. The original petition was amended. Paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of the amended petition read as follows: J (4) "Complainant further shows that by order of the interstate Commerce Commission, dated August 26, 1921, a rate of $10.00 per car for the transportation of sand and gravel from pits ad - jacent to Ashland, Nebraska, to Ashland, Nebraska, was estab - lished; that pursuant to the order of this Commission in Appli - cation No. 4838, this rate was reduced 10 per cent. Defendant herein published the $10,000 per car rate, but wrongfully pub - lished the same specifically as being from Lyman Sand Pit to Ashland instead of generally from pits adjacent to Ashland. (5) By Application No. 5433 the defendant herein asked to cancel the rate of $9.00 per car applicable from Lyman Sand Pit to Ashland. No application was made for a general cancellation for the general rate fixed as herein before stated. (6) Following the order in Application No. 5433, the defendant continued to publish a rate of $9.00 per car from Lyman Sand Pit to Ashland, but denied to this applicant the benefit of such rate, notwithstanding the fact that the location of the sand and gravel pit of the complainant was similar to the location of the sand and gravel pit known as Lyman's Sand Pit." Complainant contends that the present rate from complainant's pit to Ashland is unreasonable and that $9.00 per car would be a reasonable rate. </seg>
            <seg id="p142">142 Complainant showed by testimony that under authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission in I. C. C. Docket 11829 dated Kjust 26, 1921, supplemented by an order of said Interstate Com - rce Commission dated September 26, 1921, defendant had estab - led per car rates on carload shipments of sand and gravel from pits acent to Central City to Central City at $10.00 per car; pits adjacent to Ashland to Ashland at $10.00 per car; pits adjacent to Endicott, to Endicott at $10.00 per car; pits adjacent to Bridgeport to Northport and Bridgeport, at $10.00 per car; pits adjacent to Columbus, to Columbus, at $15.00 per car; pits adjacent to Fremont, to Fremont, at $10.00 per car and that similar rates had been established by other railroads. Complainant further showed that under application of the de - fendant per car rates on carload shipments of sand and gravel have been authorized or ordered by the Commission from various mines to adjacent cities on lines of railroad other than the defendant herein; that at the time of hearing the defendant had received authority of the Commission to cancel the $9.00 per car rate on sand and gravel from Lyman Richey sand pit located between Ashland and Melia to Ashland; that per car rates had been established by the defendant for intra and inter-terminal switching service at the larger cities in Nebraska that required as much transportation service as the handling of carload shipments of sand and gravel from complainant's sand pit to Ashland at a charge lower than $9.00 per car; that the present rate on carload shipments of sand and gravel from complainant's pit to Ashland is 3 cents per 100 pounds or $30.00 per car for a 100, - 000 pounds capacity car. The defendant showed by testimony that the distance from the center of the depot at Ashland to the center of the Lyman Richey sand pit located between Ashland and Melia is 2.9 miles; that the distance from the center of the depot at Ashland to the center of Moffitt Spur located between Ashland and South Bend is 4.04 miles; that from the center of Moffltt Spur to South Bend is 3.39 miles; that the Western Sand &amp; Gravel Company's pit is a continuation of the west end of the house track at South Bend; that no shipments of sand or gravel have been made from the Lyman Richey sand pit east of Ashland for about three years prior to time of hearing; that the billing of all cars loaded at complainant's sand pit is done by the agent at Ashland; that the sand and gravel loaded at points between Ashland and Louisville is handled by a train known as "sand run" which train lays up at Ash - land and whose duty it is to set in the empties and take out the loads at all sand pits located between the stations of Ashland and Louis - ville; that the rates established by the Interstate Commerce Com - mission in said Commission's Docket 11829 was the result of the conference between Nebraska carriers, representative shippers of </seg>
            <seg id="p143">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 143 sand and gravel and a member of the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission. The following is quoted from defendant's Exhibit No. 5, being a portion of the petition for special order in I. C. C. Docket 11829: "Regarding the specific rates to Omaha, Lincoln and other points shown at variance with the distance scale, it is stated as to Omaha and Lincoln that the sand and gravel operations at the Platte River pits (Fremont, Valley, Cones Spur, Ashland, South Bend, Louisville, Meadow, Cedar Creek and La Platte) were established largely for the purpose of supplying material to the large consuming markets of Omaha and Lincoln, and the rates were carried on the same level from all of said sand pits to those points. To points other than Omaha and Lincoln the specific rates are proposed for the purpose of meeting wagon competition since the pits are situated close to consuming towns. To apply the distance scale of rates between all points in Ne - braska would operate to the disadvantage of some pits and to the undue advantage of others, and prevent the carriers meeting the competition of wagon hauls." That the Moffitt Sand &amp; Gravel Company was not operating a pit at the time the Interstate Commerce Commission's authority was entered in the aforesaid mentioned Docket 11829. CONCLUSIONS In the order of this Commission entered May 5, 1922, the Ne - braska Commission authenticated the rates then in effect on Ne - braska intrastate traffic on carload shipments of sand and gravel. Since that time either on formal complaint or motion of the Com - mission, rates on carload shipments of sand and gravel have been authorized by this Commission in one instance only as to this de - fendant on a per car rate basis. In the Morse Bluffs and Schuyler formal complaints we refused to extend the three-cent blanket rate beyond the zone originally authorized by the Commission. As to the discriminatory situation alleged in the petition, com - plainant appears to rely on the per car rates that have been established by the defendant between pits and adjacent cities at several points on its line, including the rate that was in effect from the Lyman Richey sand pit east of Ashland to Ashland, of $9.00 per car which rate the Commission authorized the defendant to cancel in August, 1924, be - cause no sand or gravel was being loaded at that pit. Moffit is included in the defendant's tariff which shows the dis - tances between all stations on its line in this state. Therefore, a movement of sand from Moffitt to Ashland is similar to a movement from Moffitt to any other station. Complainant attacks the reason - ableness of the charge of three cents per cwt. between Moffitt and </seg>
            <seg id="p144">144 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Ashland, but backs up that contention very largely by comparisons with situations which are not identical, in that they are per car rates from sand pits to adjacent stations where the pits are not named fn defendant's table of distances. If the rate of three cents per 100 pounds between Moffitt and Ashland is unreasonably high as a road haul proposition, it is equally too high on all other short distance transportation. Nothing in this record indicates where the line of demarcation should be between the present three-cent rate and some lower rate for the short hauls. A conclusion as to unreasonableness of the rate between Moffitt and Ashland would, under the testimony, have to apply equally on all other short haul transportation of sand. In other words, we are asked on this record to establish another zone within the first 50 mile zone of the scale now in effect, at a lower rate. It may be that the present rates are not proper for short haul transportation of sand and gravel. At the time the scale was first established, the Commission stated that it would reserve for the future careful consideration of the reasonableness of the scale, a considera - tion not possible at that time. This record does not warrant conclusions which would tend to break down the present rates for the first 50 mile zone. Only one carrier, defendant in this case, has had a chance to be heard. The Ele is state-wide in its application. If miners of sand, or their tomers, feel that the present scale is unreasonable, or discrim - tory, or both, the Commission stands ready promptly to consider the matter in a proceeding where all carriers now engaged in hauling sand and gravel in this state, may have an opportunity to be heard. For these reasons we find that the complaint should be dismissed. An order will be entered in accordance with these findings. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the petition herein be denied. Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this third day of July, 1S25.

            <seg id="p145">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 145 FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 515 August E. Holmberg, Plaintiff, v. Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway Company, Defendant. Appearances : For complainant, P. H. Peterson, attorney, For defendant, Wymer Dressier, attorney. OPINION AND FINDING RANDALL, Commissioner: Plaintiff filed his petition asking for a hearing before the Ne - braska State Railway Commission, praying for an underground cross - ing under the tracks of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway company, which tracks cross the plaintiff's quarter section farm diagonally from the southeast to the northwest corner. Hearing was held at Wausa on the 7th day of April, 1925, the plaintiff, A. E. Holmberg, being represented by P. H. Peterson, attorney, and the defendant, Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway company by Wymer Dressier, attorney. The evidence in this case shows that the plaintiff's residence, buildings, cattle sheds and watering facilities are all located on tin southwest corner of his farm, that the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Company's railroad runs across his farm from the southeast corner to the northwest corner, centrally across the quarter, that the complainant's pasture land all lies north and east of the railway right-of-way, and that by reason of the railroad's crossing plaintiff's farm he is compelled to drive his stock on the main highway from his corrals across the railroad track on the main highway and then to a point some distance east on the main highway to his pasture which runs across his quarter of land on the northeast side of the railroad track, that there are no watering facilities in this pasture and no other way of getting the stock to and from the pasture except around the public highway, which makes it necessary for the plaintiff to drive his stock nearly three quarters of a mile each way, which makes approximately a mile and a half each day that this stock has to be driven from the corrals to the pasture. During the pasturing season, in the warm summer months the stock has to be driven over this route during the noon hour of the day for the purpose of being watered and at night the stock has to be kept in the corral and there - fore have no feed during the night time, which causes the milch cows </seg>
            <seg id="p146">146 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT to shrink in their flow of milk to such an extent that it is a big damage to the complainant. Complainant is a man about sixty years of age. He testified that the only help he has on the farm is a daughter and that it necessitated his spending a large part of his time driving his cattle to and from this pasture and that every time he is required to cross the railroad track on the public highway, it greatly endangered not only the life of the stock being driven, but also the life of the complainant or of his daughter when driving the stock across this railroad track; that he has twenty-three head of cattle at the present time, and ninety head of hogs and at various times during the year he has more cattle and more hogs to care for on his farm. Eight head of his stock are milch cows at the present time, but if facilities for getting his stock to and from the pasture were more convenient he would keep at least fifteen head of milch cows. Owing to the milk shrinkage by reason of the milch cows having to lie in the corral all night, it is not profitable at the present time to keep more than the limited number of eight cows for milking purposes. It was shown by the testimony that the railroad company had provided a grade crossing at a point near to the northwest corner of quarter, but its location is such that it has never been used by the complainant for stock owing to the fact that it is situated in open fields on both sides of the right-of-way and 1b inconveniently located for the complainant. In going to and from his land on the northeast side of the track it is not much farther to go around the main road and obviate the opening and closing of gates, and the crossing is so situated that it cannot be used for driving the cattle to and from the pasture without passing through cultivated fields for a distance of nearly a half mile. At the point where complainant has asked for an underground pass there is a railroad grade of nine or ten feet in height, sufficiently high so that a suitable cattle pass as prayed for by the complainant, could be installed without any added expense to the railroad company of right-of-way construction other than installing of the cattle pass. Complainant testified that he is unable at the present time to run his hogs on the east side of his farm and that it was impractical and impossible for him to drive them around the road to the east side of his farm and thus he is unable to get any use of the land on the east Bide of the track so far as pasturing his hogs is concerned, but that with a stock pass under the track he would be able to run the hogs on the east side of the track in his stalk fields and thereby save the waste that under the present conditions he is required to sustain: that it is his intention to fence his entire farm hog-tight so that he might turn his stock into his corn field and obviate the necessity of </seg>
            <seg id="p147">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 147 husking his corn, which he could not do at the present time on account of not being able to run his hogs into his field on the east side of the track. The land used by the complainant on the east side of the track is low, soggy land and not fit for any other purpose but pasture, and the pasture extends diagonally clear across the east side of the farm parallel with the railroad track and there is quite a large cultivated field east of this pasture land which the complainant desires to run his stock in after the small grain is cut, or if into corn to run his cattle and hogs in the stalks. If the cattle pass as prayed for by the complainant is installed, complainant's stock could pass from the corral directly through under the track into the pasture and stubble and corn fields as complainant desired without being driven and could pass back to the corrals for water at any time they so desired, and in the evening after the milch cows had been milked they could go back into the pasture and feed in the night during the hot weather and fly season so that there would not be the loss to the complainant owing to shrinkage in the milk flow. It was further shown by the testimony that in case complainant was away from home during the day that it was necessary for him to hire extra help to drive the stock to and from the pasture, when if this pass were constructed as prayed for this trouble and expense would be entirely eliminated. The defendant company filed exhibit No. 2, which shows sub - stantially the conditions as described by the complainant in his testi - mony as to the location of the railroad and cultivated ground, but shows that part of the land which is now contained in the pasture was used for hay meadow up to two years ago. At the present time U is all used for pasture land as the complainant has increased the number of head of stock he keeps and it became necessary to throw the entire ground into pasture in order to give him sufficient pasture land. The defendant company filed exhibit No. 3, an itemized account showing that the cost of this 60"x65" R. C. P. pass 36 feet long, installed would be $1467. The defendant's exhibit No. 4 showed that a 68"x74" R. C. P. pass 36 feet long, installed would cost $1606. These figures are an estimate and are not the actual cost which tho defendant company would be required to stand. The first $700 would be paid by the defendant company and then the amount above that would be paid for equally by the complainant and defendant com - pany. Notwithstanding the excessive amounts shown in these exhibits, the complainant emphatically says that he would be willing to sustain his one-half of the actual expense over and above the $700 that the company would be required under the law to bear, by reason of the added convenience it would give him in the conducting of his farm and in obviating the necessity of driving his stock around the road </seg>
            <seg id="p148">EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT to and from his pasture, and also that it would give him an opportunity to use the ground on the east side of the track for his hogs as well as for his cattle which at the present time he is unable to do. The complainant testified that the present grade crossing is useless to him as a stock pass and that the company can fence it up any time they desire to do so. Section 5527, as amended by the 1923 session of the legislature reads as follows: "Section 5527. LAND OWNERS TO HAVE ONE CROSSING. — Whenever any person owns land on both sides of the right-of-way of any railroad, such railroad shall provide and keep in repair at least one adequate means for such land owner to cross the right-of-way. Any interested land owner with land on both sides of the right-of - way of any railroad may file written complaint with the State Rail - way Commission against any such railroad that the crossing is not Kuate or is unsafe and dangerous to the life and property of those use the same, and the Commission thereupon shall make such itigation and hold such hearing as may be necessary, and shall i such orders as it shall deem necessary, proper and adequate. If circumstances warrant, the Commission may require existing crossings to be relocated so as to be safe to those who use them, but where such special crossing involves an expenditure of more than seven hundred ($700.00) dollars the land owners shall bear one-half the expense in excess of seven hundred ($700.00) dollars." We find from the record that complainant owns the land on both sides of the right-of-way of defendant company; that the present crossing is inadequate and impracticable and an underground cattle pass should be constructed of sufficient size for the passage of horses, cattle and hogs under the track to and from the complainant's pasture and fields, that such a pass should be constructed by the defendant railroad company and the complainant according to law. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Rail - way company be required to install an underground cattle pass 68"x74" as shown by defendant's exhibit No. 4, at the place indicated on said exhibit marked "Proposed Cattle Pass," on the northwest quarter of section twenty-four, township twenty-nine, north range two, west of the sixth P.

If the statement shows that the construction of said cattle pass did not cost as much as the estimate, then and in that case the said railway company shall refund to the said complainant any amount paid by him over and above the actual one-half of the cost which he had been required to pay under the law covering such cases.

(SEAL) FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 510 Village of Cotesfleld, Complainant, v. Central Power Company of Grand Island, Defendant. Appearances For the village of Cotesfleld: Dale P. S tough, attorney; V. L. Hollister, engineer. For the Central Power Company, C. F. SeCheverell, vice-president. For the village of Elba, R. A. Haggart, attorney. BY THE COMMISSION: The village of Cotesfleld applied to this Commission for an order and finding fixing a just and equitable fee for making physical con - nection with a transmission line operated by the Central Power com- </seg>
            <seg id="p150">150 pany and to make such additional negotiations as to rates and service as the Commission may find just and reasonable. Hearing on this matter was held in the court house at St. Paul, February 10, 1925. The village of Farwell constructed a transmission line from Dannebrog to that village, a distance of seven and one-fourth miles. This is energized and maintained by the Central Power company. The line extends north and west from Dannebrog to the northeast corner of section 9, township 15, north, range 11, west of the Sixth P. M. At this point a transmission line constructed by the village of Elba at a cost of $7,124 connects with the Farwell line and extends north for a distance of five and one-half miles to Elba. This is also oper - ated by the power company. Cotesfield is located north and west of Elba, a distance of ap - proximately eight miles, and proposes to build a transmission line to connect near Elba. Elba paid all of the cost of the transmission line north of the junction and in addition paid Farwell $2,376, or 30 per cent of the cost of the line from Dannebrog to the point of connection for a permanent right to receive service at the junction. Elba's contract with the power company includes maintenance of its line from the junction in consideration of certain rates for current delivered at the village. It also provided that the company has the right to extend and enlarge the transmission line the same as if it were the property of the company. However, the village reserved the right to charge and Fjct a reasonagle amount for connections made for the use of other ies between Elba and Dannebrog. The term of the contract was twenty years, three of which have already expired. Negotiations between Cotesfield and the power company for physical connection and service were ineffective for the reason that the right to fix the connection fee had been reserved in its contract with Elba. The company is willing to supply the service demanded when the fee has been determined. The village of Elba demanded a fee of $2,000 for the right to receive service over the line from Elba to Dannebrog and Cotesfield, alleged this is excessive and applied to the Commission for relief as provided in House Roll No. 515, session laws of 1923. Physical connection charges ordinarily include the cost of the equipment, materials, and labor necessary to supply service for the branch line or extension and the fixed charges on account of the use of main line are included in the rates. In the instant case the primary is owned by the villages and plaintiff will acquire a permanent right to use the property with maintenance paid to the point of connection. </seg>
            <seg id="p151">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 151 The electric capacity of the line is not in question. The circuit is operated on three wires with a pressure of 6300 volts, and Farwell, Elba and Cotesfield constitute the market for current along the line with the exception of farm line connections which may be added from time to time. The villages have approximately the same popu - lation, Elba 276, Farwell 256, Cotesfield 214. In the year 1923 Par - well used 15,933 kilowatts and Elba 15,675. As it stands the con - sumption of Cotesfield should be near these figures. Elba has a total investment of $9,500. If we use six per cent on the money invested and five per cent for maintenance and depreciation on Elba's part of the line on which it pays maintenance through rates, we have the fixed charges below: If the line beyond the junction is jointly used, Cotesfield will get the benefit of one-half of this sum annually, or $463.16. This sum capitalized on a six per cent basis amounts to $7,718, which might be taken as a measure of the cost of the perpetual right. If the fixed charge is spread over an annual consumption of 15,500 kilowatts to be consumed by Cotesfield the result indicates that Cotesfield would have to pay three cents per kilowatt for all current delivered to its connection at Elba in addition to the cost of the current, but a service charge was not considered. Farwell and Elba apparently planned the construction of the line anticipating that Cotesfield would join them and that each village to which the line is extended would pay thirty per cent of the cost of the property used in common with the village preceding. Thirty per cent of Elba's investment is $2,850. Elba fixed the connection fee at $2,000. This is a sum which does not result from a study of the equities involved, but is less than any figure we have made. Ootesfield can pay a fixed charge per kilowatt to Elba or buy an interest in the property, which it apparently desires to do. The Com - mission believes and so finds that the sum of $2,000 fixed by Elba as a physical connection fee is not excessive for a permanent right to use Elba's line in connection with her interest in the line from the junction point to Dannebrog. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Central Power Company of Grand Island, be 9,500 @ 6% int $ 480.00 7,124 @ 5% M. D 356.20 Total $ 926.20 </seg>

(SEAL) FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 521 DuVal Sand ft Gravel Company, Complainant, v. Chicago, Rock Island ft Pacific Railway Company, Defendant. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: Applicant is in the business of producing sand and gravel at pits near Fairbury. It complains that the rate of four cents which now applies from Fairbury to Lincoln, Nebraska, is unreasonable and ex - cessive and interferes with shipments of this nature for state high - ways tor sand and graveling purposes. It asks that defendant be required to put into effect a rate of three cents applying from Fair - bury to Lincoln, Nebraska. The complaint was set down for hearing on Monday, February 16. On that date, however, defendant, through its attorney, submitted a communication from Mr. F. J. Shubert, general freight agent of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company, one paragraph of which is as follows: "I wish to advise that we are agreeable to the publication of the rate 3 cents per 100 lbs. on sand and gravel, CL, minimum weight 90 per cent of marked capacity of car except that when weight of shipment loaded to full visible capacity of car is less than 90 per cent of marked capacity of car, the actual weight will apply, (in no case shall the minimum weight be less than 40,000 lbs.) from the Blue Valley Sand Spur located about 1.4 miles south of Fairbury 1 and from the DuVal Sand Spur located 1.2 miles west of Fairbury, to Lincoln, Nebr." </seg>

SUPPLEMENTAL FINDING AND ORDER TAYLOR, Commissioner: In the original order in this case the Commission approved a reduction from four cents to three cents per hundred weight in .the rate on sand and gravel in carloads from Fairbury to Lincoln. It now appears that the pit of the DuVal Sand &amp; Gravel Company is located 1.2 miles west of Fairbury and the pit of the Blue Valley Sand com - pany is located 1.4 miles south of Fairbury. Under these circum - stances the new rate of three cents would not affect traffic moving from these pits. Since the complaint in the case was tiled by the DuVal Sand &amp; Gravel company the order of the Commission fails to afford the relief prayed for and which was agreed to by defendant.

            <seg id="p155">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 155 The complainant is located in Omaha, under the firm name of Platner Brothers doing a retail lumber business in the city of Omaha, and as the Farmers Lumber company doing a wholesale lumber busi - ness in Iowa and Nebraska. The Farmers Educational &amp; Co-operative State Union of Nebraska intervened. This intervener is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the state of Nebraska, a cooperative organization. The Farmers Lumber company of Wymore also intervened. This intervener is a corporation organized for the purpose of "carrying on a retail lumber and building material business" in the city of Wymore. The matters contained in this complaint were formerly con - sidered by the Commission in Formal Complaint 494 and disposed of by us in an order dismissing same, entered August 15, 1924. The two complaints are substantially the same. The testimony introduced on behalf of complainant in this case is, in general, the same as the testimony introduced in Formal Com - plaint 494. The Farmers Educational &amp; Co-operative State Union of Nebraska, intervener, made the testimony introduced by the complainant, its testimony. The intervener, the Farmers Lumber company of Wymore, in - troduced testimony through witness Little which tended to show that the carload rates charged on Nebraska intrastate shipments of manu - factured articles of lumber taking lumber rates or arbitraries higher, were lower in Nebraska than in Kansas. Numerous comparisons were made between the mixtures asked for in the complaint as compared with like shipments in other states. The testimony of the defendant carriers in this case is quite similar to that introduced in the other case. Complainant alleged in this case that the rates charged by de - fendant carriers for less than carload shipments of plaster, lime, cement, brick and cement blocks when shipped by it from its yard in Omaha and loaded with carload shipments of lumber and articles manufactured from lumber taking lumber rates, consigned to stations in Nebraska, are excessive, unjust and unreasonable and in violation of the law of the state of Nebraska governing the transportation of freight between points in this state. </seg>
            <seg id="p156">156 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT In support of the contention of the unreasonableness of the rates, complainant showed that he loads the less than carload consignments of plaster, lime and cement, etc. in carload shipments of lumber at tyard in Omaha; that the defendant carriers do not perform the il less than carload services i. e. receive the shipment at the )t, handle it into the warehouse and from there into the car, and the consignee at destination unloads the less than carload ship - ts. Complainant contends that by reason of the fact that the ter does not furnish these less than carload terminal services, he tld be accorded lower rates than would apply on the same sliip - ts if they were handled in the usual manner at points of origin destination. The general mixing rule that applies in Nebraska provides that less than carload quantities of freight may be mixed in a carload ship - ment and that on all such shipments the rates to be applied will be the highest rate and highest minimum weight of any commodity con - tained in the mixture. This complainant contends that the Commis - sion should order the carriers to change this general rule so as to provide that the highest rate and lowest minimum of any of the com - modities contained in the mixture mentioned in the complaint shall apply. The mere fact that the complainant loads less than carload ship - ments in a car at his yard, is not a sufficient reason, in our opinion, to prove that the present less than carload rates on plaster, lime, cement and cement blocks are excessive and unreasonable, on these commodities when offered for shipment by the complainant at Omaha to points in Nebraska. There is a reciprocal advantage to the complainant in that he does not have to haul his less than carload commodities to the carriers' depot in order to have it transported to points of destination. Carload rates uniformly provide for the handling of carload shipments from point of loading on industry tracks to destination. In substance, the complainant contends that by reason of the fact that the carrier has to come to its yard in Omaha for the carload shipments of lumber, no consideration should be given to the cost of switching the less than carload commodities loaded with the lumber. This, generally speak- Bis on the theory that the carrier has to make the switch anyway it costs no more to handle the extra load than if the same was not placed in the car. Railroad rates cannot be established or main - tained on such a method of reasoning. In this case an individual firm, lumber dealers in Omaha, contend that the Commission should establish a more favorable mixing rule in order that it might be able to deliver freight at Nebraska stations at </seg>
            <seg id="p157">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 157 a less cost than other shippers have to pay for transporting the same commodities between other points in this state. This contention is largely bottomed on the proposition that receivers of lumber and other commodities used for building purposes will be benefited because complainant will then be enabled to name, in many instances, a lower price for a completed building than other people who are in the same business can quote. In our former decision we said: "The testimony in this case appears to us to, in substance, ask the Commission to give controlling consideration to com - mercial conditions, and order the rail carriers to establish a mix - ing rule for shipments of lumber, cement, lime and plaster direct - ly opposite to the general western classification mixed carload rule, so that the complainant — the Farmers Lumber company of Omaha, can in a measure overcome the state-wide rate adjust - ment, which allows the interior lumber and building material dealers to get their lumber from the mills in the Pacific north - west at the same rate in cents per rot., that the complainant pays for the lumber received from the same point of origin at Omaha, and at approximately the same rate for shipment of cement, lime and plaster. We do not think the record in this case justified us in tak - ing such action." Nothing has been presented in this case that would justify us in changing our position. It follows that the complainant has failed to sustain the burden as to the unreasonableness of the present rates. As to the unlawfulness of the rate mentioned in the petition, com - plainant relies entirely upon the language contained in the Railway Commission Act contained in Section 5486, Compiled Statutes of Ne - braska, 1922, page 1736. "Hearing — evidence. Upon the hearing the railway commis - sion shall receive any evidence and listen to any arguments offer - ed or presented by either party relevant to the matter under investigation, and the burden of proof shall be upon the railroad, person or persons, hereinbefore set forth, making the complaint. The lowest rates published or charged by any railway company for substantially the same kind of service, whether in this or another state, shall, when introduced in evidence, be accepted as prima facie evidence of a reasonable rate for the services under investigation. If the railway company or common carrier making complaint, or the railway company complained of by the person or persons hereinbefore named, operate a line of railroad beyond the state, or has a traffic arrangement with any other railroad company, the same shall be taken into consideration in determin - ing what is a reasonable rate. If it be operating a line of rail - road beyond the state, the rate charged or established for sub - stantially the same or greater service by it in another state may also be considered.

            <seg id="p158">158 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Complainant contends that because some of the defendants here - in have published the following rule applicable to Kansas intrastate traffic, the above quoted statute should be considered as a compelling ran why the Commission should order all railroads in this state to it into force and effect in Nebraska: •ARTICLE RATING Rule No. 400, W.

Applies only on Kansas Intrastate traffic. This rule is published solely for the purpose of complying with the order of the Kansas Public Utilities Commission Docket C. R. A. 396-F, of July 2G, 1916, carriers party to this circular reserving all legal rights to contest same." Defendants urge that the contention of the complainant as men - tioned above does not tend to support the complainant's application for a reduction in the rates on the less than carload commodities mentioned in Ihe petition for the following reasons: 1. That the section clearly expresses that the burden of proof shall be upon the person complaining of the rates. 2. That that portion of the above quoted section to-wit: "the lowest rates published or determined by any railway com - pany for substantially the same kind of service, whether in this or another state, shall, when introduced in evidence, be accepted as prima facie evidence of a reasonable rate for the services under investigation," must be considered in connection with sections 5484 and 5485 and that these sections relate entirely to common carriers subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission; that some of the railroads mentioned in the complaint do not operate in Kansas at all. 3. That the statute is limited to cases involving a schedule of rutes under consideration by the Commission and does not in any manner relate to rules and privileges. Defendants contend that in </seg>
            <seg id="p159">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 159 essence the complaint directly affects mixing rules as distinguished from rates. 4. That the statute clearly provides that a rate established by the defendant carrier in some other state must be in the nature of a voluntary act or admission against the interest of the party making it. The above quoted Kansas rule shows that the Kansas carriers established the rule under protest, consequently the same is not the voluntary act of the carriers that do operate lines of railroad in both Kansas and Nebraska. 5. That the interpretation of complainants on the statutory pro - vision deprives defendant of a chance to show that transportation conditions in other states are different from those in Nebraska and hence inapplicable as a rate measure. The rule of procedure quoted from the statutes in (2) above can hardly be interpreted as broadly as complainant seeks to do. Nor can it be read in so narrow a sense as defendants seek to read it. Section 5486 cannot be said to apply to a schedule only because it applies to all subsequent modifications. While the matter under complaint is a mixture rule it is directly a rate matter also. The carrier is in error in saying that it is deprived of right to make showing under the statutory provision. The clause on which com - plainant chiefly relies merely shifts the burden of proof. On the other hand, we can hardly endorse an interpretation of the statutory provision in section 5486 which makes the action of the Kansas regulatory body over the protest of carriers affected by this complaint a sufficient ground to shift the burden of proof in Nebraska. While it is not a controlling consideration, it should be mentioned that complainant here apparently desires to pick out of the rules and regulations effective in Kansas on shipments of mixed carloads of lumber and articles related thereto, portions only which will be fa - vorable to him. No general demand is made for the rule sought by complainant by even a moderate number of Nebraska shippers. The Farmers Union, intervener, represents in this instance receivers of lumber who are interested only, if their position is sound that the application of the Kansas rule in Nebraska would reduce the price of building materials to purchasers. The sentiment of the Farmers Union apparently is divided on this subject. The Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation, rep - resenting consumers of building materials and retail cooperative dealers, was hostile to the complaint. </seg>

NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION, Thome A. Browne, Chairman. Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. (SEAL) FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 524 Glatfelter &amp; Powell, Complainants, v. Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, Defendant Appearances : For complainants, H. E. Glatfelter For defendant, Jesse L. Root, attorney; J. B. Driggs, assistant general freight agent. FINDINGS AND ORDER BY THE COMMISSION: STATEMENT This case came on for hearing on a formal complaint filed by Glatfelter &amp; Powell, complainants, a partnership engaged in mining </seg>
            <seg id="p161">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 161 and shipping sand and gravel between points in the state of Nebraska with its main office located at Central City. Complainants operate two sand pits, one located at Powellspur 1.9 miles south of Central City and one at Gravel vale 1.6 miles west of Newark, both on the Burlington railroad. Paragraph 4 of the petition reads as follows: "That C. B. &amp; Q. G. F. O. No. 11677-P I. C. C. No. 16062 carries the following rules regarding application of rates on sand and gravel on distance ra(es: "Rates must be computed on basis of official distances as shown in C. B. &amp; Q. G. F. O. No. 9000-A, I. C. C. No. 15575 supplements thereto or reissues thereof. Where rates are not provided for the exact distance, the rate for the next greater distance shown must be used, subject to rule for disposi - tion of fractions as shown in tariff referred to." In the case of the complainant the above rule creates a hardship and in cases where shipments are made out of the fifty mile zone, a rate of V^a per hundred pounds is charged when no service is rendered, and is contrary to the Nebraska State Railway Commission Act." The petition charges unjust discrimination on account of the Burlington having named some of the sidings where sand and gravel is mined, that are located on the Burlington, in its table of distances G. F. O. 9000-A. COMPLAINANTS Mr. Glatfelter appeared as witness for the complainants and showed (1) that they had shipped from their mine located on the Burlington near Central City, a large number of cars during the year 1924; (2) that the freight charges on cars shipped had been calculated on the distance from Central City to point of destination, regardless of the direction in which the cars were moved; (3) that they had recently completed their sand pit at Gravelvale located 1.6 mile* west of Newark on the Burlington; (4) that they had paid the Burling - ton road for the construction of about 1800 feet of track at Gravel - vale; (5) that the mine near Central City was served by a spur track off of the main line located 1.9 miles south of Central City; (6) that at Gravelvale about 800 feet of a double end siding and a spur of 1000 feet long have been constructed, leading off of this siding to the loading pit; (7) that the complainants made application to the traffic department of the Burlington road asking them to name the Central City and Newark pits in their table of distances, G. F. O. 9000-A; (8) that said Burlington traffic officials had refused to place the above mentioned pits in their table of distances tariff; (9) that by reason of the fact that complainants' pit at Gravelvale was not named in tht table of distances it would be required to pay charges based on the distance from Kearney to the point of destination, on all shipments that were for destinations east of Gravelvale; (10) that the distance from Gravelvale to Kearney is approximately 6.5 miles. </seg>
            <seg id="p162">162 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT DEPENDANT Division Superintendent Mullen of the Burlington testified (1) (t cars set to complainants' pit near Central City had to be handled part as a flying switch; (2) that such method of switching was re or less hazardous; (3) that the cars handled at complainants' near Newark could be handled without hazard; (4) that accord - ing to the company's record complainants had about 2000 feet of spur rg serving their pits near Central-City; (5) that there is 1800 of track used to serve the pit near Newark, part of it in double end siding and the balance in a spur leading off from the siding; tthat the company had recently completed for the Lyman-Richey 1 Company, a double end siding located on the north side of the te River between Kearney and Newark consisting of about 2000 of track; (7) that the Burlington had recently established the that spur tracks serving industries could not be taken off of the l line track but in all such places where industry tracks are established, a double end siding must be provided in order that the cars handled to and from such sidings can be switched in the ordinary method of handling cars by road crews. Mr. Driggs of the traffic department of the Burlington testified substantially as follows: (8) that the traffic department of the Burl - ington thought that they should not be called upon to name all sand pits located on their line, in their table of distances; (9) that by so placing the industries in their table of distances, all rates named on a distance tariff basis would be applicable to such a siding; (10) that the sidings located at Cone's Spur and Allis had been placed in the table of distances many years ago shortly after the Chalco cut - off was built; (11) that the sand spur serving the Moffitt Sand com - pany located between Ashland and South Bend had been placed in the table of distances in June, 1923, at the request of the shipper, but that he personally thought that it was a mistake to place .the Moffitt pit in 9000-A, for the same reason as has been stated above; (12) that if the Commission found that the complainants' sidings located at Powellspur and Gravelvale should be named in the table of distances, that the distance should be figured including the mile- age located on the complainants' property; (13) that the present tariff provisions require that sand loaded at a spur located between two main line stations shall be billed at the distance from the next station from which the distance is shown beyond the sand pit track. CONCLUSION This is the first time that the question raised in this complaint has been presented to the Commission for its decision and what we say in these findings is related entirely to carload shipments of sand </seg>
            <seg id="p163">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 163 and gravel, that being the commodity mentioned in the petition Attorney for the defendant contends that unlawful discrimina - tion has not been shown by the complainant for the reason that "the sand loaded at Cone's Spur and Allis does not compete with the sand loaded at his pits, and that to describe his pits in C. B. &amp; Q. mileage tariff G. F. O. No. 9000-A would not permit him to invade the territory now supplied by shippers from Cone's Spur and Allis. He also admitted that sand was not shipped from Power. So, therefore, there is no statutory ground for compelling the railroad company to multiply former mistakes by naming these sand spurs as shipping points." While it is true that complainant is not able under present tariff provisions to ship sand or gravel from its pits to the so-called blanket territory located in the eastern part of the state, however, it is a fact that miners of sand located in the eastern part of the state do compete with the complainant at stations outside of the blanket territory. The traffic witness for the defendant contended that the company should not be required to include the points named in the petition, in its table of distances for the reason that if the stations are included in the table of distances, all rates that are named ok a distance basis would apply to stations so included, and that the com - pany was not in a position to handle all kinds of shipments to the sand pits in question. We think there is merit in this contention but see no reason why the tariff naming the distance from the sand pits herein considered should not carry provision that the distances apply only on carload shipments of sand or gravel. Sand and gravel are highly competitive commodities and in view of the fact that the record shows that the defendant has named some sand pits in its table of distances, we do not see any good reason in this record why the rule should not be laid down in this case that all sand pits located outside of switching limits of towns or cities should be included in the tariff carrying distances, if so desired. The adop - tion of this rule would allow the same treatment to be accorded to all miners of sand or gravel and would give them whatever advantage or disadvantage they may have by reason of their location with relation to the territory in which they desire to sell their commodity. We are not impressed with the contention of Mr. Driggs that in figuring the distance from the sand pits mentioned in the petition the length of the sand pit track should be. included in the total distances. This practice is not followed by the carriers on other traffic. The sid - ings herein considered are not longer than the average industry tracks of the defendant. We are of the opinion and so find that the petition should be granted and that the defendant should be directed to include said pit </seg>

BROWNE, Chairman: This complaint filed by the Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation, an incorporated association, alleges that there is a considerable move - ment of livestock to market wherein the species are mixed in the same carload; that under the tariffs it is necessary to separate the species by partition adequate for that purpose; that such partitions are furnished by the shipper at considerable expense and are never returned, and that it is the carriers' duty to supply all necessary facilities for the movement of livestock in mixed carloads. Formal answers were filed by some of the defendants. In general the position of defendants in testimony was that they should not be asked to furnish partitions without compensation. Plaintiffs and interveners in testimony agreed that a reasonable charge could be both compensatory to the carrier and advantageous to the shipper, inasmuch as he is now required to spend a considerable amount of money for the material used in dividing gates, and such material can never be used a second time. Specifications for six suggested gates were presented in testimony, briefly described as follows: American Railway Association recommendation. Gate 44 inches to the top of the top bar, 3 crossbars size 2 inches by 6 inches, yellow pine or fir uprights of 2 inches by 4 inches, spaces between the crossbars 6 inches, 8 inches and 12 inches measured from the floor upward, fastened together by nails, and held in place in the car by wire. Farm Bureau design No. 1. Made of No. 1 fir, crossbars of 2 inches by 6 inches dimensions, four in number, height of gate 60 inches, spaces from floor upward 9 inches, 6 inches and 9 inches, up - rights of 2 inches by 6 inches, upright bracing of same dimensions, planking bolted together and gate fastened in car by wire. Farm Bureau No. 2 design. Made of No. 1 fir, gate 59 inches high with 6 crossbars of 2 inches by 6 inches dimensions, spacing between bars at the bottom of the gate 3 inches and at the top 6 inches, bracing of 1 inch by 6 inches doubled, diagonal each way, and upright in the center of the gate, uprights of gate 1 inch by 6 inches dimension, gate parts bolted together and the gate fastened in the car by chain permanently attached with eye-bolts. </seg>
            <seg id="p166">166 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Burlington design. Gate made of good quality fir, 52 inches k, with 4 crossbars 2 inches by 8 inches dimensions, with spaces een bars of 5% inches, bracing with diagonal 1 inch by 6 inches, uprights of gate 1 inch by 4 inches dimensions doubled, gate fastened in car with wire. Union Pacific design. Gate made of good quality of fir with top bar 59 inches from the floor, two sections to each gate, each section of three crossbars, 2 inches by 8 inches dimensions, lower spaces be - tween bars 2 % inches, bracing of 2 inches by 8 inches dimension up - right in center of gate, parts of gate fastened together with nails, gate to be held in the car by bolted cleats. North Western design. Gate made of oak iu two sections, top of Pte 72 inches from floor, frame of gate 2 inches by 6 inches dimension th 14 oak uprights, 1 inch by 4 inches dimensions, bracing diagonal inches by 6 inches dimensions, parts of gate held together by bolts, and gate held in car by cleats. Estimated cost of gates ranged from $2.17 the estimate of the Farm Bureau, to $14.45 estimated cost of the gate offered by the North Western. Shippers now use a large variety of schemes for keeping the species in mixed carloads separate. Generally the gate or partition is made of native poles spiked to the car uprights or 2x6 sawed timbers. Necessarily no gate is used twice. Lacking experience it is Impossible for the Commission and also impossible for any witness to estimate the life of any gate set forth above. There was con - frable divergence on the question of cost of gates. First cost of s is less important in arriving at proper charge to be made to shipper for gates than reasonable conclusions as to the durability of the partitions. It is obvious that of the six designs set forth in testimony, some will cost more than others and some will be more durable than others. An experimental period with experimental gates seems quite essential. Definite advantages will be secured if during the experi - mental period different carriers produce different designs of gates in order that the widest information be at hand as to the most econ - omical gate. Low first cost does not necessarily mean the most economical gate. The Commission will refrain in this order for an experimental period, from designating the design of gates. It will only require thai. </seg>
            <seg id="p167">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 167 the top of the gate be not less than 50 inehes from the floor of the car, that the 3 lowest spaces between bars, including space between floor and first bar, shall not exceed 5 inches each, and that the gate be separable from the car with arrangements for wiring or chaining in place. It is recommended that the suggestion of the Farm Bureau that short chains fastened permanently to each side of the gate with eye - bolts and hook, be tried out to a sufficient extent to ascertain the practicability of such fastener. Testimony was almost unanimously favorable to a charge for the use of each gate made by the carrier, sufficient to compensate for that use. There was difference of opinion as to what charge would provide compensation. Some of the carriers urged that in arriving at com - pensation, allowance should be made for the cost of handling the gates from market to origin point from time to time. Complainant urged as against this claim, that the carrier earns more for approxi - mately the same service in handling mixed carloads, than in handling straight carloads of livestock. An exhibit was presented in evidence in support of this position. The weakness of the exhibit is that it compares actual mixed loads with minimum straight loads. How - ever the contention of complainant in this respect appears sound. On 50 carloads of mixed livestock taken at random from the records of the Commission, the average weight per car was 19,493 pounds. This loading is higher than the average loading of straight carloads of species taking the rate applicable to the mixed carload. Hence the carrier actually does earn something more on mixed carloads than on straight carloads. For the experimental period, we will consider that this higher revenue per car offsets the extra work on the part of the carrier in getting the gates back to points of origin. It is advisable, if it can be done, that during this experimental period the charge per single use of gate should be sufficient to clearly compensate the carrier for investment and deterioration and at the same time be low enough to be less than the shipper has heretofore experienced as cost. From the testimony we are of the opinion and so find that a charge of $1 per mixed car, where the carrier furnishes the gates, will fit this desirable situation. The experimental period should be at least one year. Each carrier will be required to construct gates or partitions enough to meet the demands of shippers. Such partitions can be located at strategic points within the state on the lines of each carrier, and be available at all local points if adequate notice to the carrier is given of contemplated movement of mixed carloads of stock. We find that this adequate notice from the shipper to the carrier should be three days prior to date of shipment. </seg>
            <seg id="p168">168 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT During the experimental period of a year the carrier as defend - ant will keep an adequate record of the number of gates in use, the aggregate number of times during the year the gates are used, the total cost of repairs, total gates destroyed, and shall secure an estimate of the remaining aggregate life in the gates at the end of the experi - mental period. Carriers should keep any other data which will aid in determining the actual cost of the service to them.

(SEAL) FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 527 M. L. ltawlings. Complainant, v. Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, Defendant. Appearances For the complainant, J. A. Little, rate expert For the defendant, Jesse L. Root, attorney; J. B. Driggs, assist- ant general freight agent. For the Commission, U. G. Powell, rate expert, OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This case came on for hearing on complaint of Mr. M. L. Rawlings of Wymore, a wholesale and retail dealer in natural ice, with exten - sive storage houses located on an industry track of the defendant at Wymore. The petition attacks the present rate of 6 V» cents per 100 pounds on carload shipments of ice, Wymore to Lincoln. Complainant allege3 that the present rate is unjust, unreasonable, excessive, unduly dis - criminatory, and in violation of the statutes of the state of Nebraska. Complainant asks reparation on carload shipments of ice moving from Wymore to Lincoln for a period of two years prior to date of filing </seg>
            <seg id="p170">170 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT the complaint, and in the amount of the rates paid in excess of the amount found reasonable by the Commission in these proceedings. In support of the petition complainant showed that the defendant has established a rate of 6% cents per cwt. on carload shipments of ice, Wymore to Omaha; that the present rate from Wymore to Lincoln is based on the Omaha rate and the long and short haul clause of the Railway Commission Act; that the 6*£ cent rate to Omaha was established by the Commission in 1916 on the basis of 4 cents per cwt. The rate is now 6 % cents on account of increases and deductions which have been legally made since the time the rate was established: That the defendant has established a rate of 7 cents per cwt. on car - load shipments of ice from Wymore to St. Joseph, Missouri, a distance of 122 miles; that cars of ice are loaded within twenty-four hours after they are set to his track for loading; that the defendant com - pany has set aside for his ice loading, old refrigerator cars of the 39,000 series which cars have had the bunkers removed; that he had shipped 22 carloads of ice from Wymore to Lincoln in a two-year period prior to the filing of this formal complaint; that the defendant company has established a rate from Ashland to Lincoln and Ashland to Omaha one-half cent per cwt. less than the winter distance tariff rate applying on carload shipments of ice. Complainant offered numerous comparisons of rates in effect on defendant's line of railroad in this state on commodities of greater value than ice. Said comparisons show that many of the rates per car mile for the same distance are lower than the present rate on carload shipments of ice, Wymore to Lincoln. Defendant showed that ice traffic is rather hard on equipment and K natural ice shipped in the winter months is largely carried in* k cars. Mr. Lyman, general superintendent, gave the following testimony as to the class of equipment used by the complainant in loading ice at Wymore: Q. That isn't the point. Does your ice car have to be main - tained in relatively as good a condition as your box car devoted to grain loading, for example? A. No. BY COMMISSIONER BROWNE: Q. You are speaking about non-insulated cars? A. I was going to ask the gentleman whether he was referring to insulated cars. MR. LITTLE: Q. Mr. Lyman is an able operating officer and he knows what the ice cars are. His list shows the equipment as ice cars. I am talking the language of his list. </seg>
            <seg id="p171">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 171 BY COMMISSIONER BROWNE: It was difficult to knew whether you were referring to that equipment or the four months equipment. BY MR. LITTLE: I am talking about what are technically known to his organ - ization as ice cars. A. If you are referring to the insulated cars I will say "no." The body of that car is not maintained as we would maintain a class 1 or 2 box car for grain loading, flour and sugar, but tho car must be given the same repairs and inspection. The so-called ice cars referred to by the gentleman are a class of the oldest refrigerators that the Burlington owns. The bunkers were taken out of the cars and they were thrown into the ice trade so as to get the last usage out of the equipment. They are what we call a 39,000 series car. Q. That agrees with our information and I thank you for Your frank statement. That is what we wanted. One further question, Mr. Lyman: Assuming that this ice traffic should disappear from your territory tomorrow and that you had these old ice cars of the 39,000 series on your rails what class of general traffic would you consider them as fit for handling in the absence of ice? A. The chances are they would be condemned and dismantled and destroyed. Defendant's witness Driggs showed that the complainant had shipped from Wymore to points on the Burlington during the past four years the following number of cars: 1922, 5 8 cars. 25 St. Joe 2 Superior 31 Miscl. 1923, 9 cars. 5 Superior 4 Miscl. 1924, 55 cars. 22 St. Joe 20 Lincoln 13 Miscl 1925, To date. 54 cars, 49 St. Joe 5 Lincoln. Defendant introduced an exhibit in which numerous rate com - parisons were made showing the same in cents per 100 pounds, and the earnings per ton-mile. CONCLUSIONS The testimony introduced by the complainant as to the reason - ableness of the present rate is largely bottomed on the proposition that if the 6% cent rate is a just and reasonable rate to Omaha, it is unreasonable when applied to shipments Wymore to Lincoln. This contention appears to us to have merit. According to the testimony the natural ice cut at Wymore is of good quality and is sold in com - petition with artificial ice in St. Joseph and Lincoln and by reason of the quantity of traffic offered, should be entitled to a rate less than the rate now in effect between Wymore and Omaha. The distance Wymore to Omaha is 117 miles, Wymore to Lincoln 62 miles. The character of equipment used emphasizes the advantage of </seg>
            <seg id="p172">172 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Eig an ice traffic that can utilize these 39,000 series can. Under schedule which was established by the Commission for winter nents of natural ice the present rate for the distance Wymore to Lincoln would be 4 cents per cwt. The handling of ice in the sum - mer time is more expensive than in the winter season. Comparisons of rates on a per car mile basis are not very helpful in arriving at a reasonable rate on a specific commodity between cer - tain points. The light loading of livestock as compared with ice, sand, etc. usually makes a lower per car mile showing on the livestock due entirely to the fact that cars loaded with livestock cannot be loaded k heavy as cars loaded with many other commodities. This fact s not conclusively prove that the livestock rates are unreasonably or that other rates contained in the comparison are excessive. After giving full consideration to all the testimony offered in evidence, the Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the present rate on carload shipments of ice from Wymore to Lincoln la unreasonably high, and that a reasonable rate is 5 cents per cwt., minimum weight to be 90 per cent of the marked capacity of the car As to the reparation portion of this petition complainant shows by a signed agreement with the consignee that the complainant is the party at interest who should receive the money if reparation is allowed. Complainant shows that in order to sell any ice in Lincoln he had to cut his regular price fifty cents per ton. The record as to this point is not very clear. On cross examination Mr. Rawlings said that the price for last year (apparently meaning 1924) ranged from $1.50 to $2.00 per ton f. o. b. Wymore. { Defendant offered no testimony specifically regarding the ques - tion* of reparation. It appears to us that the reparation question herein considered is one that was directly contemplated by the legislature at the time the statute was passed. For convenience we quote the section here: "Sec. 5500. Hearing on complaint — order. That if, after hearing on a complaint under sections 6126, 6127, 6128, 6129 or sections 6137, 6138, 6139, 6140, revised statutes of Nebraska for 1913 (5485-5488, 5496-5499), the Nebraska State Railway Commission shall determine that any party complainant has on and after the taking effect of this Act and within two years next preceding the filing of the said complaint paid unjust or un - reasonable rates or charges to any defendant railroad or express company in this state on intrastate traffic or has on and after the taking effect of this act and within two years next preceding the filing of the said complaint suffered damages by reason of the* </seg>

(1921 p. 820.)" It is fair to assume, in absence of testimony to the contrary, that transportation conditions were the same in the two-year period prior to the filing of this complaint, as now; that during all that period the rate complained of was unreasonable, and that reparation should be awarded. At the time of hearing a list ot cars of ice shipped by com - plainant was submitted of record. These cars were shipped during the last half of 1924. There may have been shipments made since the complaint was filed. After due consideration of the record in this case the Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the complainant should be awarded reparation as prayed for in the petition. The record is not sufficiently clear for us to state the exact amount that should be repaid to the complainant by the defendant. We will pro - vide that a list of cars shipped for a period of twenty-four months prior to March 14, 1925, the date this complaint was filed with the Commission, shall be prepared by the complainant and submitted to the defendant for check.

(SEAL) FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 528 Board of County Commissioners of Dawson County, Complainants, v. Union Pacific Railroad Company, Defendants. Appearances For the complainants, W. M. Cook, attorney. For the defendant, Thomas W. Bockes, attorney. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: Dawson county maintains a public highway on a section line running east and west between section 6 and 7 in township 12, north, range 20, west, in said county. This highway crosses the right ot way of the Union Pacific Railroad company at about the half-mile line, north and south, of sections 6 and 7. In this highway and wholly within the railroad right of way on the north side of the track is a wagon bridge crossing a draw or partially dry water course. This bridge is in need of repair, and, although notified by the county commissioners of its condition, the railroad company has failed and refused to make the necessary improvements to place it in a safe condition for public travel. This complaint is brought praying for an investigation by this Commission and for an order requiring de - fendant to make repairs to the bridge. There is no dispute as to tbe facts. Defendant admits the </seg>
            <seg id="p175">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 175 existence of the wagon bridge, its presence on the right of way, and its need of repair. It also admits that the bridge in the original instance was constructed at the expense of the railroad company. The county commissioners admit that the bridge is for the use solely of the traveling public and is of no use to the railroad company. They further admit that had the railroad never been constructed a bridge would have been required at this location. While the pleadings do not so state, complainant presumably relies for relief on the provisions of section 5524, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, the material portion of which is as follows: "It is hereby made the duty of every person or corporation, owning or operating any railroad, crossed by a public road, to make and keep in good repair, good and sufficient crossings for such road over their tracks, including all the gradings, bridges, ditches, and culverts that may be necessary within their right of way." Admittedly the bridge in question is within the right of way of defendant. A literal application of the statute would seem to impose on the railroad company the obligation of constructing and maintain - ing it. In the absence of court interpretation of the language of the statute the Commission would probably make the order prayed for. Fortunately, however, this particular provision has been passed on by our own supreme court in such clear and unmistakable language as to leave no doubt whatever as to the rule to be followed. The language quoted above has been a part of the law of tin state since 1887. In 1913 the law was amended, but the words, "Including all the grading, bridges, ditches and culverts that may be necessary within their right of way," were retained. In a decision rendered in 1890, State, ex rel. Lancaster County, v. C. B. &amp;. Q. R. Co., the supreme court held this section to be constitutional, in so far as it requires railroads to construct and keep in repair suitable crossings where railroads cross public highways, but it found that the railroad is not under obligation to construct and maintain any part of the highway that would have been necessary had the railroad never been built. In its opinion the court said: "Of course, under the guise of the police power, property of corporations or individuals cannot be confiscated. If the require - ments of section 1 of the act quoted were designed for the protec - tion of lives and property, then it was within the scope of proper legislation. It is of vital importance to those traveling by rail or upon a public road that the crossings should be properly con - structed and kept in good order. These crossings require atten - tion the same as other portions of the track, and are liable to constantly get out of repair. The section men in the employ of the railroad are daily passing over the track and would soon </seg>
            <seg id="p176">176 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT discover a defect in the crossing and remedy it. Not so with tho road supervisor; he seldom sees the crossing. The company by laying its ties and rails and making its grade renders a crossing ' necessary, and it is not unreasonable to place the burden on the one making it necessary. The interests of the public, as well as that of the railroad company, require that the latter should have exclusive control of the crossings. If inexperienced road super - visors were required to construct and keep in repair these cross - ings great loss of life and property would likely result from the negligent construction of or the failure to keep in good order the crossings. The purpose of the legislature in placing this burden upon the railroad corporation was to secure the safety of the public travel and transportation. "We do not mean to be understood as deciding that it is the duty of a railroad corporation to construct and keep in re - pair all highways laid on or across its right of way. What we hold is that it must construct suitable crossings in that part of the highway within the right of way made necessary by the building of the railroad, and keep the same in repair. If the railroad track is laid above the natural surface of the ground where the highway crosses it, the crossing, would include suit - able approaches. If the track is below the natural surface of the ground, the crossing would include whatever is necessary to make a reasonably safe way for persons traveling the highway to cross the railroad. "It cannot be said that the public good requires that the burden should be upon the railroad company to construct the remainder of the public highway within the right of way. No serious consequences would likely result from requiring the public authorities to construct the highway after the crossings and approaches are put in. We think that it is the duty of the public authorities to construct and keep in repair all the highway within the right of way which they would have been required to build had the railroad not been constructed. (People v. L. S. &amp; M. S. Ry. Co., 52 Mich., 277. 17 N. W. 841.)" In a subsequent case, Missouri Pacific Railroad Company v. Cass County, decided in 1906, the court again sustained the rule, not - withstanding the rather specific language of the provision. It said In part: "The weight of authority, however, is that under statutes similar to our own such items of damage as are necessitated and occasioned by the operation of the railroad, as the erection of sign-posts, the construction of wing-fences and cattle-guards, and the building of approaches from the public road to the rail - road track, are within the clear letter of the statute and must, be borne by the railroad company without compensation. With reference to the costs that necessarily would have been expended by the public in making the highway, had the railroad never been constructed, the opinions are divergent; but, as the exercise of the police power under this section of the statute frequently casts onerous burdens on public service corporations, and as the doctrine announced by this court, when the statute was first inter- </seg>
            <seg id="p177">N EBRAoK A STATE RAILW^AY COMMISSION 177 preted, is supported by the authority therein quoted (People v. Lake Shore &amp; M. S. R. Co. 52 Mich. 277) and, though a deviation from the letter, is in harmony with the spirit of the enactment, we see no reasoh for changing the rule which has long been acquiesced in." In testimony the chairman of the board of county commissioners stated that a wagon bridge would be necessary at the point in ques - tion if there were no railroad there and that the construction of the bridge was not made necessary in any way by the building of the rail - road. This was confirmed by the engineer of defendant who had recently made an inspection. How the railroad company happened to construct the bridge in the first instance is not disclosed, although it is admitted. It would seem to have no bearing on the issue at this time. Within five years after its construction defendant notified the county that it would not be responsible for its repairs or main - tenance and has never done any work on the bridge. Upon the facts as they exist and in view of the rule established by the supreme court with reference to the effect of the statute in - volved, we are of the opinion and so find that defendant railroad company is not liable for the repair and maintenance of the bridge in question, and the complaint should be dismissed.

M. Cook, attorney. For the defendant, Thomas W. Bockes, attorney. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: This complaint was heard and later considered in connection with Formal Complaint No. 528. The questions of law involved in both are identical. Our conclusions as to the law expressed in our findings in order No. 528 are applicable in this case. Dawson county maintains a public highway running north and south between sections 35 and 36, in township 12, north, range 20. west, in said county. This highway intersects the Stapleton line of the Union Pacific and crosses the railroad under a bridge which spans a natural water course. The highway follows the bed of the water course for a short distance parallel to the railroad on the south side, thence under the railroad bridge and out upon higher ground to the north. The water course is dry during most of the year but during the rainy season carries flood waters from that particular district. The highway is not graded and it accommodates, at the present time, only four or five families who live north of the railroad and use Sumner, three miles southeast, as their trading point. The complainant alleges that during flood periods the highway becomes impassable because of mud and water accumulating at a point just south of the railroad bridge. It is further alleged that the presence of the railroad bridge prevents the construction of a highway bridge to span the water course at this point and that in lieu of that it will be necessary to construct a concrete "dip" or "glide," providing a solid foundation for a roadway and to have the railroad bridge reconstructed so that the piers will be placed parallel with the high - way. It is also asked that the passage way under the railroad bridge be widened to at least sixteen feet. At the present time the spans are fifteen feet apart. The complainant demands that defendant be Suired to make all of the improvements asked for. The defendant es the position that some structure would be necessary in the hway if the railroad were not there and that, for that reason, </seg>
            <seg id="p179">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 179 it is not obligated under the law to bear the cost of the proposed im - provements. It offers, however, to bear the expense of remodeling the railroad bridge to the extent of widening a span so as to give approximately twenty feet lateral clearance and to rearrange the piers so as to make them parallel with the highway, thus affording a straight driveway under the bridge. It is estimated that the expense for making this change would be about $1100. The county commissioners in testimony maintain that a bridge in the highway would be preferable to the construction of a concrete glide. They agree, however, that under the circumstances the con - struction of a glide is the only feasible plan for improving conditions. It is their opinion that a glide would cost more to construct than a bridge. With this, defendant disagrees. The commissioners estimate that a glide will cost approximately $600 while a bridge with the necessary fill would cost only $400. The company's engineers, on the other hand, estimate that a concrete glide would cost about five dollars per lineal foot, making a sixty foot glide cost about $300. Their estimate of a seventy-five foot bridge with the necessary fill is eight to nine hundred dollars. It is conceded by the commissioners, I&lt; a bridge were constructed, it should be twenty feet in length but that earth fills of from forty to fifty feet would be necessary on either side. It is admitted also that it would cost more to maintain a wooden bridge than a concrete glide. It is agreed by the chairman of the board of commissioners and the engineer for the company that the concrete glide should start about six feet south of the center of the track under the bridge and extend for sixty to seventy-five feet south. It is not contended that the glide should extend under the bridge to the north. All of the structure, 1-owever, would be upon the railroad right-of-way. As the Commission views the situation, the construction of the concrete glide would be preferable even if the railroad structures were not in the highway. The highway is little used and the glide, it is admitted, would answer all purposes for practically the entire year. Even if the glide were to cost more than a bridge and fill originally, it is manifest that maintenance would be less so that the ultimate cost would probably be about the same. In view of the fact that some structure would have to be in the highway whether the railroad were there or not, and in view of the offer of the railroad company to rearrange its bridge so as to provide the necessary clearance and straighten the highway, the Commission is of the opinion that such offer represents the fair measure of defendant's legal obligation, and it cannot be required to assume the cost of the construction of a con - crete glide. It follows, therefore, that the complaint, as to the re - mainder of its prayer, should be dismissed. The railroad company </seg>

            <seg id="p181">\ NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 181 Harlan county, Nebraska; that the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy railroad intersects the complainant's land at or near the northeast corner and runs in a southwesterly direction across the east half of the land in question, between the plaintiff's buildings and corrals and his pasture land. There are about 20 acres of buffalo grass pasture used by the complainant for the pasturing of his cattle and mules; there is a good grade crossing opening directly out of complainant's feed yard across the track into the pasture. Complainant's well and water tanks are on the east side of the track in the corral and he ia required to drive the cattle and mules across the track into the pasture and from the pasture to the feed yard to water, there being no water - ing facilities in the pasture. The complainant testified that he has eight head of mules and fire head of milch cows. The lay of the land at the point where the watering facilities are located is such that it is impossible for the complainant to run the water by pipe under the track to the pasture. The testimony in this case, so far as complainant is concerned, was so very meagre that the commissioner could not get as compre - hensive an idea of the situation as was necessary to make a finding in the case and complainant took his car and drove the commissioner and the attorney for the road out to the land to make personal ob - servation. It developed in the hearing, however, that complainant was con - ducting more of a grain raising farm than a stock and dairy farm, as the number of head of cattle, already testified to, would indicate. The complainant informed the commissioner that the 20 acres used for pasturing was good clay land soil and would make as good a cultivated field as any of the land that he had on his farm and that the grass in the pasture is what is known as buffalo grass and was not yielding feed for more than the five head of cattle and the eight mules that were in the pasture only part of the time, and in the dry season prac - tically no feed at all and was not used to exceed five months of the year, and this underground pass would not serve the complainant for any other purpose than the running of stock to and from this twenty - acre pasture tract. The testimony of the defendant railroad company showed that an underground pass at the point desired by the complainant would cost $1,146. This would practically amount to 57 1/3 dollars per acre, of which defendants would be required to stand $700 or practically $46.25 per acre, and complainant would be required to pay $223 or $11. IS per acre for the amount of land contained in the pasture. The law governing cases of this kind requires railway companies </seg>
            <seg id="p182">182 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT to provide and maintain at least one adequate crossing for the use of the land owner where the railroad crosses a farm, and in this case there is an adequate grade crossing in close proximity to complainant's feed yard, so that about the only inconvenience is the opening and closing of the gates and driving the stock to and from the pasture to the feed lot. Testimony also showed that. this line of the Burlington railroad is a branch of the Burlington system, and that there is only one passenger train each way a day except Sunday, and one freight train one way each day except Sunday. So there is not much danger of stock being injured or the person driving the stock being injured In driving stock over the grade crossing to and from the pasture. The Commission does not feel justified in requiring railroad com - panies to expend such a large amount of money when there is such a small amount of land to be served and so small an amount of stock kept by the complainant. The Commission feels that the complainant should set aside some of the land on the south side of the track for pasture purposes, seed it down to tame grass so that as a matter of economy he could pasture as many or more head of stock on about half the amount of land that is contained in this buffalo grass pasture, and break up the buffalo grass pasture and put it into crop. It would cost him less to do this than it would to pay the amount that he would be required to pay as his share of the crossing, and would entirely relieve the railroad company from any expense whatever and the grade cross - ing that is now there could be used by the complainant to go to and from the land used for machinery and teams to cultivate the land in question. The railroad companies of the state have thousands of places where small tracts of land are cut off by their rights of way intersecting farms, and where the necessity warrants it the Commission has held that the company should be required to furnish an adequate under - ground pass so that stock could pass to and from the pasture without Kng driven. But in this case the Commission does not find that re is sufficient necessity to warrant a finding requiring the railroad company to construct and maintain an underground pass.

Root, attorney for C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co.; Wymer Dressier, attorney for C. &amp; N. W. Ry. Co. RANDALL, Commissioner: Hearing on the above entitled case was held at the court house in Schuyler, Colfax county, on July 23, 1925, pursuant to notice pre - viously given to parties concerned. There was no formal complaint filed with the Commission, but there was a resolution passed by the chamber of commerce of Schuyler and filed with the Commission. There was also a petition signed by 84 business houses and citizens of Schuyler, headed by the Wells- Abbott-Nieman company, asking that the Nebraska State Railway Commission require the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad and the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Companies to construct a physi - cal connection between the roads at Nimburg south of the Platte river in Butler county, where the roads cross at a point about twelve miles south of Schuyler. Nimburg is a "blind" station on the Burlington railroad .85 of a mile west of where the roads cross, and the nearest agency station on the Burlington road to the proposed crossing is Edholm, four and seventy-five hundredths of a mile on the west, ten miles to Prague on the east and on the northwest 3.3 miles to Linwood and south to Abie 2.9 miles. Hence, the crossing would be at a point isolated from a station on either of the roads. It was shown by the testimony that at the point where the roads intersect there was quite a heavy fill, and that it would be necessary for the railroad company to purchase ground in which to get .sufficient ground to construct a grade for the connecting tracks at the point ■where the roads intersect. The only testimony produced by the com - plainants was that of Mr. Ehernberger, proprietor of the Platte Valley Gravel company and of Edward Donot, rate expert for the Wells- Abbott-Nieman Milling company, and J. Folda, a banker. None of the </seg>
            <seg id="p184">184 officers of the chamber of commerce or the Wells-Abbott-Nieman company, who had signed the application and no one directly inter - ested in the shipment of hay, testified, so that the only testimony produced by applicants for the physical connection was produced by the three witnesses above mentioned. Mr. Ehernberger is the proprietor and practically the sole owner of the Platte Valley Gravel company, and his testimony was largely problematical and not based on actual facts and figures on which the Commission could arrive at a substantial conclusion as to the volume of business he would furnish to the roads. The testimony of Edward Donot, rate expert for Wells-Abbott- Nieman company, did not show that the milling company was in need of the connecting track, either for a supply of wheat or a market for the finished product. The mill being situated on the main line of the Union Pacific railway at Schuyler, and also has a connecting switch with the C. B. &amp; Q. railroad at Schuyler for points south and east on the C. B. &amp; Q. for the in-shipment of wheat and the out-shipment of the finished products of the mill, except some nearby local points south of the Platte river, and these towns truck the product direct from the mill to their respective towns. There was no testimony show - ing that there is any demand for hay shipments over the proposed connecting track. The Platte Valley Gravel company's pit is located on the north side of the Platte river on the Union Pacific railway with a connect - ing track to the Burlington railroad running south across the Platte river into the territory covered by the Burlington railroad system. The Chicago and North Western railroad runs from Fremont in a south - westerly direction paralleling the Platte river from a point where it crosses the Platte river, to Linwood and David City and points south - west to Hastings. The North Western also has a line running south from Linwood to Seward and Superior. There are extensive sand pita at Fremont on the North Western railroad, also one at Morse Bluff on the North Western. Morse Bluff is located about 13.8 miles east of the place where the applicants had asked for the connecting track. There is also a sand pit located at Bellwood on the C. B. &amp; Q. Coad line from Columbus southeast to David City, Seward, Lincoln intermediate points, so that the territory served by the North tern railroad east, west and south, and the two lines of the C. B.

            <seg id="p185">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 185 Chicago and North Western Railway company produced the testimony of their engineers giving an estimate of the cost of the construction of the physical connection and the necessary track in case the Commis - sion should order the connection. The Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company filed an exhibit showing that the expense would be J11.272; the Chicago and North Western filed an exhibit showing that the expense would be $11,280. Both companies objected to the ap - plication for physical connection for identically the same reasons. First — That the expense the companies would be put to was not justified by any increase in business that the companies would re - ceive by reason of the connecting tracks. Second — That the point of connection was remote from an agency station and could not be policed without extra expense to the companies, and, Third — That a physical connection at that point would greatly increase the possibility of accidents by reason of the connection with the main tracks of both railroads. It was shown by the testimony of both railroads that they are required to place lights upon the switch stands in the evening and re - move them in the morning, and that the agent at the nearest point, which in this case would be Abie, on the Chicago and North Western, which is 2.9 miles from the proposed connecting track, would be&lt; re - quired to do this work, which would be an added expense to the company. It was further shown by the testimony of both railroad companies that where merchandise was transferred to the connecting track at that point that the opportunity for loss by theft would be so great that it would be necessary for the companies to furnish police protection, the cost for which would be considerable, and according to the esti - mates made on shipments, the expense would equal or exceed the total income from shipments received by the companies over the connecting track. There was no testimony from any witness showing that there was a demand from the public who de3ired to purchase either flour, hay, sand, or gravel, for the connecting track; or that it was necessary to supply the needs of the public in any commodity that would prob - ably be transferred at that point. Section 5379 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, aT amended, provides:. ..."at any place where the tracks of the two railroad com - panies are within five hundred feet apart, whether on the same g ade or not, where it is deemed reasonably necessary, the State Railway Commission, upon the application of any interested person, may re - quire such track connection." After taking into consideration all of the testimony introduced by </seg>
            <seg id="p186">186 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT I the applicants, the Commission does not believe that a connecting track at the point prayed for is reasonably necessary; and that the expense of construction and maintenance of such track by the com - panies wuold not be warranted by the business that would be offered by the shippers; and that the additional service to the public would not be of any particular benefit either in the supply of commodities shipped or in a reduction of prices to the consumer. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the application of Wells-Abbott-Nieman, et al., for a connecting track between the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad and the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway at Nimburg, south of the Platte river in Butler county, be denied and the case be dismissed.

OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman Complainant herein manufactures a burned clay product under trade name of "haydite." This dust is chiefly used as a filler in con - struction of asphaltic topping of pavement. It competes with lime - stone dust in this service. No specific classification of this product has been provided in the tariffs. Generally speaking it must move on the lowest class rates. Complainant alleges that discrimination exists in that it is de - nied opportunity to ship the competitive product haydite dust at the same rates as limestone dust is shipped, and asks relief under the law. In the preparation of the asphaltic surfacing in pavement, approximately 15 per cent of the quantities is composed of limestone dust. Haydite is a substitute used in identically the same manner. Both haydite dust and limestone dust are shipped in sacks of 100 pounds each, in box cars, weigh approximately the same per cubic foot, and sell f. o. b. manufacturing point, at very nearly the same prices. Defendant carriers" did not oppose the contention of complainant that limestone dust and haydite dust should be classified in the same manner and move at the same rates. They strenuously objected to any conclusion that the present rates on limestone dust are proper or should be applied to haydite dust. On June 19, 1925, all Nebraska roads filed an application for authority to publish rates on haydite in carloads, on a scale somewhat higher than the present rates for </seg>
            <seg id="p188">EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 188 limestone dust. That application did not include the proposition pre - sented in testimony in this cause, that the rate on limestone dust should also be advanced. Interveners presented some testimony to the effect that there is a difference between haydite dust and limestone dust warranting the application of different rates. That testimony was not convincing. The record in this case is not wide enough on which to predicate conclusions as to the proper rate to be applied on both haydite dust and limestone dust. The record is ample to support the conclusion that the present rates on haydite are discriminatory to that product as applied within the state of Nebraska. We are of the opinion and so find that the discrimination should be removed by applying to carload shipments of haydite, the rates legally applicable to lime- Ke dust. This conclusion in no wise prejudices further consodera - i upon proper presentation of the issue, of the question of the proper rate scale to be applied to both limestone dust, carloads, in sacks, and haydite dust, carloads, in sacks. The situation warrants the elimination of the discrimination in less than the statutory period of notice.

            <seg id="p189">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 189 FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 584 Clay County, Complainant, v. Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, Defendant. Appearances : For the complainant, C. H. Epperson, Harvard. For the defendant, J. W. Weingarten, attorney, Omaha; F. R. Mullen, division superintendent, Lincoln. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: The main line of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad com - pany between Lincoln and Denver passes through Harvard and at the southeast corner of the city it crosses a public highway on a section line; between sections 34 and 35, township 8, range 7, Clay county, Nebraska. The board of supervisors of Clay county allege that the crossing is unsafe and dangerous for vehicles on the highway and pray that defendant railroad be required to construct and maintain a suitable crossing and provide necessary drainage. By way of answer and defense, the railroad company submits a stipulation or agremeent between Clay county and defendant, entered into in 1905, whereby the railroad was to put in the necessary plank - ing at the tracks and between the rails, and the county was to con - struct the necessary grading and maintain the same so long as the road was used as a railroad crossing. Defendant's position is that by reason of this agreement and the judgment of the district court pursu - ant thereto, complainant is forever estopped from securing any other or further relief than that provided in the agreement. At the hearing in Harvard the testimony and evidence was sub - mitted showing in substance that the crossing in question was legally opened in 1905; that the highway from the south is full 66 feet in width, but from the center of the track north it is but 33 feet wide; that the road is not a main thoroughfare, but that since the streets of Harvard have been paved it has been used frequently by tractors, threshing machines and other heavy farm equipment; that the road - way crosses what would have been low ground and that the railroad grade is 10 to 12 feet above the natural surface of the ground; that the approach to the railroad track is steep and abrupt from both sides and makes the crossing of vehicles, and particularly heavy loads, difficult and dangerous; that there are natural drainage courses on both sides of the track, the one to the north being crossed by a frame </seg>
            <seg id="p190">EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 190 bridge or culvert, the two on the south passing under the roadway through 24-inch tile pipes; that the railroad right-of-way at this point »200 feet wide and the structures just referred to are within this ht-of-way; that the present bridge and culverts would have been •essary if the railroad had not been built. Transcript of the proceedings of the county board in opening the highway and of the district court in the appeal of the railroad com - pany from the finding of the appraisers as to damages, together with a copy of the stipulation are made a part of the record. From these it appears that after the necessary steps to open the road were taken the Burlington filed claim for $300 damages. This amount was recom - mended by the appraisers, but the board of supervisors disallowed the claim and ordered the road opened. Thereupon the railroad com- E appealed to the district court. Before the case came to trial the es entered into an agreement and when this was presented the | entered an order dismissing the appeal. The agreement was as ws: "It is hereby stipulated by and between the parties to this action that an appeal having been taken by the railroad company from the assessment of damages and location of a public highway across the railroad tracks, and said crossing having been made by agreement between the parties, the railroad company putting in the necessary planking immediately at the tracks and between the rails, and the county having agreed to construct the necessary grading and maintain the same in proper condition so long as said road is used at said railroad crossing: "NOW THEREFORE, the above entitled appeal from said proceeding is hereby dismissed out of court on consideration of the agreement that the said county will build and maintain the grade and approaches for said crossing, and the railroad company supply and place the necessary planks to make a suitable crossing over the tracks and rails. No costs to be taxed to the railroad company. "WITNESS our hands this 20th day of December, 1905. CHICAGO, BURLINGTON &amp; QUINCY RAILROAD COMPANY, (Signed) By H. E. Byram General Superintendent Nebraska District. (Signed) S. W. Christy and F. W. Deweese &amp; F. E. Bishop Attorneys for Plaintiff. Clay County, Nebraska (Signed) By W. H. Lewis Chairman, Board of Supervisors." As before stated, defendant relies on this contract and contends </seg>
            <seg id="p191">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 191 that the county is estopped from asking anything beyond its pro - visions. Complainant, on the other hand, argues that the law, (Section 5524, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922) having imposed the duty of making and maintaining the crossing on the railroad company, the agreement on the part of the county board was against public policy and was ultra vires and void. It is necessary to determine, therefore, the issue thus presented. The doctrine is well established that the police power of the state cannot be abridged by private contracts. Statutes for the regulation of the construction and maintenance of grade crossings constitute an exercise of the police power. The question raised here is, did the county have the power, through agreement with the railroad company, to waive the statutory obligations of the latter in the matter of the crossing? In Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R. Co. v. State of Nebraska, 18 U. S. 513, the supreme court of the United States passed on this point and laid down a rule which appears clearly to be applicable. The city of Omaha, under a legislative act of 1S85, entered into an agreement with the Union Pacific Railroad company and the Omaha &amp; Southwestern Railroad company whereby the latter were to assume three-fifths of the entire cost of a viaduct over railroad tracks on Eleventh street, such cost and damages not to exceed $90,000. Later the law was amended so as to make it the duty of a railroad company or companies to construct and maintain such viaducts upon the order of the city coun - cil. In 1894, the city council passed an ordinance requiring the Union Pacific and Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy, the latter successor to the Omaha &amp; Southwestern, to reconstruct the Eleventh street viaduct, the Union Pacific to pay two-thirds and the Burlington one-third of the cost. In resisting the enforcement of this ordinance the railroads cited the contract and contended that the amended statute was in - applicable. In its discussion of this contention the court said.: "No doubt, the agreement of 1886 constituted a contract, in such a sense that the respective parties thereto continued to be bound by its provisions so long as the legislation in virtue of which it was entered into remained unchanged. While the agree - ment lasted, its provisions defined the rights and duties of the city and the railroad companies. But was it a contract whose continuance and operation could not be affected or controlled by subsequent legislation? "Usually, where a contract, not contrary to public policy, has been entered into between parties competent to contract, it is not within the power of either party to withdraw from its terms, without the consent of the other; and the obligation of such a contract is constitutionally protected from hostile legislation. Where, however, the respective parties are not private persons, dealing with matters and things in which the public has no con - cern, but are persons or corporations whose rights and powers were created for public purposes, by legislative acts, and where the subject matter of the contract is one which affects the safety </seg>
            <seg id="p192">• 192 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT and welfare of the public, other principles apply. Contracts of the latter description are held to be within the supervising power and control of the legislature when exercised to protect the public safety, health, and morals, and that clause of the federal consti - tution which protects contracts from legislative action cannot in every case be successfully invoked. The presumption is that, when such contracts are entered into, it is with the knowledge that parties cannot, by making agreements on subjects involving the rights of the public, withdraw such subjects from the police power of the legislature." After discussing whether the contract imposed upon the city the duty of repairing and maintaining the viaduct, the court added: "Howoever this may be, we think that, in view of the para - mount duty of the legislature to secure the safety of the com - munity at an important crossing within a populous city, it was and is within its power to supervise, control, and change such agreements as may be, from time to time, entered into between the city and the railroad company in respect to such crossing, saving any rights previously vested. Any other view involves the proposition that it i3 competent for the city and the railroad company, by entering into an agreement between themselves, to withdraw the subject from the reach of the police power, and to substitute their views of the public necessities for those of the legislature." tThis doctrine was followed by the supreme court of Minnesota tate ex rel. v. St. P. M. &amp; M. Ry. Co., 108 N. W. Rep. 261, where said, quoting from the syllabus: "The state may, in the exercise of its police power, impose upon railroad companies whose lines intersect public highways, laid out after the construction of the railroad, the uncompen - sated duty of constructing and maintaining at such crossings all such safety devices as are reasonably necessary for the protec - tion of the traveling public. "A contract by a city, by which the police power is attempted to be forever abdicated, is ultra vires and void. "Neither the state nor a municipal sub-division therof, to which the power is delegated, can by affirmative action or by in - action, permanently divest itself of the power and authority to exercise it." It seems clear, therefore, that where the statute imposes upon defendant the duty to "make and keep in good repair, good and suf - ficient crossings for such road over (its) tracks, including all the grading, bridges, ditches, and culverts that may be necessary within ,(its) right-of-way" that obligation cannot be modified or avoided by contract with the county. We are of the opinion, consequently, that defendant should be required to maintain the crossing in question, just as it is required to maintain other highway crossings. How en - forcement of this rule would affect its right to damages because of </seg>
            <seg id="p193">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 193 the original opening of the highway we have no right to say, that being a matter entirely for the courts. We are of the opinion and so find that the crossing in its present condition is unsafe and that defendant should be required to make such changes in the approaches as will remedy such condition. The necessary grading and changes in structures will be subject of course, to the rule adopted by the Commission in Formal Complaint No. 528, wherein it was held that a railroad company is not under obligation to construct and maintain any part of the highway that would have been necessary had the railroad never been built. Applying this rule to this case we find that the bridge or culvert on the north side of the track and the two drain tiles on the south side, would be necessary even if the railroad did not exist, since it is admitted that they are located in natural drainage courses. Their erection and maintenance, at least to present size and standards, is an obligation of Clay county. Whatever changes or additions to them is made necessary by the addi - tional grading is an obligation to be borne by defendant. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company be, and the same hereby is, directed and ordered to place in a safe condition for public travel the crossing on its main line near Harvard, where the latter crosses the public highway on the section line between sections 34 and 35, township 8, range 7, Clay County, such repairs, improvements and additions to be as follows: The railroad company shall cause to be done all the necessary grading to make the highway approaches on both sides of the com - pany's tracks not less than sixteen feet wide, measured at right angles to the line of the highway, and the slope of the approaches from the top of tie on the railroad embankment to the level of the existing highway shall not exceed one foot vertically to fourteen feet hori - zontally. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the defendant company shall cause existing structures along the line of the above approaches which now serve to permit water to pass under the roadway to be lengthened to conform with the new grading described above. This shall be done by using the same carrying capacity as the construction found in each location. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the repairs and improvements herein required shall be completed at the earliest possible date, weather permitting, but in no event later than April 1, 1926. 7 </seg>

OPINION AND FINDING RANDALL, Commissioner: This action occurs upon the complaint of the city of Fullerton. Nance county, against the Union Pacific Railroad company in the language following, to wit: "Comes now the city of Fullerton, by R. A. Richardson, its mayor, and complains of the Union Pacific Railroad company, and alleges, 1. That the city of Fullerton is a municipal corporation of the second class with a population of over fifteen hundred and less than two thousand, in Nance county, Nebraska. 2. That the Union Pacific Railroad company is a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Utah and engaged in the business of common carrier and operating a railroad in the state of Nebraska and elsewhere and across a portion of the territory embraced in the corporate limits of the city of Ful - lerton. 3. That in maintaining said railway as it passes through the limits of the corporation of the city of Fullerton, said right-of - way is crossed by the public road known as State Highway No. 14, the same being an extension of Broadway street northward in said city of Fullerton; that upon the crossing of said highway of said railroad company there is a grade or fill which should and ought to be maintained and kept by the said Union Pacific Rail - road company, the same being upon their right-of-way; that here - tofore, in the month of June, 1925, said grade or fill upon said </seg>
            <seg id="p195">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 195 highway, being the extension of Broadway as the same intersects and crosses said railroad company's right-of-way in the city of Fullerton, was washed away, leaving a large hole or break in said grade which, is now filled with water and is entirely closed for passage; that the said railroad company has heretofore often been requested to repair said grade or fill, but have, and still do refuse so to do. WHEREFORE the city of Fullerton, a municipal corporation, as aforesaid, does pray that said company be ordered and com - pelled to fill up said road and repair said grade without further delay." Pursuant to notice previously gives, hearing who held on the 28th day of August, 1925, in the office of Kemp and Brower in the city of Fullerton. The testimony in this case shows that on the 23rd of June, 1925, there was a heavy rain storm that caused the Cedar river to overflow its banks at a point just south of the Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of Fullerton, washing out the highway leading from the paving in the city of Fullerton, between said paving and the Union Pacific Railroad track on the Union Pacific right-of-way, within the city limits of Fullerton. The testimony shows that the city of Fullerton had requested the Union Pacific Railroad company to replace the grade that had been washed away on the highway, which the Union Pacific refused to do and accordingly the complaint of the city of Fullerton was filed with the Railway Commission to require the Union Pacific Railroad company to repair the damage done to the highway. In the time in - tervening the city of Fullerton had proceeded to make the necessary repairs to the highway, by constructing a bridge over the opening in the highway, which had been washed away by the flood, at a cost of approximately $700. As the repairs had been made by the city of Fullerton and the case is one of equity, to be determined by the courts, the Commission does not have jurisdiction in cases of this nature. After careful consideration of the evidence and facts as were disclosed in the testimony at the hearing, the Commission is of the opinion that the complaint of the city of Fullerton against the Union Pacific Rail - road company should be dismissed. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the complaint of the city of Fullerton against the Union Pacific Railroad company be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. </seg>

Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. (SEAL) FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 543 Shenefelt Oil Company, Complainant, v. Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company, Defendant Appearances : For the complainant, S. D. Thornton, attorney, Neligh. For the defendant, Robert D. Neeley, attorney, Omaha; R. W. McGinnis, general agent, Lincoln. OPINION AND FINDING RANDALL, Commissioner: This action was brought upon the complaint of Dorsey L. Shene - felt of Neligh, against the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company, the complainant alleging that the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company had refused to enter into a lease with him on a lot adjacent to the side track of the defendant company for the erection of oil storage tanks at Neligh. The complainant also alleged that the de - fendant company had no valid reason why such a lease should not be granted as the defendant company has an abundance of leasable ground. The defendant company made answer to the complainant's petition that there were already sufficient storage tank facilities at Neligh to amply serve the community and that it would be unecon - omical for the defendants to dispose of any more ground at that place for such purpose and that plaintiff had not shown in any way his financial or other ability to make the location applied for desirable or economical from any standpoint. Hearing was held on the complaint at the office of the Railway Commission in the state capitol at Lincoln, on the 10th day of September, 1925, at 9 o'clock a. m., pursuant to notice previously given to all interested parties. The testimony of the complainant, Dorsey </seg>
            <seg id="p197">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 197 L. Shenet'elt, showed that he was at present engaged in the oil and gasoline delivery business at Neligh and in the surrounding country by the delivery to his patrons in a tank wagon to their respective places of business and homes, gasoline, kerosene and lubricating oils. That in order to successfully carry on the business it was necessary for him to have storage tanks on the defendant's right of way so that gasoline and oil could be pumped directly from the tank car into storage tanks. Complainant's testimony showed that he contemplated the in - stalling of storage tanks of eight thousand gallon capacity at an estimated expense of $1,251.80. He presented a financial statement showing the value of his present plant and accounts, tools, etc., amounting to $4,150, and cash on hand of $300; with liabilities in accounts and bills payable, not due, of $311.78, which would leave according to the exhibit a net worth of $4,138.22. The assets as shown in the statement were estimates made by the applicant. The town of Neligh is a county seat town, with about 1,800 inhabit - ants and now has three oil stations with storage tanks upon the de - fendant's right of way, the Sinclair Oil company having a capacity of 30,000 gallons; the Standard Oil company having a capacity of 34, - 000 gallons and the Neligh Oil company a capacity of 40,000 gallons, so that it would not seem from the number of stations now located at the town of Neligh that there was any monopoly existing in that line of business and the combined capacity of the three stations amounting to 104,000 gallons, would indicate that the town and surrounding country were well provided for. The testimony of defendant's witesses showed that the capacity of nearly all tank cars now used in the transporting of oil, range from 8,000 to 10,000 gallons, that there were very few tank cars with less capacity. It was shown by competent testimony that it was customary for oil storage stations to provide storage tanks of from 12,000 to 15,000 gallon capacity, in order to take care of full carloads and from 8,000 to 10,000 gallons without requiring the partially emptied tank car to stand on the side track until the capacity of the storage tank could take care of the full load. The defendant company objected to the leasing of the particular lot applied for by the complainant for three reasons: First, the defendant company denies the right of the Railway Commission to require them to make a lease for industry sites to parties who cannot make a satisfactory financial statement of their ability to construct standard equipment and with sufficient capital to conduct the business they propose to install. </seg>
            <seg id="p198">198 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Second, that the applicant was not financially able to install and maintain standard sized tanks and carry on the business in a manner that would not interefere with movement of cars on the side track adjacent to the ground applied for. Third, that this particular piece of ground was so close to the turn-out of the switch to the main line track that there would not be room for the company to use any part of the switch between the point where the tank car would be spotted for unloading and the turnout to the main track for the storage of cars at the west end of the switch, which at the present time is available for use by the company. The jurisdiction of the Commission runs to the prevention ot discriminations in matters of leaseholds on railroad rights of way. In determining whether such discrimination exists such rules of the carrier as require that applicant for lease shall show reasonable financial solidity, that structures shall be safely built, and a general plan of appearance shall be adhered to, will be considered proper and appropriate. In case of complaint the Commission must therefore review the carrier's conclusions as to the financial responsibility ot complainant The testimony of complainant shows that he has no available capital with which to carry on the business but* has been promised credit from private and banking sources. This applicant has no other means with which to construct build - ings, storage tanks, etc., than promised credit, either from an in - dividual or a bank and the Commission does not consider that there is capital in hand, but is of a very uncertain nature and might not be available at all, either for the erection of the necessary build - ings or tanks or for the carrying on of the business. Applicants for Industry sites should have sufficient funds for the erection of the buildings and carrying on of the contemplated business to satisfy the reasonable demands of the carrier. It follows that we must conclude that the rule of this carrier, under which the application was rejected, has not been unreasonably applied. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the complaint of Dorsey L. Shenefelt against the Chicago ft North Western Railway company be dismissed. </seg>

Driggs, assistant general freight agent; J. W. Weingarten, attorney. For the North Western, W. H. Jones, assistant general freight agent; Wymer Dressier, attorney. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman Between August 13 and August 22, 1923, inclusive, complainants shipped six carloads of crushed stone from Louisville, to Dodge street team track west of Omaha, the shipments moving via the Burlington to South Omaha and via the North Western to Dodge street. The rates charged were 3 cents by the Burlington to South Omaha and 3% cents by the North Western for its portion of the movement. These were the tariff rates in effect at the time of movement. Complainant alleges that the charges were unreasonable and asks reparation down to a basis of 4% cents per cwt. for the entire joint line movement, these being the rates now in effect. In support of its allegation complainant relies on the following points: (1) That on shipments in question the ton-mile earning! of the Burlington were 3 cents and of the North Western 13.7 cents; the car-mile earnings of the Burlington 93% cents and of the North Western $7.01. (2) That for years these two complainants have </seg>
            <seg id="p200">EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 200 maintained joint rates on rock from Louisville to Fremont by way of Omaha at 6% cents per cwt., a distance of 68 miles. (3) That on November 7, 1924, the Commission found that for a haul of this kind a rate of 4% cents per cwt. was reasonable and that the higher rates complained of in this case were unreasonable. (4) That under the order first entered fixing distance scales for crushed rock August 26, 1921, the carriers were not justified in publishing only single line rates. Defendant Burlington resisted the complaint on the following grounds: (1) That the rates challenged were put into effect upon the authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission and that the Nebraska State Railway Commission has no authority to direct repara - tion on any such rates charged. (2) That the rates charged were the only rates that could be legally collected and under such circum - stances, a finding directing reparation violates constitutional rights, federal and state. (3) That the rates complained of were put into effect at the request of shippers of sand, gravel and crushed stone and that they are now estopped from complaining. The North Western entered a general denial that the rates collect ed by it were unreasonable. That complainant paid and bore the charges assessed on these shipments was not seriously questioned at the hearing. Our con - clusions are as follows: (1) In measuring rates on shipments such as those here in question, due weight must be given to the fact that the ton-mile and car-mile earnings will be relatively high for the short hauls where the initial rate blankets over a wide zone. (2) The fact that the joint rate to Fremont for 68 miles was th&lt;3 same at the time the shipments moved as for 33 miles, was due to the initial blanket rate of both carriers, and it cannot be said at this time that a like rate for both distances is conclusive evidence of unreasonableness or discrimination. (3) The decision of the Commission on November 7, 1924, thai the use of the sum of the locals in measuring rates for joint hauls resulted in unreasonable charges, is not necessarily proof that like charges were unreasonable at a prior date. (4) Nothing warrants the conclusion of complainant that the original order of August 26, 1921, required the publication of the scale there set forth for two-line hauls. t </seg>
            <seg id="p201">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 201 (5) The rates complained of were not at the time the ship - ments moved, in effect by reason of the order of the interstate com - merce commission of August 26, 1921, but by authority of orders of the Nebraska State Railway Commission, dated May 5, 1922, and June 23, 1922. An order requiring reparation is within the jurisdiction of the Commission. (6) An order directing reparation based on competent evidence adduced at a hearing where defendants are represented or have opportunity to offer testimony and examine witnesses, does not violate any constitutional guaranties. (7) An informal approval of rates about to be established in 1921 does not estop complainant from attacking those rates as un - reasonable in 1923. No proof was presented that complainant did so approve. (8) In establishing the rates in effect at time these shipments moved, the Commission attempted to guard against the use of the initial rate for very short hauls by a series of specific per car rates ranging from $9 to $13.50 per car. On the shipments under dis - pute the haul of the Burlington was 27.9 miles and that of the North Western 5.1 miles. The haul of the North Western was not longer than hauls represented in the exceptions by the higher per car rates mentioned above. (9) We find that the proportion of the charges on the ship - ments here under review assessed by the Burlington was not un - reasonable and that under all the facts presented of record and here reviewed, the charges of the North Western on those shipments were unreasonable to the extent that they exceeded Wz cents per cwt.

OPINION AND FINDING RANDALL Commissioner: This action occurs upon the complaint of the South Central Tele - phone company against the Eustis Telephone exchange wherein com - plainants ask that the Eustis Telephone exchange be required to make connection with an additional wire that has been constructed up to the defendant's lines in the village of Eustis. Hearing was held at the time and place specified in notice issued by the State Railway Commission to the parties in interest, on the 17th day of November, 1925, at 1:00 P. M. in the I. O. O. F. hall, in the village of Eustis, in Frontier county. </seg>
            <seg id="p206">206 £jJ.LxJtl I JuCdPi i. XI AW IN LJ AJj KllirUlw X The facts in this case as shown by the testimony are as follows: The Eustis Telephone exchange does not have any country lines. Its entire system is confined within the corporate limits of the village of Eustis. All country and farm line service is supplied by eight farm lines, owned and maintained by the several farm line companies and the Eustis Telephone exchange switches for each of these companies for an annual fee of $5.60 per phone. The complainant, the South Central Telephone company, is one of these farm lines above mentioned, which are switched by the Eustis Telephone exchange and has been doing so for about twenty years. There has been a gradual increase of subscribers on this South Central Telephone company line until there were forty-five phones being served on two lines, which greatly impaired the service as the load was so excessive that patrons could not get reasonable phone service. This line ran south about twelve miles toward Holbrook, and there were eight subscribers on this line who did very little, if any, business at Eustis, but did most of their business at Holbrook and in order to get in communication with the town in which they transacted busi - ness it was necessary to go through the Eustis exchange. The line being overloaded and the service unsatisfactory, these eight sub - scribers living tributary to Holbrook, withdrew from line forty-four, which left twelve subscribers upon that line. This left twenty-five on line forty-three. The officers of line forty-three had a conference with the owner and manager of the Eustis Telephone exchange in regard to the splitting of line forty-three to relieve the load and increase the efficiency sometime previous to the eight subscribers leaving line forty-four, and he agreed with them that if they would stretch a third wire he would give them connection with the Eustis Telephone exchange. At the annual meeting of the South Central Telephone company action was taken upon the installing of a third wire and was favorably acted upon and the wire was accordingly purchased and erected, up to the village limits of Eustis, and attached to the Eustis Telephone exchange's pole. The manager of the Eustis Telephone exchange, when notified that this wire had been provided by the South Central Telephone company refused to connect up, giving as his reason that as these eight subscribers had left line forty-four it was not necessary, as the congestion on that line had been relieved and that the expense of connecting up would be so great that he could not afford to assume that expense. Also, that as the wire at that time was encased in a pipe running under the Burlington railroad track, there was no more wire with which to connect this third wire and further than that, that he had no drop on his switch board. </seg>
            <seg id="p207">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 207 The South Central Telephone company had completed the erection of this wire on March 4th, 1925, at a cost of approximately $150. The testimony shows that there were several conferences held between the different officers of the South Central Telephone company and the manager of the Eustis Telephone exchange and that the man - ager of the Eustis Telephone exchange was well aware of the over loaded condition of line forty-three and that the service that the patrons were getting was unsatisfactory, but with all this information he refused to make the connection, so that the patrons on line forty - three were compelled to put up with the class of service that they were receiving on the overloaded wire. On September 29, 1925, the officers of the South Central Tele - phone company filed Formal Complaint No. 550 with the Railway Commission, but previous to the filing of this formal complaint, they filed an informal complaint in regard to the service and the refusal of the Eustis Telephone exchange to connect up the wire which they had stretched. The Railway Commission at once caused their assist - ant engineer to go to Eustis, make a checking of the Eustis Telephone exchange lines and report to the Commission as to what, in his judg - ment, would give the people on this switch line reasonable and ade - quate service. He reported that under the present condition it would be impossible for the people on line forty-three to get reason - able and satisfactory service, that the line should be split so there would not be over twelve or thirteen on each line, and that the only way this line could be connected up with the exchange at that time, on account of all wires in the conduit being used, would be the in - stallation of another conduit under the track, or the erection of two thirty-five foot poles to carry the wires across the track to the exchange, which would entail an expense of approximately $25. Some - time during the month of September, the Eustis Telephone exchange erected an overhead twenty-five pair cable line leading south across the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. tracks, in order to take care of the business south of the track. The testimony shows that only sixteen of these pairs are being used and there are ample pairs to which the wire stretched by the South Central Telephone company could be con - nected and sufficient drops on the switchboard for complete connection. The testimony shows that the South Central Telephone company have brought their line into and attached it to a pole owned by the Eustis Telephone exchange within the corporate limits of the village of Eustis and that this pole is between 500 and 600 feet from the south end of the cable to which the line would be connected in order to make the connection with the exchange. There are some four or five telephone poles in use with the necessary cross-arms, pins and some insulators, so that the only expense that the Eustis Tele- </seg>
            <seg id="p208">208 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT phone exchange would have in connecting up line forty-three with their switchboard would be 500 or 600 feet of number 12 or 14 galvanized wire and the little expense of labor, which was shown by the testimony of the owner of the Eustis Telephone exchange would not exceed $2. It was also shown that it would not take to exceed ten pounds of wire to connect up from where the companies wire is now located to the cable, the cost of the wire was shown to be .074 cents per pound. The owner and manager of the Eustis Telephone exchange claimed that the patrons of this line forty-three were getting as good service as. they were entitled to and showed a disposition that was very antagonistic to the patrons of both lines forty-three and forty-four, and from the testimony of all the witnesses, including the owner of the Eustis Telephone exchange it was very clearly shown that the only reason that this connection had not been made and the patrons on line forty-three given more efficient service was just simply because the owner of the Eustis Telephone exchange did not want to connect up His attitude all through the proceedings was that of an obstreperist against the patrons of the switched lines and seemed to lose sight of the fact that he should furnish the very best service possible to his patrons. His testimony was that it would cost an unreasonable amount to connect up and when he stated the figures, he stated that it would be from $15 to $25, but when the actual figures were ob - tained from the witness himself it was shown that it would not cost to exceed $3. The testimony of every witness that was served on line forty-three was that the service was poor and at times could not be used at all. The owner of the Eustis Telephone exchange produced three witnesses who testified that the service was reasonably good but it developed that all three of these witnesses were on line forty - four and there were only twelve subscribers, they also testified that the service had been greatly improved since the eight subscribers had been detached from their line and connected up* with the Holbrook line. The experience of the Commission and the experts connected with t Commission is that it is impossible to get reasonable service over overloaded line and that when over twelve phones are connected any rural line the line is overloaded, and that if it is possible to construct additional lines to relieve the congestion it is a practical solution to the matter and should be required. In this case the South Central Telephone company have constructed this wire and maintain it. All the expense the Eustis Telephone exchange will have will be to connect it up and the South Central Telephone company can cut over onto this line twelve of their phones and relieve the present congestion and so far as the number of phones on a line is concerned will give reasonable service to the patrons on that line. </seg>
            <seg id="p209">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 209 After duly considering all the facts in the case the Commission is of the opinion that the Eustis Telephone exchange should be re - quired to connect up this additional line of the South Central Tele - phone company with the Eustis Telephone exchange. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Eustis Telephone ex - change be required to connect up the wire from the present terminus of the wire where it has been connected to the Eustis Telephone exchange pole south of the railroad tracks at Eustis, to the cable wires leading over the tracks to the Eustis Telephone exchange and to connect said wires to the switchboard in the Eustis Telephone exchange and furnish service to the patrons of that line within fifteen days from date of the receipt of this order.

(SEAL) ORDERS ON INFORMAL COMPLAINTS INFORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 6084 Citizens of Howe, Complainants, v. Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, Defendant. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: This is a proceeding instituted pursuant to the provisions of chapter 144, Session Laws of Nebraska 1923, reading as follows: "A telephone exchange, central office and switchboard shall be maintained where there is an existing exchange by one or more telephone companies operating more than ten exchanges, in every incorporated city or village in the State of Nebraska, and no existing exchange, or central office shall be abandoned or discontinued by any company or removed to another city or vil - lage except by the written consent of at least sixty per cent of </seg>
            <seg id="p210">210 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT the subscribers or patrons who had rental or exchange service contracts with said company at a date six months before the circulation of any such petition, and until said petition has been presented to the State Railway Commission with the proper number of signers and upon a hearing the said Railway Commis - sion issues a report, finding, decision or order permitting such discontinuance or abandonment." Petitioners are patrons of the Howe exchange of the Lincoln Tele - phone and Telegraph company. They ask that the central office at Howe be abandoned and that they be transferred to lines extending out from the Auburn exchange. The law requires 60 per cent of the patrons of the company as signatories to a petition consenting to the abandonment of an exchange. At the time this petition was circulated there were 99 subscribers served by the company from its Howe exchange. Seventy-three of these subscribers signed the petition submitted to the Commission, which provides a safe margin over the required percentage. The statute provides that the petition shall be presented to the Commission and "upon a hearing the said Railway Commission issues a report, finding, decision or order permitting such discontinuance or abandonment." The character and extent of the investigation to be prosecuted by the Commission is not clearly in - dicated by this language. In compliance with the requirement, how - ever, the Commission held a hearing at Howe at which the company submitted a rather complete statement covering the operation of its exchange, together with a showing as to the revenues and expenses in event the exchange is abandoned and service furnished from Auburn. A committee representing the petitioners were present and urged the change in service as outlined in the petition. As stated, the company is now serving 99 subscribers at Howe, 7 of these being one party business, 7 one party residence, 6 four party residence and 79 farm. The rates at present are: business $2.50 per month, one party residence $1.50 per month, four party residence $1.35 per month and farm $1.35 per month. In addition subscribers have the option of connection with the Auburn exchange at an addi - tional charge of 25 cents per month. Sixty-seven of the 99 subscribers have taken this added service. It is proposed to serve all of the present Howe subscribers from lines extending out from Auburn. The regular Auburn farm line rates will be applied for such service. These rates are $1.50 for farm line residence and $2.50 for farm line business. The full Auburn exchange area would be afforded to the subscribers thus transferred. It will be noted that all farm sub - scribers now paying the added rate from Auburn service would, under the proposed change, have their rate reduced from $1.60 per month to $1.50 per month. In this connection it should be stated that the village of Howe </seg>
            <seg id="p211">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 211 is less than six miles south of Auburn. At the present time the farm lines of the Auburn exchange approach within a short distance of the village limits and serve territory on either side, in some instances extending beyond. It is obvious, therefore, that the Howe territory is considerably circumscribed and that service to the territory as a whole would be unified and improved if furnished from Auburn. It is this condition which prompts petitioners to ask for the change. Business men in Howe will be somewhat inconvenienced through having to accept party line service as a substitute for the individual line service with which they are now furnished. One business man appeared to mildly object to this inconvenience although he stated that the change would probably be of benefit to him generally, since it would offer opportunity for farmers in the Howe territory to reach Howe business men without an added charge. The telephone company is not objecting to the change. Accord - ing to figures which it submits, it will cost approximately $1,000 to make the change. An increase in pole line construction to the Auburn exchange will cost $2,600. From this is deducted $1,600 representing the cost of the property that will be abandoned at Howe. Interest, taxes, depreciation and maintenance of added $1,000 in property are estimated at $200 per annum. There will be an estimated loss in revenue due to the changes in rates of $405. Saving in operating expenses due to the abandonment of the Howe exchange will aggre - gate $732.80. It is estimated, therefore, that the company will experience a net annual saving of $127.56 if the change is made. From a financial standpoint both subscribers and company will benefit. The subscribers will pay $405 less for their service and the company will effect a saving of $127. This unusual situation is worthy of remark. If under the statute the Commission is called upon to exercise any discretion in a case of this kind, there would appear to be no reason why approval should be withheld in this particular case. All patrons are agreed that the service will be improved and that it can be provided at a less cost from the Auburn exchange. The only con - dition that would seem desirable would be that business subscribers at Howe be grouped upon one or more lines and that the number be limited to six on a line. ORDER It is therefore found that the provisions of Chapter 144, Session Laws of Nebraska 1923, have been complied with by petitioners in this case and by the Lincoln Telephone and Telegraph company and it is considered and ordered that the said Lincoln Telephone and Telegraph company be and the same hereby is authorized and directed to abandon </seg>

FINDINGS AND ORDER BY THE COMMISSION: STATEMENT This matter came on for hearing on the application of all Ne - braska carriers to establish Western Classification No. 58 for use on all Nebraska intrastate traffic. On May 29, 1924, the Commission entered a preliminary finding and order in this application in which it said: "This Commission is of the opinion that the joint investiga - tion by the Interstate and Nebraska Commissions will be materi - ally simplified if the classification differences between intrastate and interstate traffic can be harmonized before the general joint hearing is commenced. To this end, a hearing was held on May 27th at which time it was unanimously the sentiment of Ne - braska shippers there represented, that one classification should apply on all Nebraska intrastate traffic. At an early date, the Commission will set down for further hearing, the question of the adoption of a classification that will apply on all Nebraska intrastate traffic, to the end that, in the final determination of the application here considered, the classification, ratings, rules and regulations will be the same on all intrastate traffic." (17 N. S. R. C. 256-268.) On October 21, 22 and 23, 1924, full hearing was had on all of the matters of issue and the case was submitted for final con - sideration by the Commission. HISTORY The Railway Commission Act of 1907 required that the Com - mission establish a classification of freight to apply on all Nebraska intrastate class freight. On October 31, 1911, the Commission enter - ed an order establishing Nebraska Classification No. 1, effective De - cember 15, 1911. From time to time supplements to said Nebraska Classification No. 1 were entered by the Commission. On the 3 of July, 1916, the Interstate Commerce Commission entered an order that found that there was unlawful discrimination existing between Missouri River cities in Iowa, Missouri and Kansas and Nebraska stations on the one hand and the thirteen jobbing cities </seg>
            <seg id="p215">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 215 located in Nebraska to-wit: Omaha, Lincoln, Fremont, Beatrice, Nor - folk, Hastings, Grand Island, St. Paul, Columbus, Kearney, Nebraska City, Fairbury and Plattsmouth and all other Nebraska stations oa the other. On October 16, 1916, the federal court of the district of Ne - braska entered a temporary injunction, afterwards made permanent, against the Railway Commission and the Attorney General of the state of Nebraska enjoining them from interfering with the carriers from applying current Western Classification provisions between Ne - braska stations and the thirteen jobbing points just mentioned. In January, 1918, under its war powers the government took control of the steam roads of the country. In February 29, 1920, the government returned the roads to their owners under a guaranty provision for a period of six months as contained in the Transportation Act of 1920. Effective September 1, 1920, the Interstate Commerce Commission entered an order which authorized an increase in all freight charges and passenger fares in the western district of the United States of 35 per cent with certain exceptions as to passenger train services. Effective September 1, 1920, the Nebraska Commission authorized an increase in freight rates on all Nebraska intrastate traffic of 25 per cent. Immediately there - after Nebraska carriers filed a complaint with the Interstate Commerce Commission alleging that the rates and fares as provided in the order of the Nebraska Commission last mentioned were discriminatory as against "interstate commerce" and asked that the discrimination be removed and the level of rates, fares and charges as provided in the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission in Ex Parte No. 74 be applied to intrastate business. On January 27, 1921, carriers operating in Nebraska obtained an order of injunction from the United States district court for the dis - trict of Nebraska preventing this Commission, the Attorney General and certain persons representatives of passengers and shippers of freight from enforcing the order entered by the Nebraska Commission dated August 23, 1920, effective September 1, 1920, hereinbefore men - tioned. The order of the court here mentioned had the effect of temporarily suspending the authority of the Nebraska Commission over the intrastate rates and classifications applicable on Nebraska traffic with certain modifications, all fully explained in the supple - mental findings and order in Application 4299 published in the annual report of the Commission for 1922, commencing at page 205. We quote the following from the findings of the Commission in the order just mentioned: "It is incumbent upon us in the interest of shippers of this state immediately to accept the general level of rates prescribed </seg>
            <seg id="p216">216 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT by Congress and applied with the approval of the supreme court of the United States by the Interstate Commerce Commission. That we may be in conformity with the decision' of the supreme court of the United States, and to dispense with further litigation, this Commission should make an order authorizing the carriers in this state to establish and maintain rates and charges applic - able to intrastate transportion corresponding to those prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission under Ex Parte 74, except as to passenger fares which, as stated above, this Com - mission cannot increase. It will be observed that the rates and tares which we shall authorize are those which are now in force and effect, and have been in force and effect, for more than a year." Section (d) of the order reads as follows: "All rates increased by change in classification since said respective dates, not approved by this Commission." On May 5, 1922, the Nebraska Commission resumed their author - ity over intrastate traffic. At this time Western Classification No. 57, together with certain supplements, were in effect between the thirteen Nebraska jobbing points and other Nebraska stations and Ne - braska Classification No. 1, with supplements thereto, controlled all class freight traffic moving between other stations in this state. Effective May 31, 1924, the Commission authorized Western Classi - fication No. 58 and current supplements thereto, to apply between the thirteen jobbing points and Nebraska stations in lieu of Western Classification No. 57. Nebraska Classification No. 1 At the time Nebraska Classification No. 1 was established by this Commission on Nebraska intrastate traffic, intrastate classifications were in effect in the states of Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Virginia. Up to the time the Nebraska Classification was made effec - tive on Nebraska state traffic there had been a general tendency on the part of the states to establish their own intrastate classifications. Since that time, however, there has been a general movement all over the country to consolidate state and interstate classifications. The following classifications, Official, Southern and Western were con - solidated into one volume, effective December 30, 1919. In this con - solidated classification uniform packing requirements and as far as practicable, uniform classification of freight were established. This consolidation of the major classifications was brought about by the insistent demand of the Interstate Commerce Commission, for the carriers to publish a consolidated classification. The movement for this consolidation of classifications commenced on account of a resolu - tion adopted by the National Association of State Railroad Com - missioners, at their annual session held in 1893. Generally speaking the packing requirements as now provided in Nebraska Classification No. 1 are those that were in effect on inter- </seg>
            <seg id="p217">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 217 state traffic at the time that Nebraska Classification No. 1 was under consideration namely, 1910 and 1911. Since that time, however, a great many changes have been made in the packing requirements, rules and regulations governing the interstate classification of freight now appearing in Consolidated Classification No. 3 which is Western Classification No. 58. In the preliminary order entered in this application heretofore referred to we said: "it was unanimously the sentiment of Nebraska shippers there represented, that one classification should apply on all Nebraska intrastate traffic." In the hearings held since that time there has been no expression of Nebraska shippers other than that contained in the language just quoted. After careful consideration of all the facts of record in this pro - ceeding the Commission is of the opinion and so finds that Nebraska Classification No, 1, together with the supplements in effect as ot October 23, 1924, should be canceled and in lieu thereof the provisions as carried in Western Classification No. 58, together with the supple - ments that were in effect on October 23, 1924, should be made applic - able on all Nebraska intrastate class rate freight; provided, however, that the exceptions hereinafter specifically referred to should be made applicable on Nebraska freight moving under class rates be - tween all points in this state. CONCLUSIONS We will now proceed to the consideration of the matters sub - mitted in testimony October 21, 22 and 23, 1924, relative to the ex - ceptions that should be published by the carriers to apply on Nebraska intrastate traffic in connection with Western Classification No. 58 and supplements thereto, effective October 23, 1924, which we have here - tofore found should be applied to all Nebraska traffic. In discussing the testimony here under consideration the following legend will be used in stating the findings of the Commission: 1. Nebraska Classification No. 1, together with supplements in effect as of October 23, 1924, will be spoken of as Nebraska Classification. 2. That Western Classification No. 58, together with supple - ments in effect as of October 23, 1924, will hereinafter be men - tioned as Western Classification. 3. That Western Trunk Lines Rules Circular No. 17-E, I. C. C. No. A-1495, together with supplements in effect as of October 23, 1924, will be referred to as Western Trunk Line Rules Circular. 4. That the words "No change" mentioned in connection with Western Trunk Line Rules Circular will be understood to mean that the rule referred to by number is not to be changed </seg>
            <seg id="p218">218 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT in any particular in so far as Nebraska intrastate traffic is con - cerned. 6. That the word "Canceled" shall be understood to mean that the rule specifically referred to shall be canceled in the Western Trunk Line Rules Circular in so far as Nebraska intra - state traffic is concerned. 6. That the words "Apply to all Nebraska intrastate traffic" shall be understood to mean that the rule specifically referred to shall be corrected so as to apply on all Nebraska intrastate freight business. 7. The words "Apply when modified" shall be understood to mean that the specific rule referred to shall be modified as provided herein and when so modified will be applicable on Ne - braska intrastate traffic. Western Trunk Line Rules Circular in connection with effective supplements in effect October 23, 1924, applying on Nebraska intra - state traffic will be specifically referred to on the following pages, rule by rule, and the above legend will be understood to state the decision of the Commission in disposing of this proceeding. The Commission has given careful consideration to all of the facts of record and does not think that it is necessary in these findings to state the reasons why it has arrived at the conclusions that will be stated on subsequent pages of this finding and order. Some of the conclusions reached by the Commission may need to be modified. It would be quite unusual if the decision of the Commission in a hear - ing of the magnitude of the one herein considered should be so nearly perfect that it would not need further consideration. If and when these matters are called to the attention of the Commission they will be considered promptly. It is the desire of the Commission to au - thorize changes in and the establishment of rules in Western Trunk Line Rules Circular from time to time, effective on intrastate traffic at the same time that the supplements may be made effective on inter - state business. Whether or not we will be able to accomplish this desire will depend very largely upon the promptness with which the matters are submitted for the Commission's consideration and the magnitude of the applications presented. Attached to and made a part of this finding and order will be found a copy of Western Trunk Line Rules Circular No. 17-E to - gether with supplements thereof in effect on October 23, 1924. In the following findings under the caption of "Exceptions" this Rules Circular and supplements will be referred to as Exhibit "A". Each rule that affects Nebraska intrastate traffic will be treated separately and will be understood as representing the Commission's findings on the specific rule referred to. </seg>

Testimony presented at the hearing was to the effect that large amounts of labor have been donated by stockholders during the con - struction and development of these properties, for which no com - pensation has been received by them. Testimony also shows that during the entire history of the company, additions and betterments have been taken care of out of surplus earnings. It is difficult to determine with any degree of accuracy either the value of donated labor, or the amounts used from earnings for additions and better - ments. As a result of these practices, however, the company has de - veloped a property, the value of which is much in excess of outstand - ing capital stock. Accordingly this application is filed requesting authority to issue a stock dividend in such amount as the Commission finds the facts justify. The company has presented but little testimony from which might be deduced definite conclusions as to the proper amount of such a stock dividend. Testimony does indicate that something like $3300 was spent, out of surplus earnings, during 1911 and 1912. The company estimates that since that time, approximately $200 per year has been spent from earnings for additions and betterments. This would make a total of $5900 taken from surplus earnings for additions and betterments since the organization of the company, ac - cording to company estimates. No estimate is made as to value of donated labor, it merely being stated in testimony that it was a con - siderable amount. In addition to the above figures which are of no considerable value for purposes of this case because of the element of speculation entering into them, the Commission has at hand figures which result from studies made by its engineering department. In June, 1923, a physical valuation of these properties was made and an original con - struction cost of $26,989, and a depreciated original cost of $18,238 was found. It seems necessary to utilize this figure in reaching con - clusions. The company accepted it as satisfactory and it is the only one available which is based upon definite information. In previous instances the Commission has permitted the issuance of stock dividends in amount not exceeding the difference between securities outstanding, and the present depreciated value of the </seg>
            <seg id="p232">232 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT property based on costs. In the instant case, there seems to be suffi - cient justification and necessity for the issuance of a stock dividend representing such a margin, in that the company finds it necessary to issue and sell certain additional stock. It is desired to retain unto present stockholders by means of this stock dividend, the results of sacrifices previously made, and of property accumulated thereby. The issuance of such a stock dividend to present stockholders prior to the issuance and sale of new stock, would of course accomplish such a result and would prevent new stockholders from sharing therein. Such an attitude appears tenable and places the stock issue within the scope of statutory provisions (section 676 Session Laws of Nebraska 1925) which require that it must be "reasonably required for the said purposes of the corporation." The Commission will authorize such stock dividend up to an amount approximating the figure found by its engineering department as the depreciated original cost. Applicant also requests authority to issue and sell additional com - mon stock, the proceeds realized therefrom to be used for the metalli - cizing of certain rural lines; also for purpose of constructing additional rural properties, such additional construction being necessary as a result of overloading of some of its farm lines. It is stated that not less than 32 miles of rural grounded line is to be paralleled by an electric transmission line. This necessitates metallicizing such rural construction, at an estimated cost of $2500. It is estimated that the cost of construction of further rural lines to relieve present overload - ing, will be in the neighborhood of $750. The issue and sale of addi - tional stock appears to be justified by existing conditions. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Daykin Telephone company of Daykin be and it hereby is authorized to issue and distribute pro rata amoung its stock - holders, its further common stock, in an aggregate amount of $S,000, the new stock to be issued only to those stockholders presenting stock certificates or in lieu thereof an affidavit proving ownership and show - ing that said certificates have been lost or destroyed.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 5345 In the Matter of the Application of the Lincoln Telephone and Tele - graph Company for Authority to Publish Rates for Pay Station Service. Appearances : For applicant, Thomas Woods, attorney; W. E. Bell, commercial superintendent; H. F. McCulla, assistant commercial super- intendent. For subscribers, Roy Ford, attorney, Lincoln Retail Grocers' Association. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman This application prays for authority to publish rates for coin-box telephone service. In general it is proposed to establish public pay stations in places where there is a sufficient public demand, at a rate of five cents per local message. These telephones are to be located on premises where the subscriber has separate and distinct service. At the same rate it is proposed to establish semi-public coin-box sta - tions on premises where the subscriber will use that service as well as the general public. For the public telephone no guaranty from the subscriber is proposed. For the semi-public stations a guaranty of $5.50 per month is demanded, the subscriber to receive a commission of 25 per cent on the monthly receipts in excess of the guaranty and to make up any deficits in the guaranty. </seg>
            <seg id="p234">234 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT The application appears to cover in its scope the entire system of the company. Notices of the hearing and testimony relative to the advisability of the rate and rules, were confined to the city of Lincoln. At this time the order will relate only to service in the city of Lincoln, and suburbs being served from the Lincoln exchange. In support of its application the company alleged that Lincoln is the only city of its size in the United States, so far as the informa - tion of witnesses went, where coin-box service was not in use in public and semi-public locations. It was stated that the service as it is in existence in Lincoln in some places, is very greatly abused in that large numbers of non-subscribers paying no revenue to the telephone company, use the service. Some special counts were made which indicated that in certain localities several hundred calls a day were placed, very few of these being for the business house paying for business service. Counsel for respondents objected chiefly on the assumption that the installation of public or semi-public coin-box service would be impressed upon business subscribers widely, to their very serious dis - advantage and inconvenience. At the conclusion of the testimony of applicant, motion was made by counsel for the Retail Merchants' Association for a continuance in order that he might present his clients separately, and testify as to the effect on their business, of the company's proposal. The Commission suggested as an alternative, conclusions embodied in the order herein. These conclusions were acceptable to applicant and to attorney for Protestants. The latter withdrew his motion for further hearing with the understanding that the order entered would embody the condi - tions suggested. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission, that the Lincoln Telephone and Telegraph company be and it hereby 1b authorized to publish and collect rates for public and semi-public coin-box local message business service under the follow - ing conditions: I. PUBLIC TELEPHONES. A. Public telephones will be installed at places where telephone company and subscribers are mutually agreeable, and where tbe sub - scriber is served by other equipment. The charge will be five cents' per message for local service. No guaranty of receipts will be required of an agent, or sub - scriber, on whose premises the telephone is located. </seg>
            <seg id="p235">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 235 B. In case the subscriber desires this service to the public from his premises, and the telephone company does not deem such service advisable, the name of the subscriber will be forwarded to the Com - mission by the telephone company, and the matters in disagreement will be adjusted at informal conference in the Commission's office. The subscriber may in like manner originate the conference before the Commission by bringing the disagreement to its attention. II. SEMI-PUBLIC TELEPHONES. A. Semi-public telephones will be installed where the subscriber desires to serve the public and himself over the same equipment, where it is mutually agreeable to subscriber and telephone company that such service shall be installed. The rate for this service shall be five cents per local message with a guaranty of $5.50 per month. Where the monthly receipts of the coin-box are less than the amount above, the subscriber shall pay the difference. A commission of 25 per cent will be paid the subscriber as agent, on all receipts above the monthly guaranty. Coin box extension sets shall be $1.00 per month each, in add! tion to the charges stated above. B. Where the telephone company concludes the present location of any business telephone subjects the service to too indiscriminate a public use, and requests a change of location or the installation of semi-public service, and where the subscriber disagrees with the suggested re-location, or the installation of the per message service, the name of the subscriber shall be sent to the Commission by the telephone company and the matters under dispute will be considered at an informal conference in the Commission's office. The subscriber in like manner, may originate the conference by bringing the dispute to the attention of the Commission. In disputed cases no changes shall be made until conclusions are reached by the Commission. III. Where re-location of present station equipment occurs, either upon agreement between the company and the subscriber, or upon conclusions of the Commission, such change shall be made with - out cost to the subscriber. Service change charges on file with the Commission shall not apply to changes of equipment under this order. IV.

NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Thome A. Browne, Chairman. Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 5346 In the Matter of the Application of the Western Public Service Com - pany for Authority to Issue and Sell Securities. Appearances: For applicant, Clarence A. Davis, counsel For the Commission, U. G. Powell, rate expert; B. E. Forbes, chief engineer; I. J. Devoe, accountant. SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman: Applicant is a Colorado corporation, incorporated on the 12th day of June, 1912, for the purpose of engaging in operation of electric light, power, ice and gas plants, water works and street railways. It serves at this time, eighty-one communities in Texas, Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska and Missouri, and in most of these communities does a public utility business. It serves retail and wholesale, thirty - nine Nebraska municipalities. Under date of December 20, 1923 (16 N. S. R. C. 381-386) this Commission authorized applicant company to issue and sell $3,500,000 twenty year 6% per cent first mortgage bonds and $1,500,000 of 7 per cent ten year debenture bonds. The proceeds from the sale of $3,000,000 of the bonds and $646,000 of the debentures, were to be used in funding and refunding interest bearing obligations. The re- </seg>
            <seg id="p237">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 237 inainder of the funds to be secured from the sale of securities, was to be used for development purposes under the restrictions of the mortgage indenture. None of these securities were sold. Applicant alleges the reason to have been that the market for bonds improved so rapidly as to lead to the conclusion that lower rated securities might be disposed of. Applicant now asks the approval of this Commission to an issue of $4,200,000 of first mortgage 6 per cent twenty-flve year gold bonds, to be sold at 90% per centum of par, and $1,000,000 par value of ten year debenture gold notes bearing interest at the rate of 6 % per cent, same to be sold at not less than 90 per centum of par. It is also desired to sell $500,000 of first preferred stock at eighty-five cents on the dollar. As of date September 30, 1923, the Commission approved the refunding of all the underlying indebtedness covering all the prop - erties of applicant as then existing. It did not attempt to pass on the amount of property back of the securities nor on the stability of the securities, the issue of which was being approved. The position taken was that most all, if not all, the indebtedness had been incurred prior to the jurisdiction of the Commission and that the application had for its purpose the changing of the form of the indebtedness without increasing it. However, during the year 1924 the company acquired large amounts of property and paid for them through the sale of approxi - mately $1,300,000 of additional securities, $703,000 of which were issued and sold contrary to the statutes of this state. The Commission in this application did not inquire further relative to the securities issued prior to September 30, 1923. It required applicant to make careful showing as to the expenditures of the net proceeds from the sale of securities in 1924, and the use to which such proceeds were put. The net proceeds which would be derived from the sale of secur - ities mentioned in the application, would be as follows: $4,200,000 6% first mortage bonds at 90%....$ 3,801,000.00 An analysis of the testimony as to the purposes to which the pro reeds are to be put, is as follows: ,000,000 6%% debentures at 90 900,000.00 500,000 7% preferred stock at 85 425,000.00 Total net proceeds 5,126,000.00 </seg>

L (Approx) $ 300,000 Trinity, Tex. j FUTURE CONSTRUCTION Additions and betterments $ 150,000 WORKING CAPITAL 116,139 Total $ 5,126,000 During the year 1924 the company sold $703,000 of underlying securities without complying with the Nebraska statute, and $600,000 of short-time notes. From the sale of these securities the company realized $1,205,910. We have checked the disposition of these funds and find that they were used for proper corporate purposes. During the first two months of 1925, $408,000 par value of short-time notes were sold from which was realized $395,000 approximately. All but $35,000 of this money can be traced into property purchases. During the year 1924 the company increased its preferred stock in amount $218,828. This stock was Issued without complying with Nebraska statute. It was used to retire dividend scrip issued at various times since 1918. The testimony does not warrant conclusions as to whether such issues were for legitimate purposes and the same is not authenticated at this time. In support of its application, the company submitted the results of appraisals of the entire property, made by Day &amp; Zimmermann of Philadelphia, and also analysis of the books made by Haskins &amp; Sells of New York and Denver. </seg>
            <seg id="p239">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 239 The plant account as of December 31, 1924, is shown to be $6, - 324,231.62. The report of the accountant indicates clearly how these totals were arrived at. They are of little value to this Commission in determining whether approval should be given to the security issues asked for in this application. The company has during the past two years through a revaluation of its property, increased its plant ac - counts by $1,800,000 in round figures. This revaluation was made up not only from the liberal present day unit costs of the engineers, but by the inclusion of intangible elements in large amounts. By the simple process of increasing its property account the com - pany has written off past losses from operation, discounts on sales of bonds and stocks and property losses in amount of $689,000. Its sur - plus account in amount $974,509 is almost entirely secured through this revaluation process. A depreciation reserve of over $400,000 has for the most part been secured, not by annual charges against revenues, but through revaluation of assets. Not even the additions and betterments of the past year hare gone into the plant account at cost, but an arbitrary of more than twenty per cent has been added under the term engineering and super - intendence. By this device a credit of approximately $40,000 was made to operating expenses in 1924 and approximately $50,000 was credited to the surplus account. In our opinion the investor in securities of the company, can have no adequate idea as to the property back of his securities, and no correct knowledge of net earnings from operation under such account - ing practices. Despite what we have said here, the Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the application should be approved, that the secur - ities mentioned in the application are reasonably necessary for cor - porate purposes as they exist today, that the proceeds of securities issued in the past year and a half have been for legitimate purposes, although it is obviously impossible for this Commission to pass on whether the acquisition of property were accompanied by proper busi - ness judgment. The prices at which the securities are to be sold ap - pear reasonable in the light of the company's fairly recent rapid growth and lack of operating history. The financing here concerned will not additionally burden the rate - payer and it will, through the consolidation of obligations, render the position of creditors more stable. The debts exist whether this application is approved or not. </seg>

            <seg id="p243">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 243 APPLICATION NO. 6890 APPLICATION NO. 5881 r In the Matter ol the Application of the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company for Authority to Increase rates at Whitney and Belmont. Appearances : For applicant, A. J. McBean, attorney; Guy H. Pratt, vice-presi dent; H. A. Liver more, statistician. OPINION AND FINDING ON RE-HEARING BROWNE, Chairman: In January, 1924, (17 N. S. R. C. 343-347) the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company made application to increase its rates on its Belmont and Whitney exchanges, these exchanges being located on either side of the exchange of Crawford. Hearing on the application was held in January in Crawford and under date of July 7, order was entered effective September 1, 1924. In that order the Commission found that the rate in existence at both Whitney and Belmont failed to provide applicant with adequate revenues; that the rates asked for in the petition were unreasonably high and in the case of Application No. 5390, higher than the traffic would bear according to statement of record; that the exchanges were too small to be self-sustaining and should have been served in the first instance, as well as now, by party lines from intermediate larger exchange of Crawford. On these findings the Commission directed that the rates at Belmont and Whitney be the rates of the Crawford exchange and that frea interchange between the towns of Crawford, Whitney and Belmont be provided. The Commission did not pass on the question of eliminat - ing switchboard operation at the two points because of statutory provi - sion. This order had the effect of increasing exchange rates in the town of Whitney and increasing rural service at Whitney without in - creasing the rate. It increased the extent of service of Crawford sub - scribers without increasing the rate. Applicant asked for a rehearing which was granted and said hearing was held September 19, 1924. Testimony was that the effect of the order would be to reduce the toll revenues approximately $400 while increasing exchange revenues only about $60. No testimony had been previously given on this phase of the case and the Com - mission had not anticipated this adverse effect on the revenues. In </seg>
            <seg id="p244">EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 244 testimony witnesses lor applicant stated however, that the request for rehearing was not due to the revenue result so much as that the proposal was contrary to scientific rate making. This Commission has frequently denied application from subscribers to extend the zone of base rates to additional towns in order that flat rates might be sub - stituted for toll rates. It has also frequently approved two-town zones in order better to take care of the "twilight" rural territory. From the company's point of view the best practice probably would have been never to have attempted to serve the communities of Belmont and Whitney, but it did undertake to serve these territories and if arrangements can be made whereby it will not serve at a loss it is not permissible to retire from the field. On the whole, this Commission has not attempted to force extensions of flat rates into additional territory. In this instance, the facts seem to warrant the extension of zone and possibly ultimately one central office with switchboard and other machinery taking care of all calls. In no less than twenty localities involving service to approximately fifty towns applicant still offers zone service in Ne - braska. Since the hearing in these cases there has been under the per - mission of the federal board a change of rates at the three exchanges involved in our original opinion and finding. If applied now that order would have the effect of increasing business and some residence rates at Whitney and the switching rate at Whitney. It would pro - duce a reduction in the switching rate at Belmont. These applications are still before the Commission. There is too much merit in them to deny the applications, and yet we cannot approve them as made because as we understand the law a public utility should not attempt to eliminate unprofitable territory through the medium of rates beyond what the traffic would bear until all other other remedies have been tried. It was not the Commission's purpose to reduce revenues within the zone. That result was incidental as was also the amount. It is not now its purpose to do other than pro - vide a fair return upon the fair value of the property. We will adhere to the original order. It will have been affected in a measure by rate changes at all the exchanges since the original order was entered. If it shall appear that within the zone compris - ing Crawford, Whitney and Belmont the application of the Crawford rates does not produce the rate of return which the law presumes, that fact can be presented to the Commission in proceedings involv - ing the rates of the entire zone. The effective date of the original order was held up automatically </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 5390 APPLICATION NO. 5391 In the Matter of the Application of the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company for Authority to Increase Rates at Whitney and Belmont Exchanges. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman Applicant herein has filed application for reopening of the above cases for the purpose of filing for the record, a statement that the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, for the purpose of these applications only, is willing to and does waive its right under the law, to a fair return upon the invested capital at the two exchanges. This record statement is for the purpose of paving the way for a dismissal of the applications. The original applications were filed January 10, 1924, (17 N. S. R. C. 343-347) asking for very substantial increases in exchange rates at the two small exchanges of Whitney and Belmont. Order was entered on July 7, 1924, finding that the rates prayed for as to certain classes of service, were more than the traffic would bear, and would probably result in the abandonment of the exchanges; that the ex - changes were not self supporting; and that for the purpose of meet - ing the legal requirements of a fair return on the fair value of the </seg>
            <seg id="p246">246 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT E parties, without at the same time unduly burdening any sub - bers, the exchanges of Crawford, Belmont and Whitney should placed in one zone with free interchange of service at uniform ,s. Rehearing was granted to give the applicant an opportunity to Ktest against the zoning of the territory. On July 6, 1925, the nmission issued a supplemental order effective October 1, 1925, sustaining its original opinion, finding and order. It was there stated that it was the duty of the Commission to attempt to frame rates which would compensate the utility for the use of its property, and that in our opinion no other plan was available than the one set forth in the original opinion. Inasmuch as applicant now states its willingness for these parti - cular cases, to waive its right to a fair return on the property, the Commission is in a position to consider the advisability of not disturb - ing the present rate structure and of dismissing the applications. The cases were not brought by subscribers, who on the whole are as satis - fied with the present situation as is usually found in the relations of subscribers and utility. Under the circumstances, the Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the application should be dismissed and the rates now in effect should continue in effect for service at Belmont and at Whitney, with toll connections and toll charges on messages between Crawford and Whitney, and the present free inter - change between Belmont and Crawford. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the original applications herein be, and they hereby are reconsidered and the prayers therein are denied.

Those condi - tions will be embodied in article four of the amended articles of incorporation of applicant company, to be presently filed with proper officials. The conditions appear fair and will be approved. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the preferred stock issued under the authorization of the original order in this matter shall bear interest at six per cent per annum, shall be cumulative as to dividends and as to assets in case of dissolution, shall have full voting power with the common stock, and shall be of par value $100 per share.

Appearances : « For applicant, W. H. Pitzer, attorney. For the Commission, U. G. Powell, rate expert; B. E. Forbes, chief engineer. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman On December 31, 1924, (17 N. S. R. C. 383-396) the Commission entered its original order herein authorizing applicant to issue and sell securities under conditions set forth in that order. This supple - mental petition was for the purpose of securing modifications of the conditions applied in the original order. Hearing was held thereon in the Commission's offices on August 3, 1925. Petitioner asks specifically: (1) That because the original application stated that the Ne - braska City Gas company was to be consolidated with the Water and Light company of Nebraska City through purchase of the property of the Gas company by the Water and Light company and the dissolu - tion of the latter, and that because the stock in amount $45,000 of the Nebraska City Gas company is collateral in the hands of a trustee for certain indebtedness, with no provision for substitution of other collateral, the Commission specifically authorized the continuance of the stock of the Nebraska City Gas company until maturity date of the bonds which it is supposed to pTotect. (2) That that condition of the order numbered C be modified to permit the company to continue the integrity of the ledger ac - counts in lieu of certain modifications required in the order. (3) That condition E of the original order be modified to permit the company to set aside no reserve for retirements or accrued de - preciation until after dividends in amount of 6 per cent on the pre - ferred stock and 5 per cent on the common stock shall have been earned and set aside for payment, and that not so large a depreciation reserve as 2% per cent of the fixed and depreciable property at any time be required. </seg>
            <seg id="p249">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 249 (4) That the Commission's order distinctly state, which it does not now do, that $45,000 of the preferred stock approved in the original order is for purposes of exchange. As to these propositions (1) The original order did not require that the stock of the Nebraska City Gas company be canceled. It was assumed that such cancellation would take place because the stock was at once valueless. It does not appear essential that we now extend the order as to the dis - position of this stock. It will be made a condition of the consolida - tion that pending the dissolution of the gas company it shall transact no business nor acquire property. (2) The Commission's statement of opening entries as of De - cember 31, 1923, contained on page 11 of the original order, is some - what consolidated. It is not intended to limit the accounts as might be assumed from the original order. The chief purposes of paragraph C are: First, to restate the plant account on a more solid basis than it has been carried, namely, appraisal rather than growth from a balancing figure originally set up. Applicant indicates in testimony its willingness to conform to that portion of the order relating to plant because there is almost no difference in the total. Plant plus in - tangible as proposed by the Commission in its original order totai $1,034,735.57 and as carried in the books of the company as of the same date, $1,030,353.14. Second, the books as opened under the conditions set forth by the Commission would show an operating de - ficit. The company's books do show an operating deficit of $33,822.66 as of December 31, 1923, and somewhat more than that as set up by the company in an exhibit attached to its supplemental application under date December 31, 1924. The Commission proposed to in - crease this deficit to $131,231.15. This would be caused entirely by the setting up as a liability of a depreciation reserve account where none existed in amount $93,619.34, a depreciation in dollars con - fessed to by the company in testimony. The question raised by the supplemental application is whether in law and equity we should require a reserve in the books equal to the accrued deterioration when there was not a sufficient revenue to provide such credit. This deficit might be caused by an excess issue of stock, but in the instant case the excess issue of stock is of long standing and is represented in assets by franchise and good will. The deficit shown in the requirement of the Commission is an operating result over a series of years. The constitution of the state provides that "no dividends shall be declared or distributed except out of net earnings, after paying all operating expenses including a depreciation reserve sufficient to keep </seg>
            <seg id="p250">EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 250 (investment intact." The company's contention is that it can - legally pay dividends on preferred stock while a deficit exists. i position may be well taken. The provision of the constitution t relates to depreciation reserve, does not extend back of the date constitution became effective in 1920. It is important in rate ters, to determine whether a reserve shall be earned during a od quite different from the period the depreciation accrued, where ng the period of accrual the earnings were not had. In this in - ce there is no question of excess dividends being paid. None were We are inclined to the position at this time that the reserve shall be set aside before any allotments of income for dividends, but only if Ened. Since during the period covered by our investigation, the ;rve was not earned, we will approve the modification of the order linating the depreciation reserve item shown in liabilities on page of the original order and a corresponding reduction in the deficit of that date in the assets accounts required in our original order, s will leave the deficit in the consolidated books as of date De - iber 31, 1923, at $33,822.66. No other modification of the entries uired in paragraph C of the original order will be approved. (3) It is proposed by applicant that deductions to cover accrued but unrealized depreciation, or a reserve to equalize retirements, whichever it may be, shall not be obligatory until after dividends are provided for, even to the extent of dividends on common stock which represents no property. This particular prayer of the amended peti - tion was not strongly pressed at the hearing. It was urged however that the requirement of two per cent per annum on the fixed and de - preciable property as an operating charge, or a deduction from income, and a credit to the reserve account, was entirely too heavy a strain, especially under the company's accounting practices. It is not our purpose to embarrass the company in a fair earn - ing on its preferred stock which represents investment made in recent years in the interest of service to the public. The requirement is not out of line with what we have required in other orders on other properties. It is pre-supposed that the accounting practices will be in accord with standard usage including the recommended rules by the national electric light association and that charges will be made against this account for retirements. A change of rules by the com - pany involves no hardship. We have just stated that the company would be relieved of a serious obligation because of unearned reserve in past years, but in the interest of the property the reserve should at this time be accrued somewhat more rapidly as a protection against the loss of property already realized due to wear and tear and other causes. The promise of earnings at the time of the hearing was </seg>
            <seg id="p251">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 251 such as to warrant the conclusion that this requirement can be met without undue embarrassment to the net available for dividends. We will deny the modification prayed for in paragraph C of the supplemental application to paragraph E of the original order, with leave to the company ait any future time to show specifically that the requirement is an unfair and unnecessary burden on revenues. (4) The modification prayed for under D of the supplemental application does not appear to us to be essential, as in our opinion the order is broad enough. However, applicant must deal with technical attorneys for financial institutions and the modification will be ap - proved as prayed for. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the order entered December 31, 1924, under Applica - tion No. 5469 be and it hereby is amended in the following particulars, and in no other: I. Paragraph (B) shall read: "Applicant may issue and sell 7117 shares of preferred stock of face value $100 per share for cash or its equivalent, and may issue 450 like shares in exchange for all the assets of the Nebraska City Gas Company, under the following terms and conditions: "(1) From the proceeds of such sale the company shall (a) purchase at not more than par the stock of Nebraska City Gas company; (b) liquidate all the indebtedness accounts of the gas company with the Nebraska City Utilities company; (c) liquidate all applicant's own indebtedness account with the Nebraska City Utilities company, as of date December 31, 1923. "(2) No stock shall be issued until (a) the articles of in - corporation shall have been properly amended, (b) notice of proposed increase of stock published for sixty days, and (c) terms and conditions of the preferred stock issue submitted to the Commission for approval. "(3) Pending the cancellation of the stock of the Nebraska City Gas company and the dissolution of the corporation, and succeeding the sale of the assets here authorized, that corporation shall transact no business." II. Paragraph C is amended to permit the opening of the con - solidated books as of December 31, 1923, without the liability account on page 11 of the findings under the caption "Depreciation Reserve," and with the assets account on that page under the caption "Deficit" </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 5583 In the Matter of the Application of the Chicago &amp; Northwestern Rail - road Company for Authority to Amend Certain Passenger Train Schedules.

            <seg id="p253">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 253 For which the company desired the approval of the Commission. The application reduced the service between Lincoln and Fremont by one train each way, each day, and reversed the schedules on the Hastings and Superior lines and made the leaving time of No. 11 from Omaha earlier. Before granting an order for an experiment (17 N. S. R. C. 438 - 440) the Commission verbally requested the company officials to canvass the towns sufficiently to make the plan clear to representative persons in each town. The officials making the canvass reported that there was no opposition to the proposed schedule, and the Commission issued an order on the 19th day of June, 1924, to become effective on the 22nd day of June, 1924, for the railroad company to change its schedule as proposed in the application, for a 90-day period, subject to such review and change as might be found essential as the result of the experience during the trial period. After this schedule had been put into effect, there was some complaint from one or two towns on the Lincoln branch which were satisfactorily adjusted by the officers of the C. &amp; N. W. R. R. Co. Patrons of the road on the Hastings line, with the exception of a limited number of towns, made no complaint. There was, however, a very vigorous complaint made by patrons on the Superior line south of Linwood, and hearing was held on November 12, 1924, in the office of the Railway Commission at Lincoln, at which hearing witnesses from Goehner, David City, Surprise, York, Dwight, Hastings and Stockham, appeared and testified to being very much dissatisfied with Linwood-Superior L Jne 'rain No. 311 Leave Linwood Arrive Superior 9:40 a. m. 2:35 p. m 'rain No. 322 Leave Superior Arrive Linwood 11:30 a. m. 4:15 p. m.

It reloped in the hearing that word had gone out to several other towns that the hearing on the application had been postponed and that for that reason several towns that were interested and desired to be heard, were not represented. On account of this an adournment was taken kthe 26th day of November, 1924, in order to give all towns inter - ed an opportunity to be heard. Accordingly, on the 26th day of v ember, 1924, hearing in the matter was resumed and witnesses from David City, Millerton, Surprise, Dwight, Brainard, Bruno, Abie, Shickley, Superior, Seward, Gresham, Goehner and Davenport were heard for the complainants. C. H. Reynolds, assistant general super - intendent, and R. W. McGinnis, general agent, appeared for the rail - road company, and G. D. Patterson appeared for the express company. The testimony and exhibits introduced by the Chicago &amp; North - western Railroad Company showed that business on both the Hastings and Superior lines had greatly fallen off by reason of competition of the truck, automobile and bus until the local business had become unprofitable to the road and that in order to make the service re - munerative it was necessary to change the schedules of the trains to connect with the main line trains to Chicago and the east in the afternoon and from Chicago and the east in the morning, which reversed schedules that had been in force since the construction of the Hastings and Superior branches. This necessitated a complete re - versal of the schedule as per table shown on pages one and two, and would make a daylight run in both directions. tThe testimony of the officers of the railroad company showed business had increased and that local traffic had remained about same as previously, so that the change in schedule had been ficial to the railroad company in the matter of increased revenue. Mr. Patterson of the express company testified that the express business had been greatly improved and facilitated by reason of the delivery of the perishable express all along the line in the daytime under the new schedule instead of at night for quite a large part of the run under the old schedule. The protestants testified almost unanimously along the same lines, that is to say, that as the schedule was before the change was made, shippers of livestock desiring to return home the same day their stock was sold, could do so under the old schedule, but under the new schedule they were required to stay over night in Omaha and leave Omaha at the very early hour of 6:30 in the morning, which made it both expensive and inconvenient; also that mail delivered from the east under the old schedule, in most instances, would be delivered the same evening to the post office and would go out on the route on the </seg>
            <seg id="p255">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 255 morning following, but that under the new schedule the arrival of the train at the different stations all along the line on both lines of road was after the mail carrier had gone out on his route, which caused the mail to lie over for twenty-four hours in the post office before it could be taken out on the route for delivery. It was also shown by the complainants that as the passenger train and freight train both left Superior and Hastings going in the same direction in the morning, it did not give persons desiring to return home the same day any opportunity to do so as had been the case in the past when the passenger and freight trains had been running in opposite directions so that an opportunity had been given passengers to go east or north on the freight train in the forenoon and return home either south or west in the evening on the passenger train. There is no question but what the old schedule was more con - venient and gave more satisfactory service to the local towns along both the Superior and Hastings lines than the new schedule. When the old schedule provided eastern connections going east and western connections going west and south, it was the economical and practical way to handle this business, but when the railroad company changed its schedules on its main line east, so that, in order to meet its schedules, it became necessary for the railroad company to substitute the present schedule in order that passengers and mail could make direct connections for the east and coming from the east make direct connection going west and south and also increase the long haul revenue in order to make the revenue sufficient to warrant the ex - pense of maintaining the passenger trains on these lines. It became necessary to reverse the schedule west and south of Fremont in order to make direct connections for both passengers and mail. Owing to the decrease in passenger business, the Commission is of the opinion that the railway company should be permitted to use, so far as practicable, their judgment in scheduling their passenger trains on their branch lines in Nebraska to make connections with their main lines and in the eastern division, in order to accommodate the through passengers and mail service. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the schedules of passenger trains on the Hastings and Superior lines as applied for in the Application No. 5583, and put into effect June 22, 1924, for a 60-day period, be and are hereby extended indefinitely. </seg>

SUPPLEMTXTAL FINDING AND ORDER BROWNE, Chairman: In our order under this caption dated August 21, 1924, (17 N. S. R. C. 456-461) we authorized under definite conditions and re - strictions, the issue of (a) $1,066,000 par value of first mortgage series A, 6% per cent bonds; (b) $150,000 par value of 7 per cent debenture bonds; and (c) $385,000 par value 7 per cent cumulative preferred stock. In a supplemental petition, applicant shows that it has sold all of the debenture bonds and the preferred stock, and that it has sold $730,000 of the first mortgage bonds. It asks our approval of a modification of the preceding order referred to, by reducing the amount of authorized first mortgage bonds to $730,000 as per the order on Application 5612, and increase in the authorization of 7 per cent preferred stock by an amount of $325,000. The result of the supplemental order if entered, will be to reduce the amount of securities outstanding as a result of the original order, by $11,000 and a reduction in amount of fixed charges. The supplemental appli - cation is presented in order that the company may continue to pursue a policy of customer ownership. This Commission will be reluctant to authorize preferred stock to be sold in small amounts to customers, unless that preferred stock is as safely protected as is possible, in its value and earning power. In the case of this company which is still a youthful corporation, we can only say that at the present time when all legitimate deductions have been made from net corporate income, including all fixed charges, the preferred stock dividends have been safely earned more </seg>

ORDER BY THE COMMISSION: Applicant herein, the Nebraska Gas and Electric company, has presented this application for amendment and modification of the Commission's transmission line order No. 5617, wherein applicant was granted a permit to construct a transmission line from Lincoln in Lancaster county to Plattsmouth in Cass county, Nebraska. A hear - ing was held in the office of the Commission December 19, 1924, testimony taken and the application submitted on the record. 9 </seg>
            <seg id="p258">258 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT The original petition shows that the company applied for a permit to construct, operate and maintain a transmission line to carry two 66,000 volt circuits from Lincoln to Havelock, thence north four miles and east to Plattsmouth. Between Lincoln and a point south of Greenwood, space on the pole line was to be provided for an addi - tional circuit to be operated at 6600 volts, to be used as may be re - quired. The transfer of an existing 16,500 volt circuit to the new Ei line was included with the application for the new construction. Itioner further indicated that the two circuits to Plattsmouth would operated temporarily at 33,000 volts. In the original order, the emission fixed the maximum voltage at 33,000 between Lincoln and ttsmouth and fixed time for the completion of the construction for Applicant showed that it had obtained written agreements with the owners of existing electric lines which might be affected by the new construction and operation on the basis of 66,000 volts and it has located the power line in a manner to avoid the principal signal Iis, having in mind operating conditions. Petitioner further showed t one year is not sufficient time in which to complete the construc - i program. The proposed power line will connect with applicant's perties in this and other states and time will be required to con - ict new transmission lines and generating plants or relocate the i lines and reconstruct or change the generating plants to conform h its plan of operation. The changes in plant referred to were set out in the application for the new construction. Therefore, the nmission will set aside its order No. 5617, and find that the prayer of petitioner should be granted as set forth in the original t plication and it will authorize applicant to construct, operate and intain the transmission line, described in the original application, carry two 66,000 volt circuits from Lincoln by way of Havelock to tttsmouth as laid out on the map filed with the original application. b Commission also finds that five years from the date of this order i reasonable length of time in which to complete the proposed con - action and prepare for the high voltage operation. The Commission will retain its jurisdiction over the service on the signal circuits involved in the parallel created by the proposed construction, and in the event that the service on these lines is inter - fered with by prolonged inductive interference resulting from the con - struction and operation of the proposed transmission line, the parties at interest may apply to the Commission for relief as provided by statute.

Appearances For the applicant, C. E. Pearse, secretary. For the commission, B. E. Forbes, chief engineer. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: Applicant asks authority to issue $20,000 of either common or preferred stock for the purpose of reimbursing its capital account to cover a purchase of the property of the Tilden Telephone company. This purchase was made during the past year and the Madison Tele - phone company is now operating the Tilden exchange. It did not buy the stock of the Tilden Telephone company, merely acquiring the physical property. The price paid was $18,000. Permission is asked to authorise stock to cover this purchase and to provide a working capital fund of $2,000 in addition. Upon hearing, it was disclosed that a physical valuation was made of the property of the Tilden company by the Commission on October 14, 1919, at which time the original or historical cost of the property was found to be $24,335.07. Property was found to be in 63 per cent condition, making the depreciated original cost $16, - 155.39. No consideration was given in that valuation to increased unit costs due to increased price levels. The accounting system of the Tilden company has been established and maintained under the super - vision of the Commission's accounting department. A check made by that department of the books indicate that in the four years fol - lowing the above valuation approximately $2,000 of additions and betterments have been made. At the time of the valuation there were 359 subscribers. At the time of the hearing the subscribers had in - creased to 429. It would appear, therefore, that additions and better - ments made since the date of the valuation would carry the present or depreciated value well above the purchase price of $18,000. The records disclose, however, that during these four years a very sub - stantial amount of money has been expended in maintaining the prop - erty, the four-year record showing that over $11,000 has been thus expended. It is manifest, therefore, that the management of the Tilden company has been rebuilding the property and that its condi- </seg>
            <seg id="p261">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 261 tion at the present time is much improved over what it was at the time of the valuation. No dividends have been paid during the period, all net income having been applied to improvements in the property. It is clear, therefore, that even on an original cost basis, without giv - ing consideration to increased price levels, the present value of the physical property is well in excess of the price paid and probably is close to 120,000. The purpose for which the company desires to issue this stock is within the requirements of the statute. The Commission finds that the amount is reasonable and necessarily required for the purposes of the company. Applicant is undecided as to whether it will issue common or preferred stock, its articles of incorporation permitting the issuance of either. It is somewhat disposed to issue 6 per cent preferred stock to be sold at par. There appears to be no good reason why it should not issue preferred so long as its articles so permit. On October 6, 1923, the Commission authorized this company to issue $16,125 of common stock. At that time it had outstanding $10,750. The issuance of the $20,000 provided for herein will make a total outstanding issue of $46,850. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Madison Telephone company be and the same hereby is authorized to issue and sell at par, for cash or its equivalent, $20,000 of its common or preferred stock, the kind of stock to be at the option of the management. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that upon the issuance and sale of the stock herein authorized report of same shall be made to the Commission.

It desires at this time to issue and sell at par $119,000 of 5% first mortgage bonds with the proceeds of which to liquidate notes or account payable with the Illinois Power &amp; Light Corporation, in - curred to secure the funds with which (a) to make additions and betterments in amount $43,000 since December 31, 1922, and, (b) to purchase the Ashland Light, Mill &amp; Power company for $76,000. The balance sheet of applicant dated July 31, 1924, and submitted in support of the application showed the Ashland purchase to be yet undistributable in the consolidated statement. It showed payables owed to the Illinois Power &amp; Light Corporation in amount $258, - 059.74. The payables included the money borrowed for the purchase of the Ashland properties. In this connection, it should be stated that the creditor mentioned is the holding company, which owns the stock of applicant. On December 24, 1919, (12 N. S. R. C. 348-353) the Commission authorized certain financing by the selling company, the Ashland Light, El &amp; Power company, and there found that after the improvements progress had been completed the reasonable cost of the property, lusive of the intangible values including water rights, would be :,000. Testimony of Mr. F. E. White, president of the selling ipany, was that the actual cost of the improvements exceeded the estimates in our order in 1919 by approximately $10,000. The bal - ance sheet of the Ashland Light, Mill &amp; Power company of January 1, 1924, supports that testimony. From this data conclusion may be reached that the property, exclusive of intangible values and on a depreciated basis, should, at the time of purchase, have been in the neighborhood of $72,000. The book cost of these properties as shown by the ledger of sell - ing company under date of May 31, 1924, was $90,151. The weakness of the figure is in the fact that the selling company did not charge out </seg>
            <seg id="p263">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 263 of plant any property retired in the improvement program in 1919. We estimated the loss due to that source at $4,650. This book cost includes $8,500 actually spent in payment of damages to riparian owners, whose lands were flooded, and the cost of a lawsuit to defend the company's rights to the water power. Details of the expenditure of $43,000 by applicant for additions and betterments to its entire properties were submitted for check to cover the period after January 1, 1923, to date of application. The Illinois Power &amp; Light Corporation increased its creditor relationship with applicant between December 31, 1922, and July 31, 1924, in amount $82,531 which includes the borrowings on account of the Ashland purchase. It is not, therefore, clear as to the source of the funds with which the additions and betterments were made. Applicant states in its application that the bonds are being sold to the Illinois Power &amp; Light Corporation. It will, therefore, be assumed that con - struction payables will be reduced in amount of $43,000. If that assumption is in error, due to the silence of the record, the fact can be brought out in supplemental disclosures. After having scrutinized the properties supporting the proposed issue of bonds, we are confronted with the fact that it is the purpose of applicant to. finance all the extensions in amount $119,000 by sale of bonds. All the securities of applicant company have been ap - proved by this Commission by orders entered in 1913 and 1915. Common stock is outstanding in amount $48,800, preferred stock in amount $57,500 and bonds in amount $250,000. At the present time the outstanding bonds equals 70% of all outstanding stocks and bonds. If the proposed application is approved, the bonds will equal 77% of the total stocks and bonds. Fixed charges now exist, because of liabilities, in excess of 85% of the total capital indebtedness. Reputable financial institutions approve issues of bonds up to 85% of construction cost. This Commission has always deemed that too liberal an attitude. In its opinion the proposed financing would have been more proper, had a portion of the funds been secured from stock sales. On the other hand, the relation between applicant and parent company is such that it is able to dispose of its five per cent first mortgage bonds at par at this time when applicant could not dispose of the same bonds, except at considerable discount, if seeking its own market. It is excellent financing strategy to secure money at this time on a five per cent basis when similar corporations in this state with - out such financial connections have paid as high as eight per cent on a good security. Moved by these considerations, the Commission will approve the proposed issue having also approved the purposes for which the funds </seg>
            <seg id="p264">264 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT hare been used as being reasonably necessary for corporate purposes. It should be clear, however, that in the reduction of remaining pay - ables incurred for construction the company should propose a much larger participation of stock issue. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Omaha ft Lincoln Railway ft Light company be and it hereby is authorized to issue and sell its five per cent first mortgage bonds in par value $119,000 for a retirement of $76,000 payables due the Illinois Power &amp; Light Corporation for purchase of the Ashland Light, Mill ft Power company's properties; and, (b) the retirement of $43,000 of payables incurred for extensions and better - ments made subsequent to December 31, 1922. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the following conditions are a part of and necessary to the approval set forth in the paragraph above: (a) A property ledger account shall be maintained with the Ashland plant, the opening entry of the fixed assets in which shall not exceed the amount at which those fixed assets were carried by the selling corporation, the Ashland Light, Mill ft Power company; (b) The company shall set up in the opening entry as a liability a depreciation reserve equal to the difference between the opening entry mentioned in (a) above and the purchase price; (c) Applicant shall charge as an expense, or make a deduction from income before net profits are determined, on a monthly prorate basis, not less than two and one-half per cent of the depreciative physical property (including the dam, races, penstock and appurten - ances thereto as depreciative property) as shown by the general ledger plant accounts at the end of the month, which amount shall be credited to a retirement or depreciation reserve account, charges against which account shall be made only in accordance with the accounting rules of the National Electric Light association. (d) Applicant shall file with the Commission quarterly from date of this order a copy of the statement made by it to the Illinois Power ft Light Corporation which statement shall show as a minimum the revenues and expenses, credits and charges to the retirement reserve and the current balance sheet, and it shall also file a copy of the journal entry showing the manner in which the Ashland purchase has been brought onto the books of applicant. </seg>

Applicant now seeks extension of time for period of six months from and after October 7, 1925. The Commission has been kept orally advised of the progress toward physical amalgamation and of corporate consolidation, and is well aware of the difficulties which have prevented more rapid progress. Those difficulties could not reasonably have been avoided. Notice of the application was sent to the office of the city attorney of Lincoln, and to a representative of certain minority stockholders. They do not desire to be heard. The Commission is of the opinion and finds that the extension of time is reasonably necessary as prayed. </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 5684 In the Matter of the Application of the Cedar County Farmers' Tele - phone Company for Authority to Publish Revised Schedule of Rates. Appearances : For applicant, B. Ready, attorney. For respondents, E. H. Constable. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman: Applicant is a Nebraska corporation, locally owned by a con - siderable number of stockholders, and furnishing telephone service to the town of Hartington and its trade vicinity. As of December SI, 1924, it served 106 business subscribers, 291 residence sub - scribers, and 342 rural subscribers, all with metallic magneto service. It aeks for authority to publish a schedule of rates 25 cents higher on each class of service than is being charged and collected at the present time, or net rates as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p267">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 267 Hearing was held at Hartington on January 22, 1925. For the city of Hartington, the mayor expressed the desire that the utility be permitted to earn sufficient income to function properly. No other respondents expressed other objection than to certain service con - ditions which are to be corrected. For the company it was alleged that considerable investment in improvements has been made in the past year, the funds secured from borrowings at local banks and from sale of fractional shares of stock to stockholders. It was alleged that the requirements for maintenance and replacements annually charged against revenues, was adequate fully to maintain the property in a state of high efficiency and that the net returns did not properly compensate for the additional capital invested. At the time of the hearing the company owed interest bearing debt in amount approximately $8,000, and had outstanding or in its treasury, partially paid for, $19,650 of common stock. It had during the three preceding years, paid dividends at the rate of 7 per cent on less than the outstanding stock, owing to a restriction imposed by the Commission in a preceding order. The causes of the restriction have been removed. The company would like to gradually eliminate its indebtedness from the increased rates and to make further improvements. These are not proper factors in arriving at rate levels. In the case of the present management and ownership, no particular harm would be done to the rate-payer, but there is no assurance that subsequent owners will not demand their full legal rights. Hence all improve - ments must be paid for out of additional capital investment, this in - vestment to be made from surplus earnings or sale of securities. The additional investment during the year 1923 and 1924 in new building, cable and farm line improvement, may properly call for additional cost of maintenance to be reflected in figuring estimated annual expenses. The company however has a large reserve invested in additions and betterments. This reserve can be available for re - pairs only when the improvements in which such reserve has in the past been invested, shall have been capitalized through the sale of securities. There is not a steady local market for the stock of this company, and such market can only be induced by adequate annual dividends. This is a practical situation which must be recognized. usiness $2.00 per mont Residence „ 1.40 per montl lural 1.40 per montl Ixtension sets 50 per mont lesk sets 25 per mont' </seg>
            <seg id="p268">EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 268 Applicant company has been operated with high efficiency. Few if any companies in the state have furnished the same grade of service at so low a cost to its subscribers. The subscribers have bene - fited from this efficient local management. Such efficiency should be recognized in estimating proper annual dividend returns. In comput - ing revenue necessities, we will therefore estimate the dividend re - turn on the outstanding stock at 10 per cent. On the value of the property, it would be less. From computations based upon the testimony of the company and on the annual reports of the past three years, it is our conclusion that adequate revenue for present necessities including dividends on outstanding and treasury stock, will be secured from an increase of 25 cents per month gross and net, on all business stations excluding extension stations, and an increase of 15 cents per month gross and net, on residence and rural stations. We will also approve the charge of 25 cents per month net for desk sets, leaving it however optional with the company to publish this rate. The company will by letter notify the Commission as to the exercise of the option. No change in present residence rates for extension sets will be approved. Dis - count provisions will remain unchanged. Due to the practice of collecing rural charges quarterly in ad - vance, it is highly important that rate changes be made at the end of quarter years. This constitutes an emergency warranting effective date as of April 1, 1925.

(SEAL) APPMCATION NO. 5698 In the Matter of the Application of the Dundy County Mutual Tele - phone Company for Authority to Increase Exchange Rates. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: . This proceeding involves an application of the Dundy County Mutual Telephone Company for authority to establish the following schedule of rates for exchange service: At present the rates charged are $1.50 per month for business, $1.00 for residence and $ .33% per month for switching service. Applicant serves 49 business, 126 residence and 210 switching subscribers. The system is entirely grounded and the portion owned and maintained by the company is confined to the city limits, all farm circuits being owned and maintained by farmers' companies. Effort was made by the Commission to pass upon this application without a hearing. The company is small and the rates proposed by it are reasonable when compared to the rates charged by similar com - panies throughout the state. We found it impossible, however, to reach any conclusion from the data submitted by the applicant or from annual reports filed in recent years. A hearing was had, therefore. iusiness Service $2.00 per mont; lesidence Service 1.50 per mont: i witching Service 50 per mont' </seg>
            <seg id="p270">270 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT and in connection therewith the engineering department of the Com - mission made a physical valuation of the property. This valuation shows an original cost of $7,758.43 and a depreciated cost of $4, - 844.46. It will be seen from these figures that the property is great - ly depreciated, its present condition being very much under the standard necessary for furnishing good service. While the property is operated under corporate organization, the par value of the stock being only $10 and ownership being distributed among 210 stockholders, the management has become very much decentralized until in recent years there has been practically no man - agement at all. No dividends have ever been paid on the stock, the purpose being to operate as a cooperative institution. It follows, therefore, that now that the property has reached a stage where ex - tensive reconstruction is imperative if any sort of service is to be rendered that additional capital cannot be secured. Not only is it impossible to sell stock in the community with which to raise funds to replace the property, but under the present financial status the credit of the company is such that money cannot be borrowed for thus purpose. The service situation has become so serious that the city council refuses to grant an extension of the franchise to the com - pany unless extensive improvements are made in the property. There have been no protests over the proposed increase in rates and all information received by the Commission indicates a general willing - ness on the part of the telephone public to pay the increase in order to secure better service. Under circumstances of this kind, therefore, operating revenues and expenses do not lend themselves to the requirements of account - ing formulas. The situation constitutes an emergency. If stock could be sold, one of the remedies would be to secure additional capital in this manner and reimburse the depreciation reserve so that needed replacements could be made. That being out of the question, it is necessary to turn to the only source available and that is additional revenue from rate payers. Throughout the entire life of this company, the rates of this company have been subnormal. It is apparent that the property was never adequately maintained and that such service, as the patrons have received, has been provided at less than cost. At the present time, applicant has a lineman employed at a salary of $85 per month. With the property in normal condition and limited as it is to the city limits, the full time of a lineman would not be required for maintenance purposes. With the replacement program ahead of the company at present, however, this man will be kept constantly busy for many months. If service is to be restored, the company will find it necessary to expend at least $2,000 and possibly upwards of $3,000. Some of this money, of course, will be for new and additional property and to that extent it would be a proper charge against </seg>
            <seg id="p271">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 271 capital. An allowance for maintenance and depreciation, which will take care of the situation as we have described it, cannot be predicated on any percentage of the depreciable property. For purposes of accounting, however, that the history may be straight for the future, we are of the opinion that some definite amount for this purpose should be set up on the books. For that purpose, therefore, we shall allow $1,000 per year. At the end of the reconstruction period and after the company has reached a safe financial harbor, attention can again be given to this allowance and such readjustment made as ap - pears necessary. If the rates asked for are granted, the total gross income of the company for one year would amount to $4,994. Allowing $1,000 a year for maintenance and depreciation, the total operating expenses would aggregate $3,848.50 leaving an operating income of $1,145.50. Deducting taxes of $55, the net income would be $1,090.50. This amount would be available for a return upon the fair value of the property and for maintenance and replacements. If we regard $400 as a reasonable allowance for dividends, there would remain approxi - mately $700 as a surplus. If conditions were normal, this surplus would be excessive. Under the circumstances, however, we are of the opinion that the rates, as asked for, are needed and should be approved. The company has suggested that they might be made effective for a two year period. This would appear to be a good sug - gestion and the order will so provide. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Dundy County Mutual Telephone Company be, and the same hereby is, authorized to publish and collect on and after July 1, 1925, the following schedule of exchange rates: IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that these rates shall continue in effect until July 1, 1927, at which time applicant shall make further showing of all matters pertaining to its revenues and expenses to the end that said rates may be readjusted if such readjustment appears necessary. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that applicant set aside monthly $84 for the purpose of defraying expenditures for maintenance and depreciation, the charges and credits thereto to be recorded in accord - ance with the Commission's system of accounting.

Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 0701 In the Matter of the Application of the Blue River Power Company of Seward, Nebraska, for Authority to Issue and Sell Its Stock in the Amount of $750,000. Appearances: For applicant, Burdett Bo yes, secretary; U. G. Powell, account- ant; H. O. Fleck, engineer. For the Commission, B. E. Forbes, chief engineer OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION In 1923, (16 N. S. R. C. 270-274) petitioner was authorized to issue and sell its common capital stock in the amount of $400,000 par value. At that time the skeleton assets clearly exceeded the fixed capital applied for plus the amount outstanding in the sum of $100. - 000. The Commission did not find it necessary to make a careful analysis of the general expenses and intangibles included with the assets. In this application the company asked for authority to issue and sell additional common stock in the amount of $750,000, in shares with a par value of $100 each, to be sold at a discount of 20 per cent. Applicant alleges that the new capital is necessary to pay short time indebtedness; to reimburse the treasury for depreciation re - serve invested in property; also to provide funds for additions and betterments in the sum of $150,000, and to represent a part of its surplus now invested in plant. The property consists of seven hydro-electric generating pl-ints which supply electric energy to villages and towns connected by transmission lines which extend from the Platte river on the north in </seg>
            <seg id="p273">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 273 Butler county to Gage and Pawnee counties to the south. Applicant showed the value of its generating plants on the ledger cost basis with estimated general expenses added, while the distribution systems and transmission lines were inventoried and appraised on the esti - mated cost plan. The hydro plants were constructed through a period of approxi - mately fourteen years. Ledger accounts were kept with each one of these wherein the material and labor costs were recorded as they occurred. Operation began when the first generating plant was installed in 1910 and as each producing unit was completed there - after it was put in operation. The transmission lines and distributing systems were constructed concurrently with the power plants which afforded an outlet for production as it developed. The large part of the construction has taken place since 1918. The manager of the company is an engineer and the principal employees were selected because of their knowledge of the construc - tion of this kind of property. The office force at Seward was small and devoted to clerical duties which included both operation and construction. The manager of the company had general charge of both. The ledger charges to the various plants were based on materials purchased and delivered and pay rolls of employees engaged on construction. These entries are not in dispute. Applicant shows that its book cost of the generating plant is $534,640.85, exclusive of certain general expenses for engineering, supervision, taxes and interest in the sum of $10,572.60, which had been charged as con - struction proceeded. Theoretical charges for superintendence and engineering in the sum of $53,464.08 and interest and taxes in the sum of $36,671.43 have been substituted for the amount which was excluded. The estimated overheads amount to approximately 17 per cent of the actual construction cost as recorded. As plant No. 1 had been constructed, a standard plan for the dams was developed and the engineering problem in each instance was the adjustment of this plan to the new locations. In general this was done by the superintendent in charge of construction, who was a practical engineer, with the assistance of the general manager. The superintendent's wages were included with the labor as the work proceeded but no charge was made for the services of the man - ager and office force on account of construction. This is also true of expenses incurred for preliminary investigation of the various sites incidental to their selection. The physical conditions in each location were similar in many respects. The average construction period did not exceed eighteen months. Purchases of material and equipment were made in the manager's office. The item of taxes is subject to scrutiny for the time was short and it is probable that assessments </seg>
            <seg id="p274">274 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT actually made would be a proper charge to operation. Interest on capital during the construction period must be considered and that portion of the general office expense which resulted from field opera - tions should also be included and no doubt a part of the manager's salary, which has been charged to operating expenses, was a part of the construction cost. In view of these facts, the Commission will use 10 per cent of the ledger costs to cover the expenses properly chargeable to plant which have not been otherwise included. When this is added to the book figure, investment in hydro plants is $588,104.93. In 1922, applicant made a complete inventory and appraisal of its transmission lines and distribution systems on the estimated cost basis. This was done for the reason that ledger charges were in - complete. An attempt was made to keep the costs of each section of the pole line construction separate when only one construction unit was involved. Materials shipped to points nearest construction in carload lots were properly recorded. The same is true of labor charges. However, the company had its principal storeyard at Seward and much of the material was distributed with trucks from this point. This is especially true of short lines and additions and betterments when line changes were involved. Materials received at Seward wero charged to the store account but this was not always credited when the same was used for either construction or maintenance. A care - ful inventory of pole line property, which was checked by the engineer - ing department of the Commission, disclosed that materials in exist - ing plant exceeded those charged to construction on the books. Prices were applied, which were derived from the experience of the com - pany in connection with labor costs, to correspond with contract prices. General expenses were estimated. On the above plan, the company found a total cost new of $325,385.67 with no depreciation admitted. This includes certain lines constructed and owned by the villages and towns which were constructed in the same period which are operated by applicant under contracts. These provide that the ownership of the property shall pass to the company in the course of twenty or twenty-five years, in consideration of certain rates and service. The state's appraisal of the same property, also on the cost basis and including 15 per cent for general expenses, was $307,830 new, and less depreciation, $264,138. The material prices were taken from the company's experience and the labor costs and general expenses were f mated. The difference here is not due to quantities but to the unit s applied and the estimated amount for general expenses. Appli - t and the state were not far apart as the difference is only $17, - . We will accept a middle ground for this figure and use $316,000 as the cost new of the pole line plant. </seg>
            <seg id="p275">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 275 Since September 1, 1922, which was the date of the first inventory and appraisement, the company has made additions and betterments to pole lines and acquired new lines under operating contracts. For this application a complete check was made of plant existing in 1922 and corrections were made for changes that had occurred. Many of the lines were the same as reported in 1922. An inventory was also made of new lines. New units were applied to the entire inventory. On this basis the cost new as of September 30, 1924, was $570,252.15. The net increase by reason of line changes and additions and revalu - ation over the 1922 valuation figure is $244,866.48. The state ap - praised the new lines separately and reported an estimated cost of $179,343.55. This is comparable with $190,289.96 claimed by the company. A part of this is found in the estimated general expenses. The balance sheets of 1922 and 1924 show an increase, on account of additions and betterments to pole line property, of $208,403.52. Apparently the effect of revaluation has been to increase the esti - mated cost of plant existing in 1922 by approximately $36,500. This practice should not be encouraged, and the fact that a company's accounts are poorly kept is not sufficient reason for repeated appraisals. For the purpose of this case the Commission will use $316,000 as the cost of pole line property in 1922 and to this will be added $208,400 to represent the cost of additions and betterments as of September 30, 1924, or a total of $524,400. The company showed that the generating plants are in a 99 per cent condition. The loss on account of depreciation is small. This apparently results from the fact that plants 5, 6 and 7, which constitute the larger part of the in - vestment, are practically new and reported at 100 per cent. More - over, much of this property consists of land, overflow damages, earth work and concrete, to which low rates for annual depreciation are generally applied. The Commission will not disturb this conclusion. The state computed an average condition per cent of 91 for all of the distribution system, both old and new. The company admitted approximately 95 per cent for the same property. The difference occurs by reason of the allowance for accrued depreciation in the state's finding. Here also the difference is small and the Commission will use an average of 93 per cent. Summarizing at this point we have the following: In applicant's appraisal, working capital was estimated.

This is the storehouse account and the testimony shows that materials and supplies on hand are $25,000 less than this amount. If materials were not credited to merchandise account because they went into maintenance, they were a proper charge to operating expenses.

The decisions of courts and commissions recognize an intangible element of value in an operating public utility property which arises through the cost of developing the business and the prospect of earnings in the future. These decisions cover practically the entire field of public service. Applicant's plant has been expanded rapidly in the generation, distribution and sale of electric current la the recent past. Two of the generating plants are practically new and many of the transmission lines are in undeveloped territory. What the future promises in the way of further development we can - not say, but it is clear that to date applicant has been a pioneer. No doubt a willing buyer would see an intangible value in this situation which would affect the price he would pay for the property. Present earnings as a factor in a complete survey of the situation are some - what lower than the normal rate for a developed plant but this is to be expected. It is, however, not necessary in this proceeding to pass on the amount of such intangible values, because, for the reasons stated be - low, we reach negative conclusions. If the assets of applicant should carry an account with in - tangibles, particularly the going concern intangible, and no stock were issued against those assets, the surplus account would reflect their existence in the books, and the surplus account would be both earned and unearned. Our rule has been that we would not permit the capitalization of unearned surplus, unless the corporate necessity was very clear. It is not clear here. It seems quite probable also that an issue of stock against going value assets would violate the provisions of section 5 article 10 and section 6 article 12 of the constitution of the state.

The water rights covering applicant's seven hydro-generating plants have been estimated at the value of $250,000. The computa - tion was made on the customary comparison of the cost of water power production with steam. The cost of water-made current was taken from the estimated expenses of a normal year in which some of the items were actual expenses for nine months of the year 1924 and were extended to include twelve months on the same basis. The estimate includes current purchased in the amount of $5,000, the actual amount for the same period being $10,000 at l%c per K. W. hour. Maintenance and depreciation were estimated at 3 per cent of the cost of the plants or $14,755. The actual charges for deprecia - tion in 1924 on account of damages from floods were several times this amount. Applicant argued that 1924 was an unusual year and that this expense will not be repeated. Taken collectively, the actual operating expenses of the plants for the year ending September 30. 1924, were $85,59*6.36 which is comparable with the estimated expense in the "normal year" of $43,595.35. On the latter assumption applicant calculates that the cost per kilowatt hour of water-made current is .01995 cents. This figure would have been much larger if the actual expenses had been used. The estimated expenses of the theoretical steam plant shows that the cost per kilowatt hour would be .02389 cents. The difference between these unit costs computed on a five million K. W. hour production annually was capitalized on a 7% per cent basis in reaching applicant's conclusion. The actual current produced in 1923 was 3,219,460 K. W. hours. The estimate for the year 1924 was 4,409,886, which included purchase current in a substantial amount. Applicant has not had a complete year of operation of all generating plants on which to find the actual cost of production. The fact that applicant is able to buy steam-made current at large generating plants which are accessible suggests a question as to the value of a comparison made with the operating costs of a small steam plant. The Commission will defer a finding on this element of value until more dependable operating results have been experienced. The liabilities contain notes payable in the amount of $40,000 and advanced stock payments in the sum of $165,000 which are clear - ly subject to capitalization, as the money received was invested in plant. Applicant does not propose to capitalize its entire surplus. Therefore, we will take $200,000 of this account for capitalization. No dividends have been paid and net earnings have been reinvested with the possible exception of scattered interest payments in small amounts. The fact that the applicant has failed to charge the various plant accounts with money invested should not operate to deny the right to capitalize existing plant. Both applicant and state have </seg>
            <seg id="p280">280 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT attempted to appraise inventories on the cost basis. The differences which have occurred flow from estimated general expenses. In this finding we have attempted to eliminate doubtful items in these esti - mates. Here also applicant's failure to credit operating expenses through the years and charge plant should not serve to reduce the actual investment. Capital for additions and betterments in the amount of $150,000 par value was alleged to be required for growth in the property but no estimates of the immediate necessities were submitted. The Com - mission will act promptly when new capital is required for this pur - fi if an application is filed and properly sustained with supporting i. The company will require $205,000 in cash or its equivalent ch will be subject to a reasonable discount and $200,000 par value of the stock may be issued as a dividend at par. Applicant asks to be allowed a discount of 20 per cent on securi - ties sold. No fixed rule is used for discounts. This is an element of cost and the current market of the different classes of securities ordinarily determine the price. Applicant has been financed very largely by one man and it has not entered the open market to com - pete for funds. Selling expenses are largely eliminated. However, the use of individual credit at current rates of interest will be con - sidered and the Commission will allow the new stock to be issued for funds advanced at a discount of 10 per cent and the Commission will require that the discounts experienced under this provision shall ap - pear as a separate item in the company's statements.

Appearances For the applicant, G. A. Salisbury, manager. For protestants, none. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: Applicant operates a telephone system with headquarters at Bancroft, serving 304 subscribers and a number of switched farm lines. It has 43 business subscribers, 93 individual residence sub - scribers, 16 party residence subscribers and 152 farm stations. Its present rates are as follows: Business $2.00 per month Residence 1.50 " Farm 1.25 " " It makes application for permission to charge the following net rates: At the present time the residence rate covers both individual and party line service. As indicated, it is proposed to make a differential and charge $1.75 per month for individual line residence service. A hearing on this application was had at Bancroft on December Business $3.00 per mon individual residence 1.75 " " J arty residence 1.50 " Pjirm 1 Kn " " 'arm i.ou </seg>
            <seg id="p284">284 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 30, 1924. A few patrons were present at the hearing but none in - dicated a desire to protest against the increased rates as applied for. ■Applicant is a corporation, the stock of which is all owned by 6. A. Salisbury and family. The property was purchased by the present owners about a year and a half ago. All of the farm lines are grounded and this is true of practically all of the lines in town. A few business and residence lines are metallic. It can be stated, however, that the metallic lines are so few that the service as a whole is grounded magneto. The books of the company are now kept accord - ing to the Commission's accounting system and a check of the records shows that they accurately reflect present operating conditions. The published hours of service are from 6:00 a. m. to 10:00 p. m., but the record discloses that a full 24-hour service is rendered, necessitat - ing the full time of three operators who receive salaries of ?45 per month. The operating statement for the year ending October 31, 1924, is as follows: REVENUES: $6,762.66 EXPENSES: $6,798.22 Operating deficit $ 35.66 It will be noted that on this showing there was a deficit for this year without giving consideration to any return whatever on the in - vestment. At the time of the hearing no physical valuation of this property had ever been made. At that time, however, the manager had made a partial inventory which he has since completed. This inventory was made in detail and submitted to the engineering de - partment of this Commission. That department has made an estimate of the original cost of the property based on the inventory submitted and information concerning the condition of the property presented therewith. In this manner the department finds the original cost of the property to be $17,744.75 and. the depreciated cost on that basis $12,426.23. A valuation made on the basis of original cost takes no 'own subscribers' rentals $3,040.25 farm subscribers' rentals 2,364.00 Iwitched lines „ 406.50 toll commission 753.41 .liscellaneous revenue 198.50 total revenue laint enance „ $ 3,544.33 'raffle 1,681.15 Jeneral 1,572.74 'otal expenses </seg>
            <seg id="p285">285 NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION account of increment in the property due to increased prices. In other words, if the valuation had been made on the basis of cost of reproduction new the figures would have been materially increased. For example, if it were assumed that the level of prices today was 25 per cent above the average for the period during which the property was put in place, we would have a valuation of $22,182 reproduc - tion new and $15,500 reproduction new less depreciation. Since the level of prices on telephone material and labor is from 25 per cent to 50 per cent above the pre-war basis, it would appear that not less than the figures just quoted should be used to determine the approxi - mate fair value of the property, although it is not necessary for the purposes of this case to definitely fix such fair value. For the twelve months shown above applicant expended $3,544.33 for the maintenance of the property. This appears to be rather abnormal. It suggests that the property has reached a condition where extensive replacements are necessary and that if an extended period were taken the yearly average would not be so great. We are of the opinion that not to exceed $3,000 should be considered as a normal allowance for this purpose and such allowance should cover both maintenance and depreciation. The rent item included in the twelve months stated will not be normal for the future, since the rent was increased during that period. Applicant now pays $26 a month, $20 for the office occupied by the exchange and $6 per month for garage rent. Formerly the rental was $12 per month. The son of the proprietor is paid $50 per month for keeping the books and doing all of the collecting. This is a slight increase over the amount paid for that purpose during the twelve months shown. Reducing the allowance for maintenance and depreciation as above indicated and making adjustment on the two items just referred to, there would be a net income for the year of $339.02. Dividends at the rate of 8 per cent on $15,000 would be $1,200. If a return of 7 per cent were allowed the requirement will be $1,050. It would appear that not less than $15,000 should be accepted as a basis for a rate of return. The rates as applied for would produce additional revenue of approxi - mately $1,200 per year. The necessity for such an increase is not indicated. Moreover, the schedule of rates as asked for is not well balanced in that the business rates would be rather out of line with the other classes of service. For purposes of comparison we have made a brief compilation of rates in neighboring towns, which is as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p286">286 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Busi- Two Residence Two Party Kami ness Party Residence Pierce M 2.50 M 1.50 M 1.25 Plalnview .... M 2.25 M 1.40 G 1.40 It will be noted that the business rates in the towns listed range from $2.25 to $3.03 per month. Most of these rates are for metallic service. Where the rate is $3.00 the other rates are on a higher basis than is proposed here. Comparisons of this sort are not conclusive, but are helpful in indicating the relationship that should exist be - tween the various classes of service. If a rate of $2.50 per month for individual business service were to be charged by applicant, in connec - tion with the other increases proposed, it would produce an added annual revenue of $993. It is not improbable that there will be a number of transfers from individual residence to party residence Cice, in which event there will be no increase in revenue realized. ifestly, an increase is necessary if the property is to be properly maintained and if any earning at all is to be realized by the owners of the property. We are of the opinion, therefore, that the rates as ted for should be approved, with the exception that the business rate made $2.50 per month instead of $3.00. t Applicant makes no added charge for desk sets. The universal rential for such equipment is 25c per month. Such a rate will be oved, leaving to the subscriber the option as to which class of ument is taken. Subsequent to the hearing an application was made for permis - sion to apply a gross and net rate. Such practice is standard through - out the state and experience has shown that it stimulates prompt pay - ment and reduces the cost of collection, which is reflected in a lower rate than would otherwise be possible. A gross rate 25c per month higher than the base rate herein approved will be authorized, the rsnty-flve cents to be discounted if payment is made within ten days city subscribers and within thirty days by farm subscribers.

The application to amend the table of distances was authorized by the Commission in its order entered January 5, 1925. A hearing was held on the application to amend Section 3, paragraph (e) of 118-B: The applicant introduced testimony to show that the rule as provided in Section 3 of 118-B was made effective on interstate traffic in pursuance to an order entered by the Interstate Commerce Commission in I. &amp; S. Docket 1463, decided May 18, 1922. Protest - ants objected to the establishment of the rule as asked stating that they were of the opinion that if the rule was made effective on Ne - braska lntrastate traffic, the applicant company might use the rule as authority to haul milk and cream shipments via circuitous routes and assess rates on the basis of the longer haul, in addition to a charge for transferring the shipment from one railroad to another. In support of this contention illustrations were offered showing that shipments of cream originating in northern Kansas consigned to Lincoln, were in some instances carried by the applicant company to Kansas City instead of transferring the cream at Marysville, Kansas. Representa - tives of the applicant stated that the instances of the kind mentioned were only exceptional and were bo handled in order to expedite the cream on account of the same arriving at Marysville too late to be handled on the same day via the Union Pacific to Lincoln. From the testimony offered at the hearing, we are of the opinion and so find that the application should be allowed with the provision, however, that transfer points should be shown in the tariff and should be understood that shipments of milk and cream should be handled via circuitous routes and specific transfer points mentioned in the tariff only at the direction of the consignee or consignor. In our original order in this application specific distances were authorized to apply via certain junction points.

Appearances : For applicant, C. A. Magaw, attorney, and C. A. Moore, division superintendent. For Milldale, L. M. Pickett and L. W. Lenhard RANDALL, Commissioner This application was made by the Union Pacific Railroad com - pany to discontinue agency station at Milldale, and substitute therefor caretaker service. Hearing was held at Arnold, on March 11, 1925, before Commissioner Randall. Milldale is a station located on the Kearney-Gandy branch of the Union Pacific Railroad, about eight miles northwest of Callaway and about ten miles southeast of Arnold in Custer county. The town itself is quite small in population, there being only one store, post office, elevator and coal and lumber yard, and about four or five residences. The station at that point serves a large agricultural and stock raising territory and the business of the station has increased its revenue from freight, passenger and express service, which in 1923 was $8,985.19 to $14,964.00 in 1924. This shows a large in - crease and growth in the business of this station which would in - dicate that the services of an agent are more necessary for that volume of business than they previously had been. While it is true, as shown by the testimony, that a large part of Ie business offered the company at this ploint is carload shipments grain and stock that could be billed from Arnold or Callaway as ayed for in the application, yet it is also shown that there is quite volume of less than carload freight, express and passenger business ne at this point. One suprising item in the exhibits is the increase passenger business between the years 1923 and 1924, the ticket sales in 1923 being $419.98 and in 1924, $521.15. This is an unusual condition as at most places the number of local passengers has fallen off quite materially, but in this instance it seems to have increased nearly twenty-five per cent. There was quite a lot of testimony introduced by the applicant company requesting the substitution of a caretaker or janitor service where they now have agency service, but the kind of service that the </seg>
            <seg id="p291">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 291 company proposed to furnish was the requiring of the section fore - man to open the station and, in the season requiring it, to build fire and, during the time of day necessary, provide light, but the section foreman would be attending to his duties as such foreman and would not be at the station to receive and deliver express or less than car - load shipments or to receive communications from Arnold or Callaway affecting the business at those points. The company has a private telephone line connecting the station with Callaway on the southeast and Arnold on the northwest, and it was proposed by the company that all telegrams would be telephoned to Milldale by the agent at Callaway or Arnold, and that the telegrams would be delivered to the parties to whom sent by the caretaker or janitor; also the caretaker would order cars for the shipment of stock and grain from either Callaway or Arnold over this phone line, hut with the office locked and the section foreman out attending to his duties as such foreman, the public would have no way of communicating over this phone in the company's office except, perchance, the section foreman happened to In - at the station before going out on his duties or after coming back in the evening after his day's work. So this telegraph service and the ordering of cars would practically be confined to the early morning or late in the evening after the section foreman had completed his day's work, which, in a community so widely scattered over the territory and not being connected with the depot by telephone, would be very unsatisfactory service and would not serve the public sufficiently. Another important matter was brought out in the hearing, that it would be necessary for shippers of cream or less than carload freight or express to be present at the station when the train arrives and deliver to the train crew their shipment in order to get a receipt from some one who had authority to give such a receipt, or leave the freight, express or cream either in the freight room or on the platform to be picked up by the train crew when they came by, with nothing to show that such freight or express had been left for shipment by them. This condition was very unsatisfactory to the shippers and was seriously objected to. Also, it was shown by the testimony that the company proposed to leave the freight house unlocked so that parties having less than carload freight shipped to them could go in and help them - selves to it, with no one to check it out to them unless they called for it very early in the morning before the section foreman went out on his work or waited until evening after the foreman's day's work was done. The substitution of the proposed janitor service for that of an agent would necessitate the prepayment of all freight and express and unless the agent at Callaway or Arnold would be willing to trust a party sending a telegram until they could go to one or the other of these towns to pay him, it would necessitate the going to either Arnold </seg>

The Commission does not look with favor upon this kind of serv - ice. In instances where it is necessary to change from an agency to a caretaker in the interests of economy, the Commission has granted the application of the company to make such substitution, but the company was required to give reasonable service, a service that about the only difference between agency service and the caretaker service, was the prepayment of freight and express and the paying of fare on the train instead of purchasing tickets at the station, but the care - taker would be required to be on duty either at the depot or in close proximity thereto where patrons desiring to order cars or make ship - ments either of less than carload freight or express, could give their orders to the caretaker and he in turn notify the agent at the nearest shipping point, so that the residents of the community would receive a good substitute for agency service with but little change, which would not discommode them very much. But these instances where permission has been granted is where business has been falling off, owing to the truck carrying freight and produce, and the bus and automobile, the passengers, but this condition does not attain at Mill - dale as the increase in business in 1924 over 1923 is nearly forty per cent and from testimony it was quite clearly shown that there would be a substantial increase in the year 1925 over 1924, conditional, however, upon average crops. The company is maintaining a student agency at this point, which is not a very expensive proposition as compared with a regular telegraph agency station, being shown that the student agent was paid $100 per month and that the total amount of expense to that station would not exceed ten per cent of the revenue received at that station. After considering all the testimony and conditions in this case, the Commission is of the opinion that the application of the Union Pacific Railroad company to substitute Janitor caretaker service for agency service at Milldale, should be denied.

Appearances: For applicant, C. A. Magaw, attorney, and C. A. Moore, division superintendent. For Logan, G. I. Perkins, A. C. C. Stockall, F. J. Lemkhuler. RANDALL, Commissioner: This application was made by the Union Pacific Railroad company to discontinue agency station at Logan, and substitute therefor care - taker service. Hearing was held at Arnold, on March 11, 1925, before Commissioner Randall. Logan is a station located on the Kearney-Gandy branch of the Union Pacific Railroad, seven and one-half miles northwest of Arnold and eleven and seven-tenths miles east of Stapleton, in Logan county. The town itself is quite small in population, there being only one store, post office, elevator, coal and lumber yard, blacksmith shop, consoli - dated district school house and three residences. The station at that point serves a large agricultural and stock raising territory and the business of the station has increased its revenue from freight, pas - senger and express service, which in 1923 was $7,227.31 to $13,782.90 in 1924. This shows a large increase and growth in the business of this station which would indicate that the services of an agent are more necessary for that volume of business than they previously had been. While it is true, as shown by the testimony, that a large part of the business offered the company at this point is carload shipments of grain and stock that could be billed from Arnold as prayed for in the application, yet it is also shown that there is quite a volume of less than carload freight, express and passenger business done at thin point. .

            <seg id="p296">296 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT APPLICATION NO. 5741 In the Matter of the Application of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis ft Omaha Railway Company for Authority to Discontinue Its Trains Nos. 40 and 41, Crofton Line, and Nos. 50 and 51, Bloom - field Line. Appearances For the applicant, Robert E. Neely, attorney; E. C. Blundell division superintendent. For the respondents, J. C. Robinson, Bloomfield; P. H. Peterson, Wausa; C. W. Peasinger, Wayne; A. R. Davis, Wayne, for the Bloomfield Line. A. S. Boden, for Sioux City Chamber of Commerce. Lee Miller, Hartington; L. R. Eby, Harting - ton; B. Ready, Hartington; J. W. Linkhart, Coleridge; T. Linkhart, Coleridge; Charles Ruden, Crofton; Harry West, Crofton; B. R. Cole, Crofton; M. T. Liewer, Crofton, for the Crofton Line. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: In this proceeding the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway company asks authority to eliminate trains Nos. 50 and 51. operating between Bloomfield and Wayne, and trains Nos. 40 and 41, operating between Crofton and Wakefleld. In connection with the elimination of these trains, No. 57 will be scheduled to leave Emerson at 8:35 a. m. instead of 7 a. m. Existing trains 44 and 45 on the Crofton branch will handle the passenger and freight business now handled by Nos. 40 and 41, and Nos. 56 and 57 on the Bloomfield line will handle the business now transported on Nos. 50 and 51. It is urged that a continued falling off in passenger traffic necessitates a curtailment of service on these two branches, and the abandonment of the trains in question is proposed as a measure in that direction. A hearing on this application was held at Wayne on December 29. It was attended by a large number of citizens residing in the towns served by these two branches. A large amount of testimony relating to the effect the abandonment of these trains would have upon the passenger, mall and express service was presented by protestants. In support of its application the company submitted a rather elaborate traffic study covering a period of five months, June to October, inclusive. In this study an accurate count of passengers on </seg>
            <seg id="p297">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 297 each train was made and the revenue computed on the basis of the mileage each passenger traveled on the branch. As to train No. 50, the studies show that the average daily revenue receipts were $14.08, and the average number of passengers carried 16. Train No. 51 showed an average revenue of $11.06 and an average number of passengers carried 13. Train No. 41 showed an average daily revenue of $8.81 and an average number of passengers carried 11.7. Train No. 40 showed average daily revenue of $10.13 and an average number of passengers carried 12.5. No attempt was made to ascertain the revenue accruing to these trains from express, excess baggage or freight. It should be stated in this connection that all of the trains in - volved in this application carry both freight and passengers. A passenger coach and combination mail and express car are attached to the freight train. A study for a like period as to the number of freight cars handled on these trains discloses that from one to six empty or loaded freight cars were handled on Nos. 50 and 51. Traia 40 handled practically no freight for the months shown but No. 41 handled from two and a half to four cars per day on the average. In connection with the traffic study submitted applicant presents a gross revenue and expense statement covering the operation of the trains in question. For the five months, June to October, Inclusive, the gross revenue from passenger service only on trains Nos. 40 and 41 was $3,341.73. The expense for the same period and same trains was $9,807.54. The showing for trains Nos. 50 and 51 for the some period disclosed revenue receipts of $4,358.77 and an operating expense of $8,798.58. These figures indicate a very substantial loss in the operation of these trains. However, in the expense statement applicant has included an item of engine rental at $15 per day. When questioned as to an explanation of this item Mr. Blundell, division superintendent, stated that it represented a uniform allowance made by the company on all of its locomotives when they are leased to other lines or to any special service. In his opinion it is proper to in - clude this charge in a statement designed to show the "out of pocket, cost" of operating trains. The total of this rental for the five months period is $1,950 for each line. In our opinion, this is an improper charge in a statement of this kind. It represents the return to the company on the investment in the locomotive. To be consistent the company should ask for a similar allowance on the passenger coaches and other equipment in the train. According to our understanding of the phrase, "out of pocket cost," a return on property is never in - cluded. For that reason we believe the item should be excluded from the statement. In one statement showing the operation of the trains, but cover - ing a period of only thirty days, from October 7 to November 6, 1924.. the company included figures for the increased expense that would </seg>
            <seg id="p298">298 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT be necessary in the operation of the consolidated trains. This expense would be incurred by added compensation to the train crews. Th«s record also shows that there would be some increased station expenses due to over-time employment. In the five months statement no effort is made to take this added cost into consideration — its inclusion would reduce the anticipated savings correspondingly. At the time of the hearing applicant submitted the revenues derived from carrying mail on these trains. For the five months period the revenue on Nos. 40 and 41 derived from this source amounted to $630.50, and for trains Nos. 50 and 51, $553.40. Adding the mail receipts, trains Nos. 40 and 41 showed a gross revenue of $3,972.23 and after deducting the engine rental, an expense of $7,857.54, thus leaving a deficit of $3,885.31. Nos. 50 and 51 showed a gross revenue of $4,912.17 and an expenses of $6,848.58, with a deficit of $1,936.41. These figures cover the five-month period. No consideration in these figures is given to the increased cost of operation of the consolidated trains. Patrons vigorously object to the proposed curtailment of service. They contend that the schedules will be such as to make impossible going from any point on either branch to Sioux City or Omaha and return the same day. This would apply to trips to other points as well. The chief objection, however, is as to the interference with mail and express service, particularly mail. The substitute trains would be set back in their time and would be scheduled to arrive at the ends of the line by 3:45 in the afternoon. If assurance could be given that they Euld be on time the mail service would not be seriously impaired, was" shown that trains Nos. 41 and 51 carry very heavy mail. A isolidation of the freight and passenger business, however, and the elimination of the trains in question, protestants feel, would result in great delay in the arrival of the consolidated trains. This is admitted by applicant in its application, wherein it states that the running time of No. 45, which would be the outbound train on the Crofton line, is scheduled at 7 hours and 5 minutes, but would require from 9 to 10 hours on account of switching and a heavier train. No. 57, which is the outbound Bloomfield train, is scheduled to make the run in 7 hours and 55 minutes but it also would require from 9 to 10 hours on ■ account of switching and heavier train. It follows, therefore, that the consolidated trains would not reach the terminals before 5 or 6 o'clock in the evening, and quite frequently might be later. This delay and uncertainty of arrival would affect not only mail and express but would render the trains undesirable for passenger service. kAt the present time on these two branches there are three trains way daily. All of them carry freight. There is no exclusive mger train service. With the consolidation of the two mixed trains the freight handled on the trains carrying passengers would be greatly increased. Without question the service from a passenger </seg>
            <seg id="p299">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 299 standpoint would be materially impaired. Certainty of arrival is a prime requisite in passenger service. When freight is handled prompt schedules cannot be maintained. It is admitted by applicant that from one to three hours delay should be anticipated, the amount of this delay being dependent upon the switching and tonnage handled by the trains. It has already been pointed out that only the passenger and mail revenues were shown in the statements submitted by applicant. It was asserted by protestants and admitted by applicant that trains Nos. 41 and 51 handled a large amount of express. On this record the Commission has no means of knowing the amount of revenue that accrues from this source. It undoubtedly is material, however. The revenue from excess baggage would be nominal and would not affect the result one way or the other. There is point to the contention of protestants, however, since the trains in question handled freight, that revenue from this source might properly be taken into account. The answer of the company is that the amount of such freight is small and that it can readily be handled on the other train. Criticism was made of the period of time taken for ascertaining the passenger revenues. Applicant admits that another period might have made a better showing. Crop conditions in this particular territory also were unfavorable this year and have had their effect on both freight and passenger revenues. It would appear that if passenger, express and mail revenues were taken into account, to say nothing of freight, trains Nos. 50 and 51 are being operated without a loss. Nos. 40 and 41 are not doing so well, although without a full showing it cannot be said that they are operat - ing at a substantial loss. The company apparently has proceeded upon the theory that an adverse showing as to passenger traffic warrants a curtailment of the service and that if the passenger revenue alone is insufficient to pay the entire "out of pocket" expense it justifies the application. With this theory we cannot agree. The company is operating a railroad over which it transports passengers, express, mail, baggage and freight. All of these commodities are handled on the trains in question. That there has been a substantial falling off in passenger revenue is obvious. That this falling off is due to the in - creased use of automobiles is equally manifest. It is not unlikely that if the traffic continues to fall off applicant will be justified in curtailing its passenger service. Patrons of the railroad should realize that they cannot withdraw traffic from passenger trains through the use of automobiles and expect a continuance of passenger train service. Under all of the evidence submitted in behalf of this application, however, we conclude that the abandonment of the trains as proposed by applicant is not justified, at least for the present. The application will, therefore, be denied. </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 5742 In the Matter of the Application of the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway Company for Authority to Increase Passenger Rates.

OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: Petitioner prays for authority to so amend its charges for trans - portation services within the city of Omaha, as to enable it to collect in aggregate amount, sufficient to provide a net return of 7 per cent on the valuation heretofore found by the Commission, plus additions and betterments made since December 31, 1919, after having paid all legitimate operating expenses. Petitioner sets forth that since 1919 the earnings have been so inadequate that the company has failed to earn 7 per cent on its fair value by an aggregate amount $1,924,942. </seg>
            <seg id="p301">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 301 The city of Omaha, formally appearing, challenges chiefly the right of the company to earn 7 per cent on its value "under the circumstances and conditions surrounding the operating of that part of its system operated in the city and the state." Hearing was had in the federal court room at Omaha, March 16 to 24, inclusive. At the beginning of the taking of testimony, the Commission ruled that it would limit testimony on fair value of the company's property to the effect of changes of price levels, if any, and to the additions and betterments to the property since the date of the previous investigation on values. It also ruled that it would receive any testimony bearing on a proper rate of return which the company is entitled to ask an opportunity to earn. In its opinion regarding the values dated December 25, 1923, the Commission said that at that time 7 per cent was a fair rate of return. The ruling in this case was that any testimony bearing upon that subject was relevant. Objections from the company to the appearance of the city and certain improvement clubs and from the Independent Club to the appearance of counsel for the Street Railway company, were over - ruled. The fair value of the applicant's Nebraska properties as of date December 31, 1919, was fixed by the Commission at $14,100,000 in its original and supplemental order on Application 3539- A. The company accounts showed additions and betterments since that date in net amount $502,466 and it claimed that this should be added to the rate base in determining the proper earnings. The city took the position that there had been no net gain in value and that the property constructed had been entirely from reserve funds set aside as an offset (or accrued and unrealized depreciation. The record is uncontradicted that the additions and betterments from December 31, 1919, to December 31, 1924, were in the amounts stated by applicant. An exhibit was presented which showed that the accrual of reserve for depreciation between December 31, 1919, and December 31, 1924, had been $1,921,718 against which charges had been made for retirements in amount $1,202,996. The increase in the accrual during the five-year period had therefore been $718,722. During four and one-half years of the five-year period, applicant had charged as an expense and credited its reserve account at the rate of $395,000 per annum. It had made charges against the accrual to meet the current necessities of retirements. In its order dated Sept. 6, 1921, the Commission indicated that the rate of accrual exceeded the experienced realized and unrealized depreciation as found from the valuation studies. In 1924, the company accepted this point of view and voluntarily adjusted its expense account to $300,000 per year to </seg>
            <seg id="p302">302 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT meet the depreciation of the Nebraska properties as compared with $395,000 theretofore set up. Our conclusions in the order dated September 6, 1921, that the then annual expense to meet depreciation was too high, leads logically to the conclusion that the $718,722 credit balance in the reserve ac - count covering five years' operations was too much and that a portion of it should have been profit and loss. However, in the absence of proof to the contrary the Commission will assume that the $502,000 which was invested in additions and betterments in that time about offset the accrued and unrealized depreciation on account of which the $718,722 had been accrued. The rate base will, therefore, be considered as $14,100,000 for the purpose of this case. The contention of the company in other respects as set forth in Exhibit 21 relating to previous deficits in the depreciation reserve fund necessary to overcome, are not sound under the reasoning of our opinion in Application 3539- A. Applicant devoted a large part of its brief to support of its application, to the contention as a matter of law, that it is entitled to rates at this time which will not only enable it to earn wages on capital equal to 7 per cent on the fair value, but to amortize over a iive-year period, the alleged $1,924,942 deficit below a 7 per cent return during the past few years. The city of Omaha in brief con - tends that this position is unsound and points out inter alia that the company did not seek increased returns and hence was a party to the operating results which did occur. Applicant has presented its au - thorities in support of its position, chief among which are Galveston Electric company v. City of Galveston, 258 U. S. 388, 66 L. Ed. 678: Mobile Water company v. Patterson, 293 Fed. 208; Louisiana Water company v. Public Service Commission, 294 Fed. 954; Streator Aqueduct Company v. Smith, 295 Fed. 385; Petersburg Gas company v. City of Petersburg, 110 S. E. 533. Counsel for the Commission filed memorandum brief taking the position that Georgia Railroad Power company v. Railway Commission, 278 Fed. 242, as anlrmed by 262 U. S. 625, overturns the previous decisions and renders the contention of the company unsound. It would appear equitable that, where the Commission estimates future trend of business in endeavoring to limit fares to a level which will earn only a fair return on a fair value, and uses that estimate in fixing the rates, the company ought not to be without relief from loss which may occur during a trial period under the estimates. </seg>
            <seg id="p303">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 303 It is pointed out by the city, however, that in the prayer of its petition the company made no claim for rates which would amortize an alleged deficit. It is further contended by the city that the com - pany itself agreed that it would not seek increased rates, because it desired to give the public the benefit of the lowest possible rates. In its brief filed in support of its valuation case, on June 20, 1922, the company set forth its position relative to a rate increase as follows: "The factors justifying economic rates are present at the time of filing this brief. The company is not pressing for the increase in rates necefesary to yield a reasonable return upon the value of the property, and is of the opinion that the existing rates should be continued in effect temporarily and until such time as the company may hereafter formally apply to the Com - mission for an increase in the rates. The company's business indicates some improvement and some reduction in operating costs is being effected. An improvement is also taking place in industry in general, which, it is hoped, will be reflected in due time in greater operating revenues to the company. It may be that the country is in the way of a general recovery from the existing depression and that the restoration of normal conditions will enable the company to recoup its losses and earn a reason - able compensation for its service without an increase of rates. The prevailing purpose in industry is to assist this movement in a general way as much as possible, and particularly in the ac - ceptance of lower incomes, and the company shares in this pur - pose. The company is also actuated by its traditional desire for a satisfied patronage and a greater Omaha, and it intends to do everything in its power to achieve those ends. Consequently and inasmuch as the return now received by the company is con - siderably below the compensation to which the company is law - fully entitled on the basis of any finding as to value based upon the record, the Commission should disregard the question of rates in arriving at the value of the property." No change in this position was made until the filing of the present application on December 16, 1924. It is true that in 1921, the Commission denied the company's application for an increase in rates and recommended that in lieu of such increase of rates, the company try out certain plans for reduc - ing expenses including a horizontal wages cut. These plans were followed by the company and as has been shown above it took the position voluntarily shortly thereafter, that it would for the time being abandon the idea of increasing its rates. In our opinion, the circumstances of this case put the question of amortization of past deficits under the rule of Knoxville v. Knoxville Water company, 212 U. S. 1. We reject consideration of past deficits for the following reasons. </seg>
            <seg id="p304">304 First, the company voluntarily agreed to a rate situation which resulted in failure to earn a tair return; Second, the approval by the supreme court of the United States of a conclusion by the court below contrary to such amortization obligation; Third, the prayer for relief does not include a demand for amortization of past deficits in fair return. Concrete evidence of the company sustains the conclusion that the present rates of fare in Omaha are below the average found necessary Sthe United States. Among the larger companies of the country. ler the labor conditions obtaining in the northern part of the United tes, Sioux City has the same street car fare as Omaha. The Twin y Rapid Transit company of Minneapolis, Detroit Municipal Rail - way, Cleveland Railway company, both companies in Los Angeles, surface lines in New York City, and both the Market Street Railway and the Municipal Railway of San Francisco have lower fares than at present exist in Omaha. Omaha has during the period of receding traffic and high operat - ing costs, had the advantage of these lower rates. The public should continue to receive the benefit from high economy of track location and the close supervision of a corps of expert department heads. To the degree that this management is better than the average, some reflex of that fact will appear in the rate structure. THE LIMIT OF JURISDICTION In petition and on brief, the company has contented itself with demand that it be authorized to publish rates which will pay all legiti - mate operating expenses and provide a residue equal to 7 per cent on the fair value of the property. Considerable attention was given in the brief to the legal right alleged to exist to earn 8 per cent return on the fair value. This Commission has repeatedly said that the rule' to follow was that the rate of return should be sufficiently high to maintain the credit of the utility and enable it to secure such funds as might from time to time be necessary in meeting the public de - mand for service. This necessary rate is somewhat affected in fact and in law, by the payment by the corporation of income taxes and the relief of the stockholder to that degree. Galveston Electric com - pany v. City of Galveston, 258 U. S. 388. A long line of decisions of the controlling courts sustains such a rule. The city points out in its brief that the common stock of the company now outstanding does v.ot under the findings of the Com- </seg>
            <seg id="p305">305 NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION mission, represent an investment in property used and useful in street railway transportation, and that a 7 per cent return on the fair value as insisted upon by the company, would provide substantial margin over and above both interest on bonds and dividends on the preferred stock. This margin would be available, if the corporation so willed, as dividends on common stock, on which common stock the city casts the cloud. In the application of the Lincoln Traction company in 1918 for an increase in fares, this Commission took the position that its right to relief was blocked by the payment of dividends on stock which did not represent investment. The high court of this state corrected this view and said that the patrons of a utility are not con - cerned especially with what is done with the legal earnings after they have been collected. Lincoln Traction company v. City of Lincoln, 103 Neb. 239. We are controlled by that decision. It is true that if the fair return is fixed at 7 per cent on the fair value there will for the time being result in a margin of profit annually over and above the fixed charges and dividends on preferred stock. This margin is secured at the expense of the bond holder and pre - ferred stock owner who are, because of contract relations with the company, earning less today than fair interest rates on the money they have invested. This company approaches refinancing in major degree. No possibility is in sight of a continuation of contract arrangement between corporation and creditor whereby the common stockholder can continue to reap his present advantage. The city also presents the following pertinent inquiries: "It is conceded, of course, that the Commission must de - termine for itself whether or not it possesses the jurisdiction and authority in law to aptply this theory to the instant application. In any event, we must all concede that, at least, the Federal Constitution, probably most State Constitutions, and generally speaking, the law of the land guarantees to a utility concern an opportunity to earn a reasonable rate upon the fair value of the property. Does this mean that when a fair value of the property has been ascertained, as it has been in this case, and a reasonable rate of return determined upon, as will be in this proceeding, then the Commission has, under the law, the duty imposed upon it to apply such rate of return to the fair value of the property and fix rates of fare to provide an amount which would result from applying the ascertained reasonable rate of return to the ascer - tained fair value, leaving the results to the utility as to whether or not the traffic will bear the charge? Or, may the Commission, under the known state of the law and from the state of the record including what it is authorized judicially to know, take into consideration matters and things that determine economic rates rather than legal rates and accordingly fix a rate structure designed simply to furnish the economic rate of return?" As we understand the law, a public utility cannot demand and </seg>
            <seg id="p306">306 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT exact more than the value of the service, or more than the traffic will bear. If the net income under differing levels of rates would be the same, it is the Commission's duty and right to require that the lesser rate be charged. But whether it is an advisable thing for the com - pany to exact its full legal rights in the way of compensation for service, is a question of management. If economic conditions in the territory served, make inadvisable rates which will result in a fair return, the conclusion is one to be reached by the corporation rather than by enforced action by this Commission. Street railways have been notoriously suffering from the inroads of privately owned gas-propelled vehicles. Revenues have shrunk. More than in any other public industry, receiverships have occurred in recent years. The investing public is doubtful of the securities of electric railways. Its reluctance is overcome only by the offer of additional wages of capital. These are facts which must be recognized in arriving at conclusions. As we have pointed out, this company has thus far been able to avoid this result through long-term contracts entered into with capital before the combination of circumstances were as at present. METHOD OF DIVIDING EXPENSES For the purpose of convenience it might be well to outline briefly at the outset of this portion of these findings, the accounting practices of the applicant as shown by the record as to the separation of the results of operation as between Nebraska and Iowa. The Omaha and Council Bluffs properties are managed entirely from the Omaha office. The heads of departments and all of their office assistants are located in Omaha. The current used by Council Bluffs cars is generated at the power station located on the Nebraska side of the Missouri River. Three sub-stations are maintained by the company, two in Nebraska and one in Iowa. The operation and main - tenance of the bridge across the Missouri River is under the direct supervision of the Omaha office. That portion of the company's property that is located in East Omaha is partly on Nebraska and partly on Iowa soil. All of the operating revenues and expenses of the East Omaha line are taken into account as part of the Nebraska The cars that operated between Council Bluffs and Omaha use one of the double track facilities between Ninth and Fourteenth streets on Douglas and between Douglas and Howard on Fourteenth, between Fourteenth and Twelfth on Howard and on Twelfth street, Howard to Douglas. The fares collected on the cars here mentioned are all credited to the Council Bluffs division. The wages paid platform men </seg>

The amount paid by rental companies to-wit; Omaha &amp; Lincoln Railway &amp; Light com - pany, which operates cars over the applicant's lines between Sixteenth and Capitol avenue and the southwestern city limits, and the Omaha &amp; Southern which operates cars over applicant's line between the southern city limits and Twenty-fourth and "O" streets, South Omaha, are all credited to the Nebraska division. The expense of maintaining the bridge over the Missouri river, and all of the track structures and overhead distribution system located in Iowa are charged on the books of the company direct to the Council Bluffs division. The total power house cost, including current maintenance and depreciation is divided monthly between Iowa and Nebraska divisions on a revenue car mile basis. The expense of the general offices in Omaha is divided monthly between the Iowa and Nebraska divisions on a revenue car mile basis. Maintenance of all work cars used in the construction or maintenance of facilities located in Iowa is charged direct monthly, to the Council Bluffs division. Repair and reconstruction of Council Bluffs cars in the shops of the company located in Omaha are charged direct to the Council Bluffs division, together with a proportion of the current expenses of operating and maintaining the shops on the Nebraska side of the river. THE COMPANY'S EVIDENCE In support of the application for an increase in fares, a large number of exhibits was introduced in testimony by Mr. W. G. Nichol - son, secretary and auditor of the company. The most important exhibit introduced by this witness was a comparative income statement for the Nebraska division for the years 1920 to 1924, inclusive, based on the actual revenues and expenses as shown by the applicant's books, except for the year 1920 at which time the company did not separate its operating revenues and expenses in the same manner as it did for the years 1921 and thereafter. The applicant appears to rest its application for an increase in fares, on an estimate of the results of operating the Nebraska division for the year 1925 which is shown on the income statement introduced in testimony by Mr. Nicholson. Ij the income statement here referred to the company has set up the amount of money necessary to provide a return of 7 per cent on the Nebraska property as fixed by the Com - mission, as of September 1, 1919, in the sum of $14,100,000.

Numerous exhibits were introduced in support of the income statement for the several years. The operating expenses were shown for each operating expense account for a five-year period. The num- ber of revenue passengers carried on the Nebraska division for the years 1920 to 1924, inclusive, was introduced in the record. For the several years the figures are as follows: 1920 61,650,839 1921 58,807,511 1922 57,964,812 1923 56,063,792 1924 53,274,810 1925 (Estimated) 50,608,683 The applicant showed in testimony that the loss in revenue for the several years was occasioned by the passengers who rode on ticket fares. The passengers who paid cash remained almost constant during the five-year period. The children fares decreased slightly during the period and the number of riders on school tickets increased somewhat year by year from 1920 to 1924. The number of passengers carried in 1924 as compared with 1920, by classification, was shown to be follows Cash Ticket Children School Children Fares Fares Ticket Fares Ticket Fares 1920 5,588,551 53,462,883 2,064,785 542,602 1924 5,441,457 45,094,238 1,861,884 869,214 The company estimates that the number of adult ticket riders for 1925 will be 42,479,791. The applicant introduced a detailed statement showing all of the charges made to the depreciation reserve account for replacement and reconstruction of Nebraska property for the five yean 1920 to 1924, both included, as follows: </seg>

At the request of the corporation counsel for Omaha, the company introduced in evidence a statement showing the common operating expenses computed on several bases for the year 1924. The applica- tion of the different bases had the result of stating the operating expenses chargeable to the Nebraska division by group of accounts as follows: Transportation Car Miles Track Miles Revenue Way and Structure $ 294,721.40 $ 292,186.01 $ Maintenance of Equipment.. 280,786.35 278,101.22 Power 379,909.20 379,278.71 Conducting Transportation.. 1,1 8 0,3 5 5. 7 5 1,177,604.46 1,180,289.98 Traffic 4,655.23 4,347.92 4,640.63 General 270,272.46 259,679.04 204,042.69 Transpn. &amp; Invest.

In this exhibit the witness takes the revenue passengers as reported by the company in its exhibit No. 3 and computes the "return on value of property per revenue passenger based on a seven per cent return." By his calculation he attempts to state the rate of return which would be required to maintain the same cost of capital per revenue pas- senger for each of the years 1921 to 1925, inclusive, based on a seven per cent return for the year 1920. The exhibit shows the following percentages by years. 1920 7. 1921 6.68 1922 6.58 1923 6.36 1924 6.5 1925 5.75 Hereafter in these findings where we speak of the "Iowa division" we refer to the leased property operated by the aplicant including the Missouri River bridge.

            <seg id="p311">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 311 Nebraska, including the loop and the East Omaha line. Where we speak of the "loop" we refer to that portion of the applicant's prop - erty located in Nebraska heretofore described as used by the Council Bluffs cars Ninth on Douglas to Fourteenth, south on Fourteenth to Howard, east on Howard to Twelfth, north on Twelfth to Douglas, east on Douglas to Ninth. It should be apparent to anyone connected with this case, that the applicant is not receiving a reasonable return on the fair value of the property devoted to public use in Omaha. The question here is, what should the increase in the revenues, be, and how should the burden be distributed between the several classes of passengers using the service. In the valuation case we became thoroughly familiar with all of the property of the applicant and the methods used in accounting for the operation of the property, as well as the placement of additions and betterments to the company's facilities. For more than five years we have required the applicant to file weekly statements of its operat - ing revenues and monthly statements in detail as to its operating expenses and net operating income. In an order entered in September, 1921, we denied the applicant an emergency increase in fares, and urged definite economies in labor costs and depreciation reserve cost. As to probable results it was said: "Because of the existing industrial depression, the large number of unemployed and the prevailing discontent, it is im - possible to estimate or forecast the effect of an increase of fares. In other words, an increase, unless it was very slight, might result in accelerating the present loss in traffic to the point where added revenue could not be secured. In our opinion the neces - sities of the company at this time do not make it necessary to assume the hazard of such a loss. We have suggested as an alternative a policy of economy, the prime factor in which is a reduction of wages. This, together with the use of available re - serves gives strong promise of carrying the company through the present crises. Necessarily, this conclusion is based on esti - mates. The company, even with the best of efforts, may not succeed in accomplishing the economies we think possible. In that event there will be but one other course — the securing of the necessary revenue through some further increase in rates. If the remedy we now suggest does fail, we shall not hesitate to adopt the other, since street railway transportation for the city of Omaha is too vital to the welfare of that community to be permitted to languish or ride into disaster for want of revenue to pay for its maintenance." (Page 190, 1921 Annual Report of the Commission.) At the time the above quoted language was used the Commission </seg>
            <seg id="p312">312 EIGHTEENTH A^i.N UA.L RuFORT had not yet entered its decision in tbe valuation case. Since that time, the fair value of the property has been found by the Commission. Some of the economies that were anticipated by the Commission in the above quoted decision, have been realised by the company but they have not been sufficient to meet the greatly reduced revenue re - ceived by the applicant for the carrying of passengers in Omaha. For convenience of reference, we will subdivide this section of the findings in this case into the following general headings (1) Revenues; (2) Nebraska Property Used by Council Bluffs Cars; (S) Depreciation; (4) Operating Expenses; (5) Operating Income. REVENUES — PRESENT AND PROSPECTIVE The greatest number of passengers the applicant ever handled was in the year 1920. Since that time there has been a general decline, more or less spasmodic. The losses on the number of fares collected since 1920 have been as follows: Percentage of loss over the preceding year Year The first four months of 1925 as compared with the same four months in 1924 show a loss of 8.5. Prior to the war the company experienced an annual increase of revenue passengers carried of around five per cent. During the war the number of revenue pas - sengers carried by the system as a whole by years, according to the annual reports filed with the Commission were as follows: Year Millions 1914 54.9 1915 54.1 1916 58.9 1917 61.7 1918 60.7 1919 70.1 1920 72.1 The Nebraska division in 1920 carried 61,700,000 passengers. Since that year the decrease in the number of passengers has been as stated above. In Exhibit No. 1 of the applicant, the revenue from passengers carried is calculated on the basis of five per cent less than the SZ1 _. 922 923 924 4.Y% 1.6% 3.3% 5. % </seg>
            <seg id="p313">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 313 revenue received from transportation of passengers in 1924. The average loss of revenue passengers for the three-year period, 1922 to 1924, inclusive, has been 1,844,000 passengers per annum. In terms of revenue the annual average loss has been $113,000 for the same three years. It is a very hard matter to estimate what the loss on traffic will be for the entire year of 1925 as compared with 1924. We are not convinced that in estimating the passenger revenue for 1925 the loss should be calculated on the same percentage as experienced in 1924 as compared with 1923. While the first four months of 1925 appear to Justify the five per cent estimated by the applicant, we are inclined to the opinion that the business depression that has been rather pronounced in Omaha during the last eighteen or twenty-four months, has had a considerable effect on the revenues of the applicant. For the purpose of deciding this case we will estimate that the revenue received by the applicant will be more nearly reflected by using the annual average loss in revenue for the past three years, 1922 to 1924. This average annual loss in revenue as stated was $113,000. That sum deducted from the total passenger revenue of 1924 results in a figure of $3,186,369 which we shall use in a constructive income state - ment that will be brought together later on in these findings. In the estimate of revenues for 1925, applicant has included $6,500 as the interest on working capital. This is based on the 2 per cent per annum paid on balances of cash in the bank, calculated monthly. This rate is the maximum generally paid by banks on bal - ances subject to check. In the valuation case we allowed $200,000 reserve for injuries and damages as additional working capital. The record of this account Indicates that the reserve is not called upon to any degree for current demands. It is on hand for major exigencies. The $200,000 is in existence, having been created over many years' time, as an expense charge. It is not economy to carry this reserve in the bank subject to check, under the circumstances stated. The fact is the company does not usually so carry it. If the company is to be allowed a fair return on a very considerable reserve covering protec - tion against large disaster, it ought to earn as much as possible on that investment as an offset to the return. The steadiness of the balance in this account, over a considerable number of years, would warrant the company in investing it in not less than 5 per cent securi - ties which can be turned readily into cash. If the company does this and the amount is added to the 2 per cent which is actually received from cash balances made up of accumulating bond interest, taxes and other items where accumulations are essential, the amount earned as interest on working capital will not be less than $15,000. </seg>
            <seg id="p314">314 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT . As to revenues from other railway operations, the estimate of applicant fairly reflects the probabilities and we will accept the amount shown on exhibit No. 1 for the year 1925 in the sum of $73,770. We £also include the estimate of the company for special car revenue miscellaneous transportation in amount $1200. Our conclusion therefore is that the revenues of 1925 under present rates which may be fairly forecast from the carrying of pas - sengers and from all other sources which we take into account here will be $3,276,139. NEBRASKA PROPERTY USED BY COUNCIL BMJFFS CARS The company has deducted from the 7 per cent annual return on the value of the property as fixed by the Commission, the sum of $38,093 as the amount of taxes and fair return that should be charged against the Iowa division, for the property located in Nebraska used in common by both divisions. The use of the Nebraska property by Council Bluffs is represented in three subdivisions; (a) power station buildings equipment, and real estate; (b) shop buildings equipment and real estate; (c) the loop used by Council Bluffs cars in handling traffic between Omaha and Council Bluffs, heretofore explained in de - tail. Tested by the data submitted by the company in the valuation case we find that the amount credited to the Nebraska division and charged to Iowa is not sufficient to take care of the items mentioned in his testimony. In making the allocation of interest and taxes on that portion «the company's property located in Nebraska and used in common the Iowa division the "bare bones" present value based on 1919 prices for the power station buildings, equipment, and real estate, and the repair shop buildings, equipment and real estate were aggre - gated and to the figures so found 60.54 per cent was applied in order to equalize the figures with the findings of the Commission as to the fair value of the Nebraska property, which is the percentage that $14,100,000 (Commission's fair value), is of $23,291,722, (company's present value 1919 prices). In the last two sums just stated the over - head figures are included. "The bare bones" figures for the power station and repair shops do not include the overheads, consequntly the ratio of 60.54 per cent could not properly be applied to the figures for the power station and shops. When the figures have been properly equated we find that the total amount of Nebraska property represented by power station buildings, equipment, and real estate and shop buildings, equipment, and real estate pro rated to the Iowa division on a revenue per car mile basis for 1924 is $524,122.85. </seg>
            <seg id="p315">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 315 The amount of money included by the company as representing the present value of the property used by the Council Bluffs cars in the loop, after having been adjusted to the valuation findings of the Commission, is shown at $24,648. The sum just stated is somewhat lower than the figure ought to be on account of not including any allowance for the crossings contained in the loop tracks which are used by the Council Bluffs cars. This amount would probably be some place around $5,000. We are not in possession of the exact figures. We will estimate that the value of the Nebraska property in the loop used by the Council Bluffs cars is $30,000. Thus arrived at, there is $554,122.85 of value of Nebraska properties, the return and taxes on which should be borne by the Iowa division properties. The annual total of the two amounts is $47,493.08 which figure we will use in our adjusted income statement later on in this report as a substitute for $38,095.39 used by the company. DEPRECIATION ALLOWANCE In Exhibit No. I Mr. Nicholson includes in his operating expenses for the year 1925, depreciation charges in the sum of $300,000. He charges about $19,000 against the Iowa division on a revenue car mile basis, on account of joint use by both companies of power station buildings and equipment. In testimony the city of Omaha took the position that the $300, - 000 annual expense to provide for property retirements and accumula - tions to offset unrealized depreciation, was an excessive amount, although it had been reduced to that figure from $395,000. Under the latter charge the company had accumulated in five years as here - tofore stated $718,000 credit balance in the reserve account. It wa3 indicated that no accumulation was necessary and that the company might save the full amount and make it available for dividends and interest. On brief the city contended that the reserve expense might be reduced by $100,000 annually and an equivalent amount be avail - able for additional dividends. Thereby, the necessities for a fair re - turn would be reduced by $100,000. The average expenditures from this reserve in the past five years were $240,600 per annum. The present total reserve is not excessive as is shown by our valuation conclusions. An allowance as suggested by the city would use up annually some of the company's capital. In its valuation findings the Commission rejected the theory that there is no deterioration of existing physical property in excess of that offset by current replacements. We find that the present annual charge of $300,000 per year, of which $281,000 is an expense charged against the earnings of the </seg>
            <seg id="p316">EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Nebraska properties, Is not excessive. Mr. Nicholson did not make any charge against the Iowa prop - erty for the depreciation of repair shop buildings, shop equipment and the loop. We have calculated this amount and find the same to be about $2000 which should be credited to the Nebraska division operat - ing expenses. We will take the amount just mentioned into the read - justed Income account which we will set up later. OPERATING EXPENSES In Exhibit No. 2 applicant has set up the Nebraska division operating expenses in detail for the five-year period 1920 to 1924, inclusive, and shows an estimate for the year 1925. In this estimate a reduction of $45,000 was made on account of the reduction in de - preciation charges against operating expenses. In the $45,000 was included an allowance for the amount charged against the Iowa divi - sion on account of the power station buildings and equipment depreciation charged to the Nebraska division. About July 1, 1924, there was a reduction of approximately 2,285 car miles per day on the Nebraska division. Because of this fact the company estimated its expenses at $40,000 less than the 1924 experience. Five thousand dollars was deducted from the 1924 charge against operating expenses for injuries and damages. The above figures total $90,000. The witness stated that there was about $10,000 credited to the Nebraska division operating expenses in 1924 on account of supervision and general office expenses on reconstruc - tion of the Missouri river bridge, and that no such credits are likely to occur in the year 1925. On account of the changed conditions expected in 1925 as compared with 1924, he estimated that the operating expenses for 1925 would be $85,000 less than for 1924. In making his estimate Mr. Nicholson has assumed that the same number of car miles per day would be run in 1925 as were operated in the last half of 1924. In his estimate as to revenue the witness figures that there will be a reduction of five per cent in the passengers carried. It appears to the Commission that if the traffic continues to fall off a reduction must be made in the number of car miles run which, of course, would affect operating expenses. The charge to operating expenses for fuel, conductors, motormen and car - house employees was a little more than fifty per cent of the total operating expenses, not including taxes for the year 1924. If a reduction in the number of car miles run per day is made necessary by reason of continued falling off in passengers carried, the operating expenses for 1925 will not be as much as Mr. Nicholson has estimated. We have attempted to estimate the operating expenses of the applicant for the year 1926 on a number of different bases. We hare </seg>
            <seg id="p317">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 317 aggregated the monthly reports made to the Commission by the applicant for the Nebraska division, for January, February and Marcli 1925, inclusive, and have compared same account by account with the operating expenses shown in Exhibit No. 2 for the several years and have attempted to equalize those operating expenses that are season - able in nature. We have also used the operating expenses for 1924 except on those accounts which would be affected by a reduction in the number of car miles operated. These affected accounts are: Fuel for power Labor, unloading fuel Water for power Lubricants for power Passenger conductors Passenger motormen If a less number of car miles are run there are probably other accounts that would be affected to a more or less degree. Carhouse employees would probably be somewhat reduced and there might be a reduction in the cost of maintaining equipment. As to the ex - penses of maintenance of equipment, however, by reason of the drop - ping off of traffic, the company is not placing so many new cars in service as it formerly did and it is doubtful whether or not a saving could be made in the maintenance of equipment for any great length of time. Under the subdivision of "Income" we will discuss in greater detail, the results reached by computing operating expenses on the different bases used by as. Witness Nicholson has estimated that the taxes for 1925 will be approximately $5,500 less than in 1924. The Omaha occupation tax is based on the number of revenue passengers handled and if the number of riders decrease the amount of such taxes will automatically be reduced. We have given careful consideration to the estimate for the constructive year 1925 and adopt the company's conclusions in amount $348,000.

            <seg id="p320">320 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT CONCLUSIONS While it is manifest, from a consideration of all the factors which we have discussed, that the company la plainly entitled to relief in the form of increased revenues, it is equally manifest that the meas - ure of that relief cannot be determined with exactness. Passenger Kc, while showing a marked downward tendency, has fluctuated ply, so that no students of the situation, including the managers of the property, are willing to hazard an estimate as to what the final level will be. The management has been successful in following the diminishing traffic with curtailed expense. There will be a limit to such economies to be sure, but it is significant that the total railway operating expenses of the Nebraska division for the first four months of 1925 were 11% less than for the corresponding period of 1924. This is a materially greater rate of reduction than was estimated by applicant, and is somewhat greater than the Commission estimate embodied in its calculation shown on the summary page. If this expense basis can be continued throughout 1925 it will very favor - ably affect the net income for the year. It cannot be forgotten, moreover, that after the Commission hai reached a conclusion as to the approximate amount of revenue which the company should have to insure a reasonable return, this amount cannot be guaranteed by the adoption of any given schedule of rates. The reaction of car riders to new rates cannot be definitely forecasted, and the annual revenue from such rates may vary $25,000 to $50,000 from the estimate. Upon a consideration of all of the evidence in this record, there - fore, and after having given what we regard as proper weight to all of the factors involved, we are of the opinion and so find that the gross revenue received from the transportation of passengers should be increased by from $300,000 to $350,000 over our estimate for 1925 of $3,187,369. During the taking of testimony and in argument two questions were discussed with considerable earnestness, to-wit: (a) The city to cancel its occupation tax against the applicant and (b) relieve the company from paving, repaving and maintenance of paving between tracks. These two questions have been more or less concretely answered by the city as follows: (a) The demand on the city for revenue is very heavy, and af - ter careful consideration the city commission has determined that the occupation tax paid by the applicant cannot be set aside at this time. (b) The city charter would have to be changed by a general </seg>
            <seg id="p321">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 321 vote of the people, and the procedure is rather expensive if a special election were held. With the facts as they are, the Commission is compelled to accept the situation as it now finds it and will decide this case with - out making any allowance for changes in the operating expenses as to occupation tax and paving. If, at some future time, the city manage - ment finds it expedient to change the present situation as to the ques - tions here discussed, their action will promptly be considered by the Commission. At the suggestion of the corporation counsel of the city of Omaha the Commission called an informal conference for the purpose of con - sidering the question of the adjustment of the fares between the different classes of street car riders. Representatives of the applicant, the city of Omaha and commercial and industrial clubs that were rep - resented at the time of the hearing, appeared at the offices of the Commission. The question was considered from many angles. The representatives of the applicant earnestly suggested to the Commission that any schedule of fares that it may adopt in this case, should reflect, the material reduction in car riders that has occurred in 1925. They presented figures to show that the loss in passenger revenue for the first five months of 1925 as compared with the same months in 1924 was 8.24% after eliminating the extra day in February, 1924, and that the falling-off for the year June 1, 1924, to May 31, 1925, was at the rate of 7.61% as compared with the same months in 1923 and 1924. Representatives of the applicant admitted that the operating expenses for the first five months of 1925 have been reduced somewhat below the company's estimated expenses for 1925. Representatives of the city were of the opinion that a ten-cent fare for cash adult passengers, and as low a rate for adult token fare riders, and for children under twelve years of age was to be preferred to a low cash fare and corresponding increase in the amount that would be necessary to be paid by adult token fare and children riders. Some of the representatives of the city also thought the reduced rate to school children should be continued at as low a figure as consistent with the revenue necessities. No consideration has been given to the question of requiring a charge for transfers. Neither the company nor the city pressed this matter, consequently the Commission has not given consideration to the question here mentioned. The Commission is favorably impressed with the idea that a schedule of street car fares should be so adjusted as to charge as high a rate as practicable to the casual user of the service in order that the u </seg>
            <seg id="p322">322 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT rwho use the street car service continuously in their regular business should enjoy as low a rate as can be established. After careful consideration of all of the testimony, arguments, and facts that have been submitted to the Commission in this case, we are of the opinion and so find, that the applicant should be authorized to establish the following fares for the transportation of passengers on its lines in Nebraska. Children under five years of age carried free. In the above schedule we have not provided for a reduced rate for school children. It appears to us that the circumstances and conditions surrounding the handling of school children are materially different than they were at the time the rate was established, which we understand was in 1906. When the school children fares were rblished the bulk of the travel in this class of passengers came after rush hours in the morning and before the peak load in the even - ing. At the present time, school children are required to arrive and frt from the different schools at such hours that this traffic ntage no longer exists. We are unable to distinguish between the in or sixteen year old boys or girls who use street cars to get to from school and the young people of the same age who ride the t cars in going to and from work. tThe schedule above, applied to the Commission's estimate of the ber of passengers applicant will carry in 1925 will produce addi - al revenue between $311,596 and $367,312, the variation depend - on the percentage of cash riders. If the traffic decrease for the year 1925 is relatively as great as for the first five months the gross revenue will be less than the esti - mate. If the expense level continues as favorable as during the first five months the increased fares will produce the fair return here - tofore by us found proper and legal, even under the greater traffic ■lump. During the hearing mention was made of the fact that the city commission has under consideration the advisability of changing the parking rules in the downtown district of Omaha and it was suggested that the rules that were under consideration might decrease the use of automobiles in carrying passengers to the business district of the city and increase street car riding. Parking rules have a direct bear - ing on the volume of street car traffic. Adult cash fare 10 cent! Adult token fare 6 tokens for 40 cent Children five years of age and not over twelve years of age — (a) Cash 5 cent (b) Token 10 tokens for 35 cent </seg>
            <seg id="p323">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 323 We are seeking to approve rates which will produce proper net returns to this company, at the least possible burden to the patrons.

The method of allocating com - mon expenses between the two divisions is determined. Future rate adjustments, if necessary, can be quickly made. In such adjustments full account will be taken of any deficits under the fair return or surplus over the fair return which may result from the application of the scale herein approved.

Appearances For the applicant, John Lee Webster, counsel. For the city of Omaha, W. C. Lambert, corporation counsel; James A. Dahlman, mayor; Jos. Koutsky, J. B. Hummel, Dean Noyes, John H. Hopkins, and Dan Butler, city com - missioners. For United Improvement Clubs, Ralph G. Coad For the Commission, U. G. Powell, I. J. Devoe, accountants, OPINION AND FINDING ON MOTION TO MODIFV BROWNE, Chairman: This case was reopened by the Commission and hearing held at the council chamber in Omaha, on June 30, on a motion filed by the corporation counsel of the city of Omaha at the instance of the city commission of Omaha, asking reconsideration of the rate schedule promulgated by the Commission in its order dated June 10, 1925. The motion proposed to limit consideration of the rate schedule to a reduction in the number of tokens available to the public at one purchase. In reopening the case the Commission declined to limit the in - vestigation within such narrow lines as suggested in the motion, and pointed out that a necessary corollary to any rate schedule is the result in revenues to be obtained from use of a rate scheme. In its orders, dated September 25, 1923, and September 22, 1924. the Commission reached the seasoned conclusion that the fair value of this company's property used in street railway business within the city of Omaha was $14,100,000. The Commission is without power, did it desire to do so, to change this conclusion without evidence of proper weight on which to base the change. We have no such evidence. In its finding in the matter of rates dated June 10, 1925, the Commission said: "Upon a consideration of all of the evidence in this record therefore, and after having given what we regard as proper weight to all of the factors involved, we are of the opinion and so find that the gross revenue received from the transportation of passengers </seg>
            <seg id="p325">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 325 should be increased by from $300,000 to $350,000 over our estimate for 1925 of $3,187,369." The last named figure represented esti - mated earnings under the rates existing before June 11, 1925. The schedule of rates which is here under review was estimated by us in the original finding, to produce additional revenue some - where between $311,596 and $367,312, dependent upon the result of cash fares upon casual riders. While there is still insufficient time elapsed on which to reach stable conclusions, it would appear from such evidence as is at hand that the additional revenue is more likely to approximate the lower than the higher figure. Hence, any reduction in the level of the rate scheme now in effect, will, almost without question, result in deficits below the fair return which we have said this company is entitled to opportunity to earn. The sale of three tokens for 20 cents would amount to a reduced rate because it would reduce the revenues of the company. We have already said that if we did a poor job of prognosticating at the expense of the company, or at the expense of the public, efforts would be made to compensate in a subsequent ad - justment. If now the company is to earn less than its fair return, it is simply postponing a portion of the burden of the public to be applied at a later date. This is a short-sighted basis on which to construct public utility rates. The company might at its option, ask to install rates which would produce less than the found fair return, if in the judgment of the managing officials it was advisable so to do. This Commission to whom the motion was addressed, is powerless to establish valid and legal rates which are known to be below those which will produce the fair return. And it must be kept in mind that the company did not ask to have the case reopened. These were the considerations which led the Commission to suggest to the city council of Omaha that if the rate scheme had objectionable features which should be removed, efforts should be made to present some alternative which the Commission could legally and equitably adopt. No such suggestions were received at the hearing on the motion. It was generally the opinion of witnesses that it would be a great convenience to offer three tokens for 20 cents. With this opinion the Railway Commission is and has been in full accord. There was little direct evidence that the burden of buying six tokens for 40 cents was serious or had resulted in compelling persona who could ill afford it, to pay cash fare. There was much testimony on the theory of such situations and some evidence of embarrassments on the first or second </seg>
            <seg id="p326">326 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT day after the rate change. No doubt many instances have occurred where prospective customers of the street railway company did not have sufficient funds to purchase six tokens. No doubt many other occasions existed, if they could be found, where prospective patrons did not have the price of a single ride. Such embarrassing situations are not confined to purchase of transportation. tA token fare one-third of a cent higher than the one now in effect the cash fare of 8 cents in place of 10 cents would produce iximately the same amount of additional revenue as the present lule and under such a scale any person without 35 cents to buy a block of tokens, would be penalized only one cent in place of 3 % cents. Not one witness endorsed this scale. Mayor Dahlman and Commissioners Koutsky and Hummel, and Corporation Counsel Lambert believe that the present rate should be continued in effect unless legally the Commission could enforce a reduction to a sale of three tokens for 20 cents. Commissioners Hopkins, Noyes and Butler desire the change wholly on grounds of convenience to the public, but had no suggestions on the legality of the rate. In the absence of a direct request from the officers of the street (way company, indicating that the company is willing to forego a of the net earnings to which it is clearly entitled, this Com - lion cannot require a reduction in the number of tokens purchas - at one time, without providing through increased token rates, a ier level of charges for token riders. We do not consider the rnative advisable. We are certain that after a short period of ljustment, no considerable embarrassment to the Omaha public Id result from the present schedule. It follows that the motion t be denied. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the motion to modify, be and it hereby is, denied. Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this sixth day of July, 1925.

            <seg id="p327">327 NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION APPLICATION NO. 5761 In the Matter of the Application of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Tele - graph Company for Approval of the Base Rate Map of the Lincoln Exchange. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: Pursuant to the receipt of numerous complaints over a period .of several years, the Commission informally directed the Lincoln Tele - phone &amp; Telegraph company to make a re-survey of the Lincoln service zone and file a map with this Commission indicating its judgment as to what territory the base rate area should comprise. This proceeding arises, therfore, upon the application of the company to have approved the map thus prepared. A hearing on the applica - tion was had in the offices of the Commission January 30, 1925. Rates for exchange telephone service are usually based upon a zone which is generally described by the city or village boundaries. Individual or limited party service beyond this so-called base rate area is almost universally charged for on a mileage rate. Farm line service is provided under different circumstances, the factor of greater area covered being compensated for by serving more patrons on a line. The so-called mileage rates in the Lincoln zone have been somewhat confused ever since the consolidation of the Nebraska Tele - phone company properties with those of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company. Prior to consolidation each company had a slightly different method of stating these rates. Upon consolidation, the necessary changes were not made, so that since 1913 considerable confusion has resulted as to just what constituted the base rate area and just what rates should be charged for service beyond this area Subscribers residing in the same neighborhood have found them - selves paying various rates and complaints alleging discrimination have resulted. Upon informal investigation of the situation the Com - mission concluded that before any uniformity could be brought about a reconstruction of the base rate boundaries was essential. In filing its map embodying its ideas of what should constitute the base rate area in Lincoln, the company states that, except that for the circumstances arising out of improper and inequitable practices in the past, it would have regarded the city limits of the city of Lincoln as a proper zone but that in view of this situation it was decided to extend the zone one-quarter mile beyond the city boundary except in those instances where suburban development seemed to make it advisable to change the line. This has the effect of bring- </seg>
            <seg id="p328">328 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT ing into the cone a considerable number of subscribers, although the different method of stating the rates heretofore preclude as large a reduction in rates as would otherwise appear. As a further con - cession to the existing situation the company thought best to establish certain uniform rate zones where suburbs having a considerable num - ber of people in them might be grouped. This treatment applies to West Lincoln, Lakeview, West "A" Street, State Hospital for Insane and State Penitentiary. The plan of the company is to determine the rates within these zones by measuring air line from the nearest point on the boundary surrounding the suburb to the nearest point on the line describing the base rate area, and to give to all subscribers within that zone the rate as determined by this air line measurement. This has the effect of removing all discrimination within such a described area and it also has the effect of quite materially reducing the rates from what they would be if each individual subscriber were assessed on the basis of his distance outside the base rate Kin this connection it might be explained that the mileage are $5 per year for individual residence telephones for each quarter mile of distance beyond the base rate area, and $3 per year for two-party residence telephones for each quarter mile be - yond the base rate area. It so happens that West Lincoln, for example, lies in five quarter mile zones. Under a rigid application of the zone rates this would make five different rates within that suburb. Under the plan of the company the rate for all subscribers in that sub-zone will be the same and will be that of the subscribers nearest to the base rate boundary. It is thought that this plan will entirely eliminate the discriminatory practices of the past. Because the suburb Belmont has been within the city limits of Lincoln for many years the company decided to retain it in the Lin - coin service zone although it is far distant from the city, with an un - improved territory intervening. The proposed base rate boundary, however, was not extended the full quarter mile beyond the limits of Belmont but were moved out only one-half block. Subscribers living in the vicinity of West Lincoln argued that the base rate area should be moved out so as to take in the so-called Stewart tract recently acquired by the city. This tract is unimproved and it is not anticipated that it will ever be used for anything but park purposes. From the standpoint of telephone development, therefore, it should not properly be included in the base rate zone. To the south of the city the base rate line is extended one-quarter mile beyond the city limits, but this has the effect of bisecting a settle - ment just this side of the State Penitentiary. In the opinion of the Commission an exception should be made in this instance and the boundary carried south on 14th street to the Burlington tracks and thence eastward to Twentieth street and thence northward to the </seg>
            <seg id="p329">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 329 point where it would again intersect the base rate boundary. Such modification will remove the possibility of discrimination. From fifteen to twenty patrons of the company were present at the hearing, most of whom would be adversely affected by the proposed change in boundary lines. Most of those affected would sustain an increase of 25c a month. In some cases the increase would be greater. How - ever, these subscribers are offered the alternative of farm line service, which can be secured at $2 per month. If, in their opinion, the individual or two-party line service is more costly than they can afford they can be transferred to farm lines at a considerably re - duced rate. Some of the patrons present at the hearing found that their rates would not be changed by the change in the zone. A sub - stantial number of patrons will have their rates reduced but none of them were represented at the hearing. A complete check as to the final revenues of the company has not been made. It is probable, however, that a slight reduction will result. It is impossible to fix a boundary without adversely affecting certain individuals who live on the outskirts of the city or in suburbs contiguous thereto. It is be - lieved, however, that the line as presented by the company and modified as indicated above is as equitable and fair to all concerned as it is possible to establish. The Commission has given the matter very careful consideration, making a visual inspection of certain of the territory affected, and is of the opinion that the map as filed should be approved subject to the one amendment referred to. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company be and the same hereby is authorized to establish a new base rate area for exchange service in the city of Lincoln according to a map attached to its application herein, said map to be filed with the Commission and made a part of the rate schedule for the city of Lincoln, except that the boundary described in such map shall be modified as follows: Starting at a point at Fourteenth and Fonca streets said line shall be extended south to the point of inter - section with the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad tracks and thence eastward to Twentieth street and thence northward on Twentieth street to the point of intersection with Ponca street. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the rates now on file with this Commission for service beyond the base rate area shall be applied in accordance with the boundaries described on said map, this order to become effective not later than April 1, 1925.

Appearances: For applicant, E. J. Soloman, manager; D. S. Phelps, secretary; J. L. Ashmore, treasurer. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner Following an order issued by this Commission in Formal Com - plaint No. 497, directing the Bladen exchange of the Glen wood Tele - phone company to cease and desist from certain practices with refer - ence to rates charged to stockholders and renters of the company, the company filed this application. It asks that it be permitted to charge a rate of $17 per year for non-stockholders, the company to furnish tnd maintain telephone instruments. A rate of $17 per year is asked for to be applied to stockholders all of whom now own their own tele - phone instruments and to these a discount of 25 cents per month to to be allowed on account of their ownership of the instruments. At the present time, the company has a gross rate of $15 per year for all subscribers. Its schedule of rates, filed with the Com - mission, provide for an allowance of 25 cents per month or $3 a year to stockholders because of their ownership of the telephone instruments. In the previous investigation referred to, the Com - mission found that this schedule of rates was not being complied with and required the company to change its practice so as to conform to the published schedule. This had the effect of making the net rate to stockholders $12 per year. Since all the revenues received by the company from gross rates in recent years has been required to operate the plant, the company decided that a change in its rate schedule was necessary. A hearing on this application was held at Blue Hill. No protest - ants appeared. Testimony was received from the officers of the dis - tt. There are 216 stockholders in the Bladen district at the present e. All of these receive service from the exchange and all of them, under the rules, own the telephone instruments. In addition, 131 non - stockholders are served by the company. Fourteen of these have purchased and own their telephone instruments. It is proposed that if the rate applied for is approved, the company will negotiate with </seg>
            <seg id="p331">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 331 the fourteen rental subscribers, either purchasing their telephone in struments or selling them a share of stock, preferably the latter. Seven subscribers have two telephones each for which they pay i rate of $19 per year. In effect, this amounts to a rate of $4 per year for the second telephone. There is but little difference in the service furnished to these subscribers for which a rate of only $4 a year is paid. All of these subscribers are stockholders. It is proposed by the company that this $4 rate be increased to the general level of $17 gross or $14 net. The application involves only slight revenue changes. The 21 S stockholders are now paying $15 per year. Under the new rate they will be paying $14 per year. Renters at the present time pay $15 per year and their rate will be increased to $17 per year. The net effect of the application of the new rates will be an increase of possibly $125 per year. The company is organized on a cooperative basis and has never paid dividends other than the allowances to stockholders in one or two years for the telephone instruments which they own. It is not intended at the present time to pay any other dividend to the stockholders than the allowance of 25 cents per month referred to. At the hearing, the Commission made inquiry into the financial history of the company and found that the present revenues are no more than sufficient to pay the operating expenses and the maintenance of the property. The officers of the company serve for nominal salaries and all of the expenses are on a minimum basis. Under the circum - stances, the Commission is of the opinion that the rates as applied for should be authorized. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Bladen exchange of the Glenwood Telephone company be, and the same hereby is, authorized to publish and collect the following schedule of rates for exchange service, effective July 1, 1925: Seventeen dollars per year for non-stockholders, the com - pany to furnish and maintain telephone instruments. To stock - holders owning and maintaining telephone instruments a discount of 25 cents per month or $3 per year will be allowed from the above rate, the same to be credited at the time rental is paid.

            <seg id="p332">EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 332 APPLICATION NO. 5775 In the Matter of the Application of the Northwestern Telephone Com - pany for Authority to Increase Residence Telephone Rates in the City of Neligh. Appearances : For applicant, O. A. Williams, attorney For Chamber of Commerce, J. C. Harris, attorney. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: In the original application in this case approval was asked for an increase of residence rates in the city of Neligh. At the present time the company has only individual residence service for which the rate is $1.50 per month gross with a discount of 25 cents if paid within ten days. The first application asked to increase this rate to $2 per month gross, or $1.75 per month net, with the addition of a two party classification to residence service for which a rate of $1.75 per month gross, or $1.50 per month net, was requested. Subsequent to the hearing and after having received certain suggestions from the Commission relative to the desirability of a more equitable schedule, the management of the company submitted the whole matter to the Chamber of Commerce at Neligh and at a well attended meeting of that organization the whole situation was very thoroughly discussed with the result that the following resolu - tion was unanimously adopted. It was moved and seconded that we go on record as favor - ing an increase of 50 cents on business phones and 35 cents on residence phones in the city of Neligh." Pursuant to the adoption of that resolution, the company has submitted an amended application on the basis of the increases approved in the resolution. This would increase the business rate from $2.75 gross to $3.25 gross, the 25 cents discount applying, and the individual residence rate from $1.50 gross to $1.85 gross and would make the new second party residence rate $1.70 gross. It will be noted that the new application for residence service is 15 cents per month less than originally applied for. The net effect from a revenue standpoint of the new application would be almost exactly the same. </seg>
            <seg id="p333">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 333 At the close of the year 1924, the company served 96 business telephones, 330 individual residence telephones, 33 farm line tele - phones and 179 farmers who receive only a switching service. In 1920 the Commission authorized an increase in all of the exchange rates of this company. At that time, a valuation of the property was made by the engineering department of the Commission and on the basis of original cost the depreciated value was found to be $19,738. At the present time the books of the company show total assets of $29,692. The company has outstanding $10,000 of common stock, notes payable to the amount of $8,000 and bills payable of $1,526.91. The indebtedness has accumulated since 1917 and for the large part the proceeds have been applied to the maintenance and operation ot the property. Up to and including 1920, dividends at 8 per cent or over were paid on the outstanding stock. In 1921 and 1922 dividends of 8 per cent were declared, but only partially paid, the balance being rep - resented in notes issued to the stockholders. In 1923 and 1924 no dividends were paid other than an allowance of the telephone rental of stockholders amounting to $41.25. Up to and including 1922 officers' salaries aggregating about $900 per year were paid. Since that year, however, the revenues have not been sufficient to pay these salaries and aside from $165 paid for bookkeep - ing the general officers have received no compensation. In the order issued in 1920, the Commission required the com - pany to set up for the purpose of maintenance and depreciation an allowance of 10 per cent of the cost of its fixed property. This amounted at that time to slightly less than $2700 per year. Allow - ance and expenditure therefrom for the five years have been as follows: Allowance Expended These figures disclose that there has been an excess of expendi - tures over the amount set aside of $1090.52 in the five years. The large expenditure in the year 1920 was occasioned by the installation of a new switchboard and other central office equipment. It is mani - fest, however, that the allowance has not been excessive, although &lt;J *- \J ................ . 921 922 923 _ 924 $ ! 2,684.00 2,646.00 2,844.00 2,736.00 2,748.00 3,897.52 2,665.64 2,636.28 2,658.73 2,890.87 </seg>
            <seg id="p334">334 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT consideration should be given to the fact that the company has been passing through a period of reconstruction. It is stated in testimony in this case, however, that a considerable amount of this reconstruc - tion is still to be made. Any surplus above dividends on the out - standing stock is to be applied to this purpose. The earnings statement of the company for the year 1924, as submitted in the annual report of the company, which is made a part of the record in this case, as well as in figures submitted by applicant at the time of hearing, are somewhat misleading. In December, 1924, applicant, in order to make allowance for uncollectible rentals, de - ducted approximately $1600 from the gross earnings statement of that year. This, of course, distorts the results. By applying the present rates to the number of subscribers in service, however, it is possible to secure an accurate figure representing the gross income of the com - pany. The result of this calculation shows that such gross income from subscribers service was $8,424 in 1924. Adding to this the revenue from switching service and toll the company had a gross revenue of $9,759.54. The operating expenses for the year, exclusive of taxes, interest and dividends were $8,122.32. This left an operat - ing income of $1637.22. Deducting taxes $300, interest $660, and dividends $800 would leave a deficit of $122.78. It will be noted that dividends are figured only on the outstand - ing issue of stock. If they were calculated on the depreciated value of the property as of 1920, namely, $19,738 the fair return at 8 per cent would amount to $1,579.04, The deficit would thus be increased by almost $800. Applicant is not asking, however, for a full return on the fair value of its property. In considering the deficit moreover, it should be borne in mind that no allowance was made for officers' salaries. What we have said concerning the expenses for mainten - ance and depreciation should be considered also as the expenditures for these purposes for the next two or three years will very likely exceed the present allowance. It seems very clear, therefore, that, if the company is to continue to operate so as to give adequate service and at the same time pay its dividends, an increase in revenue is necessary. In this connection, a rather unusual traffic condition obtaining at Neligh should be referred to. The company employs six full time operators and pays one-half the salary of the night operator. The Northwestern Bell Telephone company operates the toll switchboard in the central office and maintains two full time operators and pays one-half the salary of the night operator. Thus it is seen that the full time of nine operators is given to the operation of the exchange. As we have shown, only 638 subscribers are connected directly to the Neligh exchange. The exchange is connected, however, with five other </seg>
            <seg id="p335">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 335 exchanges belonging to the Northern Antelope Telephone company so that altogether between 900 and 1,000 subscribers are served. The abnormal traffic load which is handled at Neligh is without doubt due to this inter-connection of exchanges. Many companies in the state operating exchange of 500 subscribers employ not to exceed three operators who handle toll messages in addition to the local service. There appears to be no local condition at Neligh tc induce a heavy traffic. The business men of Neligh desire the connection with the territory served by the other exchanges and it is that fact which prompts them to consent to an increase in the exchange rates at Neligh. Both companies referred to have common stockholders and a very close relationship exists between them. The subscribers of the Northern Antelope company, who are switched at Neligh, pay a regular farm line rate of $1.50 per month to the Northern Antelope company and that company in turn pays 25 cents per month to the Northwestern Telephone company at Neligh for the switching service. This rate is subnormal. Ultimately, it should be increased. In the present case, however, the arrangement will not be disturbed be - cause of the rather precarious financial condition of the Northern Antelope company. In the rates as proposed in the amended application a differential of only 15 cents per month is made between individual residence service and two party residence service. The prevailing differential in the state is not less than 25 cents per month. We believe this difference should be maintained here and that the two party net rate should not exceed $1.35 per month if the individual rate is fixed at $1.60. If the increase in business rates is authorized, and $1.60 net for individual residence, and $1.35 for two party residence, the gross revenues received from all services, including switching and toll, would aggregate $11,662.14. This is an increase of $1,902 as com - pared to an increase of $1,980 under the first proposal. It is not un - likely, however, that, with an option to take two party service at 25 cents per month less, a number of residence subscribers will avail themselves of the opportunity. No estimate can be made as to the number. The larger the number the greater the decrease in the esti - mated revenue from the new rates. It is manifest that the increased revenue as applied for will not be excessive and is required by the company to maintain adequate service and pay dividends on outstand - ing stock. The rates asked for in the amended application will, there - fore, be approved subject to the modification in two party rates as we have discussed them. Because of the delay in the issuance of the order due to further consideration and because of the revenue requirements of the com - pany we find an emergency to exist and the rates herein approved will be made effective August 1, 1925. </seg>

It asks our approval in accordance with provisions of section 676, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, to the issue of $250,000 of first mortgage series C bonds, bearing 6 per cent interest, due and payable in 1944, from the proceeds of which sale to purchase the securities now outstanding against the Hastings Gas company, a Maine corpora - tion, doing business exclusively in the city of Hastings.

            <seg id="p337">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 337 Testimony showed that negotiations for the transfer of the Hastings properties to the Central Power company were carried on between the officers of the two companies and an informal option was entered into for the transfer of the properties for $215,000 in cash and $15,000 of series C bonds at par, the vendor agreeing to secure and turn over to the purchaser, all the fixed obligations and to liquidate the current obligations. Because pf a lack of current cash to complete the transaction, a Chicago bonding house acted as intermediary, made the purchase of the securities outstanding of the Hastings Gas company, and entered into contract of sale to the Central Power company, the terms being payment of cash in amount $122,990 on January 3, 1925, and an additional $100,000 of cash on March 2, 1925, and the surrender on that date of $15,000 par amount of series C bonds. The total purchase price therefore between the investment bankers and appli - cant here was $237,990 as opposed to $230,000, the tentative agree - ment between the officers of the two corporations. Most of this difference was represented by cash in the bank earned and set apart to pay interest and dividends on the old securities. Part of the contract between the investment bankers and appli - cant related to the sale of the bonds it is here proposed to issue. The written agreement was that the bankers would pay $215,000 cash for series C bonds in par amount $235,000. The testimony is that sub - sequent market conditions improved and a slightly better price would be paid for the bonds. We find no objection to the proposed sale price of the securities. Applicant attempted to justify the purchase price of $230,000 by an inventory and appraisal on the basis of unit prices of 1924 and a submission of operating statements. The appraisal figure showed cost new on a basis of 1924 prices, of $380,496 and cost depreciated $296,025. We have examined this appraisal with care and while in places the reproduction units used are based upon experienced piece - meal cost, the computations as a whole are not particularly out of line when measured by what they purposed to show. Thus, the price paid, is substantially below the appraisal, based upon reproduction in 1924. The amount of depreciation found by applicant is liberal. The books of the Hastings Gas company show a total plant cost of $293,759. Testimony indicated strongly that the figure represents fairly well gross cost of the property sold. The reserve for deprecia tion increased tremendously in the past five years. It totalled, at time of hearing, more than 35 per cent of the depreciable property. It is clearly too liberal an accrual. </seg>
            <seg id="p338">EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 338 The earnings of 1923 and 1924 indicate that at present rates and present volume of sales, the company will pay the interest on the pro - posed bonds, will be able to set aside a reasonable amount for accrued and unrealized depreciation, (the proper amount for amortization), and will have something left to pass to surplus. The buyer of public utilities properties, generally speaking, con - siders results of operation in the form of net profits as the basis upon which the purchase is consummated and while the Commission care - fully scrutinizes such testimony it should not be used, in our opinion, as the controlling factor in determining the amount of capital securi - ties that will be authorized by the Commission. Rates are based upou fair value at the time the rates are brought in review before the gov - erning body. Change of rates will directly affect the earning power of the utility. Applicant asks to be allowed to pay for the entire acquisition through the issue and sale of first mortgage bonds. Such a proposal calls for scrutiny. Applicant, Central Power company, at the time of filing this application, had outstanding $2,045,000 of first mortgage series A and B bonds, and slightly more than $3,000,000 of common and preferred stocks. Of those stocks $1,900,000 have been issued with our approval and present a definite relationship between dollars Vd in for construction purposes and the securities approved, much the remainder of the stock represents apparently early promotion efforts. We are not prepared to say what property is now supporting the earlier junior securities. After this financing, if approved, the company's outstanding first mortgage bonds will not exceed 60 per cent of the total bonds and stock approved by us. This is a conservative situation. Applicant indicates that it is buying the securities of the Hast - ings Gas company for the price indicated above, that it is its purpose to cancel and retire the bonds, to assume current liabilities in return for receipt of current assets and consolidate the properties of the Hastings Gas company with those of applicant. The record is silent as to whether it is proposed that the Hastings Gas company shall con - tinue in existence after the completion of the sale of its properties to the Central Power company. We will provide as a condition of this order that the Hastings Gas company be dissolved and the stock be canceled of record, unless in supplement proceedings, applicant shows a necessity for the continuation of the corporate identity of the Hastings Gas company. In the earlier days of its existence applicant appeared to have written into its property accounts acquired property at an appraisal </seg>
            <seg id="p339">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 339 figure and to have made such transaction the occasion for extra securi - ties issues. More recently in the purchase of a gas property, appli - cant appears to have written that property into its consolidated plant account at the appraised value, and thereby to have increased its surplus account by the difference between the net appraisal figure and the purchase price. The practice of this Commission has been to require the continua - tion of the plant accounts of the purchased company, if reasonably accurate, as contained in the books at time of acquisition, and if the appraisal figure is used, to have the ledger accounts show the addi - tional value caused by such reappraisal. We have also required that these subdivisions of plant account shall not be merged without the approval of the Commission. Corresponding requirements relative to the surplus account have been made and will be repeated as a condi - tion of this approval. We find from the record that issue of $250,000 of bonds by the Central Power company of Grand Island, for the purpose of securing funds with which to purchase the Hastings Gas company, is a reason - able corporate necessity. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Central Power company be and it hereby is authorized to issue and sell $250,000 par value series C first mortgage bonds bearing 6 per cent interest, due and payable in 1944, $235,000 in par amount of which are to be sold to net applicant not less than 92 per centum of par, and $15,000 of which shall net applicant par. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the approval In the two para - graphs of the order next above, is conditioned upon the following: (a) From the proceeds of the sale of these securities or an equivalent amount of cash, applicant shall purchase all the outstand - ing stock and bonds of the Hastings Gas company, shall cancel and retire the same, and shall dissolve the Hastings Gas company in appropriate proceedings, unless in supplemental showing it shall be made to appear that it is necessary to preserve the corporate identity of the Hastings Gas company. Proof of such dissolution shall be made to the Commission within ninety days of this order. (b) The difference between the par value of the bonds and the net amount received by applicant therefor, shall be ratably amortized by deductions from operating income throughout the life of the bonds. </seg>

(d) Applicant shall carry forward into its own ledger the plant account as shown by the books of the Hastings Gas company under such appropriate heading as will show that it represents the construc - tion cost of the existing plant. (e) At its option applicant may open ledger plant accounts under appropriate headings, to represent the difference between the reproduction new cost of the physical plant (excluding intangible values) and the book cost of the plant as carried forward from the predecessor corporation, the sum of these two accounts in opening entries, not to exceed the appraisal new of the plant excluding in - tangibles as presented in evidence at the hearing on this application.

Browne, Chairman. Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 5790 In the Matter of the Application of the Nebraska Power Company for Authority to Issue Bonds in the Sum of $2,000,000. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: In this proceeding the Nebraska Power company, a foreign cor - poration organized under the laws of Maine, and owning and operat - ing electric light and power properties in the city of Omaha and suburbs, and by stock ownership controlling gas and electric properties in Council Bluffs, asks for authority to issue and sell $2,000,000 of first mortgage five per cent gold bonds, maturing June 2, 1949. On June 20, 1924 (17 N. S. R. C. 432-433) this Commission au - thorized an issue of $1,000,000 of first mortgage bonds, and on February 23, 1924, (17 N. S. R. C. 364-370) $1,200,000 of seven per cent cumulative preferred stock, upon the application of this com - pany. In connection with those applications the accounts and records of the company were carefully scrutinized and it is not necessary at this time to repeat what was then said concerning the history of the company's financing. The company is in the midst of an extensive improvement pro - gram. The record in this case shows that since January 31, 1924, $3,562,191 has been expended in additions and betterments to the property. On January 31, 1925, the amount of such additions for which the company has permission, under the terms of its first mortgage to issue bonds was $2,190,836.81. In the furtherance of its improvement program applicant has borrowed money from the American Power &amp; Light company and there is due that company at the present time $1,094,000 in short time securities, bearing six per cent interest. In addition, applicant proposes to pay off a second mortgage of $300,000 against its subsidiary in Council Bluffs, which. </seg>
            <seg id="p342">342 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT mortgage becomes due within a short time. This mortgage bears five per cent interest. In this connection, it might be stated that under the terms of the general mortgage of applicant it is authorized to issue bonds under certain limited conditions against the assets and securi - ties of subsidiary companies. The net effect of the refinancing, there - fore, will be that the company will take up the $1,094,000 of pay - ables owed to the American Power &amp; Light company and the $300, - 000 just referred to, leaving a net of $700,000 to cover additions and betterments as yet not capitalized. At the price realized the interest rate on the proposed issue of bonds will be 5.3 per cent. This will effect a substantial saving in interest. We find that the purposes for which the funds are to be secured from the sale of these bonds are reasonable corporate necessities and the application will be approved. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Nebraska Power com - pany be and hereby is authorized to issue and sell $2,000,000, par amount, of first mortgage five per cent gold bonds, due and payable June 2, 1949, under the following conditions: (a) The sale price shall be such as to net applicant not less than 94.5 per centum of par; (b) The proceeds secured from the sale of these bonds, or an equivalent amount of cash, shall be invested in additions and better - ments to the physical property of applicant company, or for the re - tirement of obligations incurred in the construction of physical property of applicant company or its subsidiary, not heretofore rep - resented by issued and outstanding securities; (c) As of date June 30, 1925, and semi-annually thereafter until the expenditures have been completed, the company shall make report to the Nebraska State Railway Commission concerning the amount of such proceeds expended for physical property, the expendi - tures charged against the account in major classifications and separate - ly therein the cost of labor and materials, and the expenditures for overhead cost, such as interest during construction, organization and administration during construction, and engineering and super - intendence. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the difference between the net amount received by applicant from sale of these bonds and the face value thereof shall be amortized evenly throughout the life of the bonds. </seg>
            <seg id="p343">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 343 Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this sixteenth day of February, 1925. NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION, H. G. Taylor, Vice-Chairman. Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. (SEAL) APPLICATION XO. 58O5 In the Matter of the Application of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Tele - graph Company for Permission to Issue and Sell $500,000 of Bonds. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: The Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company contemplates expenditures in the improvement of its property for 1925 aggregating $1,106,018. Definite commitments have been made with reference to most of these expenditures and the budget has been authorized by the board of directors. A portion of these improvements will be in the nature of replacements and will be charged to the depreciation reserve. The remainder will be additions and betterments to the ex - isting property. The company asks authority to issue and sell $500, - 000 of bonds to secure the additional proceeds necessary to pay for the improvements. A statement of the major items composing the budget is submitted in the application for permission to issue the bonds. The bonds which the company now proposes to issue draw 5 per cent and can be sold to net the company not less than $94 per $100 par value. The bonds will be issued under the general mortgage of the company. At the present time there is outstanding under this mortgage $1,500,000 of bonds. One million two hundred thousand dollars of this amount was authorized to be issued and sold in an order issued by this Commission on January 11, 1916. At that time the company was permitted to issue $1,500,000 but only $1,200,000 was sold. The remaining $300,000 was retained in the treasury. On February 10, 1920, the company again made application to issue $300,000 of bonds but at that'time the money market was such as to make it impossible to sell 5 per cent bonds. The $300,000 above referred to were, therefore, retained in the treasury of the company subject to the further order of the Commission and a like amount of </seg>
            <seg id="p344">344 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 6 per cent bonds were authorized. It is now proposed to issue the $300,000 of bonds in the treasury and $200,000 additional. The price of $94 per $100 of par value is favorable and will result in the financing of additions and betterments at a low cost, so far as the securing of capital is concerned. A check of the accounts of the company has been made by a rep - resentative of the Commission. This discloses that there is a sub - stantial margin of property in excess of outstanding securities includ - ing common and preferred stock and bonds. Since the proposed issue of bonds is to cover entire new property this margin will be main - tained. The Commission is of the opinion, therefore, and so finds, that the proposed issue falls within the corporate requirements of the com - pany as defined by statute and should be approved. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company be and the same is hereby authorized to issue and sell $300,000 of its first mortgage, thirty year bonds, bearing 5 per cent interest, held in the treasury of the company under an order No. 2609 issued by this Commission on January 11, 1916.

Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this twenty-sixth day of February, 1925. NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION, H. G. Taylor, Vice-Chairman. Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 5812 In the Matter of the Application of the Nebraska Electric Power Com - pany for Authority to Issue Securities. PRELIMINARY OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: Applicant is a Deleware corporation recently organized for the purpose of acquiring and operating electric light and power properties within the state of Nebraska. In the present proceedings it asks authority of this Commission under provisions of the Nebraska law, to issue and sell: (a) $650,000 par value of first mortgage 6 per cent five year gold bonds; (b) $50,000 par value of 7 per cent cumulative preferred stock; and (c) $200,000 par value, of common stock. The sale of these securities is alleged by applicant to be necessary for the acquisition of funds with which to pay for certain properties already bought and to secure certain treasury funds for future expan - sion, not now describable. The properties already purchased, are as follows: United Electric company of Lexington, comprising generat - ing and distributing properties at Lexington, Cozad, Overton and Elm Creek, together with wholesale sale at certain other towns; generating and distributing properties at Broken Bow; generating and distribut - ing properties at Loup City and generating and distributing properties at Arcadia. The purchase price of these properties as shown by copies of contracts of sale and purchase, are as follows: / </seg>
            <seg id="p346">EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 346 Lexington $ 400,000 Broken Bow 50,000 Loup City 50,000 Arcadia 7,500 Applicant alleges that the physical properties involved in these purchases are in fact worth the following amounts, after existing de - preciation is substracted: It also alleges that it has become possessed through these pur - tses of intangible elements of value, consisting of (a) going value i,000 and (b) contracts with various towns and villages for the : of current at wholesale $38,500. Thus the company claims in imony that it has purchased for $507,500 sound values of $644, - &gt;. It is upon these claims that it asks authority for the issue of securities outlined above. In further support of its application, itioner sets forth actual and estimated operating results of each the plants involved for the year 1924. So far as the Lexington perties are concerned, the accounting is accurate and the results icate a prosperous concern. Testimony showed that this property was purchased largely on its earning power and that purchasers were aware that under no sound principles could physical property be shown to represent the purchase price. The records of the other three purchasers were extremely fragmentary. Recasts of revenues and estimated expenses were made by the auditors in such manner as was possible from the check stub records of expenditures. Such estimates are uncertain. In support of the claim of values of physical properties, the company submitted appraisals and presented the appraisal engineer, for purpose of verifying the exhibits and explaining them. These appraisals were supposed to be on ten year average price basis. No account was taken by this appraisal engineer of whether the units purchased were modern or obsolete; whether efficient or inefficient; whether the classes of property purchased would fit in its scheme of co-ordinated manufacture and distribution; and without regard to the age of the property in service. Through this peculiar line of appraisal testimony, applicant con - cluded that the properties purchased from the Lexington company were in 94 per cent condition; those at Broken Bow in 92.4 per cent condition, those at Loup City in 94 per cent condition and those at Arcadia in 91.4 per cent condition.

            <seg id="p347">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 347 properties in less than 90 per cent condition under the methods of computation used by this witness. In our opinion, the company has utterly failed to prove in any such values as claimed for these prop - erties, under any reasonable method of appraisal, giving weight to those elements which go to make up value. So much was this the fact, that the Commission did not ask its engineering department fully to testify on the results of its inspection of the properties in the field. We are sustained in this conclusion from another point of view This applicant was in the market according to its testimony, seeking purchases — its headquarters at Davenport, Iowa. The owners of the plants purchased, were not actively seeking buyers. The reverse was the situation. Three of the plants purchased were being operated by men thoroughly familiar with prospects for the future and of knowl - edge of values of their electric properties, yet applicant has said in effect through its application, that it went to Broken Bow and pur - chased for $50,000, properties which were in fact reasonably worth $102,000; at Loup City for $50,000, properties reasonably worth in excess of $85,000; and at Arcadia for $7,500, physical properties of a present worth in excess of $26,000. It requires only a general scrutiny of the appraisals to understand how such peculiar con - clusions could be arrived at. The conclusion seems fair and equitable that instead of applicant buying properties of a reasonable worth of $644, 480 for $507,500, It actually acquired properties worth less than the purchase price, when measured by a reasonable appraisal. Applicant asks our approval of the issue and sale to the general public, of first mortgage gold bonds up to 90 per cent of the purchase price, and more than 90 per cent of actual value, according to our conclusions stated just above. This is not sound financing. We have been reluctant on other occasions to approve bond issues covering a considerable smaller proportion of property values. It is time now to call a halt and to point out the hazards of such financing as is here involved. Objection to this application goes further. In our opinion the company has paid too much for these properties, with proper regard to their conditions, to the early dismantling of considerable portions of some of the plants, and the sale for junk of dismantled units. In the past we have contented ourselves with a view of the law that where in our judgment, extravagant prices were being paid for properties and such prices had been arrived at through negotiations lacking every element of fraud, we would approve the necessary </seg>

In other words, we demanded that those taking the risk of the future, should back their judgment with their own money. On more extended consideration of our duty as at least implied in the statute, we are now of the opinion that we have not fully per - formed that duty in resting our conclusions upon the purchase price, regardless of our opinion of the extent of good judgment shown in the purchase. As we now view the statute, we are given the discre - tion to go beyond the fact of the purchase price, and to give regard to whether the issuance of securities for the acquisition is justified. To limit our supervision to the mere function of approving whatever may be presented, so long as the element of fraud is not present, is to disregard the purpose for which the law was made. These conclusions preclude an affirmative finding on the applica - tion, on the record as it now stands. There would appear to be no good reason, however, for withholding approval of a portion of the securities asked for, in an amount well under what will ultimately be found as a proper basis for capitalization, reserving final action for further investigation and consideration. Such approval of a portion of the securities should in no wise prejudice our conclusion as to the final results. Applicant desires at this time to issue and sell $507,500 of its first mortgage 6 per cent gold bonds, the proceeds to be used in pay - ing for properties acquired. It has already, or will by April 15th, have advanced between $300,000 and $400,000 in cash. Within a compartively short time the remainder of the purchase price will have to be paid. In the opinion of the Commission, an issue of $350,000 of bonds can safely be authorized at this time. These are to be sold at not less than $90 per $100 par value. Applicant would thus realize not less than $315,000 in cash. For purposes of organization and to further assist in the financing of the enterprise a certain amount of common stock should be authorized. Approval of common stock in the amount of $200,000 has been prayed for. We are of the opinion that an issue of $100,000 is all that can be authorized in this pre - liminary order. This makes a total of $450,000 in securities to be issued under our approval at this time. In our opinion this amount is well within the value of the property and may be authorized without injury to the public interest. Before reaching a determination as to the ultimate amount ot * </seg>

Appearances: For applicant, C. A. Magaw, T. W. Bockes, attorneys For the Commission, B. E. Forbes, chief engineer. SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman: This applicant desires to complete the financing as near as may »of the purchase of the properties of the United Electric company Lexington, Martin Brothers Electric and Ice company of Broken Bow, Loup City Light and Power company, and the Arcadia Electric Light and Telephone company. In preliminary order we authorized it to sell $350,000 of 6 per cent first mortgage bonds and $100,000 of common stock. The bonds were to net applicant not less than 90 per centum of par. From the proceeds of the sale of the securities authorized in the preliminary order dated April 4, 1925, applicant was able to realize $415,000 in cash. Final order was not entered in that matter because the Commission was dissatisfied with the showing made by Elicant, in justification of the purchase price, and particularly in ification of the amount of securities it was desired to sell as wn in the preliminary order. Further hearing was in consequence at the Commission's office on April 29, 1925. tlAr. Forbes for the Commission and Mr. Knudson for applicant, able to agree on the reproduction cost of the properties pur - id as $580,000. They agreed also that the material on hand for construction and repair purposes was worth $15,700. Mr. Forbes found a composite condition per cent of the property of 80.9. Mr. Knudson found the figure to be 85.7. Mr. Forbes concluded the de - preciated reproduction cost plus the materials and supplies on hand was $483,800. Mr. Knudson used the figure of $512,760. Applicant's engineer Mr. Knudson found an intangible value of $58,000 which included in his estimation the cost of establishing the business and the cost of securing wholesale contracts. This is 10 per cent of the cost of the physical properties. Mr. Forbes made no figure for in - tangible values and did not testify regarding them. </seg>
            <seg id="p351">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 351 The company's witness estimated that certain retail stores which the company proposes to open at once, will have combined stocks of goods in amount $10,000. He also estimated working capital at $27,500, which he said was two months' operating expenses. The company must supply its own working capital as it did not buy the working capital of the predecessor companies. Operating expense, maintenance and taxes for the year 1924 were 58 5,810. Two months' expenses would be approximately $15,000. Witness computed his two months' period on gross revenues rather than expenses. If we accept the most conservative figure placed in testimony as the reproduction new cost of the properties less depreciation, and assume the company will have $25,000 of cash and merchandise, we would have a reproduction cost figure of $508,800 back of the securi - ties. Applicant asked for a very considerable block of common stock to offset the expense and trouble of purchasing and consolidating these properties. Witness Knudson estimated the cost at $25,300. This exceeds the percentage usually applied in valuation cases of this class of work. There is no testimony of merit sustaining any figure as to cost of organization. We will follow the usual estimate in valuation cases and assume the company is entitled to $12,500 in stock or in cash from sale of stock to reimburse it for organization expense. The money required to reimburse the company for what it has spent and will shortly spend is as follows: Mr. Knudson estimated these items at $570,300. The difference therefore between the most conservative appraisal at present-day prices without intangibles, and the money needed is $36,000. There is no doubt of some intangible value attaching to this property although it has been consolidated so brief a time as to render any estimate purely speculative. In our estimation a purchase price based on present-day unit costs plus intangible values of consequence, is a high purchase price. The proportion of such purchase price which represents the speculative margin should be in common stock. But we are not to be understood as saying that securities issues to meet a purchase price will always be approved by us. It is a sound general rule, which at least should be the aim sought, that bonds should not urchase price 9 507,500.00 ixpense of organization 12,500.00 forking capital 15,000.00 detail merchandise 10,000.00 Total % 545,000.00 </seg>

Applicant alleges that it has an improvement program at once to be carried out which will cost it $126,000. The details of this esti - mate are not given, although there is general testimony on the subject. Subject to the same requirements relative to relationship of securi - ties which we have outlined above, we will approve securities suffici - ent to produce $126,000 for additions and betterments, but will re - quire that the bonds to be issued as against this improvement pro - gram shall be placed in the hands of a trustee to be surrendered only upon adequate proof of the expenditure for construction of an amount equal to 33% per cent more than the aggregate of the bonds sur - rendered. We approved the sale of the 6 per cent bonds to net applicant 90. In our opinion the 6% per cent preferred stock will sell at no better figure. Applicant alleges the property it has purchased has such high earning value that it will have for amortization purposes and dividends on common stock, anywhere from $12.35 to $19.10 per share. Such stock should be worth at least par.

Day. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman Applicant operates an exchange at Weeping Water -which supplies service to approximately 480 subscribers, of whom all but 21 are served exclusively by the property of applicant. The town part of this exchange has recently been converted from magneto metallic to common battery service, at an expenditure of $17,227, of which $6,025 represents added investment. Applicant now asks that it be authorized to publish and collect increased rates for town service. The net rates proposed and the rates as they now exist are as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p356">EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 356 Proposed Rates Present Rates It will thus be seen that it is desired to increase the rates for town service by amounts ranging from 15 cents to 50 cents per month per station. Applicant's book value at Weeping Water is $42,740 as compared with $36,749 prior to the reconstruction. The books of the company are kept in accordance with approved accounting practices and rep - resent cost of the plant with the exception that in 1912 when this plant was purchased it was appraised and placed upon the books of appli - cant at the appraised figure on prices prevailing at that time. This valuation is without deduction for depreciation. It is also without increases to represent present-day advanced values. It may safely be said that the depreciation has been offset by appreciation and that the book value can be taken as the fair value for rate-making purposes. The proposed increases in rates would produce $946. SO additional revenue as a maximum. The 1924 revenues of this exchange amounted to $10,248. The net earnings available for interest and dividends was in that year, $1,948. Representatives of the subscribers pointed out that in 1918 the company secured the consent of almost all the town subscribers to an advance in rates to approximately the present level, in return for reconstruction and alteration to common battery class of service. They also pointed out that the increase in rates resulted without reconstruction and it was their opinion that the reconstruc - tion in 1924 was merely the delayed completion of the agreement, and that no increase in rates at this time was logical or ethical. The company's explanation was that before it was in position to reconstruct the plant, operating costs sharply advanced due to war - time changes in price levels and it was necessary to secure increased revenues. These were secured by general applications to the Ne - braska Commission in 1918 and 1919 carrying rate advances applicable to 100 exchanges of which one was Weeping Water. The explanation of the company is in line with the facts. No application was made to .the Commission embodying the results of the agreement for a rate increase early in 1918. The increases which were made at Weeping Water were not on account of any agreement, but solely that the people served at that town should bear their fair me party business $ ine party residence [ulti party residence Lural metallic Lural grounded i 3.50 1.75 1.50 1.50 1.35 i 3.00 1.50 1.35 1.50 1.35 </seg>
            <seg id="p357">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 357 share of increased costs of doing business. The company alleges that it has in the last few years earned at Weeping Water much less than its fair return. Specifically it alleges that it lost money in the years 1917, 1918 and 1919 without any return on the investment, and that it has at no time since, earned a fair return on a fair value of its Weeping Water properties. It is alleged also that under the proposed rates the net return will only be 5 per cent on the investment. The allocation of expenses which are common to all exchanges, as used by the company in figures for the Weeping Water exchange, are subject to the minor weaknesses frequently mentioned by us in the past. We cannot agree with the company also that the recon - structed plant will at once cost increased maintenance in proportion to the added investment. A larger proportion of long lived plant has been installed. On the whole the evidence is convincing that the proposed rates will not produce more than a fair return on a fair value of the Weep - ing Water properties on the present expense level, nor does the evi - dence lead to any safe conclusion that these expenses can be reduced in any near future time. The tendency is, under existing level of prices of labor and materials, for plants to become of greater value due to reconstruction. This tendency is not developing at an alarm - ing rate. The proposed rates are the same as those now being charged at Auburn, Friend, Hebron, Osceola, Stromsburg, Sutton, Wilber and Wymore, with the exception of differences for farm and business service. At Weeping Water farm rates are generally lower and it is not proposed that they be increased at this time. The rates proposed by applicant are materially lower than those now in effect, due to an order of the court, on similar exchanges of the large company operating north of the Platte river. The rates pro - posed at Weeping Water for business service are 25 cents higher than those at the exchanges specifically mentioned above. This spread between the proposed business and farm rates is too great. We will approve the rates prayed for with the exception that the business rate shall be $3.25 per month net, to meet the criticism above. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Lincoln Telephone and Telegraph company be •nd it hereby is authorized to publish effective October 1, 1925, the following rates for telephone service at Weeping Water, Nebraska: </seg>

(SEAL) APPMCATION NO. 6815 In the Matter of the Application of the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company for Authority to Issua Securities. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman t Applicant operates extensively in the five states of Nebraska, i, Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota, with gross book ts of $99,520,624.83 as of January 31, 1925. Under the pro - visions of section 676 Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922 as amended by chapter 168, session laws of Nebraska for 1923, applica - tion has been made for approval so far as Nebraska is concerned, of an issue of $22,850,000 of common stock. This stock is to be sold at par for cash. The proceeds are to be used in retiring fixed obligations. At the time of the consolidation of various subsidiaries of the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph company into the Northwestern Bell Telephone company, this latter corporation issued $30,000,000 of ' per cent 20-year collateral trust notes dated February 1, 1921. This constituted the entire funded debt of applicant. Provision of the trust indenture permitted the retirement of these notes for a sub - stantial price above par. Because of the condition of the market on </seg>
            <seg id="p359">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 359 the date of sale, the notes did not net applicant par. The discount was carried as an amortization item on the books. On January 31, 1925, the capital obligations of applicant con - sisted of $42,150,000 of common stock and $27,082,200 of the notes above mentioned. The company had, subsequent to the issuance of the notes, purchased a considerable quantity on the open market and retired them. On February 28, 1925, the funded debt had been can - celed through the borrowing from system corporations, of $28,100,000. The unamortized debt discount and the premium at which the notes had to be purchased had been charged against surplus, which fund had been reduced from $3,446,787 to $163,051. The common stock which it is desired to sell will be purchased at par without selling expense, by the American Telephone &amp; Tele - graph company, which as has been stated, advanced the money for the retirement of the funded debt. When the financing is completed, there will be no funded debt. The common stock will amount to $65,000,000 and there will be owing on demand notes to the parent company, the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph company, several millions of dollars. The effect of this financing will be to reduce fixed charges. In our opinion, the financing plan set forth in the application is conservative, the purposes for which the common stock is to be sold are reasonably necessary, and we find the application should in all respects be approved. Ordinarily the Commission sets forth in its approval of securities issues, certain provisions relative to reserve for retirements.

            <seg id="p360">360 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT APPLICATION NO. 5835 In the Matter of the Application of the Western Public Service Com pany for Authority to Issue Its First Mortgage Bonds, Its Deben - ture Oold Bonds and Preferred Stock. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: In this proceeding Western Public Service company asks author - ity to issue 1800,000 of first mortgage, 6 per cent, twenty-five year bonds, 11,000,000 of debenture gold notes and $350,000 of first pre - ferred stock. Since filing the original application a supplemental request has been submitted asking that $25,000 of second preferred stock be authorized in addition to that described above. The history, financing and operation of this company were thoroughly reviewed in an opinion by this Commission in Application No. 5346. It is unnecessary to repeat what was said therein. Appli - cant is engaged in an extensive development program involving the construction of transmission lines, the reconstruction of generating plants and the purchase of new properties. Practically all of this de - velopment work is taking place in the state of Texas. The proceeds of the securities for which approval is asked in this proceeding are to be used to pay for additions and betterments and for the purchase of new properties. While a portion of the improvements have al - ready been completed, by far the greater portion are either in process of construction or will be undertaken within the next few months. The program covering additions and betterments was submitted with the application, together with an estimate of the cost of each project, and is as follows: Chadron, Nebraska: Equipment and chances Electric $ 45,000.00 Ice 5,000.00 Transmission Line to Crawford.. 45,000.00 $ 95,000.00 Bridgeport to Dalton, Transmission line and addi - tion to distribution 18,000.00 Las Animas to Meleta transmission line 7,000.00 Auburn, additional engine and accessories 15,000.00 Tarkio, additional engine and accessories 15,000.00 Tarkio-Auburn-Mound City transmission line connections .. 10,000.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p361">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 361 Navasota to Conroe trans- At the hearing, the president of the company was questioned at length concerning these proposed expenditures. It appears that they have been estimated on a fairly conservative basis. The only change, developed at the time of the hearing from the program as above out - lined, is in connection with the last two items covering power at West Texas end, $275,000 and power at East Texas end, $160,000. Sub - sequent to the Sling of .the application applicant entered into a con - tract with a large electric concern for the purchase of current for its East Texas properties. This will obviate the necessity of the con - struction of a power plan in that field. Negotiations are also in progress looking to a similar arrangement with other companies in the West Texas territory. Should they be consummated, the expendi - tures for both power plants would thus be unnecessary, although some additional expenditures would be required for the construction of transmission lines. Since the date of the hearing, however applicant is faced with an unexpectedly large demand for current because of the bringing in of several oil wells in its East Texas territory and attendant activity in that connection. It has found it necessary to revise its plan for the construction of certain transmission lines and will expend upwards of $200,000 more than was anticipated at the time the program submitted at the hearing was prepared. We are of the opinion, therefore, that the reasonable requirements of tha company for the purposes of additions and betterments at the present time aggregate $1,250,000. Commitments have been entered into and on much of this work large amounts of material have already been purchased, some of which is now on the ground. It follows, there - fore, that funds must be immediately available if applicant is to properly finance these improvements.

            <seg id="p362">362 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT to provide the necessary funds for the purchase of properties now under negotiation. No specific information as to the location of these properties or the prices to be paid was furnished in support of this part of the application. If the Commission were to accept pur - chase prices on properties acquired as the sole basis for security issues, authorization in advance of purchase might be justified and practicable upon subsequent showing by the company as to facts. We have recent - ly held, however, (Application No. 5812) that other elements than the purchase price must be taken into consideration as a basis for securities issues. It is recognized that, where a company like the applicant is engaged in an extensive expansion campaign and is con - stantly negotiating for new properties, it is placed at some disadvant - age through its inability to know in advance just what amount of securities will be authorized against any given property. Since the use of the purchase price as the sole basis for the issue of securities cannot be accepted, we know of no other plan than for applicant to complete its negotiations and then make showing of all facts in connection therewith in a subsequent proceeding before this Com - mission. For that reason that portion of the application asking for securities for properties yet to be purchased will be denied. I In Application 5346 practice of applicant with reference to mak - an arbitrary allowance for engineering, supervision and other head costs was discussed and disapproved. In connection with this Ication we desire to renew such criticism.' In our opinion where al costs for such overhead items are charged into operating ex - es there is no justification of an arbitrary percentage allowance and above this amount for the same items. It was shown in the. ious proceeding that 19% per cent of the cost of additions and jrments had been added to cover engineering, supervision, and heads. We believe that this practice should cease and will require the securities therein authorized for future additions and better - ts shall be limited to actual expenditures for these purposes. In our investigation of this company's affirs, it is disclosed that with reference to discount on the earlier issues of securities, applicant has charged against surplus certain amounts in lieu of charges against operating expenses for amortization of the discount involved. It is rily admitted that the surplus against which such charges were e is not an earned surplus but has been developed largely through reappraisals of the properties acquired. An application is pending, asking approval of these charges in so far as they apply to certain past issues. We make no finding on that application. With respect to the securities herein, however, we reaffirm our position as expressed in Application No. 5346 in which we required that no part of the dis - count on bonds or debentures be cancelled through revaluation of plant. </seg>
            <seg id="p363">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 363 In its amended application the company advises that it has certain obligations which it can discharge with the issuance ot $25, - 000 of second preferred stock at par. These obligations are for material and services going into additions and betterments and are, therefore, proper charges to capital. It is to the interest of the com - pany to be able to discharge such an obligation with its securities at par and the necessary authority will be granted. Applicant has negotiated a sale of its first mortgage bonds at a price of 90.5, its debentures gold notes at 90 and its first preferred stock at 85. Under all the circumstances and the condition of the market at present, these prices appear reasonable. We are of the opinion, therefore, that securities in the following amount should be authorized: first mortgage bonds $386,740, debenture gold notes. $694,444, first preferred stock $294,118, second preferred stock $25,000, or a total of $1,400,302, the net proceeds of which to the company will be $1,250,000.

RANDALL, Commissioner: On the 23rd day of April, 1925, the Cihcago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company filed an application with the Nebraska State Railway Commission to discontinue the running of trains Nos. 305 and 306 between Nelson, Nebraska, and Horton, Kansas, on Sunday, and on Friday, May 8, 1925, hearing was held at Beatrice on this </seg>
            <seg id="p365">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 365 application; all towns along the line of this road having had due notice of the time and place of the hearing. The applicant railroad company stated that their resasons for making the application to discontinue the running of the trains Nos. 305 and 306, between Nelson, Nebraska and Horton, Kansas, on Sun - day was that business had fallen off to such an extent that the com - pany was sustaining a great loss in revenue that they were unable to continue to bear and that there were no prospects of the business in - creasing but that there had been a steady decline from the revenue from these trains for the last four or five years until the loss was so great that it became necessary for the railroad company to ask the Commission for the discontinuance of these trains. The applicant company filed exhibit No. 1 showing the number of passengers carried and the revenue received from said trains on April 12, 1925. From Horton to Nelson, on passengers, express and mail the total earnings of train No. 305 on that date were $54.41, and the expense of operating the train was $97.36, making a loss of $42.95. On the same date, the total earnings from train No. 306 from Nelson to Horton, including passengers, express and mail were $62,18. The expense of operating the train was $97.36, showing a loss of $35.18, or a total loss of the two trains on Sunday, April 12, of $78.13. The applicant also introduced an exhibit showing the earnings of train No. 305 on April 19 from Horton to Nelson, including passengers, mail and express, to be $51.14; operating expenses $97.36, showing a net loss of $46.22. On the same date train No. 306, Nelson to Horton, showed total earnings for passengers, mail and express, $61.14; expense of operating train $97.36, showing a loss of $36.22. The total loss of operating trains Nos. 305 and 306 for Sunday, April 19 was $82.44. Applicant also presented an exhibit of the operating of trains Nos. 305 and 306 on Sunday, April 26. The total earnings of No. 305 from Horton to Nelson on April 26, for passengers, mail and express were $53.46; expense of operating train $97.36, showing a loss of $43.90. On train 306 the same date, from Nelson to Horton, the total revenue for passengers, mail and express was $54.44; expense of operating train $97.36, or a loss of $42.92, making a total loss for operating trains Nos. 305 and 306 on April 26 of $86.82, or a total loss for the three Sundays of $247.39. And if the same ratio of loss should con - tinue, which there was every indication that it would, the loss on these trains to the railroad company would amount to about $4,000 per year, which the applicant could not afford to sustain in order to give the service to the people along this line for the limited amount of patronage they were receiving. </seg>
            <seg id="p366">EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 366 A large number of witnesses were present from nine of the towns through which the railroad traversed and protested strongly against the elimination of this Sunday train service, not so much for the pas - senger service as for the mail and express. A proposition was made to the protestants that in order for them to receive their mail and express that a mixed train be substituted for passenger trains Nos. 305 and 306 on Sunday, which was not objectionable to the protest - ants as that would give them their mail and express and they could also ship their cream out on Sunday. It was shown by the railroad company that this substitution would not reduce their expenses as there was at present no freight train on Sunday on the Horton-Nelson branch, and it would simply mean changing a passenger train into a mixed train without the saving of any expense or bettering the service tit would be necessary to curtail the running time of the train g to the heavier load and the time required in the handling of at stations. §A proposition was made to the protestants that in order for them have Sunday service it might be necessary for the Commission to substitute a mixed train for the passenger trains Nos. 305 and 306 for the entire seven days of the week. This proposition did not meet with much of any objection from the protestants and the matter was left for further consideration by the Railway Commission and the complainant railroad company for an adjustment that would not materially inconvenience the traveling public or the various towns through which the road traversed and would give them adequate mail, express and passenger service. The Nebraska State Railway Commission took the matter up with the Kansas State Railway Commission to learn what action they had taken upon a similar application made by the complainant company for the elimination of trains Nos. 305 and 306 in the State of Kansas. A conference was had in the office of the Nebraska State Railway Commission between the Chairman of the Kansas State Railway Com - mission and the Nebraska State Railway Commission on Thursday, May 14, at which time the subject was carefully considered and the proposition of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company to make the following substitution for trains Nos. 305 and 306 was con - sidered by them to be the most practical solution of the matter. Th9 proposition made by the applicant railroad company was as follows: That trains No. 87 would leave Horton, Kansas at 9:55 a. m. arrive at Pairbury 4:45 p. m. connecting with No. 5, No. 37 and No. 8. Train No. 88 would leave Fairbury at 7 a. m. arriving at Horton 4:30 p. m. connecting with St. Joseph, Topeka and Kansas City trains. Train No. 89 to leave Fairbury at 7 a. m. and have connections of both express, mail and baggage from No. 5 due at Fairbury at 5 p. m. the </seg>
            <seg id="p367">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 367 evening prior to the departure of train No. 89 next morning. It will have the same connections of No. 7 which is due into Fairbury at 3:15 a. m. ■ Under this proposed schedule it would give the people on the Nelson line their mail earlier Sunday forenoon than is now the case with the passenger train. Train No. 90 returning from Nelson would make connections at Fairbury with train No. 8 for Chicago and the east, also for Lincoln, Omaha and all stations where No. 8 is scheduled to stop. Passengers going west from Fairbury would connect with train No. 37 which is due at Fairbury at 8:45 p. m. Train No. 80 would also connect with train No. 5, the Chicago to Colorado daily passenger train. The proposed arrangement would give the people along that line Sunday service whereby they might ship stock from any point between Nelson and Fairbury on Sunday, which privilege they do not now have. Stock shipped on Sunday would be at St. Joseph for Monday market. Cream shipments from points from Nelson to Fairbury for Beatrice would be handled three days a week on freight train No. 998 east bound out of Fairbury for Horton and train No. 991 eastbound freight from Horton to Fairbury. No. 998 would leave Fairbury at 4 p. m. Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays and arrive at Beatrice at 5:53 p. m. on the same day. Cream arriv - ing at Fairbury on these three days would be transferred to Beatrice. Passengers who might wish to go through on No. 998 to points be - tween Fairbury and Horton would do so on these three days a week if they so desired. The other four days of the week cream arriving from Fairbury on train No. 80 at 2:30 p. m. would be forwarded to Beatrice at 7 a. m. next morning on local freight No. 88. The acting superintendent has agreed with the Railway Com - mission to give the conducting of these mixed trains especial attention in the matter of service in the handling of passengers and mail and especially cream so that there will be no loss to the patrons of the road in this respect. The Commission is of the opinion that the rail - road company should be given an opportunity to try out their proposed substitution of a mixed train for the passenger trains Nos. 305 and 306 for a period of sixty days, as experience only can tell whether this substitution will serve the public sufficiently to warrant its continuance. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that effective Monday, June 1, 1925, the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company be and is hereby authorized to substitute a mixed train in the place of trains Nos. 305 and 306 be - tween Nelson, Nebraska and Horton, Kansas, the equipment used on </seg>

Connecting with No. 5, No. 27 and No. 8 These mixed trains to run daily IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the railroad company is not to carry excessive tonnage so as to delay the schedule and shall furnish weekly to the State Railway Commission a report of the time of the departure and arrival of these trains at Horton, Fairbury and Nelson. This order shall be considered experimental in its nature for a period of sixty days subject, at the end of that time, to such review and change as may be found essential as a result of experience during the trial period. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that if objections to the sufficiency of service is lodged on or before July 20, 1925, the Commission will assign the cause for further hearing at Beatrice, for the purpose of amending the order.

Adcock, Carl Smith, Jr., Henry Weideman and Fred Kelly, RANDALL, Commissioner: This application was made by the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company to discontinue agency service at Nora, Nuckolls county, and to substitute therefor a custodian. The hearing on this application was held in the depot at Nora, on October 16, 1925, that being the time and place designated in the notice to the public for such hearing Nora is a town with a population of about 160 inhabitants. It is located 7.8 miles northwest of Ruskin and 6.3 miles southeast of Nelson on the Fairbury-Nelson line of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company at a junction point of the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway. The country tributary to Nora is well settled with well improved farms and a large amount of grain and other produce and also livestock is raised and fed by the farmers for shipment to market. The town, though not large in numbers, seems to be a thrifty business town. The exhibits introduced by the applicant railroad show that the amount of business done at Nora by their road for one year from August 19, 1924 to August 1, 1925, inclusive is as follows: The total earnings at this station was $21,350.69, the wages of the agent amounted to $1,457.46.

            <seg id="p370">EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 370 substitution of a custodian at Nora, was to eliminate the expense that the company is to in excess of the amount it would cost to have a custodian look after the business at that point. It was shown by the testimony of the company that the saving would be approximately $1,100 per year, without material inconvenience to the citizens of Nora and the patrons of the road in that vicinity. All carload freight would be billed at Ruskin or Nelson and all telegrams for Nora would be telephoned to the custodian at Nora, to be delivered by him to the parties to whom sent, and telegrams to be forwarded from Nora would be delivered to the custodian by the sender and by him phoned to the agent at Ruskin or Nelson to be sent to their destination. All freight would have to be prepaid at point of shipment to Nora. There was a large amount of testimony introduced in this case and serious objection was raised by the elevator and lumber and coal dealers as to the inconvenience and disadvantage that would occur in case billings could not be made at Nora and freight could not be paid on shipments of lumber and coal at that point instead of being From the testimony it was disclosed that the Chicago, Rock Island it, Pacific Railway company is receiving at least four times the patron - age at Nora that the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company is receiving, this road being more on a direct line with the St. Joseph and Kansas City markets and is being used by the shippers more extensively than is the North Western. The town of Nora has enjoyed the services of agents and tele - graph operators at both stations in the town ever since the roads were constructed and seriously objects to being deprived of agency and telegraph service. There was some testimony to show that one reason why business was not more extensive with the railroad at present time, was due somewhat to crop shortage in the past year and that with average crops the business would increase in freight receipts at least. After taking into consideration all the facts as presented in the testimony of parties concerned, it is the opinion of the Commission that the application of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company to substitute custodian service for agency service at Nora be denied.

As a result of the transaction, there will be retired and canceled $200,000 of common stock. As a matter of record the company's proposal involves several steps which will include the sale at par of the preferred stock to the Middle West Utilities company of Chicago; the purchase from the Middle West Utilities company at 82% per centum of par of $200,000 of common stock sold to that company at a price of 80 some time ago; and the re-purchase from the Middle West Utilities company of the preferred stock for sale to the general public.

OPINION AND FINDING RANDALL, Commissioner The applicant in this case Is the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company asking for permission to discontinue the employment of an agent and telegraph operator at the town of Prairie Home and substitute therefor a caretaker to serve the people of Prairie Home. The population of Prairie Home is shown by the testimony to be sixty- E. It is situated eleven miles east of Lincoln adjacent to a state way. It has two grain elevators, a post office, a garage, a bank and two stores. The town is situated about three and one-half miles south of the town of Waverly on the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad and about the same distance from the town of Walton on the Missouri Pacific Railroad on the south and a large amount of </seg>
            <seg id="p373">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 373 business has been diverted from the railroad company to trucks so that the less than carload shipments have fallen oft materially and there are no prospects of a future growth of the town. Exhibit No. 1, filed by the railroad company, shows that the revenue received from carload shipments forwarded from April 24, 1924, to March 25, 1925, in - clusive was $9,423.09 and for less than carload shipments forwarded $5.17, on carload freight received $1,098.12 and on less than carload freight received $404.27, for ticket sales $268.35, making a total revenue received at the station of $11,199.50. During this period the expense for an agent at the station was $1,649.64. The substitution of caretaker for an agent would make a saving to the company of over $1,200 per year. The railroad company agreed to substitute a caretaker who would keep the depot open during the business hours and on the arrival and departure of all schedule trains, would keep the depot heated and lighted so that it would be comfortable for the traveling public the same as if an agent were employed. He would be accessible to the public from 8:00 a. m. to 6:00 p. m. and be at the depot on the arrival and departure of all schedule trains. Telegraph messages received at Lincoln for parties living at Prairie Home and vicinity would be telephoned free of charge to those parties in case the parties have telephones with the Lincoln connec - tion. In case the parties at Prairie Home and vicinity have no tele - phones and no direct telephone communication with Lincoln, the agent at Lincoln would telephone to the caretaker at Prairie Home over the company's telephone and the caretaker would reduce the message to writing and either deliver it in person or deposit it in the post office at Prairie Home, addressed to the party for whom it is intended. Parties desiring to send telegrams from Prairie Home could deliver the telegram to the caretaker who would phone it to the agent at Lincoln to be forwarded by him to the destination. So that about the only difference there would be to the patrons of the railroad com - pany at Prairie Home is they would be required to pay their fare on the train and prepay less than carload freight. If they had baggage to be checked it could be delivered to the baggage car by the custodian and checked on the train by the conductor after passengers had pur - chased tickets of the conductor to their destination. As the business at Prairie Home is largely carload business, that can be handled with - out inconvenience to the public by being billed at Lincoln by telephone without expense to the shipper or by the caretaker or conductor at the station. This arrangement would make very material saving to the railroad company without material inconvenience to the public and as the less than carload freight and express shipments and tele - graph business is very small and gradually decreasing it appears to the Commission, in the interest of the economical handling of the business, that the prayer of the applicant should be allowed. </seg>

Appearances: For the applicant, E. P. Holmes, attorney; E. D. Hungerford, division superintendent For the interested town, J. L. Rigeman, Rokeby; F. C. Munn, Rokeby. OPINION AND FINDING RANDALL, Commissioner The applicant in this case is the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Icailway company asking for permission to discontinue the employ - ment of an agent and telegraph operator at the town of Rokeby and substitute therefor a caretaker to serve the people of Rokeby. The population of Rokeby is twenty-five. It is situated 8.4 miles south of Lincoln adjacent to a state highway. It has a grain elevator and a store and has R. F. D. mail service from Roca. The town is situated close to the Union Pacific and Burlington railroad stations, Jamaica and Saltillo are just south of it, and the town of Denton is just west of it so that the territory is very limited and a large amount of busi - ness has been diverted from the railroad company to trucks so that less than carload shipment and express have fallen off materially and there are no prospects of a future growth of the town. Exhibit No. 1, tiled by the railroad company, shows that the revenue received from carload shipments forwarded from April 24, 1924, to March 25, 1925. inclusive, was $7,977.54 and no less than carload freight was for - warded. Revenue from carload lots received was $2,606.02 but there was no less carload lot freight forwarded. Ticket sales amounted to $170.25 making a total revenue received at the station of $10,753.81. During this period the expense for an agent at the station was $1, - 770.31. The substitution of a caretaker for an agent would make a saving to the company of over $1200 a year. The railroad company agreed to substitute a caretaker who would keep the depot open during the business hours and on the arrival and departure of all schedule trains, would keep the depot heated and lighted so that it would be comfortable for the traveling public the same as if an agent were employed. He would be accessible to the public from 8:00 a. m. to 6:00 p. m. and be at the depot on the arrival and departure of all schedule trains. APPLICATION SO. 5856 </seg>

In case the parties at Rokeby and vicinity have no telephones the caretaker would reduce the message to writing and either deliver it in person or mail it as other first class mail is handled ac that station to the party for whom it is intended. Parties desiring to send telegrams from Rokeby would deliver the telegram to the caretaker who would phone it to the agent at Lincoln or Martel to be forwarded by him to the destination. The question of billing cars of Eand stock shipped from Lincoln as was proposed by the corn - was considered and it was shown that it would be more ad - geous to shippers at Rokeby to have their stock and grain billed Martel so that bills of lading for grain shipments could be delivered to the bank at Martel for use of shipper making a sight »ift. About the only difference that there would be to the patrons the railroad company at Rokeby is they would be required to pay their fare on the train and less than carload freight would have to be prepaid. If they had baggage to be checked it could be delivered to the baggage car by the custodian and checked on the train by the conductor after passengers had purchased tickets to their destination. As the business at Rokeby is largely carload business, that can be handled without inconvenience to the public by being billed at Lincoln or Martel by telephone without expense to the shipper or by the care - taker or conductor at the station.

            <seg id="p379">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 379 "Comes now the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company and represents to this Honorable Commission that the station at Thompson, situated upon the company's line, transacts very little busi - ness of a local nature, and such business is not sufficient to warrant the payment of the salary to an agent for the services performed; that most all the business done at this point is in carload lots; that the payment of wages for the past year to the agent, to carry on said station, has amounted to $1901.85; that the total amount of business for the past year at this station was as follows: Passenger earnings for year $ 644.38 Toal freight earnings 7,858.44 Your applicant represents that if permitted to discontinue such agent and discontinue such service and substitute a caretaker therefor, all of the business now transacted at the station of Thompson could be carried on by a custodian, and a yearly saving made of ap - proximately $1,650. A custodian would be available to take care of the requirements of the company's patrons for a greater number of hours daily, than does the present agent, and can give the patrons as good if not better service, than they now obtain at this point." Hearing was held on this application at Fairbury on Tuesday, June 2, at 10:00 a. m., and testimony was taken both from the appli - cant and protestants in the case. It developed in the hearing that the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Raihoad company also has a station at Thompson, which is served jointly by the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company's agent, and that a part of the expense of the maintenance of the agent by the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company is borne by the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Rail - road company. Exhibit No. 1 of the C. R. I. &amp; P. Ry. Co. shows the figures both of business done and salary paid the agent at that point and are in accord with the statement made by the C. R. I. &amp; P. Ry. Co. in its complaint, but there is no mention made of the business done by the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. and handled by the same agent. Exhibit No. 2 shows that the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. did $7,710.40 in business at that point, which was handled by the agent of the C. R. I. &amp; P. Ry. Co. and was paying 35% of the expense of the maintenance of the agent at that point, which would amount to $665.65. The Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company made no mention of this amount to be deducted from the expense of maintaining that agent, which would leave the agency expense for the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company to pay $1,236.20 instead of $1,901.85, as the application states. Previous to the war, both companies were maintaining separate agents at said station of Thompson. During the war, as a matter of </seg>
            <seg id="p380">380 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT economy, the Burlington depot was closed, and the agent of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company acted as agent tor both companies and the expense was borne jointly by the two com- panies. All less than carload freight and express received over the C. B. ft Q. railroad is stored and cared for in the C. R. I. ft P. com- pany's depot; all tickets sold for both roads are sold by the agent at the C. R. I. ft P. coiwpany's depot, and the agent is in all respects a joint agent for the two roads and handles all the business for both roads at that point in the depot of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company. The combined business of both roads is as follows: C. R. I. &amp; P. Freight forwarded, C. L $6,609.93 Freight forwarded, L. C. L 40.33 Freight received, C. L 452.73 Freight received, L. C. L 111.07 Ticket sales 644.38 Total $7,858.44 Added to this should be the express earnings and telegrams, which are as follows: Telegrams $ 12.59 Revenue received from cream forwarded.. 171.30 Express 391.47 Making total earnings for the C. R. I. ft P. $8, 433. 80 The statement of the C. B. ft Q. shows the total revenue from Freight forwarded $5,823.00 Freight received 1,148.00 Ticket sales 772.34 Cream 3.80 Total $7,710.40 This shows the combined business transacted by the agent for the two companies at that point as amounting to $16,144.20. It would seem from the figures showing the number of tickets sold on the two roads, that there is more passenger business done at this point than is usually the case in a town of so small proportions, as the testimony shows that there are only two elevators and one store located at this point. </seg>
            <seg id="p381">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 381 An exhibit was presented showing the amount of salary paid the agent at that point is $1901.85 per year, which is a much larger amount paid the agent than has been the case at several other stations on the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific railway where application has been made to substitute caretaker for agency service. It is approxi - mately $600 more than has been shown at some points, and the wit - nesses for the C. R. I. &amp; P. did not seem to be able to give the reasons why this should be the case. There are probably some reasons why the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company should have made this application as the expenses could undoubtedly be reduced at that point in the interests of economy for the company, but the application should have been made by both companies affected and the full facts set out to the Commission as to the conditions under v/hich the station was being operated, and the proposition should have come from both companies as to the character of service that would be furnished by a joint caretaker. The C. R. I. &amp; P. Ry. Co. in its application suggests furnishing a caretaker at that point for $300 per year. It does not look possible, nor does the Commission believe that it is possible, for the company to furnish a caretaker to serve both roads at any such figure and give adequate service, and until the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company comes before the Commission with an application that pre - sents the conditions exactly as they are, the Commission is of the opinion that this Application No. 5863, should be denied. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Application No. 58S3, of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company, to substitute care - taker service for agency service at Thompson, be, and the same is, hereby denied and the application dismissed without prejudice.

            <seg id="p382">382 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT APPLICATION 5864 ■ the Matter of the Application of the Union Pacific Railroad Com - pany for Authority to Eliminate Certain Motor Train Passenger Service. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman: Application has been filed by the Union Pacific Railroad company seeking legal authorization for the removal of trains Nos. 546, 547, 548 and 545. These trains constitute the various trips of one motor car operated by one crew in one day. No. 546 leaves Beatrice at 7:25 a. m. and runs to Valparaiso. No. 547 is the same motor train from Valparaiso to Lincoln. No. 548 is the return trip to Valparaiso, and No. 545 is the return of motor and crew from Valparaiso to Beatrice. Another crew operates with motor train between Lincoln and Central City on what is known as Nos. 505, 506, 507 aand 508. It is proposed that this motor train shall originate its day's trip at Beatrice rather than at Lincoln, operate through to Central City and return to Beatrice in one day. Certain changes of time of other trains are proposed. The net effect of the application is to remove two round trips between Lincoln and Valparaiso with motor train, these trips now being represented by departures from Lincoln at 9 a. m. and 2:25 p. m. and with arrivals at Lincoln at 11 a. m. and 4:25 p. m. If approved there will remain as service between Lincoln and Valparaiso one steam train and one motor train each way each day. All necessary connections will be made at Valparaiso east-bound and west-bound with trains operating between Central City and Omaha by way of Valparaiso and Valley. No changes are proposed in extent of service south of Lincoln. The motor train will leave Beatrice at 6:50 a. m. in place of 7:25 a. m. and returning will arrive at 7 p. m. in place of 6 p. m. Certain changes are being made in running time of the Omaha-Kansas City train which operates by way of Lincoln and Topeka. Southbound from Lincoln, this train will depart forty minutes earlier. Northbound it will depart from Lincoln one hour earlier and thereby divide the time between the present departure of the same steam train and a motor train which it is proposed to </seg>
            <seg id="p383">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 383 eliminate. Inconsequential changes in schedule of the Central City- Omaha trains will have to be made in order that connections can be continued at Valparaiso. For some years four trains each way have been operated between Valparaiso and Lincoln, this extent of service being made necessary in order to furnish service to and from Lincoln from points on the Central City-Omaha line. The installation of the "Capitol-to-Capitol Limited" about a year ago, duplicated a portion of this service. We have received as an exhibit a study of the business done on the trains which it is proposed to remove With the exception of the train leaving Lincoln at 2:25 p. m., that service is very light. The particular train mentioned makes connections at Valparaiso or Central City. It is proposed that these connections be established by way of the steam train leaving Lincoln at 4:05 p. m. This should be more satisfactory to patrons of the line as it gives a longer day in Lincoln for those who desire to make the round trip in one day. Likewise some im - provement will be made in the service between Lincoln and Beatrice by reason of the proposal to operate on Sunday. We carefully checked the service which would remain if this application is approved and are of the opinion that ample and adequate service will remain. It may be that this survey overlooks some fac - tors. The matter has been submitted to the chamber of commerce of Lincoln, whose interest would be identical with those of any other patrons of the line. Our conclusion is re-enforced by that body. It seems reasonable to approve the change to take place May 31, 1925, lor a ninety-day experimental period. These ninety days will be the light branch line passenger train period because of availability of privately owned motor vehicles. It will be a sufficient time to enable those directly affected to ascertain if serious inconvenience results from the change. If such serious inconvenience does develop, evidence of that fact may be filed with the Commission by letter or otherwise on or before August 15 and a hearing will be had to ascertain whether an extension of the curtailed service shall be granted. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Union Pacific Railroad company be and it hereby is authorized to eliminate the service of trains No. 546, 547, 548 and 54 S, as carried in the time card on date of this application; provided that motor trains Nos. 506 and 505 shall originate and terminate the day's run each day at Beatrice in place of at Lincoln and on schedules approximating those set forth in the exhibit attached to the applica- </seg>
            <seg id="p384">384 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT tion; and provided further that other changes in schedules shall be made approximating those set forth in the application in order that proper connection shall be made at Valparaiso. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this approval shall take effect as of date May 31, 1925, and continue for a period of ninety days. Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this twelfth day of May, 1925. NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION, Thorne A. Browne, Chairman. Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 5891 In the Matter of the Application of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company for Authority to Cancel Item No. 70, C. B. &amp; Q., G. P. O. No. 11677-T. Covering Rate of Three Cents on Sand from Allis to Wahoo. Appearances : For applicant, J. B. Driggs, assistant general freight agent. For respondents, Trenmor Cone for Consumers Sand Co., Water- loo; H. F. Curtis for Lyman-Richey Sand Co.; A. H. Farrens, Western Brick &amp; Supply Co., Lincoln. For the Commission, U. G. Powell, rate expert. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: In this application the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company asks authority to cancel item No. 70 C. B. &amp; Q. G. F. O. No. 11677-T which prescribes a rate of three cents per hundred pounds on carload shipments of sand and gravel from Allis to Wahoo. The effect of the cancellation of this item would be that, the regular distance tariff applicable to sand and gravel shipments would apply, and under this tariff this rate from Allis to Wahoo would be three and one-half cents per hundred pounds. Two intermediate stations, Memphis and Ithaca, would also be affected and their rate, in event of the cancella - tion, would be increased to three and one-half cents. The Burlington's </seg>
            <seg id="p385">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 385 reasons for requesting cancellation are that there has been practically no movement of sand and gravel from Allis to Wahoo or to the two intermediate points, and that the maintenance of a rate less than the distance scale jeopardizes the so-called zone rate structure wherein the rate from certain producing points to Omaha and Lincoln is three cents. This view is partially prompted by the fact that a request has already been received to apply the three-cent rate to shipments of crushed stone, which ordinarily take the sand and gravel rate. The Burlington representative testified at the hearing that it was his understanding that at the time the present structure of sand rates was agreed upon, the three cent rate should apply only from certain points of origin to Omaha and Lincoln, the only, exceptions being at points intermediate which should take the same rate. It was not his understanding that the three cent rate should apply between all points within the so-called zone. According to his testimony the three-cent rate from Allis to Wahoo was put in by the Burlington for the pur - pose of meeting competition with the Northwestern from Fremont and it was without full consideration of the principle governing the estab - lishment of the zone. In his opinion, to continue the maintenance of the three-cent rate would be to invite further demands for a similar rate between other points in the zone territory, the effect of which would be to ultimately break down the zone structure. In connection with this application, authority was also asked by the Burlington to cancel a similar rate of three cents applying to Wahoo from South Bend. This rate was put in for a similar reason and the same explanation is given for its cancellation. The Burlington submitted no record as to the number of cars moving from Allis to Wahoo but indicated that the movement had been very light. Accord - ing to its record, which was not disputed, only two cars of sand moved from South Bend to Wahoo during the past year. Mr. H. P. Curtis, representing the Lyman-Richey Sand com - pany, having a pit at Allis, and also pits at Fremont and other points, testified that he had no objection to the cancellation of the three - cent rate from Allis to Wahoo or from South Bend to Wahoo. He agreed with the Burlington representative that the existence of the three-cent rate endangers the maintenance of the zone structure. Mr. A. H. Farrens, representing the Western Brick &amp; Supply company, who operate a pit at South Bend, testified that he has no objection to the cancellation of the rate and for the reason assigned by Mr. Curtis. He is concerned with the maintenance of the zone structure and would forego any advantage accruing from a three-cent rate from South Bend to Wahoo in the interest of maintaining the adjustment to Lincoln and Omaha. 13 </seg>
            <seg id="p386">386 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Mr. Trenmor Cone, representing the Consumers Sand company with a pit at Allis, is the only protestant to the cancellation of the three-cent rate. His position is that competition in rates to Wahoo IBted prior to the establishment of the present sand and gravel scale October, 1921, and that for that reason it should be continued at present time. He is insistent that the zone arrangement should continued but sees no inconsistency in demanding that the com - itive arrangement be maintained so far as shipments into Wahoo concerned. We are unable to follow his logic. I If it is proper to have a three-cent rate from Allis to Wahoo and en South Bend to Wahoo, it is equally proper to establish and intain a three-cent rate between all other points in the so-called e. The old competitive situation was abolished when the present d rate structure was established in October, 1921. For the two rs from October, 1921, to December, 1923, the three and one-half t rate prevailed from Allis to Wahoo. By what it now admits was listake, the .Burlington changed this situation and it now desires correct the blunder by restoring the distance rate. Very little He has moved under the three-cent rate. Mr. Cone testified that in ear and a half he has not shipped to exceed fifteen cars from Allis to Wahoo. A few have been shipped to Ithaca and Memphis. Argument that the present rate of three cents should be con - tinued from Allis to Wahoo because it corresponds to a competitive Ijustment that existed for many years prior to 1921, would apply th equal force to many other points in the territory adjacent to Lin- In and Omaha. If an exception is made in the two cases involved this application, there would appear to be no good reason for with- Iding similar adjustments from other points in the zone territory, does not appear feasible to extend the benefits of railroad competi - m to one or two points and withhold them from others in like cir - mstances. We are of the opinion, therefore, that the application should be approved. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Eincy Railroad company be, and the same hereby is, authorized to eel Item No. 70, C. B. &amp; Q. G. F. O. No. 11677-T and Item 80 G.

Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 6893 In the Matter of the Application of the Loup Valley Independent Telephone Company of North Loup, Nebraska, to Issue Stock Dividends in Amount $8080. OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION Applicant company seeks approval of the Commission to a stock dividend of $8080. It is alleged by applicant that the resultant out - standing capital stock would approximate the true value of its prop - erty. Hearing was held in this matter July 17, 1925, in the Com - mission's office at which time testimony was offered by applicant in support of this application. As in most of the smaller individual telephone companies it has developed that considerable of the plant was built through donated services by stockholders and officers and through extremely economic management. Applicant's charge for service has been reasonable and comparable with prevailing rates for like services. The testimony of applicant attempted to show a property value for the purpose of this application of $14,820.41, exclusive of any good will value which it was assumed should have consideration. The above finding as to value was predicated by the company upon its balance sheet figures and increased values based on present day prices as compared with cost. No consideration was given to accrued depreciation. The company's figure must be rejected for the following reasons (1) That no sound basis is presented for the original plant assets placed on its books, which fact was read into the record from applicant's journal. The original fixed assets accounts placed on </seg>
            <seg id="p388">388 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT applicant's books by the accounting department of the Commission were estimated and were used only as a temporary expedient, pending final adjustment by physical inventory and valuation by the Com - mission's engineering department. ( 2 ) , Accrued depreciation in the property was not given due consideration. (3) The finding was not based upon cost (16 N. S. R. C, 264 — Application 4475.) After due consideration of showing made by applicant and sub - sequent to formal hearing in this matter the Commission caused a physical valuation and inventory to be made by its engineering de - partment based upon original or historical cost with accrued deprecia - tion. The resultant figures were original cost $19,453.05 and de - preciated cost $16,291.15, including stores and supplies in amount 91,096.65. While the reeord is clear that dividends have been paid on its capital stock at the average rate of 8.9 per centum per annum and that property has been accumulated in excess of its capital obligations, applicant is entitled to capitalize by way of stock dividends the bene - fits of its careful management thereby permitting such capital to accrue to the original investors where it rightfully belongs. If this application were granted, based upon cost appraisal figures, applicant would have outstanding liabilities of $12,120 in capital stock and $1,600 of notes payable with a depreciation reserve of $3,161.90. The fixed assets which are comparable with the above liabilities, would be $18,356.40. Surplus would result thereby in amount $1,474.50. • • A stock dividend will be approved subject to compliance by applicant with section 5, article 10 of the state constitution relating to public notice.

Appearances : For applicant, F. D. Smith, engineer. For the Commission, B. E. Forbes, chief engineer. BY THE COMMISSION: Applicant herein is a corporation engaged in the generation, transmission and sale of electric energy to the public. It has applied to this Commission for a permit to reconstruct and change the location of an existing transmission line from a point four miles west of Norfolk to Tilden, and change the method of operation from single to three phase. The voltage will be continued at 16,500. Applicant was un - able to secure a written agreement with the Battle Creek Telephone company and the matter was heard by the Commission in its offices, July 27, 1925. Applicant filed a map which shows the new location of the transmission line, where changes will be made, and the location of the existing line which will be reconstructed. It also shows the location and extent of existing electric lines which will be involved in parallel. Specifications were also filed which describe the manner of • </seg>

The parties which own existing electric lines which will be in - volved in parallel by the new constiuction and may be affected by the operation of the transmission line are the Western Union Tele - graph company, Northwestern Bell Telephone company. Meadow Grove Telephone company, Madison Telephone company and Battle Creek Telephone company. Written agreements with these parties at interest were identified and offered in evidence with the exception of the Battle Creek Telephone company. The latter did not appear, although its president and secretary were notified of the time and place when the matter would be heard. The Commission finds that applicant has complied with the law and the prayer of its petition should be granted, subject to the terms and conditions of the written agreements with the parties at interest and the transmission line rules adopted by this Commission and effective September 5, 1919. The Commission also finds that one year from the date of this order is a reasonable length of time in which to complete the proposed construction. The Commission will retain its Jurisdiction over the service on the signal circuits involved in the parallel created by the proposed con - struction, and in the event that the service on these lines is interfered with by prolonged inductive interference resulting from the construc - tion and operation of the transmission line, the parties at interest may apply to the Commission for relief, as provided by statute.

BY THE COMMISSION Applicant is a corporation organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of Delaware. It is engaged in the business of own - ing, operating, building and acquiring light and power properties in Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa. It applied to this Commission for authority to issue and sell its first mortgage bonds in the sum of $346,500 par value to provide funds for the purchase of new properties. A hearing was held in the offices of the Commission, July 11, 1925, and testimony taken. The application was amended to include preferred stock in the amount of $422,000 par value to assist in </seg>
            <seg id="p392">392 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL, REPORT financing the purchase of the properties and pay for additions and betterments; and further amended to ask for the validation of pre - ferred stock in the par amount of $14,500 issued since July 1, 1923, without the approval of the Commission; likewise bonds issued since the same date in the sum of $204,500. The bonds are to be sold at 90 and the preferred stock at 88. The articles authorize 500 shares of no par common stock and 50,000 shares of preferred, with a par value of $10 each. The com - mon stock has been issued and. 7,800 shares of preferred are out - standing. Applicant desires to change the par value of the preferred shares to $100 each, and the Commission will have this in view in the denomination of the stock approved in this order. In 1919, applicant issued a first mortgage deed of trust providing for a bond issue limited to $1,200,000 to run fifteen years at six per cent. Of this amount $724,000 has been sold. Applicant also has income bonds in the amount of $100,000 par value in the hands of the investing public. On August 1, 1923, first mortgage bonds were outstanding in the sum of $546,500 and income bonds in the amount of $170,000. First mortgage bonds were issued in the amount of $70,000 par value and income bonds reduced in a corresponding amount. This was a refund - ing proposition and resulted in an improvement in the securities held by the public. In April, 1925, the company sold property in the amount of $27,000 and reduced the bonded indebtedness in the same amount. In April, 1925, new bonds were issued in the amount of $101,000 for additions and betterments and new property acquired as provided in the deed of trust. Again in May, 1925, applicant issued bonds in the sum of $33,500 to provite funds for new property ac - quired and additions and betterments. All of the bonds were taken down under the terms of the indenture and for purposes reasonably required for the development of the property. The preferred stock sold since July 1, 1923, was issued in small amuonts to pay for addi - tions. These were sold for cash at $9 per share. The Commission might require that the securities issued since July 1, 1923, be called in and canceled but this could only be accomplished with much diffi - culty as to the bonds and would not serve a useful purpose. The Commission finds that they were issued for property purchased and constructed and they will be approved. Petitioner now proposes to buy new properties with purchase contracts and appraisals as set out below. The contracts show the price paid for the properties and the appraisals reflect the reproduc - tion cost new, less depreciation which is the basis on which applicant proposes to buy and issue new securities*. </seg>
            <seg id="p393">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 393 Purchase Contract Appraisals $ 470,000 $ 544,478 Applicant's common stock is owned by the W. B. Foshay company of Minneapolis, Minnesota. The officers of the Tri-State company are also the officers of the Foshay company. The president of the applicant company is vice-president of the holding company. The secretary and treasurer acts for both concerns. This is also true of his assistant. The Foshay company functions as general manager for the Tri-State company at a fixed compensation per month. The holding company negotiated for the properties and the pur - chase contracts were made in the name of the W. B. Foshay company with one exception, when Mr. Henley, vice-president of the holding company, and president of the applicant company, executed a purchase contract as vice-president of the holding company notwithstanding the fact that he is president of the company for whom it was purchased. Theoretically the properties were purchased by the Foshay company for the Tri-State company. The officers of the Foshay company as such agreed to buy the properties in the amounts of the purchase contracts and the same men as officers of the Tri-State company agreed to buy the properties, not at the purchase contract prices, but on the basis of reproduction new less depreciation. On this basis the profit to the holding company would be approximately $74,000 less the cost of acquirement in the sum of $24,200, or approximately $50,000 profit. Applicant maintained that the service of the holding company in mak - ing these purchases were necessary because of its own inability to finance. We note that applicant held notes receivable from the hold - ing company May 31, in the amount of $203,916.88. Had these obligations been paid applicant could have financed the purchase of the property pending the issue and sale of its bonds and preferred stock. These conditions call for a careful scrutiny of the values in - volved and the entire transaction. The appraisal shows an estimated cost new of the properties to be acquired in the sum of $634,917 and less depreciation $544,478. As to the fixed property, the estimates are based on an actual count and inspection in the field. The units applied are conservative present day costs on which 15.6% has been allowed for general expenses. The depreciation was fixed having in mind the loss in value on account of wear and tear, obsolescence and inadequacy where they were found. The Commission takes no exception to the values found for the fixed property but certain amounts were included in the totals for flowage Atkinson Neligh and Valentine Ainsworth Butte, Anoka and Fairfax % 80,000 200,000 135,000 55,000 | 85,16 170,89 237,06 51,35 </seg>
            <seg id="p394">394 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT rights, going concern and cash working capital which command further consideration. The rights at Valentine were included at a value of $31,000. This rests on the assumption that at least half of the potential kilo - watt output can be sold. A highly competitive situation exists in the town, which has a population of less than two thousand. The dis - tribution lines are paralleled by the competitor and many customers have both services. It appears that the local market will absorb less than half of the theoretical capacity. Even then a stand-by unit is required to supply power in periods of low water. When the water is available, the market cannot use it. There is no market to the south. It is sixty-five miles in an easterly direction to the nearest town of any importance and this is already supplied by the Ainsworth property. A transmission line to the north would have to be at least sixty miles in length to reach new customers and this territory can be supplied at less expense. The market to the west is already occupied by the competitor. Ruinous rates prevail at home. The Commission cannot see a value in the water right under these conditions. Going concern has also been included in the estimate of the Valentine prop - erty in the sum of $5,939. The Commission cannot see going concern value in a property that does not have a potential earning power which will yield a fair return. Cash working capital was included at Atkin - son, Neligh and Valentine, Butte, Anoka and Fairfax in the sum of $4,000. It is not customary to include cash when utility properties are sold and in this instance the amount on hand at the time of the appraisal was supplied from other sources. This also will be excluded. At Ainsworth, the stock was purchased and therefore carried all of the assets of the company with it. This is an exception. An admitted error in the sum of $6,800 found in the appraisal of the Ainsworth property will also be deducted. We have two figures — the sum of the purchase contracts in the amount of $470,000 plus the cost of acquirement in the sum of $24,200 or $494,200 comparable with the revised appraisal of $496, - 739. These are practically the same and as applicant's plant accounts are now set up on the appraisal basis, the Commission will use the latter figure in proceeding to its conclusions. k Applicant proposes additions and betterments in the amount of 0,884. This is made up of 135 miles of 66,000 volt transmission to connect properties purchased, owned and operated by applicant to cost $264,000. Additions to existing transmission lines, distribu - tion systems and substations are estimated to amount to the difference. The Commission will accept these figures but will require copies of the detailed statements of the construction costs made for the trustee as provided in the indenture. </seg>
            <seg id="p395">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 395 Applicant company was incorporated in 1917 and passed through a consolidation of properties in 1919, when plant values were set up on the estimated cost new less depreciation. Since 1919, properties purchased have been put on the books on the appraisal basis and plant constructed by applicant has been included at cost. Company's liabili - ties as of May 31, 1925, are as follows: First Mortgage Bonds. $ 724,000 Current liabilities exceed current assets in the amount of $232, - 732. Protection for this balance after the bonds is found in the values behind the remaining liabilities which includes the preferred stock owned by the public. The surplus is unearned and it is uncer - tain to what extent the measures of the reserves and common stock have also resulted from appraisal. Applicant has been unable to pay interest on the second mortgage bonds and surplus has been reduced substantially by losses from operation. It is clear that the preferred stock which is second to the income bonds in equity should have a more secure position. After the new financing applicant would have first mortgage bonds outstanding in the sum of $1,070,500, second mortgage bonds, $100, - 000 and preferred stock, $500,000. The new properties will increase earnings and the preferred stock will finance additions and better - ments, which will reduce operating expenses. However, certain con - ditions will be imposed before the new securities can be issued. The no par common stock with an apparent investment of $15,000 represents the voting control. Unless dividends are unpaid the preferred stock cannot vote. Common stock is approximately one per cent of the entire investment. This condition is opposed to public policy and the investment is not sufficient. As a condition to this order, the Commission will provide that the holding company shall acquire and cancel the second mortgage bonds in the amount of $100, - 000 which shall be represented in the liabilities by the common stock. The Commission will also require that the holding company shall put $50,000 additional in money or property to the credit of the company's stock. This may be used in paying for the purchased properties and will be considered with the cash required. The receivables from the Foshay company will be used to supply the remainder after the sale of bonds.

Giving effect to the new financing, the ratio of bonds to plant will be approximately 70%. The mortgage will include additions and betterments provided by the sale of preferred stock. This ratio should be reasonably maintained. Therefore, the Commission will provide that after the sale of bonds in the sum of 1200,000 par value, the remaining bonds in the hands of the trustee cannot be sold except on proper certification that additions and betterments financed by the sale of preferred stock have been added to plant in the same amount. The Commission believes and so finds that first mortgage six per cent bonds in the par amount of $346,500 as provided in the trust indenture to be sold at 90% are reasonably required for the purchase of the properties and will be authorized under the terms and condi - tions described above. The Commission also finds that the sale of seven per cent preferred stock in the amount of $422,000 par value at 88 is reasonably required to provide funds for additions and better - ments also subject to the terms and conditions set forth. We also find that the discount on the bonds and preferred stock which appears in applicant's financial statements as a separate item and the discount on the bonds shall be amortized from earnings during the life of the mortgage.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 5014 In the Matter of the Application of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company for Authority to Discontinue Agency at South Minden Station. Appearances For the applicant, Jesse L. Root, attorney; F. R. Mullen, division superintendent. For the respondents, L. W. Hague, M. D. King, and J. S. Canaday, secretary, Community Commerce Club. RANDALL, Commissioner: Hearing on the above entitled case was held in the courthouse at Minden, Kearney county, on the 28th day of July, 1925, pursuant to notice previously given to parties concerned. Minden is the county seat of Kearney county, with a population of about 2000. It is on the main line of the Burlington that runs between Chicago and Denver. The railroad company has a very com - modious, modern depot on the main line about four blocks from the business center of the town, with an agent, telegraph operator and helpers. On the 15th day of February, 1908, the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company acquired the Kansas City &amp; Omaha Railway line running from Alma, Nebraska, to Stromsburg, Nebraska, intercept - ing the Chicago and Denver main line at Sutton, Nebraska. This line of road runs through the south part of the town of Minden about five blocks from the business center of the town and there 1b no physical </seg>
            <seg id="p399">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 399 connection at Minden between these two lines of road notwithstand - ing the fact that they are both owned and operated at the present time by the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company. There is a fairly good depot located on this line of road in South Minden. The Commissioner taking the testimony made a personal inspection of the depot and stock yards and found that while the depot is a com - modious building, it has been allowed to deteriorate to such an extent that it needs painting and considerable repairing to put it in condition to be comfortable and a credit to a town of as much importance as Minden. The stockyards are old and in bad repair, and should be repaired and put in condition for stock shipments. The railroad company has maintained an agent-operator at South Minden and since acquiring the road the two stations have been run as separate and distinct as if they were owned by separate and distinct companies. There is a mill and elevator in operation near the station of South Minden, and an elevator that is not in use has also been erected on the side track. There is also a two-pen stockyard. The bulk of the business handled at South Minden is carload shipments. This line of road that was acquired by the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company did not lead to any of the great markets until after it was acquired by the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Rail - road company, starting as it does from Alma in the southern part of Harlan county where it intercepts the Burlington line to the southeast and running to the town of Stromsburg, which is its terminus. It has served only the purpose of a "feeder" for the main line of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy railroad, both at Alma and Sutton, 30 that all carload shipments are carried on the main line east from Sutton or Alma. The road traverses a very fertile and well populated country, and the local business furnished the road through the territory which it traverses has made the road reasonably profitable, but the business at Minden is largely handled on the main line as the following figures will show: The total business done at South Minden in 1924 was $10,958.07. At north Minden on the main line, nine blocks distant, the business was $178,112.87. If it were not for the industries that are on the South Minden line, or if there were a physical connection of the roads at Minden, the South Minden station could be abandoned and all shipments over the road could be handled at the north Minden or main line station. But as there is no such physical connection it is necessary to handle the business on the south line at the South Minden station. However, the business done at that point does not warrant the expense of a telegraph agent, as it was shown that the expense of maintaining an agent at South Minden was about 15 per cent of the gross receipts at that point. </seg>
            <seg id="p400">400 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT The Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company in its application asked that it be permitted to "eliminate the position of agent at the South Minden station and handle the business with a force operated at the Minden station on the main line, keeping the South Minden station open at train time for trains as conditions might require." There was a large amount of testimony introduced both by the railroad company and the citizens of Minden in regard to the matter, and the Commission, after duly considering all of the testimony and conditions, is of the opinion that the company should be permitted to substitute a caretaker for the South Minden station who should be under the supervision of the agent of the north Minden station, and that the telegraph business should be handled by the north Minden agent, but that the depot should be kept open during business hours and be under the supervision of a custodian, and, further, that the custodian should be permitted to collect for all freight and express and report the same to the agent at the north Minden station; that one-half hour before the arrival of both passenger and freight trains the agent, or a proper substitute, at the north Minden station should be required to go to the South Minden station and sell tickets to pas - sengers, bill less than carload freight and carload shipments, sign all bills of lading and have full supervision of the business transacted at the station, the same as though he were the agent at that station; and that the station at South Minden shall not be scheduled as a prepay station, as is usually the case where the station is in charge of a custodian. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company be permitted to substitute a caretaker for the agent and telegraph operator at South Minden, Kearney county, under the following conditions : 1. The depot shall be put in good repair and painted; it shall be kept open and well lighted during the hours when light is necessary, and well heated when heat is necessary, at least one-half hour before the arrival and departure of scheduled trains at the station. 2. The caretaker shall be accessible during the hours from 7 a. m. to 6 p. m. for the receiving of less than carload freight and express, and shall be authorized to receipt for express; shall order all cars for shippers; shall telephone all billings of less than carload freight and carload freight to the agent at north Minden, who shall make out the billings and deliver same to the caretaker and he shall </seg>
            <seg id="p401">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 401 deliver them to the shippers. The caretaker shall have authority to seal all cars of both livestock and dead freight. 3. The caretaker shall be given authority by the railroad com - pany to receipt and deliver all express that may be sent to that station, and receive pay therefor from the consignee; that in all respects he shall perform the duties of an express agent. 4. The caretaker at the South Minden station shall be supplied with telegram blanks so that parties desiring to telegraph from the South Minden station may reduce the same to writing, the same as though the caretaker were an operator, and he shall telephone or de - liver in person, the message to the agent at north Minden, to be sent by the operator at the north Minden office. The caretaker shall have authority to collect for the message after ascertaining from the agent at the north Minden station the amount to be collected. The agent. or a proper substitute, at north Minden shall be required to go to the South Minden station one-half hour before the arrival of scheduled trains, open the ticket office and sell tickets to passengers and check baggage; he shall also telephone to the caretaker the time of the arrival of each train in case said train is not on schedule time, and the caretaker shall post on a blackboard provided for that purpose with chalk, conspicuously, the time of the arrival of the trains, so that the public may have the same information as though an agent were at the South Minden station. 5. The company shall maintain a telephone so that parties de - siring information from the caretaker shall be able to obtain it over the telephone the same as though an agent were in charge. The caretaker shall at all times serve the public in the same manner as would be done by an agent. 6. The stockyards shall be repaired and put in condition to hold stock offered for shipment and in case there are 40 or more cars of stock shipped from the South Minden yards in a year the company shall connect up with the city water main or provide a wejl and wind mill with sufficient storage tanks to supply water for stock offered for shipment.

No public utility corporation or common carrier shall con - solidate its stock, property, franchise, or earnings in whole or in part with any other public utility corporation or common carrier owning a parallel or competing property without permission of the Railway Commission; and in no case shall any consolidation take place except upon public notice of at least sixty days to all stockholders, in such manner as may be provided by law. The Legislature may by law require all public utilities and common carriers to exchange business through physical connection, joint use, connected service, or otherwise." This agreement for purchase marks the end of a long period of controversy and negotiation between the two companies at Hampton. The efforts of the two companies to eliminate a competitive situation has been due very largely to the demand on the part of the public at Hampton. As far back as 1918 citizens of Hampton filed a complaint with the Commission asking that the companies be required to furnish better service, or as an alternative, that a consolidation be effected. The Commission found it was without jurisdiction to order a consoli - dation. At various times, however, both before and after the formal proceeding, it has lent its good offices in an effort to effect a settlement. In the present case the Hamilton County company purchases all of the exchange property of the Lincoln company but acquires none of the toll facilities. The purchase price is $10,000. At the request of the parties the Commission made a valuation of the Lincoln properties and found the present cost on the basis of original construction units to be $12,011. It was a condition of the agreement that if the Com - mission's valuation was found to be less than $10,000 the figure thus found was to be the consideration for the transfer of the property. </seg>
            <seg id="p403">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 403 Notice of the proposed consolidation has been sent to the. clerk of the village board at Bradshaw, the clerk of the village board at Hamp - ton, Commercial Club at Hampton, all newspapers in Aurora, county seat of Hamilton county, and the newspaper at Bradshaw. In these notices a statement of what is proposed was set forth in detail and protests or suggestions concerning the same were invited. There has been no response to these notices, indicating general approval of the proposed consolidations upon the terms and conditions set forth in the agreement. At the present time 183 subscribers are served from the Hampton Exchange of the Lincoln company and 138 from the exchange of the Hamilton County company. Upon consolidation, through the elimina - tion of duplicate telephones, there will be a total of 297 subscribers served. The Lincoln company at the present time serves 119 farm subscribers out of Hampton. These pay a rental of $1.25 per month. The application for approval of consolidation asks that this rate be increased to $1.50 per month. The Hamilton County company is a cooperative organization paying no dividends. One of its require - ments is that all farm subscribers must own at least one share of stock in the company. This rule is applied throughout all of the system and affects several hundred subscribers. The rate to these farm sub - scribers is 95c per month, plus repairs on their telephones and interest on their investment. It should be said in this connection that every subscriber served by the Hamilton County company receives service to all of the exchanges operated by the company. Ultimately it is ex - pected that the farmers transferred by the consolidation will purchase stock in the Hamilton County company at which time they will be entitled to the rate of 95c per month. Under the circumstances the rate of $1.50, considering the enlarged zone of service which will be extended to the Hampton farm subscribers, appears to be reasonable and will be approved. As will be noted, the constitutional provision above referred to requires that before any consolidation can be ap - proved public notice of at least sixty days shall be given to all stock - holders. No such notice has been given in this case. It will be necessary, therefore, to make the order of approval contingent upon the giving of such notice. In view of the general public demand for unified telephone service at Hampton, in view of the long effort that has been made to bring this situation about, and in view of the fact that the terms and conditions of the consolidation appear to be reasonable and in the best interest of the public, the consolidation will be approved.

OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman Under the jurisdiction of the federal district court, applicant is making effective certain exchange rate increases within its territory in the state of Nebraska.

These zones have included two or more towns. In the rates to be effective July 1, 1925, the company is now offering optional rates in the localities mentioned just above. That is, the subscriber may continue to enjoy at a specified rate the former ex - tent of service connections, or he may elect to pay a lesser rate for purely one town service, and to pay toll rates for intertown messages. Because of the many years during which these intertown mes - sages had been hauled free, it is the desire of the company now to offer to subscribers electing the option of single town service, a special station-to-station rate of 5 cents where the message is between adjacent towns and 10 cents in certain longer hauls heretofore within the free territory. It has filed an application setting forth the desired rates. The proposed changes apply only to station-to-station service, regular distance rates to apply to person-to-person messages, appointment and messenger service messages, and to report charges. It is of course obvious that the same evening and night rates will apply as the day schedule in these reduced rate situations. No change is contemplated in the overtime charges as compared with the standard rates now in effect throughout applicant's Nebraska territory. The proposed rates which are hereby approved for station-to-station service are all at five cents for the initial period with the exception between Boelus and St. Paul and between Stratton and Trenton, where the proposed rate is 10 cents.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 5932 In the Matter of the Application of the Wehn Telephone Company for Authority to Increase Rates. Appearances : For applicant, Eben D. Warner, president; J. C. Reynolds, auditor; H. M. Carmean, traffic superintendent; Otto Fuerst, plant superintendent. For respondent, E. E. Richards, for Oshkosh subscribers; Dr. G. H. Morris, mayor of Oshkosh; F. A.

OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman Applicant acquired the properties here involved, namely the ex - changes at Broadwater, Lewellen, Lisco and Oshkosh, in the latter part of 1919. During 1920 the plant was very generally reconstructed and improved. New schedules of rates were authorized by us effective about the middle of 1920. Those rates are now in effect. </seg>
            <seg id="p409">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 409 Applicant asks further rate relief alleging that it has $70,000 of property, including toll lines; that exclusive of taxes, interest and dividends, it has not been able to pay its way; that it is entitled to at least $7,000 return on capital invested, and such rate increases as will produce that amount. The prayer of the petition setting forth the following schedule of net rates, it is alleged, will produce about $3,000 per annum additional revenue, or 34 per cent increase in exchange rates: Annual Rate Net 16. A discount of 25c per month on each main or initial station if paid in full on or before the 10th of the current month. 17. Service station discount of $1.50 per bill - ing period where billed semi-annually in advance, or its equivalent if billed for a greater or lesser period, and if paid in full on or before the 10th of the current billing or initial month of period billed. Our computations indicate that the revenue increase will be slightly more than the petitioner alleges if the rates prayed for are approved. Applicant opened its book accounts upon purchase of the property, showing assets of $44,286. Through the rebuilding program, the property on April 30, 1925, stood at $70,856 in the books, or an in - crease of $26,570. Its bills payable assumed at time of purchase amounted to $15,000. As of April 30, 1925, this had increased to $49,208, or an increase of $34,208. The difference between the in - debtedness and the book plant increase was due in part to charging unearned and unpaid interest into the bills payable account, and in part to the reconstruction program and dismantling of certain property where there was no reserve account against which to charge it. 1.

            <seg id="p410">410 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT The plant account shown in the opening statement as of October 31, 1919, was based upon an appraisal which this Commission was un - able to approve, which fact was stated in the finding on the preceding rate application. In so far as error existed in the original plant entry, it existed in the plant accounts of April 30, 1925. »For that reason, the Commission sent its telephone engineer to entory and appraise the property which was done with assistance the company's plant superintendent. Those appraisals were entered in the record at the hearing as follows: ON COST BASIS The company's book cost was $70,856 and its indicated present value from the books, $57,210. In cross examination, the company rather sustained the conten - tion that the Commission's engineer did not in his labor units, give fer consideration to a different level of wages in western Ne - ka than in eastern Nebraska. There were also some errors rela - to sizes of poles, which when corrected would not greatly change appraisal. If the figures of the Commission's engineer were in - sed ten per cent, it will be a liberal allowance in favor of the company and offsetting the conservatism of the engineer. The gross book value of this company's exchange properties is $205 per station, excluding the toll properties. The gross book value find by the Commission's engineer on reproduction cost basis, was 70 per station, excluding toll, and on his cost basis, $143 per .tion. On any of these bases the investment is higher than that any other telephone company in the state so far as our check goes. The reason for this is that under an erroneous interpretation of t development of the territory, the company reconstructed its perties to serve more than twice the number of subscribers it had. place of a developing territory, there has actually occurred a de - ising number of subscribers. The result is that the company's advance construction very greatly exceeds that warranted by circum - stances as they actually exist. Jross construction cost $44,572.78 londition per cent _ ... .. 70 )epreciated cost _ $31,411.04 ON REPRODUCTION BASIS leproduction new $53,347.82 Condition per cent 69 leproduction new depreciated $36,861.15 </seg>
            <seg id="p411">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 411 A certain amount of advance construction in a plant is sound economy and should appear In the rate base. Excessive advance con - struction results in certain plant not used and useful. To the extent that such advance construction is beyond reasonable prudence, th3 immediate public may not be asked to bear the burden of a full return. The extent of this mistake in judgment must be considered in passing upon applicant's claim as to fair value. During the past five years, applicant's books show average gross income of $1,086 and during the past two years, an average $1850. Out of this it was necessary to pay rents and interest. The interest charges shown on the books for the five-year period, average $4,129 and for the past two years, average $4,134. Interest is charged at the rate of 9 per cent per annum. The creditors are stockholders. In passing on the expenses shown by the books, it is necessary to discuss the method of handling the reserve for depreciation charged as an operating expense. When the books were opened after the purchase of the plant by applicant, the reserve was shown as $1,998. The credits and charges to that account during the years 1920 to 1924 inclusive, were as follows: There has thus accrued in the account and charged as expense during the years 1922 to 1924, inclusive, with four months of 1925, the sum of $11,821. The measure of the need for the reserve is the cost of the depreciable plant, inasmuch as charges to the reserve account are made on that basis. The Commission's engineer figured the cost of the depreciable plant at $42,124. If we recognize the criticisms of applicant to this valuation, to the extent of ten per cent additional, which the Commission's engineering department refuses to concede, the gross cost of the depreciable plant would not exceed $46,500 as it stands. The reserve account therefore now amounts to 29 per cent of the cost of the depreciable plant. On any other than the rigid straight line basis of figuring depre - ciation, this is about as high as this reserve needs to be. Even to the advocates of rigid depreciation on a life in service basis, five per cent of the cost is considered a sufficient depreciation rate. This would amount to $2,300 per annum in place of the amount actually set up as an expense of $4,100. If $2,300 has been the amount credited to the reserve account and charged to expense annually dur- rear 920 921 922 923 924 Accrual $1,603.05 2,364.73 ._ 4,577.08 3,931.28 4,224.34 Used $1,792 2,474 464 1,481 308 </seg>
            <seg id="p412">412 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT ing the past five years, the account would now have in it $6,976, after having borne a very considerable burden of reconstruction as has been shown above. This would be a perfectly safe rate of increase and would during the life of the plant, create a reserve sufficient to retire it or replace it. The error of applicant appears to have been the application of a depreciation rate to the book investment which we have already shown to have been much too high. Had the reserve requirements been applied to the proper base, applicant would have earned a very considerable portion of his interest charges. As it was, the reserve accrual was used to pay interest charges in so far as they were paid. Applicant's expenses have not varied greatly during a five-year period, although it has been unfortunate in the loss of some sub - scribers. This loss could not be reflected in reduced expenses. Dur - ing the past two years the average expense of operation has been $11,400. The average revenue during those two years has been $13,540. Commendable effort has been shown in keeping the ex - penses down with the exception of the credit to the reserve account above discussed. By making a deduction from the expenses charged for the purpose of crediting the reserve account in excess of 5 per cent of cost, we find that the gross income of applicant, had the books been so kept, would have been an average for the past two years of $3,990. Against this are the legitimate charges for rent and taxes in amount $1,200. This would leave a net earning available for interest and dividends of $2,790 under present rates. We come now to consideration of the wages of invested capital required under the law, involved as it is with the consideration of overbuilt plant. Appli - cant has figured interest at 9 per cent per annum, basing this upon the bank rate paid by some of the creditors in order to loan the money to the company. The fair rate of return may not be measured by the requirements of the most hard pressed borrower. Rand v. Minneapolis, 285 Fed. 818. The most liberal valuation that can be placed by us on this prop - erty for the purpose of this case does not exceed the bills payable, $49,000. We find the fair rate of return to be 8 per cent. This valuation includes consideration and fair weight to all the elements of valuation, including cost, reproduction cost, extent of depreciation, extent of property not used and useful, intangible values and the necessary working capital. So considered, this company's necessities for additional revenue appear not to exceed $1,500 per annum. We are therefore unable to approve the rate schedule applied for on the whole, but do find necessity for some relief. </seg>

It is organized under the laws of the state of Colorado. It owns and operates extensive Nebraska properties. Various financing measures of this applicant have heretofore been presented to this Commission under the provisions of article 17, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, and in the orders on those Eications considerable of the history of the company has been ined. In the one instance, applicant desires to issue one thousand shares of common stock to liquidate a claim of R. E. Wilsey &amp; Co. arising by reason of a contract to sell a large block of bonds and debentures authorized by this Commission, but which applicant elected not to sell.

Originally applicant's predecessor, the Intermountain Railway Light &amp; Power company, issued $1,000,000 of preferred stock, $999, - 300 of common stock. At approximately the time of incorporation it paid $82,800 in preferred stock and $211,300 common stock in ex - change for certain public utility properties. The remainder of both preferred and common stocks were placed in the treasury. From time to time certain amounts of common stock were issued to promoters apparently without other consideration than reward for promotion. Preferred stock was sold generally in exchange for properties, or the stock subsidiary corporation. Plant accounts were handled with the necessary liberality. All of these transactions took place before the Nebraska law was broadened sufficiently to give this Commission certain supervisory powers. The entire common stock had been issued and was outstand - ing before that statute was passed. No matter how we may regard those securities it is not within our province to undo any of those earlier transactions. The Lincoln Traction Company v. City of Lincoln, 103 Nebraska 231. In 1924, applicant corporation bought back three thousand shares of common stock for a consideration of $72,000. This stock was placed in the treasury at par and a fictitious surplus was thereby created. On June 30, 1920, there was in the treasury of applicant the following unsold stock: First Preferred $382,300 Second Preferred 349,400 Common 240,000 The common stock represents the entire amount repurchased in 1924 excepting six hundred shares already withdrawn from the treasury in connection with these applications. The preferred stock has never been sold. The question arises at once as to the jurisdiction of the Com - mission over the matters involved in the applications. The only power of the Commission to supervise the issue of public utility securi - ties is granted by section 676 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, as amended in chapter 168 of the session laws of 1923. That statute relates to the original issue. It would appear that the Com - mission has no more authority to restrict the resale of its stock by a </seg>
            <seg id="p416">416 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT corporation if such stock has been legally secured in a bona fide trans - action than it would to supervise the sale of a corporation stock by one individual to another. This conclusion in no-wise relates to a transaction where stock is issued by a corporation to an officer with - out consideration and returned to the treasury without consideration and held as treasury stock. Such a question is not presented in these applications which relate entirely to the common stock as we have already shown. This common stock came into the treasury as a bona fide transaction. It is our conclusion and we so find that the Commission is with - out jurisdiction in the matters presented by these applications. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that our applications numbers 5944 and 6029 be and they are hereby dismissed for want of jurisdiction.

RANDALL, Commissioner: This application was made by the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company and the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company in the following language: "The Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company and the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company represent to this Honorable Commission that the station at Thompson, Jefferson county, </seg>
            <seg id="p417">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 417 Nebraska, on the lines of said companies transacts very little business of a local nature and such business is not sufficient to warrant the payment of the salaries to an agent for the services performed; that most all of the business done at Thompson is in carload lots; that the payment of wages for the past year to the agent has amounted to $1,940.00; that the total amount of business for the past year at this station was as follows: "Your applicants represent that if permitted to discontinue such agents and discontinue such service all of the business now transacted at the station of Thompson could be carried on by a custodian at a yearly saving of $1,640, of which the Rock Island proportion is $1, - 230.75 and the Burlington $410.24. A custodian would be available to take care of the requirements of the companies' patrons for a greater number of hours daily, than does the present agent, and can give the patrons as good, if not better service, than they now obtain at this point. "If this Honorable Commission should grant this application Thompson would become a prepay station, billing accounts, etc.. would be handled on behalf of the Rock Island at Mahaska, seven miles distance, or at Fairbury and on behalf of the Burlington at Endicott, 9.35 miles east or at Reynolds 4.51 miles west." Hearing on this application was held in the Chamber of Com - merce building at Fairbury, at 7:00 p. m. on the 30th day of July, 1925, pursuant to notice previously given. Both railroad companies who had made the application presented exhibits substantiating the facts and figures set out in the application. There was no serious objection presented by representatives of Thompson to the discon - tinuance of agency service and the substitution of custodian service provided that the substituted service did not cause inconvenience to the patrons of the two roads other than that of the station being made a prepay station on less than carload freight and the paying of tares on the train. It was agreed by the two companies that they would pay a custodian $50 per month, the amount to be paid by each road to be agreed upon between themselves. It was also shown that arrange - ments had practically been made with the manager of the two elevators at that point to act as custodian.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 5967 In the Matter of the Application of the Blair Telephone Company for Authority to Issue Stock and to Exchange the Same for Out - standing Stock. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: By order issued on March 5, 1920, the Blair Telephone company was authorized to issue a stock dividend to the amount of $36,700. At that time it represented that it had outstanding $10,800 of common stock. For various reasons this stock was not issued at that time and on January 16, 1924, a supplemental order under our Application No. 5375 was issued, authorizing the company to change the par value of its stock from $40 to $50 per share. It was also given authority to </seg>
            <seg id="p420">420 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT increase the amount of new stock from $36,700 to $37,400. Shortly, thereafter, the officers of the company discovered a slight error in the record as to outstanding stock and asked the Commission for a modification of the order, and on February 13, 19 24, another supple - mental order was issued, changing the amount of authorized stock to $37,520. As a condition of these orders it was required, in order to avoid the issuance of fractional shares, that a small cash payment be made by the stockholders when the exchange of securities was made. The total amount of cash thus involved would have been $820. Because of difficulty in inducing stockholders to make the cash payment as a condition to receiving the new stock, and because the constitutional notice governing issues of new stock was not complied with, none of the stock was ever issued. The company now makes application to have the issue again approved, having complied with the necessary requirements as to notice, and for authority to issue common stock in the full amount, so as to render unnecessary the payment of cash by stockholders. Dividends have not been paid for several years, so that there is an ample margin in surplus to support the stock that will be outstanding. The application of the company will therefore be approved. Owing to defects in the stock record and to the fact that it is possible stockholders may have transferred shares without notifying the recording officer, it will be made a condition of this order that new stock will be issued to stockholders only upon presentation of the shares or an affidavit proving ownership, and establishing the in - ability of the shareholder to present the stock itself. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Blair Telephone com - pany be, and the same hereby is, authorized to issue its common stock in the amount of $37,520, same to be issued to existing stockholders in lieu of cash paid into the treasury of the company in the form of assessments, and in lieu of dividends earned but not paid, and making the total outstanding issue of capital stock $48,200. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that new stock shall not be issued except upon presentation by the stockholder of the shares which he claims to own, or in lieu thereof, a satisfactory affidavit establishing ownership and showing that such shares have been lost or destroyed. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that report of the distribution of the stock herein authorized, shall be made to this Commission within 60 days of the date hereof. </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 5990 In the Matter of the Application of the Chicago &amp; North Western Rail - way Company for Authority to Discontinue Agent at Charleston Station. Appearances For the applicant, R. W. McGinnis, general agent, Lincoln; G. A. Holmes, superintendent, Norfolk. For the respondents, W. L. Kirkpatrick, attorney, York. RANDALL, Commissioner The applicant in this case is the Chicago &amp; North Western Rail - way company asking for permission to discontinue the employment of an agent and telegraph operator at the town of Charleston and sub - stitute therefor a caretaker to serve the people of Charleston arid vicinity. The population of Charleston is about fifty. There is one store, two elevators and a repair shop, or garage. The town is located about seven miles southwest of York in a very fertile and thickly settled country, but it is only about four miles from Bradshaw on the Burlington and about five miles from Knox on the Burlington, so that the territory is quite limited. The business at Charleston is largely carload shipments, which could be billed from York without incon - venience to the shippers and the less than carload business has fallen off to such an extent that there is very little income from that source to the company. During the year 1924, the carload business at Charleston amounted to $22,767.30, less than carload business $901.64, ticket sales $140.95, and cream shipments $118.75, making a total income to the station of $23,928.64. Deducting the carload shipments leaves only $1,116.34 in less than carload, cream and passenger receipts. The salary of the agent at this station was $1,430 and there were some other expenses in connection with the agent which brought the </seg>
            <seg id="p422">422 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT expense of maintaining an agent at that station to $1500 per year. The railroad company present exhibits and testimony to show that if they were permitted to substitute a caretaker for an agent at this point that they would make a saving of at least $100 per month or more than $1200 for the year and that the business could be handled as satisfactorily by a caretaker as by an agent, as his hours would be longer and the only difference would be that the shippers of less than carload freight would be required to prepay the freight to that station and also that passengers would be required to pay the fare on After duly considering all of the testimony in the case, the Com - mission is of the opinion that the application of the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company to substitute a caretaker for an agent at Charleston should be granted on the conditions provided for in the order. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company be permitted to substitute a caretaker for the agent and telegraph operator at Charleston, under the following rules: 1. The caretaker shall live in the depot and be accessible to the public from 8 a. m. to 6 p. m. ; he shall keep the depot open from 8 a. m. to 6 p. m.; during the time of year when heat is necessary he shall see to it that the waiting room is kept comfortable, and well - lighted during the hours when artificial light is necessary. 2. The Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company shall pro - vide telephone communication with York over a single party line wire so that communications between Charleston and York shall be of a private nature. The Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company shall also maintain a telephone in the depot connected with the rural lines so that the public can communicate with the caretaker. 3. The caretaker shall order all cars for shippers, or permit the shippers to do so, over the private telephone lines; he shall com - municate all billings of less than carload and carload freight to the billing agent who shall make out the bill and return duplicate to the caretaker at Charleston to be delivered by him to the shipper. 4. The conductor of the freight train shall have authority to seal all carload shipments; he shall sign receipts for less than carload shipments and deliver them to the caretaker who shall deliver them to the shipper, and such receipts shall be binding upon the railway company. </seg>
            <seg id="p423">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 423 5. The caretaker shall be given authority by the railroad com - pany to receive and receipt for outgoing express and receive and de - liver any and all express that shall be sent to Charleston, and receive payment therefor from the consignee. 6. The caretaker shall be furnished with telegraph blanks for the use of the public. Upon delivery to him by the sender of the message he shall communicate the same over the private telephone to the telegraph agent at York. If the message is to be prepaid he shall collect from the sender after having ascertained the amount of the charges from the telegraph agent at York. When telegraph messages are sent to the parties at Charleston, the messages shall be handled by the caretaker in the same manner that they would be handled in case there was an agent at Charleston. 7. Passengers paying their fare on the train shall not be required to pay more than the regular fare. When passengers have baggage to be checked the caretaker shall put it in the baggage car and the conductor shall either obtain a check from the baggage man or from the agent at the first agency station and deliver the check to the passenger paying the fare. 8. When stock is shipped the conductor of the train shall carry the shipper or caretaker of the stock to the station where the billing is made out, and the billing shall be made out as from Charleston so that the contract will be good for return passage to Charleston.

Appearances For the applicant, R. W. McGinnis, general agent, Lincoln. For the respondents, F. J. Wortman, R. F. D. No. 5, West Point; Wenzel Maly, R. 7, West Point RANDALL, Commissioner The applicant in this case is the Chicago &amp; North Western Rail - way company asking for permission to discontinue the employment of an agent and telegraph operator at the town of Crowell and sub - stituting therfor a caretaker to serve the people of Crowell and vicinity. The population of Crowell is about 25. It 1b situated about eight miles northwest of Scribner on a state highway. It has one grain elevator and one store. Owing to the prevalence of the trucks and busses the less than carload freight and passenger business has fallen off materially and there are no prospects of the future growth of the town. During the year 1924, the total amount of business done at this station was $4,253.16, divided as follows: Carload freight for - warded and received $3,474.59, less than carload freight forwarded and received $404.02, cream shipments $137.44 and ticket sales and fares paid to conductors on train $237.11. The business at this station is largely carload shipments and can be handled at Scribner without any inconvenience to the shippers as they do their banking at Scribner. The railroad company presented an exhibit showing that the salary paid the agent at Crowell amounted to $1,505.28 a year and that by substituting a caretaker the company would make a saving of $100 per month without any inconvenience to the public. Owing to the falling off in business and with no prospects of an increase, and with the overhead expense so much out of line with the business transacted at this point and with the substitution of a competent caretaker in place of the agent, the public would receive as much or more service than it is receiving now, except the slight inconvenience of payment of less than carload freight at the station and paying pas - senger fare on the train^ The Commission is of the opinion that the application should be granted on the conditions provided for in the order. </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 5994 In the Matter of the Application of the Farmers Independent Tele - phone Company of Red Cloud for Authority to Purchase Certain of the Exchange Property of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company at Red Cloud and to Consolidate the Same for Unified Service. Appearances For the applicant, W. E. Bell, commercial superintendent; W. L. Lemon, auditor, for the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company; S. W. Frisbie, president, and O. C. Teel, secretary, for the Farmers Independent Telephone Company of Red Cloud. For the Commission, R. C. McLain, assistant engineer. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: feThe Farmers Independent Telephone company, operating a tele - ne exchange at Red Cloud, has entered into an agreement with the coin Telephone &amp; Telegraph company, also operating an exchange </seg>
            <seg id="p427">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 427 at Red Cloud, for the purchase of a portion of the latter's property at that point, and the two companies join in application to this Com - mission for authority to consolidate the two exchanges, the former thereafter to furnish a unified service. It is set out in the agreement that the Farmers company is to acquire the distribution system, or the so-called outside plant of the Lincoln company at Red Cloud. The central office equipment is not being purchased but the lines of the Lincoln company will be carried to the switchboard of the Farmers company. It is agreed that the maximum price paid by the Farmers company shall be $15,000, but it is a part of the stipulation that a valuation is to be made by the State Railway Commission and, if the present value found by the Commission is less, that figure shall be used as the basis for purchase. Hearing was had at Red Cloud on September 2, at which rep - resentatives of both parties appeared and all details and circumstances connected with the proposed consolidation were inquired into. At that hearing the engineering department of the Commission submitted its report as to the valuation of the property of the Lincoln company. The original cost of the property was found to be $26,545.31 and the present or depreciated cost $17,312.43. It follows, therefore, that the valuation being higher than the amount named in the agreement, the latter will be the price at which the property changes hands. It is estimated by the Farmers company that it will cost at least $5,000 to make the necessary changes in the property to furnish consolidated service. Additions will have to be made to the central office equip - ment of the Farmers company and readjustments of outside pole and wire lines will be necessary. It is estimated that the consolidation can be effected by December 1. The Farmers company owns only the town property within the city of Red Cloud and serves 330 subscribers. It furnishes switch - ing service to 330 farmers who own and maintain their lines. The Lincoln company has 364 subscribers, 51 of which are farm telephones, the remainder being within the city. It is not proposed by the Farmers company at this time to make any change in rates although it is suggested that some increase later on will be necessary. There will be a loss on account of duplicate service of 126 subscribers. It is estimated that the loss of revenue will be approximately $300 per month. There will be some additional expense in the operation of the consolidated exchange, roughly estimated at the present time at about $300 per month. No detailed statement of operating expenses and revenues was submitted and since existing rates are not to be disturbed, such statement would not appear to be necessary. One of the conditions of the agreement between the two com - panies is that existing grounded lines between Red Cloud and Cowles, </seg>
            <seg id="p428">EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 428 Red Cloud and Guide Rock and Red Cloud and Inavale be discon - nected and service discontinued. Between the same points the Lin - coln company already has metallic toll lines over which it is proposed to furnish connections between the towns mentioned. The grounded line between Cowles and Red Cloud is owned jointly by the Amboy Telephone company and the Glenwood Telephone company, the latter company operating the exchange at Cowles. The line between Guide Rock and Red Cloud is owned jointly by the Amboy Telephone com - pany and the Glenwood Telephone company, the latter company operating an exchange at Guide Rock. Ownership of the line to Inavale is not disclosed by the record. It is owned, however, by a farm company. A rather peculiar situation exists as to rates. Messages originat - ing at Red Cloud and going to either of the three points mentioned carry a five-cent charge. Messages originating at Cowles and Guide Rock and terminating at Red Cloud are handled free of charge. The five-cent charge applies on both in-bound and out-bound traffic from Inavale. There would appear to be a measure of discrimination in the Guide Rock and Cowles situation where a charge is made for mes - sages one way and not for the other. Representatives of the com - panies owning the grounded lines were present at the hearing and entered protest over the proposed abandonment of these lines. They agreed that a five-cent charge on messages out of Guide Rock and Cowles would' be proper and that it would ultimately improve the service. It might be stated in this connection that the Lincoln com - pany agrees to maintain the five-cent rate over its own toll lines as a part of the consolidation arrangement. The proposed arrangement is justified by good telephone practice. It is admitted by protestants that service over the grounded lines is not good and is particularly poor out-bound from Cowles and Guide Rock. It might be said also that the metallic lines of the Lincoln company would be ample to handle all of the business between the points in question. The Commission is of the opinion, however, that it is without power at the present moment to approve the proposed abandonment of these lines because of the property interests involved. If either the Lincoln company or the Farmers company were to pur - chase these lines, property rights would be protected and approval might follow. Opportunity will be afforded for such negotiation, pending which approval of this particular arrangement will be held in abeyance. The consolidation at Red Cloud follows a number of years of controversy and litigation. An order of this Commission requiring compulsory physical connection was carried to the supreme court but the conditions imposed by the Commission were disapproved. The </seg>
            <seg id="p429">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 429 competitive situation at Red Cloud is one of two remaining in the state involving exchanges of any size. In the other case approval of a consolidation has already been applied for. The consolidation is in keeping with the universal public demand for a unified telephone service. It goes without question that telephone service at Red Cloud will be improved by this consolidation. Neither company has been able to adequately maintain its property nor render proper service because of competitive conditions. The purchase price and the con - ditions of consolidation, with the one exception noted, appear to be reasonable. The Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the consolidation is in the public interest and should be approved. Section 3 of article X of the constitution requires that "in no case shall any consolidation take place except upon public notice of at least sixty days to all stockholders, in such manner as may be provided by law." No such notice has been given by the companies involved. Approval of consolidation will be subject to the giving of such notice. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Farmers Independent Telephone company of Red Cloud be, and the same hereby is, author - ized to purchase certain of the property of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company at Red Cloud and to consolidate the same with its own exchange at that point so as to thereafter provide a unified tele - phone service. Such consolidation should be effected by not later than December 1, 1925. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that within thirty days the said Farmers Independent Telephone company and the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company shall report to the Commission the results of their negotiation for the purchase of the grounded trunk lines between Red Cloud and Guide Rock, Red Cloud and Cowles and Red Cloud and Inavale. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, upon completion of the con - solidation, the Farmers Independent Telephone company shall make report to this Commission showing in detail the property displaced, the charges made to depreciation reserve and the credits made to plant as a result of such consolidation.

SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: The original order in this case provided that the consolidation of the property of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company at Red Cloud with that of the Farmers Independent Telephone company should be consolidated by not later than December 1, 1925. Owing to the inability of the Farmers company to secure equipment from the supply houses, it was impossible to complete the consolidation by the date named. A request was made, therefore, for a sixty day extension Btime. There seems to be no reason why such extension should not granted.

            <seg id="p431">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 431 SUPPLEMENTAL FINDING AND ORDER TAYLOR, Commissioner: In the original order we discussed at some length the proposal of the consolidating companies to abandon certain trunk lines running from Red Cloud to Cowles, Guide Rock and Inavale and to substitute therefor service over toll lines already in place between the same points and owned by the Lincoln company. Because of our doubt as to our authority to authorize the abandonment of the property in - volved we suggested that one or the other of the two companies pur - chase the trunk lines in question, reserving further order until report could be made as to the outcome of such negotiations. Under date of November 11, 1925, the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company advises that it has been unable to purchase any of the lines involved. Since the Farmers company has not the direct interest in abandon - ment as has the Lincoln company, it has not concerned itself with the attempt to purchase the lines. We may assume, therefore, that the suggestion of the Commission cannot be carried out, for the time being at least. We pointed out in the original opinion that the present practice of making a five-cent charge from Red Cloud outward to Guide Rock and Cowles with no charge on in-bound messages bordered on dis - crimination, if it is not in fact discriminatory. We are still of that opinion. The practice should be corrected by the application of the same charge in both directions and the Guide Rock and Cowles dis - tricts of the Glenwood Telephone company in conjunction with the Amboy Telephone company, joint owner of the trunk lines, will be required to file and collect a rate of five-cents on messages originat - ing at Guide Rock and Cowles and terminating at Red Cloud. The five-cent charge is already applied in both directions from Inavale. The Commission is advised that a similar situation exists with reference to the Blue Hill district of the Glenwood Telephone com - pany. This should likewise be corrected. The officers of that dis - trict were not parties to this proceeding although the general officers of the Glenwood company were present at the hearing. The proper representatives of that company should make application to the Commission to apply a five-cent charge on messages originating at Blue Hill and terminating at Red Cloud. In the event of their failure to do so it will be necessary for the Commission to take the necessary steps to require it. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Guide Rock and Cowles districts of the Glenwood Telephone company and the Amboy Tele- </seg>

(SEAL) APPUCATION NO. 5995 In the Matter of the Application of the Farmers Independent Tele - phone Company of Red Cloud for Authority to Issue and Sell $25,000 of Common Stock. Appearances For the applicant, S. W. Frisbie, president; O. C. Teel, secretary. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: This application is considered in connection with Application No. 5994 which asks authorization for the purchase by the applicant of a portion of the property of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph com - pany at Red Cloud and a consolidation for the purpose of thereafter furnishing a unified telephone service. This is an application to issue $25,000 of the common stock of the company, the proceeds of the sale of $15,000 of which is to be used in paying for the property acquired from the Lincoln company, $5,000 or more to pay for the cost of con - solidation of the two properties and such additional equipment as will be necessary and the remainder to pay oft all or a portion of $5,000 of present indebtedness. The company has outstanding at the present time 376 shares of common stock of a par value of $50 per share, making the total out - standing at par of $18,800. The company was organized in 1907 with an authorized capital of $50,000. At the outset stock was sold at $12 per share. Later an assessment of $15 per share was levied but </seg>
            <seg id="p433">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 433 not all the stockholders paid. Since negotiations for the purchase of the Lincoln property have been started an effort has been made by the officers of the company to induce the delinquent stockholders to pay the assessment. A considerable number have responded but it is expected that for various reasons some will not do so. The com - pany has paid no dividends since it was first organized. It is hoped to be able to put the property on a paying basis following the con - solidation, at which time the payment of dividends will be instituted. It is proposed, however, to withhold dividends to those stockholders who do not pay the assessment until such time as the accumulated dividends equal the amount of the assessment. As a matter of equity to the other stockholders it would appear to be justified. It is estimated by the present management that the dividends that have been earned, but which have been used to construct additions and betterments to the property, equal the difference between the $27 of principal paid in and the $50 par. The value of the fixed invest - ment as shown by the books July 31, 1925, is $30,988.49. Net assets of cash, receivables and materials and supplies would increase this to approximately $33,000. The present value of the property acquired from the Lincoln company according to the valuation made by the Commission's engineering department is $17,312. There is consider - able duplicate property that will be eliminated as a result of the con - solidation. It was impossible from the record to determine how much of this there is measured in dollars. Some additfen will have to be made to the existing property of applicant which will in a measure off-set the loss from duplication. It seems quite clear, however, that on an original cost basis there will be physical property of a present value of between $43,000 and $45,000. If the full $25,000 of new stock is issued there will be outstanding $43,800. Whether the full amount is issued will depend upon the cost of the consolidation. The stock is to be sold at par. The present outstanding indebtedness of the company was in - curred in the construction of additions and betterments to the prop - erty, a considerable portion of it going into the purchase of land and the construction of a central office building which property at the present time is carried on the books at $8,200. As stated, $5,000 of this indebtedness remains unpaid. It is proposed to retire it with proceeds from the sale of stock at par. In Application No. 5994 we have approved the proposed consolida - tion of the properties at Red Cloud. In our opinion, such consolida - tion will be distinctly in the public interest. Since this issue of securi - ties is required largely to carry out the plans for consolidation it follows that in the opinion of the Commission the issue is proper and reasonably necessary for the corporate purposes of the company. </seg>

            <seg id="p435">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION' 435 Appearances : For applicant, Anan Raymond, attorney, Omaha OPINION AND FIXDIXG TAYLOR, Commissioner: On August 11, 1925, the Omaha &amp; Lincoln Railway &amp; Light com - pany made application to this Commission for authority to increase its passenger fares to the level recently authorized and now in effect for the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway company. Hearing was had on the application at Omaha on September 22, 1925, at which time testimony on behalf of applicant was submitted. No protestants appeared and the evidence submitted by the company stands un - challenged. The question of the Commission's jurisdiction is presented how - ever, by the existence of an injunction granted by the District Court of Lancaster county on July 8, 1920, permanently enjoining the attorney general of Nebraska and the members of the State Railway Commission, from "In any manner enforcing against the plaintiff (applicant herein) any of the provisions of Chapter 92 of the Session Laws of Nebraska for the year 1907, and Sections Nos. 6067 to 6071, inclusive, of the Revised Statutes for the year 1913, and from instituting or prosecuting any suit or action against the plaintiff ••** for or on account of the failure of them or either of them, to continue to keep in force any of the rates or fares for the transportation of passengers over the line of railway now operat - ed by the plaintiff and located in and between the villages of Papillion and Ralston, Nebraska, and the city of Omaha, Ne - braska." The statute referred to in the injunction is the so-called two-cent fare law of this state. Applicant is incorporated under the Steam Railroad Act and is thus subject to the statute. The jurisdictional question involved herein has been submitted to the Attorney General and under date of October 5, 1925, he submits an opinion in which he says: "My opinion is that the State Railway Commission is without jurisdiction in the premises." It would appear unnecessary to quote his reasons which are given in some detail. After consideration, the Commission adopts his opinion as its own.

NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION, Thome A. Browne, Chairman. Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 6015 In the Matter of the Application of the Chicago &amp; Northwestern Rail - way Company for Authority to Discontinue Agent at Nora and Substitute a Caretaker. Appearances : For C. &amp; N. W. Ry. Co., R. W. McGinnis, general agent, Lincoln For community of Nora, H. J. Adcock. OPINION AND FINDINGS RANDALL, Commissioner: The applicant in this case, the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company asks for permission to discontinue the employment of an agent and telegraph operator at the town of Nora, Nuckolls county, and substitute a custodian. The hearing was held in the depot at Nora, pursuant to notice given all parties concerned, at 1:30 p. m. October 16, 1925. Nora is a town of about 160 inhabitants, situated about 12 miles northeast of Superior, 6.3 miles southeast of Nelson, 5.8 miles north - west of Ruskin and 6.8 miles southwest of Oak, at a junction point of the Rock Island Railroad company's line from Fairbury to Nelson. The country tributary to Nora is well populated and an improved </seg>
            <seg id="p437">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 437 farming country. The town though not large in numbers seems to be a thrifty business town. The business of the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway for some unknown reason is very light at this point, not being more than 25% of the railroad business at that town. The business has gradually fallen off at that point with the Chicago &amp; North Western to such an extent that the expense of maintaining an agent is way out of line and excessive and unreasonable, as is shown by the testimony. The business done by the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company at Nora, for 1924, is as follows: The salary of the agent amounted to $1,391.88 and other nec - essary expenses charged to the station amounted to $385.37, making a total expense of $1,777.25. The company produced testimony to show that if it was permitted to substitute custodian service for agency service that this expense could be reduced at least $1,100, without any inconvenience to the public. The railroad company proposes to have the billing for all freight done at its office in Superior, and all telegrams for parties at Nora to be communicated to the custodian at Nora over the company's private phone and all messages sent from Nora to be delivered to the custodian at Nora and by him transmitted over the company's private phone to Superior. It would seem from the amount of business being done at this station by the company that their application should be granted and that a custodian would be able to take care of the business at that station without any inconvenience to the public. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Application No. 6015 of the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company to substitute custodian service for agency service at Nora, Nuckolls county, be, and the same is hereby approved on the following conditions.

OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman The Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company advises that a commercial sand and gravel business is now being done from Rock Island Sand Pit Spur, approximately one and one-half miles west of Fairbury. The tariffs do not contain reference to this sand pit and the operator thereof is at the disadvantage of having to use the gen - eral rule of application of the distance to the station beyond, namely. Fairbury on westbound shipments and Gladstone on eastbound ship - ments. It is desired to include Rock Island Sand Pit Spur on the publication of rates from Fairbury and its neighborhood in the same items containing reference to two other similar industries. The operator of Rock Island Sand Pit Spur is entitled to rates approved by us for the miner of sand located immediately adjacent. Among the items amended is 4077 of Rock Island tariff 25000-6 which relates to blanket rates from pits in the neighborhood of Fair - bury to Lincoln. Much complaint has been made with regard to this departure from the general tariff provisions.

For Madison County Farmers Telephone company, O. A. Sunder- man, director. For St. Bernard Telephone company, Henry Schaecher, secretary. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: The Madison Telephone company has completed negotiations for the purchase of the stock of the Madison County Farmers Telephone </seg>
            <seg id="p441">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 441 company, and desires to consolidate the property of the latter with its own system. It has made application for authority to effect the consolidation and to issue $23,130 of stock. Under the terms of the agreement to purchase, the Madison Telephone company is to acquire all of the outstanding stock of the Farmers company, $12,250 in amount. It proposes to make payment by issuing, its own preferred stock in an equal amount. The property of the Madison County Farmers Telephone com - pany lies partly in the city of Madison and partly in the country to the west thereof. Under an agreement entered into several years ago with applicant company, the territory was divided, the line of the Union Pacific Railroad, which runs north and south through Madison, being used as a dividing line. All of the territory west of that line and tributary to Madison was to be served by the Farmers company, the territory east to be served by applicant. In 1915, an arrangement was made whereby the Farmers company abandoned its switchboard, and its lines were carried to the board of applicant. Since that date, therefore, the service has been unified and the entire switching operations have been performed by applicant company. What little duplication of property existed has been eliminated as a result of the joint switching arrangement, so that in the consolidation as proposed there will be no duplicate property involved. The rates are the same for both companies, so that no change is necessary. For many years the Farmers company has had an interchange of service with a small independent company with headquarters at St. Bernard. It has also had a similar exchange of service with a company at Battle Creek. In taking over the property of the Farmers company, applicant requested authority to discontinue this so-called free service and substitute therefor a message charge. Representa - tives of the St. Bernard company were present to mildly protest against the elimination of the free service. There would appear to be no very good reason for such an exchange of service, since the St. Bernard exchange is located in Platte county. While a number of its farm lines enter Madison county, there would not appear to be a sufficient community of interest as between St. Bernard and Madison to justify a free interchange. There were no protestants from Battle Creek. The free service has been furnished over trunk lines and it is proposed to continue to use these lines for the substitute toll service. Following the filing of the application for authority to con - solidate, the engineering department of this Commission made a valuation of the property of the Madison County Farmers Telephone company. The department found the original construction cost of the property to be $30,526.84 and the depreciated original cost $17, - 628.50. These figures cover only the valuation of the physical prop- </seg>
            <seg id="p442">442 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT erties and include nothing for intangibles. As indicated, the property is in a low condition of maintenance, the percentage being 58. This means that considerable reconstruction work will be required in the near future if adequate service is to be rendered. It is the purpose of the purchasers to expend at least $5,000 in rehabilitating the property acquired. This is an estimate only, and in the opinion of applicant may be too low. It is manifest that the price being paid for the property is not unreasonable. The consolidation of the two prop - erties should result in better service, since a centralized management within the natural service zone of Madison and vicinity, will have ad - vantages over divided operation. There is no opposition to the E posed consolidation. In our opinion, the public interest will be red by a merger of the two properties, and the same should be Applicant asks for the approval of the $23,130 of stock, $20,000 I this to be preferred stock and the remaining $3,130 to be common. this amount $12,250 will be used in the purchase of the property of i Farmers company. The proceeds from at least $5,000 will be id in the reconstruction of the property acquired. The remainder the preferred stock and the $3,130 of common stock will be issued linst additions and betterments to the property made during the it two years. The odd amount of common stock, $3,130, is sasioned by the fact that the company is authorized to issue $50,000 common stock and it now has outstanding $46,870. It desires to issue the full amount of its authorization. If the amount asked for is approved, the company would have outstanding $70,000 of stock, $50,000 of common and $20,000 of preferred. The property of the company, including that to be acquired in this consolidation, has all been valued at one time or another by the engineering department of this Commission. In 1922, for purposes of a stock issue, a valuation of the then Madison Telephone company was made, the original con - struction cost being $40,990.26, and the depreciated original con - struction cost being $26,901.39. Since that date the company has purchased the property of the Tilden Telephone company, paying $18,000 therefor. In 1919, the Commission made a valuation of that property for rate purposes and found an original construction of $24,335.07 and a depreciated original cost of $16,155.39. At the time of the purchase of the Tilden property by applicant, the Com - mission found that because of additions and betterments and rather heavy expenditures for replacements, the depreciated value of the property had been increased to at least $20,000. On the basis of these valuations the present or depreciated value of the consolidated prop - erties would be approximately $65,000. This figure includes nothing for working capital, and it should be borne in mind that it is pre - dicated on the original cost of the properties and does not take into account any increment due to increased price levels. With the inclusion </seg>
            <seg id="p443">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 443 ] of the property of the Farmers company the net assets of applicant will aggregate over $87,000. It would appear, therefore, that the roposed issue of securities Is well Justified from the standpoint of the property that will be behind the outstanding issues. We are of the opinion therefore, that the application as prayed for should be approved. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the purchase by the Madison Telephone company of all of the outstanding stock of the Madison County Farmers Telephone company be, and the same hereby is, approved, and the consolidation of the physical properties under one ownership and management, with the purpose of furnishing a unified service is likewise approved.

SUPPLEMENTAL FINDING AND ORDER TAYLOR, Commissioner: Through a misunderstanding of the facts, the original order in this case provided that the Madison Telephone company should pur - chase the stock of the Madison County Farmers Telephone company and that upon the acquirement of the same the Farmers company should be dissolved and the stock cancelled. The Madison Telephone company is not buying the stock of the other company, rather it pur - chases only the physical property.

As evidence of the necessity of this service it is pointed out r during a five- weeks period of this year only $4.12 were earned passenger traffic. A local passenger train each way each day serves the territory affected and another passenger train serves additionally Endicott, Thompson, Chester and Superior. It is stated that the train can be operated with one less trainman if it does not carry passengers. The average wages of the extra train - man are given as $208.69. During the period studied this expense is offset by revenue of $4.12. We need not here pass upon the necessity of the extra trainman for other duties on this train. It is, however, evident that there is no necessity to continue to carry pas - sengers on this way freight. The authority to discontinue will be granted.

The proposed changes can be made with a minimum of discomfort to the traveling public. It may be some difficulties will be apparent upon a try-out of the proposed service not now visible, and that further changes will be necessary to meet those difficulties.

Appearances For the applicant, M. A. Rawlings, rate clerk, general freight office, Kansas City. For the Missouri Pacific Railroad company, E. V. Korus, chief clerk, division freight agent, Lincoln. For the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company, J. B. Driggs, assistant general freight agent, Omaha. For the respondents, J. C. Hartigan, attorney; Henry DuVal, and R. B.

Ehern - berger, for Platte Valley Sand &amp; Gravel company, Schuyler; W. S. Whitten, secretary, for Lincoln Chamber of Commerce. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman Applicant herein desires to establish a rate of four cents per cwt. on sand and gravel from pits closely adjacent to the city of Fairbury to Lincoln, a distance of approximately 58 miles. The present rate is three cents per hundred pounds. Hearing was held at the offices of the Commission on November 10. At that hearing the range of testimony permitted was wide, and covered not only the rate affected in the application, but the entire sand and gravel scale of Nebraska. This wide range of testimony was permitted because, involved in the application, was the question of enforced extension of the initial zone carrying the minimum rate beyond 50 miles, its present distance limits. The rate of three cents from the pits near Fairbury was estab - lished on Formal Complaint 521, orders dated February 20, 1925, and March 2, 1925. The complaint in that case asked for the estab - lishment of a three-cent rate to Lincoln from so-called Fairbury pits where the rate was four cents. No hearing was held because the Rock Island volunteered to establish the rate. In the instant application, authority is requested to cancel the lower rate and to reestablish the four-cent rate applicable under the general Nebraska sand and gravel scale. </seg>
            <seg id="p453">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 453 In general, the testimony emphasized on the part of miners of sand located more than 50 miles from Lincoln, or Omaha, or both, the necessity as a competitive matter, of the extension of the initial zone beyond 50 miles, with particular emphasis upon the market for so-called by-product consisting of the screenings secured in the prep - aration of road gravel. It was alleged with emphasis that unless there is an equality of rate to these major markets for the by-product parti - cularly, those miners who operate under an adverse rate have a handicap difficult to overcome. Miners of sand adjacent to Fairbury opposed the application be - cause it would renew the handicap in reaching the Lincoln market. Some more distant miners on other railroads opposed the application because of their contention that the entire sand and gravel scale should be revised by extending the initial zone. There may be a distinct difference between approval by this Commission of a rate proffered by a carrier and the enforcement of the same rate over the protest of the carrier. We have twice passed on the identical contentions in this case, although involving different railroads. In Formal Complaint 508 (17 N. S. R. C. 207-210) the Moffltt Sand and Gravel company with a pit at Morse Bluffs on the C. &amp; N. W. Railway, more than 50 miles from Omaha, desired a three-cent rate to that market. Its existing rate was four cents measured by the general sand and gravel scale of the state. The reason for the com - plaint was identical with the testimony offered in the application here under consideration. The Commission found that as a matter of fact there are two scales of sand and gravel rates in the state, the one to Omaha and Lincoln destination and directly intermediate points — the other % cent per cwt. higher, applicable on shipments between other points, and that it was an erroneous position on the part of the carriers that specific rates to the two markets had been provided only for a selected list of sand and gravel pits. The order directed the establishment from Morse Bluff of the scale applicable to Lincoln and Omaha upon the actual mileage from that pit. In Formal Complaint 513 (17 N. S. R. C. 210-217) the Platte Valley Gravel company of Schuyler, sought a rate of three cents to Omaha and to Lincoln, a distance more than 50 miles to each destina - tion. We applied the principle laid down in the Moffitt case and di - rected the carrier to establish rates in conformity with that principle. The only difference between the situations developed in the two complaints outlined above and that developed in testimony on this application, is that the carrier has had in existence, a lower rate to </seg>
            <seg id="p454">454 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Lincoln than required by us in the two complaints Nos. 508 and SI 3. The precedence there established should govern in this case. The carrier is asking for a rate of four cents per cwt. from the pits adjacent to Fairbury to Lincoln. This rate is bottomed upon assumptions which we condemned in Formal Complaints 508 and 513. The rule there laid down would warrant a rate of 3% cents from the three pits adjacent to Fairbury to Lincoln. It follows that we must deny the application. The carrier may at its option file another application in conformity with the findings here stated. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the application of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company to publish rate of four cents per cwt. on sand and gravel from pits located on its trackage closely adjacent to Fairbury, to destination at Lincoln, be, and it hereby is denied.

OPINION AND ORDER TAYLOR, Commissioner: The Farmers Independent Telephone company of Red Cloud, recently purchased certain of the exchange property of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company at that place and is consolidating the </seg>
            <seg id="p455">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 455 same with that of its own, the purpose being to render a unified service, the Lincoln company retiring from the local field. Approval of the purchase and consolidation was granted by this Commission in Application No. 5994, (18 N. S. R. C.) The task of amalgamating the two plants is in progress but has been delayed by the failure to re - ceive necessary new equipment. Most of this is now at hand, how - ever, and it is expected that the "cut-over" can be effected by January 1st next. At the time of the hearing on consolidation applicant made no request for a rate readjustment for the reason that the effect on revenues and expenses could not be definitely anticipated. Develop - ments have progressed to the point, however, where a reliable fore - cast can now be made and the company has applied for authority to modify its schedules so as to meet the new conditions. The schedule as applied for, slightly modified at time of hearing is as follows: Monthly Residence, party line (not to exceed 4) 1.75 1.50 Business, extension sets 1.00 Residence, extension sets 50 Extension bells 25 Extension gongs (6") 50 Residence, farm, party line, metallic .... 1.75 1.50 (Wall set) (Payable quarterly in advance) Business, farm 2.25 2.00 (Payable quarterly in advance) Desk sets on farm lines .25 per mo. additional Semi-annual Residence, farm, switching 4.00 3.00 (With minimum of 6 subscribers per line.

            <seg id="p456">456 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT The difference between the gross and net rates on town subscribers shall be allowed for payment at the company's office on or before the 15th of the cur - rent month, and for farm subscribers if paid during the first month of the quarter and for switching subscribers, if paid by lines, during June and De - cember of the semi-yearly period. Hearing on the application was had at Red Cloud on Thursday, December 10, 1925. Notice of the pending application and the date and place of hearing was given to the public through local newspapers. No protestants appeared. Representatives of the company submitted extensive statements covering property accounts, revenues, expenses, Kber of subscribers following consolidation and other material •mation. It appears unnecessary to review these in detail. Three balance sheets are presented, one for December 31, 1924, one for October 31, 1925, the first month following the purchase of the Lincoln property, and a third which is an estimate of the ac - counts after consolidation is effected. The total fixed investment as of December 31, 1924, was $31,077.83. The Lincoln property was written on the books on the basis of the valuation made by the engineering department of the Commission for the purpose of the Klidation proceedings, this figure, on the basis of original cost, $26,545.31. This resulted in a total gross fixed investment on October 31, 1925, of $57,486.88. Expenditures for new equipment necessary for consolidation, most of which have already been realized and the detail of which is submitted, will aggregate between $6,000 and $7,000. In the estimated balance sheet, therefore, the fixed in - vestment is placed at $64,000. This may vary a few hundred dollars, dependent upon the net value of property displaced and finally sold. Consolidation will result in the elimination of 126 duplicate tele - phones. Revenue from these telephones at the present rates would amount to approximately $225 per month, or $2700 per year. The consolidated revenue from the two plants for the month of October, including rentals from duplicate telephones, was $1259.40. Eliminat - ing the revenue from duplicates, the company would have, under Residence, installation charge — in- strument in place 3usiness, installation charge — instru- ment not in place Business, installation charge — instru- ment in place nside more: Moving instrument within same room Moving instrument from one room to another remporary disconnect 1.00 2.50 1.00 1.00 1.50 One-half rat </seg>
            <seg id="p457">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 457 present rates, a monthly revenue of approximately $1,034 or about $12,400 per year. On the basis of 544 telephones in service after consolidation, applicant estimates its gross receipts from all sources under the new rates at $1,335 per month or $16,020 per year. This would represent a gross increase of about $3600 per year, or a net increase, making allowance for loss of revenue from duplicates, of about $900. It is expected that there will be an increase in toll traffic because the subscribers of the Farmers Company have not had toll connections for two or three years. While the Lincoln company will furnish the toll service, applicant will receive the usual terminating and originating commission, so that its revenues from this source will increase $15 to $25 per month. The total operating expenses of the two properties for the month of October were $1,021.86, exclusive of taxes. This figure does not include -the salaries of the manager and lineman of the Lincoln com - pany, since their services have been dispensed with. The two re - ceived $235 per month. Through error, rent of $20 for the building which the Lincoln company occupied, is also omitted. These items should be added if comparison is to be made with the anticipated expenses after consolidation. The estimate of total expenses follow - ing consolidation is $1,050 per month, exclusive of taxes. Eight operators are now employed by both exchanges. It is hoped to reduce this number to seven and possibly to six, although the demands of the traffic will necessarily govern that. The principal increase in expenses over those experienced by applicant occurs in the allowance for maintenance and depreciation, due to the increase in property, and in wages of operators. Taxes will also be increased. Deducting the estimated monthly expenses of $1,050 from the esti - mated monthly revenues of $1,335 leaves an operating income of $285. From this should be deducted at least $43 for taxes. The company has a debt of $10,000. Interest on this will be about $60 per month. There would thus be available for dividends about $185 per month or $2,220 per year. The company has outstanding at the present time $37,500 of stock. This net income would be equivalent, therefore, to less than six per cent on this stock. The company hopes to be able to pay an annual dividend of 8 per cent on outstanding stock but to do this must rely on increased business and further economies of operation. It is manifest that the rates as applied for will not produce an excessive return. To the 126 patrons who have maintained duplicate telephones there will be a substantial reduction in charges with an attendant improvement of service. For example, the individual business rate for each company is now $2.50 per month. The proposed rate will be $3.75 per month, net, a reduction of $1.25. Applicant furnishes switching service to a large number of farmers who own their lines and telephones. The base rate of 50c </seg>
            <seg id="p458">458 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT per month will not be changed, but it was desired to apply a gross rate of 75c per month, 25c to be deducted if payment was made by the tenth of each month. Applicant has been collecting from its switch- ing patrons six months in advance and at the hearing the applica- tion was modified so as to continue this practice, but to apply a gross rate of $4.00, with a discount of $1.00 if payment is made within the first month of the period. Under the practice of the company the farmers have been billed on December 1st and June 1st. The new rule with reference to the discount, therefore, will not be applicable until June 1, 1926. In applying for rates for extra mileage on private or two-party service outside the city service zone, the company fixed the city limits as the boundary of the base rate area. It develops, however, that there are several additions outside the city limits of Red Cloud where very considerable service is already being rendered. It is not desired to charge other than the regular zone rates to the patrons in such additions. The application is amended, therefore, to provide that the mileage rates will apply "outside the base rate area," and the company will file with the Commission a map clearly defining this zone. No change should be made in these rates until such map is filed. The remainder of the application covers accessorial service of various kinds. Substantially it is in keeping with charges and rules hitherto approved by the Commission. We note, however, that the charges for installation of telephone instruments are based on the schedule for exchanges having 600 to 1000 subscribers. Including the switched farmers the consolidated exchange will serve upwards of 900 patrons. The farmers, however, handle their own mainten- ance and installation. Without the switched lines the company will have 544 subscribers. We are of the opinion, therefore, that the schedule of charges for installations applicable to exchanges of less than 600 subscribers should be approved. These are as follows: Residence installation charge — instrument not in place $ 1.50 Residence installation charge — instrument in place 1.00 Business installation charge — instrument not in place 2.00 Business installation charge — instrument in place 1.00 ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Farmers Independent Telephone company of Red Cloud, be, and the same hereby is, author- ised to charge and collect the following schedule of rates and charges for exchange service: Monthly Gross Net Business, individual line $ 4.00 $ 3.75 Business, party line 3.50 3.25 </seg>

Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 6089 In the Matter of the Application of the Minnesota Electric Distributing Company for Validation of Certain Securities Issues. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman The Minnesota Electric Distributing company is a Minnesota corporation, owning and operating electric • light and power plants located in the states of Nebraska, Iowa and Minnesota. Effective July, 1923, the Nebraska statute was amended to apply to all corporations owning and operating public utility properties in the state of Nebraska, where the previous provision had applied only to corporations organized under the laws of the state of Nebraska. On the advice of counsel, this applicant proceeded upon the assumption that the law did not apply to it and during the period December 31, 1922, to July 31, 1925, it issued and sold first mortgage seven per cent gold bonds of various series, in amount $421,500 and preferred stocks of classes A, B and C in amount $488,600. It now asks that the Nebraska Commission under the laws of this state, issue an order validating these unauthorized securities. The statute is silent as to the power of the Commission to make legal outstanding stock which has been issued without conforming to Nebraska law. It has, however, been the policy of the Commis - sion to validate unauthorized issues where in its judgment it would have approved the issues, had application been presented in timely manner. On July 31, 1925, the company had outstanding, securities with which the Nebraska statute is interested, as follows: ieven per cent first mortgage bonds $ lommon stock •referred stock, Class A 'referred stock, class B 'referred stock, class C i 977,500 250,000 100,000 100,000 377,900 </seg>
            <seg id="p461">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 461 The common stock was all issued and outstanding before the Nebraska law was amended to affect applicant. With it we are, there - fore, not concerned. The class A preferred stock was all issued prior to December 31, 1922, except $10,700. The class B preferred stock which participates with the common stock up to 12 per cent per annum, was all sold after December 31, 1922. Of the total, $70,000 was approved by the securities commission of the state of Minnesota in March 1924. It was sold at a gross price of $125 per $100 share. The class C preferred stock was all issued after December 31, 1922. In fact, was all issued during the year 1925. This stock bears seven per cent cumulative dividends. Under the Minnesota law the securi - ties commission approved the sale within that state of $295,300. The remainder which has been issued and sold is in the possession of the W. B. Foshay company. The price at which this stock was sold to the public was $100 per $100 share. Applicant realized that amount, less rather liberal commissions. The bonds bear interest at seven per cent and are all protected by one blanket mortgage. They are issued in various series. Of the total amount outstanding, we are interested in the amount $421,500. The issue and sale within the state of Wisconsin of $700,000 of these bonds was approved by the securities department of the Wisconsin Railroad Commission in July, 1924, and $350,000 of the bonds were approved by the Minnesota Securities Commission in April, 1924. The approval in the two states apparently referred to the same bonds. Those departments were interested in sales to the public as opposed to the Nebraska statute which is interested in the issue. The company's plant account increased during the period under review in amount $999,393, which is slightly more than the total of the issues. The discount on bonds is carried in suspense account on the company's books and is being amortized ratably as is regularly required by the Nebraska Commission. The discounts on the stock sold in amount $4 8 8,600 have not been carried in the accounts as stock discount and have apparently been offset by debits to plant. This practice has been condemned by this Commission. The company has now pending with the Commission, an applica - tion for the issue of considerable blocks of class C preferred stock, on account of acquisition of rather extensive additional properties. Con - sideration of accounting practices may well be deferred until the hearing on that application. The evidence warrants our approval of the issues above specifically referred to and we find that such issues were reasonably necessary for corporate purposes.

OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman Applicant desires to make certain changes, advantageous to sub - scribers, at its exchanges at Boelus, Cushing, Dannebrog, Elba, Farwell, Grand Island, St. Libory and St. Paul, which changes are set forth in detail in exhibits A to K inclusive, attached to the application. In general the changes are as follows At Boelus, service connection companies are offered at a gross rate of $7.60 per year, additional exchanges of Dannebrog, Farwell and St. Paul. Heretofore the rate was $6.50 gross for the exchanges of Boelus and Cotesfleld, and $9.50 gross for the seven exchanges in the zone. At Cushing, company rural subscribers are offered free connec - tions with Elba and St. Paul exchanges, without an increase in rate.

Heretofore, these exchanges were available at a rate 25 cents higher than here proposed. Service connection companies are offered the same exten - sion of service for $7.60 gross per annum, where before, the additional exchanges were only available at a rate of $9.50 gross per annum. At Elba, rural subscribers are offered without increase in rate, service to the exchanges of St. Paul, Farwell and Cushing, which heretofore were available only at a rate 25 cents per month higher. Service connection companies are given extended service to the above exchanges at a gross rate of $7.60 per annum, where heretofore this extended service was only available at a gross rate of $9.50 per annum. At Farwell, rural subscribers are offered without increase in rate, service to the exchanges of Boelus, Dannebrog, Elba and St. Paul. Service connection companies are to be given no extension of service unless at the higher rate for zone service. At Grand Island, rural subscribers are offered free service to subscribers on the St. Libory exchange, without increase in rate over the rate heretofore charged for Grand Island service alone. At St. Libory, rural subscribers are given free connections with subscribers on the Grand Island exchange, without increase in rate. Heretofore this service was available only at a rate 25 cents per month higher. At St. Paul, rural subscribers ar« given without increase in rate, connection with subscribers at Cushr».g, Dannebrog, Elba and Farwell, where heretofore this service was only available at a rate 25 cents per month higher.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 6105 In the Matter of the Application of the Hamilton County Farmers Telephone Association for Authority to Continue Its Present Rates. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman Applicant operates exchanges at Aurora, Doniphan, Giltner, Hamp - ton, Hordville, Marquette, Phillips, Stockham and Trumbull. Its rates on all these exchanges were increased 25 cents per month per station in the early part of 1920, on a temporary basis, and have been ex - tended annually since then. On December 31, 1924, we authorized a one year extension, at a reduction of ten cents per month on all main classifications of service, from the rates that had been in effect during the preceding five years. Applicant has since acquired some additional properties and asks that it be authorized to increase the reserve for maintenance and depreciation from $18,000 per annum to $19,800. Its net earnings for ten months of 1924 were $3,242. The company does not operate on a profit basis and its rates are adjusted to that corporate condition. The rates at present are 15 cents per month higher on all main classifications than the pre-war rates. It does not appear advisable at this time to require further decreases. The rates authorized December 31, 1924, were to remain in effect until specifically modified. No order extending the existing rates is necessary.

Considering the purchase prices paid which have been presented in former applications, this appears to be a very liberal and perhaps misleading policy of accounting. We find the sale of the bonds, approval of which is requested, reasonable, and a necessary procedure in the development of the property. We will however, place certain restrictions as a condition of the order of approval, upon the method of handling the additional properties in the plant account. The sale price of the bonds does not appear of record. The mar - ket warrants a price above 90. We will place the minimum sale price at 90 but will expect the bonds to have been sold at something better than that figure.

These rates were, because of administrative reasons, listed to become effective January 1, 1926. At 50 of these exchanges, it is now desired to amend the service station rate for one exchange, from $5.50 per annum net, to $5.25 per annum net, and at 20 exchanges, to reduce the zone switching rates 25 cents per annum, with certain exceptions where the reduction is greater. Discount provisions are to remain the same as heretofore. It is desired to publish the rates for collection annually in advance.

Byrne, Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., Omaha. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: Subsequent to the issuance of the order requiring common carrier bus lines to file surety bonds covering their liability to passengers, question arose as to what form of bond should be authorized. Certain of the companies writing casualty insurance called attention to the fact that liability under a surety bond might terminate with the first claim made against it whereas with the continuous operation of the bus a series of accidents might occur and the passengers be with - out protection. Under a casualty insurance policy, the liability of the insurance company continued throughout the life of the policy, which in practically all cases is for a period of a year. Some complaint was heard from bus operators to the effect that the cost of the bonds or insurance was excessive. Also the Commission found that in most of the bonds or policies filed the provisions for service of notice and for imposing direct liability to passengers were absent or ambiguous. The terms likewise raised a doubt as to joint liability of the common carrier and the insurance company. The Commission was without necessary information to prescribe the terms and conditions of a bond </seg>
            <seg id="p471">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 471 and in the absence of such information called a conference of bus operators and representatives of bond and casualty insurance com - panies. This conference was held at the offices of the Commission on December 12, 1924. The whole subject was thoroughly reviewed and the relative merits and demerits of bonds and insurance policies discussed. The point made that bonds are terminable when the amount for which they are given is exhausted was conceded by all as being a fundamental weakness. Common carrier busses operate daily. Con - sequently, there is a daily risk. The passenger is not adequately pro - tected if the insurance or bond has been exhaused by previous claims. It is unnecessary here to enter upon a discussion of the technical dif - ferences between a bond and an insurance policy. It was made clear that there are such differences and it was quite generally agreed that a form of insurance policy providing for a continuous liability should be worked out. To that end a committee of three was appointed by the Commission, consisting of a representative each of the bond - ing companies, casualty insurance companies, and the bus operators. This committee was directed to formulate a document that would meet the requirements. Within a few weeks it submitted a repdrt which was given careful consideration by the attorney general's depart - ment and a form was finally approved. By that time, however, the legislature had convened and several measures had been introduced for the purpose of further regulating busses and trucks. The Com - mission thought it advisable to withhold action in the matter until it was determined whether any legislation would be enacted. No such legislation was enacted. We are of the opinion that we should now proceed further in the matter and adopt a form of bond or policy that will adequately protect the public riding upon busses. After having given careful consideration to the form agreed upon by the committee and approved by the state's legal department, we are of the opinion it should be approved and that all companies operat - ing busses as common carriers in the state of Nebraska should be required to use the form herein prescribed. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that in complying with the terms and conditions of the Commission's original order in Resolution No. 86 that no person, firm or corporation operating motor vehicles over a fixed route and upon a regular schedule along or upon any public street or highway in this state for the carriage of passengers for hire (except as they may be operated in connection with an existing electric railway) shall be permitted to commence such operation or to con - tinue the same unless he shall file with this Commission an insurance policy containing a condition in words and terms as follows: </seg>

OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: The attention of the Commission has been directed to the fact that our original order entered in this resolution provided that the minimum weight on shipments of calves in single deck on Nebraska intrastate traffic, should be 18,600 pounds. While the original order does provide for this minimum weight on all traffic, intrastate, it was not the intention of the Commission to set up a minimum weight on shipments of calves when moving between other points than from points in Nebraska to the terminal markets. This matter was taken up with Mr. C. B. Steward, secretary of the Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation, and Mr. A. F. Stryker, secretary-traffic manager of the Omaha Live Stock Exchange, and their replies indicate that they have no objection to the issuing of a supplemental order to our original </seg>
            <seg id="p476">476 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL. REPORT order providing that the minimum weight of 18,600 pounds on calves should apply only on movements to the terminal markets. In view of the fact that it was never the intention of the Com - mission to establish this minimum weight on shipments of calves other than to the terminal markets, the Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the original order should be corrected to read that the minimum weight on shipments of calves in single deck cars should apply only on such shipments moving from Nebraska points to the terminal markets, and should not apply as a general provision on all intrastate movements.

The suit was brought by the receiver of the railroad company to pre - vent the enforcement of the Nebraska two-cent fare law. The court approved the report of the special master holding that the two-cent fare law was confiscatory. Owing to increase in fares beyond the two-cent limit by order of the Director General of Railroads during federal control and to the further increase fixed by the Interstate Commerce Commission in ex parte 74, it was deemed, by this Com - mission, to be inadvisable to appeal.

Randall, Individually and as Persons Constituting the State Railway Commission, Defendants. Munger, D. J. </seg>
            <seg id="p491">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 491 The Northwestern Bell Telephone company, the plaintiff herein, made an application to the Nebraska State Railway Commission for leave to increase rates charged for intrastate service to its patrons. After extended hearings, an order was made allowing a portion of the increases and denying others and reducing some rates which were being charged. The plaintiff began this suit, seeking to enjoin the enforcement of the order of the Railway Commission and seeking to enjoin the defendants from interfering with its charging rates suffici - ent to yield it a return of eight per cent on its property used in such service. The case was referred to a special master and to the extended report which he has made exceptions have been filed. The case has been submitted for final hearing upon this report and the exceptions thereto. The defendants claim that the case should not be decided upon the facts as to the rates, because the plaintiff is given the right by Sec. 5491 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska (1922), to appeal from the findings and order of the Railway Commission to the supreme court of Nebraska. The nature of the appeal granted by this section of the statutes was considered by the supreme court of Nebraska in Hooper Telephone Co. v. Nebraska Telephone Co., 96 Nebr. 245, 147 N. W. 674, and it was held that that court in the hearing of an application under this section would exercise only judicial powers. The right to resort to that court does not exclude the right to review the decision of the Railway Commission by a suit of the nature of this one in this court. Monroe Gaslight &amp; Fuel Co. v. Michigan Public Utilities Commission, 292 Fed. 139; Pacific Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. v. (usluiian, 292 Fed. 930. It is also claimed that the case as now presented, was not so presented to the Railway Commission, and there - fore that this court may not enter a decree for the plaintiff. Section 5520 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska (1922) hereinafter quoted, requires an application for a change of rates by a common carrier to be first presented to the Railway Commission and permission to be obtained therefor before any change is made. It is not claimed that an application was not made, but that some features of the evidence now presented were not presented at the hearing before the Railway Commission. The variance between the cases presented in the two hearings is not deemed to be material. At the hearing there was a stipulation as to values of the plain - tiff's property, which has been accepted by the parties as eliminating the question of the proper valuation, as a base on which rates are to be computed, except as to the value of machinery used for switch - ing in the Omaha office of the plaintiff. The application of the plaintiff was for an increase in both toll and exchange rates. The Railway Commission granted substantially what was asked in the in - crease of toll rates, and this controversy is now chiefly concerned with the question of the exchange rates of the plaintiff. As to these rates, the extended and instructive briefs and arguments have covered many topics, but the defendants' principal exceptions are conceded to relate </seg>
            <seg id="p492">492 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT to the master's findings on five different subjects. The first is the Eng that the amount of four and one-half per cent of the gross aue of the plaintiff paid annually by the plaintiff to the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph company, in pursuance of a written contract, is a proper item of the plaintiff's expenses. The defendants have criticized this payment because the close relationship between the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph company and the plaintiff may over - burden the plaintiff with an undue expense account for the benefit of the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph company. This subject and this danger have been considered in many other cases and it has been held that such a relationship between the two companies may require a close scrutiny of the intercorporate dealings. But the final question in a case of this nature is not the possibility of overreaching, nor the amount of scrutiny required, but whether in view of the facts, the expense item is or is not a proper one. That the American Tele - phone &amp; Telegraph company furnishes services and property to the plaintiff under this contract is not disputed nor is there any real dis - pute that they are of substantial value. The presumption is that this contract was entered into in good faith and in the exercise of a proper discretion by the officers of both corporations. To overcome this presumption it was incumbent on the defendants to show that the con - tract was not made in the exercise of a proper discretion by the plaintiff's officers. If it imposed an unreasonable charge upon the plaintiff for the services and property to be furnished, that would be a strong circumstance to show that the amount paid was not paid as the result of the honest judgment of the plaintiff's officers, but if the amount was fair and reasonable, it could not be omitted as a proper item of expense, simply because it was made to a corporation which might have dominated the action of the plaintiff's officers. Houston t. Southwestern Tel. Co., 259 U. S. 318; S. W. Tel. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Com., 262 U. S. 276; Indiana Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Com. «Fed. 190; State v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., 115 Kas. ,223 Pac. 771; Southern Bell T. &amp; T. Co. v. Railroad Commission - 299 Fed. 615; Chespeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Co. v. Whitman, 3 Fed. (2d) 938. There was no substantial evidence offered on be - half of the defendants upon the question of the unreasonableness of this charge of four and one-half per cent of the gross annual earn - ings of the plaintiff. On behalf of the plaintiff there was much testi - mony to support the rate of charge as less than the reasonable value for the services and property furnished under the contract. In this condition of the record, the defendants' exceptions to the master's allowance of this item cannot be sustained. The second question presented by the defendants is an allowance, aa a part of the valuation of the plaintiff's plant, of the value of the machine switching equipment used in the plaintiff's office at Omaha. The defendants' claim is that this machine switching is a new process, </seg>
            <seg id="p493">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 493 not fully proved, and their exception urges that a part of the cost of it should be deducted and that the expense of adapting it to the Omaha exchange property should be borne by the American Telegraph &amp; Telephone company. No basis is given for any division of this item. It appears that this method of switching has passed the purely ex - perimental period, has commended itself to telephone engineers, and while the Omaha office is one of the first to attempt a trial of it on a large scale, it operates satisfactorily. The plaintiff is entitled to some latitude in adopting new methods, and if the use of this equip - ment is a reasonable exercise of judgment by the plaintiff's officers, and not obviously wasteful, the item cannot be disallowed. S. W. Tel. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Com., 262 U. S. 276; Consolidated Gas Co. of New York v. Lewton, 267 Fed. 231. The defendants except to the master's allowance for charges for depreciation. The methods of arriving at a proper charge for de - preciation are discussed, and many abstract questions of law relating to this vexed subject are argued, but the amount to be allowed in this case is chiefly a question of fact. Upon that issue there was offered by both of the parties, the opinion of expert accountants and engineers. These witnesses have detailed the methods by which they arrived at an allowance. The master's findings are supported by testimony and the exceptions are quite general. It is impossible to overthrow these findings for the very general criticisms levelled at them by the defendants. The claim seems to be that the methods of plaintiff's witnesses were so foreign to the proper methods, that all of the testimony on behalf of the plaintiff on this subject, or at least as to the amount of depreciation, should be disregarded. While some of the criticisms seem to have some basis not enough error is shown to invalidate the findings of fact on this subject. Nor is it necessary in this case to review various legal theories presented as to the elements of a depreciation account and the proper uses of a fund realized from a depreciation account. The defendants claim that the master erred in allowing certain operating expenses of the plaintiff which the defendants claim to be excessive. The expenses that are questioned relate to the number of employees and to the wages and salaries paid to them. A witness of the defendants, by means of a series of studies of the number of employees and of the amount of wages paid by some other telephone companies, as compared to the number of employees of the plaintiff and to the wages paid to them, deduces the conclusion that a large saving could be effected by the plaintiff. The evidence shows that very many differences in conditions exist between the services re - quired of the employees of the several companies, and these differences are so great that one may not be used as a standard for the other. The officers of the plaintiff must be allowed to exercise business judg- </seg>
            <seg id="p494">494 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT merit in deciding what employees are necessary to the conduct of the business and what is a reasonable compensation for them. There is no evidence of any abuse of discretion in these matters. S. W. Tel. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Com., 262 U. S. 27 6; Consolidated Gas Co. of New York v. I-owton, 267 Fed. 231; Harvre Oe Grace &amp; Perry ville Bridge Co. v. Towers, 132 Md. 16, 103 Atl. 319. The master found that the plaintiff was entitled to a rate of return of seven and one-half per cent on the value of its property (plus a working capital) used in rendering telephone service in Ne - braska. The defendants except to this finding, because seven per cent is an ample return. The plaintiff excepts because the master should have found a rate of return of eight per cent. Upon the basis of the stipulated value of the plaintiff's property devoted to the service in question, and the further bases of the revenues and expenses as found by the master and herein approved, it is undisputed that the net return to the plaintiff on the property involved is, and will prob - ably continue to be, less than five and one-half per cent per annum, and that, if the increases asked for by the plaintiff had been granted by the State Railway Commission, the rate of return would have £bably been less than six and one- half per cent. In view of these :s, it does not seem necessary to determine whether or not seven and one-half per cent as a rate of return is confiscatory. The rates prescribed by the Commission cause a rate of return much lower than the rate the master commends, a rate below that which the answer of the defendants admits is a fair rate, and one which, in the light of .the decisions, and of the testimony in this case, must be regarded as unreasonable and confiscatory. It results, from what has been said, that a decree must be entered enjoining the enforcement of the order of the State Railway Commis - sion. The plaintiff has asked that the decree also enjoin the defend - ants from interfering with the' plaintiff's charging such rates for telephone service rendered by it in the state of Nebraska, as will produce to plaintiff a return of approximately eight per cent on the value of its property used in rendering such service. The master has made a recommendation of a decree allowing the plaintiff to charge rates free from molestation by the defendants, which will allow plaintiff a rate of return on its property of seven and one-half per cent. The making of rates is a legislative and not a judicial act. (Reagan t. Farmers' Loan and Trust Co., 154 U. S. 362; Newton v. Consoli - dated Gas Co., 258 U. S. 165; City of Minneapolis v. Rand, 285 Fed. 818; City of Dos Moines v. Des Moines Gas Co., 264 Fed. 506; 2 Elliott on R. R. (2nd Ed.) 691; 10 Corp. Jur. 432). A decree which should authorize the rates to be charged in the future would be clearly the exercise of legislative power and not a decision upon the validity of a rate which has been prescribed or adopted. The rates </seg>

It is hereby declared to be unlawful for any railway company or common carrier to change any rate, schedule or classification until application has been made to the railway commission and permission had for that purpose. Any railway company or common carrier violating this provision shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof shall be fined in any sum not exceeding ten thousand dollars. (1907 p. 339; Ann. 10663; Comp. 4727n; R. S. 1913, 6158.)" The Court may not in the face of this statute, grant the right to the plaintiff to change its rates generally, in order that it may earn a fixed per cent upon its investment. Rates that are in force may not be changed, unless application has been made to the Commission for that purpose. Similar statutes have been held valid. State v. Chicago A N. \V. Ry. Co., 198 N. W. 670; St. Clair Borough v. Tamaqna &amp; Pottsville E. Ry. Co., 259 Pa. 462, 103 Atl. 287; 5 A. L. R. 20; 10 Corp. Jur. 406, 409. If the hearing of such an application causes delay the plaintiff has a remedy against daily confiscation by seeking an injunction pending final decision by the Commission. But the effect of the injunction to be granted in this case is to set aside the exchange rates fixed in the Commission's order of November 4, 1922; and thereafter there will be no legal rates prescribed by the Commission in place of these exchange rates. Until the Commission shall have adopted new rates, the plaintiff has the right to fix its own rates in place of the rates so enjoined, subject, of course, to the general re - quirements of law that they be just and reasonable and not in viola - tion of any statute. City of Louisville v. Louisville Home Telephone Co., 279 Fed. 9 4 9 ; Empoiia Telephone Co. v. Public Utilities Commis - sion, 97 Kas. 136, 154 Pac. 262; Walker Bros. Co. v.

The decree will not attempt in advance to determine a percent - age of return upon the investment which may be earned by the plain - tiff, because such an order would fix the rates which might be charged by the plaintiff. The question of a proper rate of return can be presented, when an actual rate of return has been established. A decree will be entered accordingly. </seg>

            <seg id="p498">498 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 3. "The essential quality of the police power as a governmental agency is that it imposes upon persons and property burdens designed to promote the safety and welfare, of the public at large." Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R. Co. v. State, 47 Neb. 549, affirmed, 170 U. S. 57. Heard before Morrissey, C Thompson, J. J. J. Dean,, Day, Good, Evans and DEAN, J. Lena Lindemann and William Lindemann, her husband, are the owners of, reside on and cultivate a farm described as the northwest quarter of section 25, township 6, range 8, in Clay county. Besides the dwelling-house, the farm is equipped with the usual complement of farm buildings. The St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island Railway com - pany, defendant, is a common carrier of passengers and freight in Nebraska and elsewhere. Defendants right of way extends diagonally in a northwesterly and southeasterly direction through a part of plaintiffs' farm. There is no public or private crossing connecting plaintiffs' lands, which lie on either side of defendant's right of way, except the public crossings, or highways, on the section lines which adjoin the farm. Defendant having been requested, and having refused, to con - struct a private crossing at plaintiffs' request, which was made pur - suant to section 4, ch. 261, Laws 1921, now section 5527, Comp. St. 1922, a formal complaint was filed before the Nebraska State Railway Commission, and, after an investigation and hearing, it was duly ordered by the Commission that the defendant railway company, within 60 days from the date of the order, "construct at its own expense one private grade crossing between the portions of com - plainants' farm, described in this finding, with grading and planking in conformity with the standard practices of defendant company in construction of similar crossings." From this order defendant has appealed. Among other things defendant railway company pleaded the fol lowing: "Further answering, the defendant states that it is the legal successor of the St. Joseph &amp; Denver City Railroad company, to which the United States granted, by the Act of Congress, approved July 23, 1866, a right of way two hundred feet in width, one hundred feet in width on each side of the road where it may pass through the public domain, together with all necessary grounds for station buildings, depots, switches, side-tracks and so forth, and that the right of way and premises owned by the defendant in the quarter section described in the complaint filed herein are a part of the right of way so granted </seg>
            <seg id="p499">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION" 499 to the defendant's predecessor, said St. Joseph &amp; Denver City Rail - road company, and are owned by defendant in fee simply pursuant to such grant." See 14 U. S. St. at Large, ch. 212, p. 210. "The defendant further states that by the same Act of Congress, approved July 23, 1866, there was granted to the state of Kansas, for the use and benefit of the St. Joseph &amp; Denver City Railroad company, the odd-numbered sections, ten sections in width on each side of the rail - road of the defendant's predecessor, the St. Joseph &amp; Denver City Railroad company; that the St. Joseph &amp; Denver City Railroad com - pany duly accepted said Act and filed its plat of the location of its railroad, and that thereafter that part of section twenty-five in the township, range and county aforesaid, exclusive of the right of way two hundred feet in width, was patented to the St. Joseph &amp; Denver City Railroad company in aid of the construction of its railroad; and that the portions of the northwest quarter of said section twenty - five above described lying on either side of said railroad right of way, so granted as aforesaid, were conveyed to the complainant's predecessors in title by the said St. Joseph &amp; Denver City Railroad company, or its successors, after the date of the construction of the railroad upon and along the right of way granted by the aforesaid Act of Congress, and after said quarter section had been physically divided by the construction of said railroad." It seems that the section of railroad here involved was built in 1871, and that in 1875 defendant's predecessor, namely, the St. Joseph &amp; Denver City Railroad company, conveyed the section of land, which included that now owned by plaintiffs, to plaintiffs' predecessor, and that, among other things, the deed of conveyance reserved a strip of land one hundred feet wide on each side of the center of the railroad track. The conveyance above referred to, which is dated October 26, 1875, upon which defendant in part relies, contains this recital: "Reserving, however, to the St. Joseph &amp; Denver City Railroad company all that portion of the land hereby conveyed, if any such there be, which lies within lines drawn parallel with and one hun - dred feet on each side distant from the center line of its road as now constructed, and any greater width when necessary permanently to include all their cuts, embankments and ditches and other works necessary to secure and protect their main lines." And on this point defendant argues: "The conveyance of the railroad company to appellees' grantor of the lands owned by appellees does not recognize any right of the grantees to a pTivate crossing." And in its answer it is pleaded that, in view of the facts, it "Is not required under the statutes and laws of the state of Ne - braska to make the private crossing prayed for in the complaint filed </seg>
            <seg id="p500">EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 500 herein and that to require it to make such private crossing under the circumstances herein- above recited would unlawfully take the property of the defendant for private use, and deprive it of its property without due process of law, in violation of and contravention of its rights under the Constitution of the United States, and more particularly under section 1 of the fourteenth amendment therto." A statute which required railroads to erect crossings over lands of persons which were located on both sides of a railroad was enacted by the territorial legislature in 1866. The act reads: "When any person owns land on both sides of any railroad, the corporation owning such railroad shall, when required so to do, make and keep in good repair one causeway or other adequate means of crossing the same." Rev. St. 1S66, ch. 25, sec. 106. On July 1, 1S66, the above territorial act was in force. This was prior to the congressional grant of the right of way to defendant's predecessor. And the act was in full force and effect when the con - stitution of 1866, and the territorial laws, were approved by the congress when Nebraska was subsequently admitted to the Union. So that it follows that the above act, together with all territorial laws then in force, were then, and thereby, saved to the state. The above territorial act remained in full force and effect until 1921, when it was amended to read as follows: "When any person owns land on both sides of the right of way railroad, such railroad shall provide and keep in repair at it one adequate means for such landowner to cross the right of way. Any interested landowner with land on both sides of the right of way of any railroad may file written complaint with the State Railway Commission against any such railroad that the crossing is not adequate, and the Commission thereupon shall make such in - vestigation and hold such hearing as may be necessary, and shall issue such orders as it shall deem necessary, proper and adequate. If circumstances warrant, the Commission may require overhead, underground or grade crossings and require wing fences at under - ground crossings, but where such special crossing involves an expendi - ture of more than six hundred ($600) dollars the land owner shall bear one-half the expense in excess of six hundred ($600) dollars." Laws 1921, ch. 261, sec. 4. In the case under consideration, the facts are undisputed and questions of law alone are here involved. Counsel for the Commission, in behalf of plaintiffs, argues that defendant's right of way, a.? pointed out in Northern P. R. Co. v. Townsend, 190 U. S. 267, 271, </seg>
            <seg id="p501">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 501 was in effect, "a limited fee, made on an implied condition of reverter in the event that the company ceased to use or retain the land for the purpose for which it was granted." In the Townsend case, it was decided that no part of a right of way of a railroad company, which was granted by an Act of Congress, could be held by adverse posses - sion. However, in the same case the court held that the grantee of such right of way was not absolved from the operation of police regulations. On this point the court said: "Of course, nothing that has been said in any wise imports that a right of way granted through the public domain within a state is not amenable to the police power of the state. Congress must have assumed when mak - ing this grant, for instance, that in the natural order of events, as settlements were made along the line of the railroad, crossings of the right .of way would become necessary, and that other limitations in favor of the general public upon an exclusive right of occupancy by the railroad of its right of way might be justly imposed. But such limitations are in no sense analogous to claim of adverse ownership for private use." In Illinois it was held that, because of the public nature of its business, railroad corporations are within the operation of all reason - able police regulations. Illinois C. IS. Co. v. Willenborg, 117 111. 203. See Fremont, E. &amp; M. V. K. Co. v. Lamb, 11 Neb. 592. In a case which, on appeal, was affirmed by the supreme court of the United States, we held that the police power is one, "which cannot be surrendered, to require persons and corporations to bo exercise and enjoy their rights as not unnecessarily to injure others. That the principle stated is especially applicable to existing rights, without regard to the time of their acquirement or to the source from whence they are derived, appears to us a self-evident proposition not requiring argument." Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R. Co. v. State, 47 Neb. 549, affirmed on appeal, 170 U. S. 57. Defendant has cited cases which do not appear to be in point, and we do not find it necessary to notice them further. In view, therefore, of the record, and of the decisions applicable thereto, we conclude that deprivation of property without due process has not been shown. The findings and order of the Nebraska Railway Com - mission, therefore, must be, and they are hereby, in all things AFFIRMED. </seg>
            <seg id="p502">502 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OPINIONS Lincoln, March 9, 1925. Mr. John E. Curtiss, Secretary, Nebraska State Railway Commission, Office. Dear Sir: Sometime since, at the direction of the State Railway Commis- E, you submitted to me the request of Mr. C. C. Frazier for infor - on concerning the service facilities and physical connection act ipter 170, Laws 1923). He presents two specific questions, ely, (a) The franchise granted by the city of Aurora to the Ne - braska Gas and Electric company to occupy the streets of the city with its lines etc., for the purpose of supplying the city and its in - habitants with electric current will expire in February, 1926. If the city should build a distributing system of its own, may physical con - nection with the transmission line owned by the Gas and Elec.tric company which brings current into the city be required (it is not stated where the current is generated or whether or not the company has lines running near or through the city and carrying current to points beyond) and may the company be required to furnish current? My conclusion is that under the facts stated the city may require neither physical connection nor the furnishing of current. The trans - mission line was apparently built for the express purpose of carrying current to the city of Aurora, the distributing system being for the purpose of getting it from the transmission line to the consumer. When the franchise expires, the company will have a right to remove such distributing system and it will also have a right to remove the transmission line which apparently is a stub line and, as stated above, was built solely for the purpose of transmitting current from the place of generation to the distributing system. If used solely for that purpose, it would be improper for the company to be required to maintain the transmission line for the purpose of supplying the dis - tributing system built by the city. It would deprive it of its property without compensation. Blackledge v. Fanners Ind. Tel. Co., 105 Neb. </seg>
            <seg id="p503">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 503 If on the contrary the company continues to maintain and use the line for electric transmission to other places after it ceased to furnish the city with current, then physical connection may be com - pelled. Question is raised as to what would happen in case the city bought the distributing system. Probably no question could then arise for if the city came to an agreement with the company with regard to the distributing system, such agreement would doubtless include the disposition of the transmission line. (b) Has the Nebraska State Railway Commission power to fix rates as well as power to order physical connections? The Commission has the power to fix the rates in case physical connection is required. Very truly yours. O. S. Spillman, Attorney General. By Hugh LaMaster, Assistant Attorney General. Lincoln, April 17, 1925. Mr. John E. Curtiss, Secretary, Nebraska State Railway Commission, Office. Dear Sir The Commission has submitted the following question A complaint was heretofore filed by a land owner owning lands on both sides of the right of way of a railroad asking for an under - ground crossing. The Commission denied the complaint. Later the same land owner filed a second complaint asking the same relief. Assuming that conditions have not changed, may the Commission entertain the second complaint or is its decision on the former applica - tion a bar to the second complaint? My opinion is that it is not, that the matter is not res judicata and that the Commission may entertain the second complaint and order an underground crossing if the facts warrant such a determination. The question involves a consideration of Section 5527, Compiled Statutes of 1922, as amended by Chapter 167, Session Laws of 1923. </seg>
            <seg id="p504">504 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT As amended, it provides that whenever a person owns land on both sides of the right of way of a railroad, the company owning such railroad shall provide and keep in repair at least one adequate means for such land owner to cross the right of way. It also provides that the land owner may file written complaint with the State Railway Commission setting forth the inadequacy or dangerous character of any existing crossing and the Commission shall thereupon make an investigation and hold such hearing as may be necessary and, if the facts warrant, shall issue an order for an adequate crossing. Section 5527 must be taken in connection with Sections 5496-5498 parti - cular ily as Section 5527 does not contain full provisions for the pro - cedure in such cases. As an order requiring a crossing would sub - stantially affect the property rights of the railroad company, it must have an opportunity to be heard and defend. Section 5496 provides generally for the procedure. It seems clear that the action of the Commission would have to be in accordance with the requirements of Section 5496. The order authorized to be entered under Section 5496 is limited by Section 549S which provides that such an order shall be in force and effect from and after the date fixed by the Commis - sion "until annulled, modified or revised by the Commission or until finally adjudged to be unreasonable and unjust in a court of compet - ent jurisdiction." These provisions seem to make the order subject to revision at any time, even without additional hearing. Section 5 4 9? also provides that the findings and order of the Commission in such a case shall thereafter, when properly authenticated, be admitted in all judicial proceedings as evidence of every fact found and that said orders are, prima facie, just and reasonable. The statute, therefore, seems to treat such an order as lacking judicial qualities. If it is not, in fact, a judicial order, it cannot, in any event, be res judicata. The specific terms of the statutes seem to make it subject to revision by the Commission itself. In the case of Postle v. O. B. &amp; Q. R. K. Co., 98 Neb. 192, the supreme court reversed the order of the Commission requiring the building of an overhead crossing. This was under the statute prior to the amend - ments of 1921 and 1923. The appellant, railroad company, contended in that case that the Commission erred in assuming jurisdiction of the complaint for the reason that its determination involved the adjudica - tion of private rights and was, therefore, an exercise of judicial power with which the Commission was not vested. The court conceded that there was force in the contention but did not find it necessary to determine the question. Now that the Commission has such power, it would seem that an adjudication by it would be a judicial deter - mination and therefore the matter would be res judicata. That would doubtlessly be true except for the specific provision of Sections 5496-5498 above mentioned. In view of the statutory provision, it is considered that the matter </seg>
            <seg id="p505">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 505 is not res judicata, although, of course, the former holding should be given a high presumption of correctness and the burden is upon the applicant to overcome such presumption. Very truly yours, O. S. Spillman, Attorney General. By Hugh LaMaster, Assistant Attorney General. Lincoln, April 29, 1925. Honorable Thome A. Browne, Chairman, Nebraska State Railway Commission Office. Dear Sir: As requested by you, I have examined the authorities cited by the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway company in its brief in its application for increased rates so far as the same relate to the fixing of rates for future operations that would pay a proper return aud would also amortize losses sustained by the company during pre - vious operation. It is claimed by the company that it has lost large sums during the last five years of its operation under rates prescribed by the Com - mission. It now claims that it is entitled to rates that will yield compensatory returns not only for the future but also sufficiently large to amortize the past losses. Galveston Electric Co. v. City of Galveston, 258 U. S. 388, 66 L. ed. 678, involved street railway fares of the Galveston Electric com - pany in the city of Galveston. A portion of the opinion is quoted in the brief of the applicant, company. It is necessary, however, to quote more extensively. Following is the whole paragraph, part of which is quoted by the applicant, company: (396-397) "In determining the value of a business, as between buyer and seller, the good will and earning power due to effective organization are often more important elements than tangible property. Where the public acquires the business, compensation must be made for these; at least, under some circumstances. (Authorities) And they, like past losses, should be considered in determining whether a rate charged by a public utility is reason - able. Compare C. H. Venner Co. v. Urbana Waterworks, 174 Fed. 348, 352. But, in determining whether a rate is con- </seg>
            <seg id="p506">506 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT fiscatory, good will and franchise value were excluded from the base value in Cedar Rapids Gaslight Co. v. Cedar Rapids, (Authorities) and the expressions in Denver v. Denver Union Water Co. (Authorities) are not to be taken as modifying in any respect the rule there declared. Going concern value and de - velopment cost, in the sense in which the master used these terms, are not to be included in the base value for the purpose of determining whether a rate is con fiscatory." So far as the subject is referred to in the decision of the court below (272 Fed. 147) the court said: (160) "It is very evident that the parties, in making their agree - ment on value, and the master, in valuing the plant, valued it as a plant in use, and not in any sense as junk, or a dead and idle property. The agreement between the parties showed plainly that they had included everything in the valuation of the property except the franchise value, going-concern value in the sense of development cost, bond discount, and brokerage, and it is evident that the master, in making his allowance for this item, made it, not for the purpose of making a distinction between junk and live value, but in order to add to his valuation an allowance for development cost somewhat analogous to the procedure earlier adopted by the Wisconsin Public Utilities Commission. In any case, where a plant is fully valued upon the cost of reproduction basis, the allowance of any element for development cost cannot, in a judicial proceeding, be reasonably sustained for the reason that such a utility is entitled to a reasonable rate of return upon its plant from the day it goes into operation, and the court does not take into consideration at all that there may be lean years before the fat ones. Therefore a court in a rate case has nothing to do with any increment to the actual value of the plant acquired by the successful operation of it, nor in a case of valuation, where the cost of the plant and its historical development is determined, does the court add anything to its capitalization for rate-making purposes for its unsuccessful years, nor deduct anything for its successful ones." t There appears to be nothing either in the decision of the district t or in the decision of the Supieme Court of the United States would justify the citation of the case as an authority for amortiz - past losses. Mobile Water Co. v. Patterson 293 Fed. 208. In the opinion it is said: (224) "This loss having been imposed by the direct action of the Commission in compelling the plaintiff to continue to operate at a conflscatory rate between these dates, the company is entitled to reimbursement of these losses, which should be permitted by amortizing them over a period of five years." Petersburg Gas Co. v. City of Petersburg (West Virginia), 20 A. L. R. 542, 110 S. E. 533, and several Commission cases are cited. </seg>
            <seg id="p507">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 507 Louisiana Water Co. v. Public Service Commission, 294 Fed. 954, as quoted in the company's brief, recognizes that a company should be permitted to amortize losses suffered under regulation. It cites as its only authority the case of Galveston Electric Co. v. Galves - ton, supra. Streator Aqueduct Co. v. Smith, 295 Fed. 385, holds that where there is conclusive evidence of deficits in the operation of property these should be ascertained and amortized. It cites in sustaining its position the case of Columbus Gas Light Co. v. Public Service Com - mission (Ohio), 140 N. E. 538. Petersburg Gas Co. v. City -of Petersburg (Virginia), 110 S. E. 533, 20 A. L. R. 542, recognizes that if a loss has been inflicted upon a gas company by a rate fixed by the Commission it should be amortized. In the opinion it is said: "For reasons stated by the Commission we do not think that the losses sustained by the gas company prior to its application for an increase of rates should be amortized, but if, upon further investigation, it is ascertained that a loss has been sustained since that date, in consequence of the rate fixed by the Commis - sion, such loss should be amortized and spread over such a term of years as will be fair to the gas company and not too burden - some to the consumers." The McAlester Gas and Coal Co. v. Corporation Commission of Oklahoma (Okla.) 227 Pac. 831, does not appear to sustain the com - pany's position. The quotation on page 50 of its brief from that case does not refer to the amortization of past losses but amortization due to the depletion of a natural gas field. It seems that it should have been designated as an allowance for depletion rather than an allow - ance for amortization. The language of the opinion seems to be opposed to the position of the company. The court said: "If, at the conclusion of this investigation, it should finally appear, as the record before us at the present time makes it ap - pear, that the company is now operating its business at an un - fairly low rate, then there will be no practical way for the com - pany to reimburse itself for the loss in furnishing gas to its patrons between now and then. If, however, we put into effect now a temporary increase in rates, and require the company to give a large and substantial bond, conditioned that it will re - fund this increase in rates in the event we, upon the final record, decide such increase to be erroneous, then the patrons' interests will be amply protected by the refund." The Columbus Gas Light Co. v. Public Service Commission, 140 N. E. 538, cites Newton v. Consolidated Gas Co., 258 U. S. 165, and quotes therefrom. </seg>
            <seg id="p508">508 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL. REPORT The foregoing authorities taken by themselves fairly sustain the contention of the company. There is nothing new in the doctrine; in fact, the principle is recognized in all public regulation. It is im - possible for a regulatory body to readjust rates at very frequent intervals so that it is necessary that an average should be taken which means that losses and gains are to be so equalized as to give a fair average return. The doctrine is also recognized in every instance where a surplus is allowed to be accumulated to take care of times of adversity. The difficulty in applying the principle seems to be that both the body of stockholders and the body of rate payers are con - stantly changing. The authorities that must be -regarded as final, bearing upon the subject, are directly opposed to the position of the company. In the case of Georgia Railroad Power Co. v. Railway Commis - sion, 278 Fed. 242, the United States District Court, N. D. Georgia, refused such an allowance. The court said: (247) "Losses, or more properly failure to earn 8 per cent, net return on the values since fixed by the Commission, are claimed during the years 1917, 1918, 1919, and 1920. During part of this time operations were under the rate voluntarily established by the company; during the rest, under raised rates allowed by the Commission. The claim that the failure to earn a reasonable return, if established, should now be either allowed as capital investment or amortized under this or future rates we cannot allow. To concede this as a right would be to guarantee income, and would raise a correlative duty to account for earnings beyond what were reasonable in the past. No limit could be placed to the period of the inquiry, nor could justice really be done by it to the individual stockholders or consumers actually concerned, for these are constantly changing. A rate established as reason - able, whether by the company or by the Commission, is not guaranteed by the Commission or the public. Whether it will actually yield more or less than a fair return during its continu - ance is a risk of the business. We do not deny that it is within the discretion of the Commission to consider the experience of the immediate past in fixing a just rate for the future, but we hold that no legal right exists to have disappointments or sur - prises in results balanced." On appeal the decree of the District Court was affirmed. Georgia R. &amp; P. Co. v. Railway Com., 262 U. S. 625, 67 L. ed. 1144. The court said: (632) "That past losses are not to be capitalized as property on which the fair return is based was held in Knoxville v. Knox - ville Water Co., 212 U. S. 1, 14, 53 L. ed. 371, 380, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 148; Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, supra. Here this conclusion seems even clearer than it was in those cases. The losses under consideration in the case at bar were obviously not </seg>

The Georgia case is the last expression of the supreme court of the United States upon the subject. The Georgia case seems to dispose definitely of the contentions of the company. The objections raised by Judge Lambert in his brief to the allowance claimed appear to be sufficient to determine the subject without reference to the authorities above cited. Very truly yours, O. S. Spillman, Attorney General. By Hugh LaMaster, Assistant Attorney General. Lincoln, May 28, 1925. Mr. John E. Curtiss, Secretary, Nebraska State Railway Commission, Office. Dear Sir: Sometime since Mr. J. F. Moredick, chairman Nebraska State Legislative Board, Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, submitted the following questions: (a) Should a railroad company operating a motor car singly, carrying passengers, provide a crew consisting of three men, that is, a motorman, a conductor and a brakeman or flagman? (b) Where a trailer is attached to a motor car carrying pas - sengers, should there be a crew consisting of three men, that is, a motorman, a conductor and a brakeman or flagman? Motor cars are being operated by Nebraska carriers singly and with trailers by crews consisting of two men each, that is, a motor - man and a conductor, no brakeman being employed. Section 5336, Compiled Statutes for 1922, is as follows: "It shall be unlawful for any railroad company doing busi - ness in the state of Nebraska to operate or run over its road or any part thereof, or suffer or permit to be run over its road or any part thereof, outside of the yard limits, any passenger, mail </seg>
            <seg id="p510">510 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT or express train carrying passengers, whose regular equipment consists of more than five cars, with a crew, consisting of less than one engineer, one fireman, one conductor, one brakeman and one flagman; and further provided, passenger trains whose regular equipment consists of five cars or less, may be operated with a crew consisting of one engineer, one fireman, one con - ductor and one brakeman or flagman. Mr. Moredick calls attention to the definition of a train stated in the operating rules of the Nebraska carriers. It is as follows: "Train — An engine, or motor, or more than one engine, or motor, coupled, with or without cars, displaying markers." The rules are to be considered but, of course, they cannot govern the language of the statute. The latter seems to preclude the idea of treating a single motor car as a train. It provides for a fireman, who can only be employed on a steam locomotive which of necessity means that there are to be both a locomotive and cars. The statute above quoted was approved March 31, 1909. At the same session an act was passed relating to the operation of gasoline motor trains or gasoline motor cars. The latter act, chapter 97, Laws 1909, was approved, April 3, 1909. The first two sections are as follows: "That each and every railroad company operating gasoline motor cars or gasoline trains in this state on which passengers are transported, shall on and after January 1st, 1910, cause such cars to be equipped with separate toilet closets for men and women and shall also maintain a smoking apartment; either as a separate car in the train or completely partitioned off by a suit - able wall and tightly closing door and suitably furnished. "The State Railway Commission shall have power to release any railway company from the provisions of this act on new roads where steam passenger trains have not been regularly run until such time as the business will warrant better service, also on parts of roads where at least one steam passenger train is run, which makes regular stops at least six days in the week. Provided that mixed freight and passenger trains shall not be considered passenger trains." These two acts must have been considered simultaneously by the legislature. They indicate that the legislature itself differentiated between trains and motor cars operated singly. Webster's Dictionary (International Dictionary, Last Edition,) defines a train as "A connected line of cars, etc., on a railroad, without or With the locomotive." </seg>
            <seg id="p511">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 511 It is, therefore, concluded that a motor car operated singly is not a train within the meaning of the statute above quoted, and may be operated without a brakeman. The reasons leading to the conclusion that a motor car may be operated singly without a brakeman indicate that where a trailer is used a brakeman should be employed. The statute is penal in its nature and, of course, the definition of the offense must be within the plain import of its words. While the subject is not entirely free from doubt, it seems to be within the plain import of the statute that a brakeman must be employed where a trailer is used. My conclusion is, therefore, that where a motor car is operated with a trailer a brakeman should be added. Very truly yours, O. S. Spillman, Attorney General. By Hugh LaMaster, Assistant Attorney General. Lincoln, July 25, 1925. Honorable Thome A. Browne, Chairman, Nebraska State Railway Commission, Office. Dear Sir: I have examined the question stated in your letter of June 18 as to whether or not the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph company of Nebraska is required to file an annual report. It appears that the company owns all of the toll lines in Nebraska operated by the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph company. The former company does not operate any telephone lines although under its articles of incorporation it may own and operate both long distance lines and exchanges. It is not a common carrier as that term is generally used nor does it seem to fall within the definition of a common carrier as con - tained in section 5483, Compiled Statutes, 1922. While the subject is not free from doubt, my conclusion is that the company may not be required to file an annual report. Very truly yours, O. S. Spillman, Attorney General. By Hugh LaMaster, Assistant Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p512">512 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Lincoln, July 1, 1925 Mr. John E. Curtiss, Secretary, Nebraska State Railway Commission, Office. Dear Sir: Mr. U. G. Powell, rate expert of the Commission, submitted the following: Wells- Abbot t-Nieman company of Schuyler, shipped via U. P. R. R. certain grain in carload lots from Schuyler, to Omaha. Shipments were billed to parties in the city of Omaha and there was K intent on the part of the Wells-Abbott-Nieman company that the In should move farther. Loss was incurred and in making settle - its of the claims, the carrier seeks to reduce their amounts by acting % of 1% on small grain shipments and 14 of 1% on corn shipments to cover what it claims to be natural shrinkage. This de - duction is allowable on interstate shipments but is not allowable on intrastate shipments. It appears that some of the dealers in Omaha to whom the grain was sold have used the shipments as a basis for securing proportional rates on shipments of grain beyond Omaha. Tha carrier now claims that by using the shipments as a basis for pro - portional rates they thereby became interstate and the deductions may be properly made. The sole question is whether the shipments were interstate or intrastate. In the correspondence the carrier stated that it relied upon a case found in the Interstate Commerce Commission reports as au - thority for its position that the shipment was interstate. The writer requested a citation of the case and was referred to B. &amp; O. S. W. R. Co., v. Settle, 260 U. S. 166, 67 L. ed. 189. The question is one of difficulty and has been given careful atten - tion. Our conclusion is that the shipment is intrastate in character but it should be said the subject is not free from doubt. The au - thorities are not entirely in harmony concerning it. The leading case upon the subject is Gulf C. &amp; S. F. R. v. Texas, 204, U. S. 203, 51 L. ed. 540. Briefly stated the essential facts are: A carload of corn was shipped from Hudson, So. Dak., via Kansas City Missouri, to Texarkana, Texas, the consignment being to shipper's order. The shipper had previously sold the grain to a concern which intended to send it to Goldthwaite, Texas. Upon arriving at Texarkana it was shipped by the agent of the seller, who was acting for the purchaser, to its destination, Goldthwaite, Texas. Upon the arrival at the final destination the connecting carrier, the defendant below, plaintiff in error in the United States Supreme Court, demanded </seg>
            <seg id="p513">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 513 settlement of charges upon the interstate rates. They were paid and suit was instituted to collect a penalty for overcharge between Tex - arkana and Goldthwaite. Conviction was had and the company ap - pealed to the supreme court of Texas where the conviction was affirmed. Upon error to the supreme court of the United States the decision of the supreme court of Texas was affirmed. It is said in the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States: "It is undoubtedly true that the character of a shipment, whether local or interstate, is not changed by a transfer of title during the transportation. But whether it be one or the other may depend on the contract of shipment. The rights and obliga - tions of carriers and shippers are reciprocal. The first contract of shipment in this case was from Hudson to Texarkana. During that transportation a contract was made at Kansas City for the sale of the corn, but that did not affect the character of the ship - ment from Hudson to Texarkana. It was an interstate shipment after the contract of sale as well as before. In other words, the transportation which was contracted for, and which was not changed by any act of the parties, was transportation of the corn from Hudson to Texarkana, — that is, an interstate shipment. The control over goods in process of transportation, which may be repeatedly changed by sales, is one thing; the transportation is another thing, and follows the contract of shipment, until that is changed by the agreement of owner and carrier. Neither the Harroun nor the Hardin company changed or offered to change the contract of shipment or the place of delivery. The Hardin company accepted the contract of shipment therefore made, and purchased the corn to be delivered at Texarkana, — that is, on the completion of the existing contract. When the Hardin company accepted the corn at Texarkana the transporta - tion contracted for ended. The carrier was under no obligations to carry it further. It transferred the corn, in obedience to the demands of the owner, to the Texas &amp; Pacific Railway company, to be delivered by it, under its contract, with such owner. What - ever obligations may rest upon the carrier at the terminus of its transportation to deliver to some further carrier, in obedience to the instructions of the owner, it is acting not as carrier, but simply as a forwarder. No new arrangement having been made for transportation, the corn was delivered to the Hardin com - pany at Texarkana. Whatever may have been the thought or purpose of the Hardin company in respect to the further dis - position of the corn was a matter immaterial so far as the com - pleted transportation was concerned. "In this respect there is no difference between an interstate passenger and an interstate transportation. If Hardin, for instance, had purchased at Hudson a ticket for interstate carriages to Texarkana, intending all the while after he reached Texarkana to go on to Goldthwaite, he would not be entitled, on his arrival at Texarkana, to a new ticket from Texarkana to Goldthwaite at the proportionate fraction of the rate prescribed by the Inter - state Commerce Commission for carriage from Hudson to Gold - thwaite. The one contract of the railroad companies having been finished, he must make a new contract for his carriage to Gold - thwaite, and that would be subject to the law of the state within which that carriage was to be made. ***** 17 </seg>
            <seg id="p514">514 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT "It must further be remembered that no bill of lading was issued from Texarkana to Goldthwaite until after the arrival of the corn at Texarkana, the completion of the first contract for transportation, the acceptance and payment by the Hardin com - pany. In many cases it would work the grossest injustice to a carrier if it could not rely on the contract of shipment it has made, know whether it was bound to obey the state or Federal law, or, obeying the former, find itself mulcted in penalties for not obeying the law of the other jurisdiction, simply because the shipper intended a transportation beyond that specified in the contract. It must be remembered that there is no presumption that a transportation when commenced is to be continued beyond the state limits, and the carrier ought to be able to depend upon the contract which it has made, and must conform to the liability imposed by that contract. In that case it appears that it was the intention of the part of the owner to ship the corn through to Goldthwaite, Texas. In the present instance the shipper had no intention of shipping the grain further and the transaction was closed when the consignment was delivered at Omaha. The Texarkana case, as it is called, has been repeatedly cited with approval. The case of B. &amp; O. S. W. R. Co., v. Settle, supra, cited by the carriers, seems to be at variance with the Texarkana case although it is stated in the Settle case that the two cases are entirely consist - ent although some of the expressions in the opinion in the Texarkana case are not in harmony with the Settle case. In the Settle case it appears that the B. &amp; O. S. W. R. Co., has a freight station at Oakley and a freight station at Madisonville both within the city limits of Cincinnati. Settle shipped lumber from the south of Oakley, paid the freight to that point, received, at that station, delivery of the loaded cars on the team tracks or in the bulk yard and without unloading any of the cars reshipped them within a few days to Madisonville on local bills of lading paying the local freight rate; thereby transportation was secured to Madisonville by paying less in freight charges than would have been payable according to the interstate rates. It was held that the movements were inter - state. It was the intention of Settle, at all times, to move the cars to Madisonville. Several cases are cited to sustain this position of the court. In each one of them it appears that there was an intention on the part of the shipper to continue the movement to some more distant point than that named as the destination in the first bill of lading. It is recognized in that case that a reshipment to another point does not of itself establish continuity of movement. The court said: "The mere fact that cars received on interstate movement are reshipped by the consignee, after a brief interval, to an- </seg>
            <seg id="p515">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 515 U. S, other point, does not, of course, establish an essential continuity of movement to the latter point. The reshipment, although im - mediate, may be an independent intrastate movement. The in - stances are many where a local shipment follows quickly upon an interstate shipment and yet is not to be deemed part of it, even though some further shipment was contemplated when the original movement began. Shipments to and from distributing points often present this situation, if the applicable tariffs do not confer reconsignment or transit privileges. The distinction is clear between cases of that character and the one at bar, where the essential nature of the traffic as a through movement to the point of ultimate destination is shown by the original and persisting intention of the shippers, which was carried out." In the case of Bracht v. San Antonio &amp; Aransas Pass R. Co., 254 . 489, 65 L. ed. 366, it was held that "The liability of the initial carrier of goods consigned by a shipper to himself at a point within the state, where he in - tended to sell them, and shipped under an intrastate bill of lad - ing that contained no reference to diversion or reshipment, is governed solely by such bill of lading, subject to any applicable rules and regulations prescribed by state authority, although, upon arrival at destination, at a point beyond such initial carrier's own line, the carrier then having possession of goods forwarded them, upon the shipper's request, made after arrival, to a point in another state, taking up the original bill of lading, and issuing an interstate one, and such initial carrier may not be held liable by virtue of the Carmack Amendment of June 29, 1906, to the Interstate Commerce Act of February 4, 1887, for the damages sustained in the course of transportation beyond the destination originally specified." The court said in the opinion: "Respondent's contract appears to have related only to a movement between points in the same state. It had no notice or reason to suppose that the freight would pass beyond the destination specified. The original undertaking was an intra - state transaction, subject, of course, to any applicable rules and regulations prescribed by state authority. The record discloses none; and we are unable to say, as matter of Federal law, that the tariff schedules for interstate shipments, or the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act, constituted part of the agreement. The general principles announced in Gulf, C. &amp; S. F. R. Co. v. Texas, 204 U. S. 403, 411, 51 L. ed. 540, 545, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 360, are applicable. Railroad Commission v. Worthington, 225 U. S. 101, 56 L. ed. 1004, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 653, Texas &amp; N. O. R. Co. v. Sabine Tram Co. 227 U. S. Ill, 57 L. ed. 442, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 229, and similar cases, are not controlling. They involved controversies concerning carriage between points in the same state which was really but part of an interstate or foreign movement reasonably to be anticipated by the contracting parties, — a recognized step towards a destination outside the state. The distinctions are elucidated in Texas and N. O. R. Co. v. Sabine Tram Co. Here neither shipper nor respondent had in con - templation any movement beyond the point specified, and the </seg>
            <seg id="p516">516 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT contract between them must be determined from the original bill of lading and the local laws and regulations." As It is recognized in the Settle case that shipment may be either interstate or intrastate according to circumstances and as there was no intention on the part of the shipper in this instance to extend the movement to any interstate point, it would seem that the movement is to be regarded as intrastate. As the deductions are not authorized on intrastate movements, the company should settle without making them. If this deduction were allowed, as claimed, and the grain should move further, interstate, it might easily happen that a second deduc - tion for shrinkage would be made. Very truly yours. O. S. Spillman, Attorney General. By Hugh LaMaster, Assistant Attorney General. Lincoln, July 7, 1925. Mr. U. G. Powell Rate Expert, Nebraska State Railway Commission Office. Dear Sir: . I have examined the correspondence in Informal Complaint 7004 filed by Mr. D. M. Hildebrand. Mr. Hildebrand complains of the length of time certain livestock shipments were kept on the road without unloading for food and rest by the Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railway company. He does not specify any particular shipment except one from Rapid City, South Dakota, to Seward, Nebraska. In fact, he does not state the destination definitely but as he is doing business at Seward I take it that was the point of destination. He states that the records show that the car arrived at Long Pine at 7:00 a. m. and did not leave until 5:00 a. m. the next morning. The hogs were fed but not removed from the car. Assuming that the facts are as above stated, the Federal twenty - eight hour law was not complied with. Section I thereof permits a maximum time without unloading of thirty-six hours. Section III contains a proviso permitting a longer detention where the animals are carried in cars in which they have proper food, water, space and </seg>

R. Co. v. Pinch, 225 Fed. 676. The tariff to which you referred me, being quarantine circular 5-C issued April 20, 1925, E. B. Boyd, agent, effective May 1, 1925, page 52, contains a statement that, under the conditions and regula - tions of Nebraska, hogs must not be loaded or unloaded through public stockyards except where Federal supervision is maintained or where the animals are to be immunized with anti-hog cholera serum or when special permission is given by the Bureau of Animal Industry of the State Department of Agriculture. Under ciroular No. 11, Bureau of Animal Industry of the State of Nebraska dated April 6, 1925, the limitations above mentioned are not required. I find nothing in the statutes that would authorize the tariff provisions. There seems to be no basis for the provisions except as they may be a survival of older provisions in force during the period of Federal control. I see no reason why the provisions of the tariffs may not be changed now so that hogs may be loaded and unloaded through stockyards. I suggest that the matter be taken up with the carriers with a view to modifying the tariffs. Very truly yours, O. S. Spillman, Attorney General. By Hugh LaMaster, Assistant Attorney General. Lincoln, September 17, 1925. Honorable Chas. A. Randall, Nebraska State Railway Commission, Office. Dear Sir: I have examined the question which you submitted in reference to the laying of water mains by the Tillage of Greenwood in its public streets and under the tracks of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company at that point. It appears that a water system is being constructed and that the company demands that the village execute a lease under the terms of which the company might cause the mains to be removed upon thirty days notice. </seg>
            <seg id="p518">EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL. REPORT 518 The Tillage is not required to enter into a contract with the com - pany nor has the company a right to demand that the village obligate itself to remove the mains upon thirty days notice. Under the statute (Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, Section 4267) the village is the owner of the public streets and may lay its water mains therein. It may lay them under the railroad tracks, the conditions being, of course, that the work must be carefully and safely done. The company and the village should cooperate so that the work may be quickly done without damaging the property of the railway company and without endangering persons employed or served by it. Very truly yours O. S. Spillman, Attorney General. By Hugh LaMaster, Assistant Attorney General. Lincoln, November 20, 1925. Mr. John E. Curtiss, Secretary, State Railway Commission, Office. Dear Sir: I am in receipt of your letter submitting the complaint of Mr. J. F. Moredick of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen against the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company, the complaint being that the company is not providing two brakemen for the operation of a self-propelled bridge derrick. The question is whether Section 5337, Compiled Statutes for 1922, applies to the operation of a self-propelled bridge derrick. It reads as follows: "It shall be unlawful for any railroad doing business in Ne - braska to operate or run over its road, or any part thereof, or to suffer or permit to be operated or run over its road, or any part thereof, outside of yard limits any freight train which is not manned with a crew consisting of one engineer, one fireman, one conductor and two brakemen: Provided, main line local freight trains running one hundred miles or more and carrying pas - sengers, local merchandise and doing station switching shall be provided with a crew consisting of one conductor, one engineer, one fireman, and three brakemen." </seg>
            <seg id="p519">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 519 The statute does not define the term "freight train" nor has the question presented ever been before the supreme court of this state. Several decisions from southern states define the term "freight train" but only in connection with a requirement of separate accom - modations for different classes of passengers. No court of final resort, so far as I have been able to find, has defined the term in connection with a statute like that under consideration. The only case found that appears to indicate that a work train might be considered as a freight train is C. B. &amp; Q. v. Johnson, 53 111. App. Rep. 478, where it was held that a work train was a freight train within the meaning of a municipal ordinance regulating speed. The case seems not to have gone to the supreme court of the state. The train was carrying company implements, machines and materials. The decision as to the character of the train may have been due to the lading. It is really dictum in any event as the company was plainly liable because the speed of the train that caused the death of the deceased was so great as to amount to a wanton and reckless disregard of the safety of the public irrespective of the ordinance. The ordinary meaning of the term "freight train" carries with it the idea of the transportation of freight by a carrier. Webster's dictionary defines it as "a railroad train made up of freight cars.." Section 5337 seems to use the term freight train in its ordinary mean - ing and is not broad enough to include the operation of a self-propelled bridge derrick. My conclusion is that a self-propelled bridge derrick does not come within Section 5337 and that two brakemen are not required by the statute. Very truly yours, O. S. Spillman, Attorney General.
