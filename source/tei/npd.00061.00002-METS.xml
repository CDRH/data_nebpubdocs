Dear Mr. Jackson: I regret to state that it will be impossible for me to be present at the coming annual meeting of the State Board of Agriculture on account of the condition of Mrs. Hawk's health.

            <seg id="p014">14 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: There is a quorum present. We will now proceed to the business and have the report of the Committee on Credentials. REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON CREDENTIALS BY MR. A. H. MILLER OF KENNARD: I want to say that one mistake that has been made in so many in - stances, instead of the Secretary or President of the local Fair Board sending in the credentials to our Secretary, they have either kept them at home, or they have kept them in their pockets, or they have sent them down to Mr. Smith, Secretary of the Nebraska Fair Managers' Association. Anyway they have been lost or have not come to us. I think we have met with that situation in about a dozen instances. BY MR. A. B. WOOD OF GERING: I am here representing Scottsbluff County by instructions received over the telephone. The present Secretary could not be here. BY MR. MILLER: We have a good many cases like that. Do you have any statement to file, sent in by the officials? BY MR. WOOD: That will probably be in during this afternoon in the mail, BY MR. MILLER: We don't wish our committee dismissed, if possible to retain it a little longer, as there may be other cases which we should take up. Next year we believe you should instruct your Presidents and Secre - taries to send down the credentials or write down to Mr. Jackson so he may have them on file. I think after while we will probably make it a rule that this must be done. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL Your report is that the delegates as read are correctly entitled to be seated. BY CHAIRMAN MILLER: Yes, it is correct. Those names have been called are the delegates to this convention and should be seated in this convention. I move that the names read by the Secretary as delegates be seated in this con - vention. Motion seconded. </seg>
            <seg id="p015">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 15 BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: You have heard this motion duly made and seconded. Are you ready for the question. The motion is that the delegates as read be seated in this convention. All in favor say "Aye"; contrary "No". The motion is carried. BY MR. MILLER: I have an amendment. We would like to strike the name of C. E. Genung, and substitute therefor John Link, of Rock County. Seconded. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: You have heard the motion that the name of the delegate from Rock County be stricken and the name of the other man be substituted and that John Linke be seated in this convention. All in favor say "Aye"; contrary "No". The motion is carried. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: Is there anything further in regard to the delegates. If not we will pass on to the next order of business. Following in the regular order of business as we have conducted it in the past, the next business to come before the meeting is the nomination of members of the Board to fill vacancies caused by the expiration of the terms of certain members at this time. I believe I will ask the Secretary to read these off the sheet BY MR. JACKSON: The names of those members whose terms expire at this time are: BY MR. MILLER: Upon further consideration and investigation and on behalf of the Credentials Committee I move that Mr. Wood be seated as a delegate from Scottsbluff County.

            <seg id="p019">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 19 PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS In dealing with the activities of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture, it is not my purpose to go back into history, but to deal with the problems of the present time and make a few recommendations for the near future. The Nebraska State Fair has gone steadily forward from its in - ception until today it takes rank with the leading organizations of its kind in the nation. With an annual attendance that reaches well above a quarter of a million, it is the popular vacation ground of Nebraska. Its grand exhibits of every grain, vegetable and plant that the soil of the central west produces, its wonderful showing of purebred live stock, of which none better can be found in the known world, its great industrial exhibits, its far reaching educational features and its clean and wholesome entertainment all go to make a mammoth exposition that is the pride and delight of the people of this great state. The monster institution that it is demands that its affairs be adminis - tered in a big and able way, if it continues its onward march of progress I would not have you believe that any great degree of credit is due to myself for the splendid success of this annual affair. As president of the organization, I am simply the spokesman of an untiring army of enthusiastic workers, whose loyalty to our great industries and whose love of state pride have spurred them on to the making of the Nebraska State Fair, a really great and outstanding exposition. The 1925 fair was beset by troubles that the human hand could not control. The weather man was most unkind and gave us a rainy week, keeping thousands of people away, and seriously interfering with several programs. One storm made it necessary to refund admission money to a grand stand full of people. Yet with this handicap, the attendance which reached 267,000 exceeded that of the previous year under perfect weather condition and was within two thousand of the record attendance for all time. Our enlarged camp ground, which we thought was ample prior to the opening of our gates, was filled to capacity by Monday noon of fair week, and acres of added space had to be provided. The management has already taken action to provide for this on - rush of state fair campers for next year, by opening several acres on the extreme west of the grounds. To do this a bridge will be put across the stream that separates this tract from the main grounds. This in - crease of camping capacity nearly doubles that of previous years. The entire camping grounds were planted to trees, shortly after the close of the fair and a few years hence will find plenty of shade for the tented army of people who visit us once each year. </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture The Nebraska State Fair has for some years taken an advance step in encouraging the younger generation. The boys and girls club work has been promoted to a degree that is quite outstanding among the larger fairs of this country. The club demonstration building with its great floor space, has become a show spot that has attracted state wide attention. This work is growing by leaps and bounds and it is impossible to keep up in building equipment with the progress of this great army of youth. I One outstanding need at the present time is a large — yes, we might a mammoth-club building for these boys and girls who are now ng the exhibit space at our county fairs and are clamoring for ce at the state fair that they may show to the world the wonderful ilts they are attaining. There is no investment for the younger gen - tion within the confines of all Nebraska that has a greater bearing the future outlook of our one great industry, than the erection of uitable show building on the state fair grounds for these boys and s. They are now rivalling and one might say, surpassing their lers and mothers in all avenues of farm production and in many ac - plishments of the home. The crowded quarters of 1924 became the gested quarter of 1925 and what will be done with these calf clubs, clubs and other exhibits of Nebraska boys and girls in 1926 and 7 is causing us great concern. Our beef and dairy cattle, our swine, our sheep, poultry and farm produce as well as our educational, art and industrial exhibits, are well housed, thanks to progressive legislators in past years. But we have problems ahead that are yet unsolved. The horse industry that was on the decline for several years is coming back and coming fast. The row of antequated sheds that house Nebraska's wonderful exhibit of purebred horses, should be replaced with a modern show barn in keeping with the great horse industry of a great livestock state. Some of our best breeders hesitate to exhibit their valuable stallions and mares, because the accomodations are poor and the fire risk great. A new building is one of the very great needs at this time. When one visits other large fairs of the country and compares our agricultural, live stock and industrial exhibits with those of the lead - ing expositions of the nation, we have every reason to be proud of the Nebraska State Fair. But when we make a survey of the ground equipment we find that the legislatures of many states have been more liberal in providing proper exhibit buildings than has our own state. The management of the State Fair, covering a long period of years, has no reason to be ashamed of what it has accomplished in a financial way. It is a matter of record that during a period of 24 years the re - ceipts of the fair have paid a million and a half dollars in premiums, buildings and permanent improvements while during the same period </seg>
            <seg id="p021">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 21 the legislature appropriated for buildings only $640,000. Every dollar that has come into the treasury above operating expense, has gone di - rectly into improvements. Operating expenses have been and are be - ing held down to the lowest possible point. There is only one salaried officer, the secretary and his compensation is barely in keeping with the great responsibilities of the position. Others are paid only a nominal sum sufficient to cover actual ex - penses. This is as it should be and we mention it only in connection with the efforts being made to hold down expense and build a great institution by those who are charged with this responsibility. Thus, when we say that the people of Nebraska should, through their legislative body, appropriate a sufficient sum to properly equip the state fair grounds, we come with clean hands and are not embarrassed with inquiries regarding salaried officers or extravagant use of funds. There have been no buildings erected on the grounds, through state aid, during the past five years. However, during the past year some important ground improvements have been made. The securing of the debris of the old capitol building and the dirt from the excavation for the new one, some 2000 carloads, have worked wonders in trans - forming waste land and useless lake into a valuable and useful tract of ground. For this we are indebted to a progressive legislature and to the members of the capitol commission, who co-operated in every way possible. The last legislature gave us a maintenance appropriation of $55,000, and had it not been for this we would have been in red figures, owing to heavy repairs and ground upkeep. I wish at this time to express the fullest appreciation of the splendid co-operation accorded us by the business interests and citizens of Lin - coln. The city administration, the chamber of commerce, the various clubs, the business firms, both great and small, the railroad officials of various lines and other interested corporations centered in the city have been very helpful in making it possible to put over the Nebraska State Fair in a really big way. One result of this splendid co-operation is the acquiring of the new auto building erected last summer. This building was entirely financed by auto dealers of Lincoln at a cost of more than twenty-five thousand dollars. At the end of a ten year period it automatically becomes the property of the state without cost. This much needed building could not have been acquired in any other wav and the fact that the auto dealers are interested to the ex - tent of this large expenditure guarantees a wonderful and permanent exhibit of this popular commodity. I would call your attention to the efforts made by the management </seg>
            <seg id="p022">22 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture in giving to the people a clean and moral fair. In arranging the enter - tainment and amusement program every possible effort has been made to keep it high class. People come to the fair for a vacation, attracted largely by our great educational exhibits, but entertainment is essential and that entertainment must be clean and of a quality that is out - standing, if we expect to satisfy a critical public. It is necessary, for obvious reasons, to open the fair to the public on Sunday and it is gratifying to know that the policy of arranging a program in keeping with the day meets with general approval. The 1926 fair should see a more outstanding observance and a stronger Sunday program than ever before. Sacred concerts, religious services, a speaker of national fame and a Sunday evening program of real merit are now considered possible. The amusement grounds should remain closed all day and evening as in recent years. The management should make Sunday on the fair grounds so attractive to church going people that the Lincoln churches of all denominations will feel justified in closing their morning places of worship and all join in one great service at the fair grounds auditorium. We believe it possible to make the Sunday attendance one of the largest of the week and the pro - gram one that will appeal to all church going people and to the public at large. I wish to commend the managers of county fairs of Nebraska that have cleaned their grounds of crooked game and questionable show. And to those who have not yet done this, I would say you cannot do a bigger thing for your fair than to cut them out. There is nothing to the argument that concession money for games is necessary to finance the fair. Rides for the children are all right, clean shows are not objectionable, but the game generally speaking can well be called a graft, followed to a large extent by the professional crook, who travels the circuit of fairs. It is unfair to invite an army of guests within your gates and then have the unsuspecting fleeced of his money. The crooked gamester may run straight until the grand rush is on and when the fair officials are buried with a multiplicity of duties, the game changes and after it is too late you find a percentage of the people whom you regard as your guests have been fleeced. My advice is to cut out the games, make the shows go clean or close them up and give the young folks the rides. Your receipts will be greater and your people will stand back of you. Give the public plenty of entertainment and plenty of sport, but let it be clean. The State Fair has cashed in more money from its amusement grounds without the games than it ever did with them. The county fair can do the same thing. The State Fair is growing by leaps and bounds. It is the show win</seg>  
            <seg id="p023">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 23 dow of a great agricultural state whose products of the farm and range rank fifth among the states of the union. It is the exposition grounds of great industries, both within and without our borders, who depend on prosperous Nebraska for a market. It is a great educational center for one week where people in every walk of life from everywhere, gain knowledge of the vocation, the profession or the calling they are most interested in. And with this great educational opportunity, comes the relaxation from business cares and wonderful entertainment. There is no doubt in the mind of the fair management that the admission price of 50 cents is entirely too low to properly finance such a great institution. The constant demand for more and larger premiums in all departments, the increasing cost of repair and upkeep of buildings and grounds and the steadily increasing overhead as the institution grows, makes it a difficult problem to keep the expenses within bounds of the receipts. Yet it does not seem advisable to raise the price of admission in face of the fact that other state fairs have a fifty cent gate. The benefit to the state at large derived by reason of this great exposition, seems rather to justify a popular admission and in l'eu thereof to secure financial help in buildings and ground improvements from the state. I would say to the people of the various counties of Nebraska, stand by your county fair. Give your hearty support and co-operation to your county fair officials. They are doing a grand work for your section of the state and are real factors in the development of Nebraska. In closing I wish to call the attention of the people of the state to the debt of gratitude they owe to the men who during a long term of years have fostered and built this splendid institution. Money can - not buy the loyal service and self sacrifice contributed by the members of the State Board of Agriculture, the county fair men scattered in every section of the state and the army of men and women who each year contribute toward the making of the State Fair. They do it because they love Nebraska and have a just pride in seeing her resources shown to the world in a big and grand way. It is these men and women who have made it possible for the Nebras - ka State Fair to take rank among the leading institutions of its kind in America. To this army of workers, with whom I have been associated the past year and especially to the officers and board of managers, I want to express my deep appreciation for the splendid co-operation and hearty support. It is your work and your loyality that accomplished the results attained. </seg>
            <seg id="p024">24 Repobt of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: kThe next step, I believe, should be the report from the Secretary, Jackson. Now Mr. Jackson has prepared a report which I am you will find very interesting and he will now favor us. SECRETARY'S REPORT Lin compliance with the statute governing my official transactions Secretary of the State Board of Agriculture, I hereby submit the ual report for the year ending December 31, 1925. Agriculture is and ever will be the basic resource and industry in Nebraska. To foster this industry is to befriend and build up every other industry and to cripple it is to impair every activity which con - tributes to the welfare of the people. As I look back into history and glance through the records of this Association for past years and connect them with the pictures that hang on the walls of our office, you can not help but feel what a wonderful organization for service it has been and what an opportunity to erect a monument for the early pioneer of Nebraska. Not a monument to be thought of for its intrinsic value alone but portraying the resources of our great state, the possibilities for future development, the educa - tional work, factories, soil and its products, all built upon a super - structure, the basis of all material wealth; AGRICULTURE. If I was privileged to design this monument I would have it read first above all, dedicated to the Pioneer of Nebraska, who were charter members of this organization of inspiration and enthusiasm, and then realizing our responsibility, I would say, we stand for Boys and Girls, Better Homes and a higher standard of citizenship. Our motto should be Service to All, and should carry out the real meaning of the word Fair. As the years come and go, we find wider fields for service opening. If Fairs are to be leaders in rural life, its organization and methods must be carefully outlined in advance to be in accord with the condi - tions that control success in such enterprises; or in other words, our thoughts must be years ahead of the time, so we may be ready to meet the conditions as they appear. Every Fair, even if assisted by appropriation, will be largely de - pendent upon public patronage for its success. If public patronage is to be secured and held, the Fair as a whole must be made sufficiently interesting to attract those whose presence is desired. This is a very fast age we are living in and people in general are not satisfied unless the best and latest in all exhibits is to be seen. It is not enough to know and see the prize winners but they are anxious to know the reason why. Each and every department of our State Fair should be sim- </seg>
            <seg id="p025">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 25 plif.ed and be made more educational. With this thought in mind I would advise that your Secretary be instructed to insert in the premium list at the head of each department, when that department will be judged, and that all exhibitors are requested to be present and are privileged to ask questions of the judge, who should be qualified to answer. We found that the banners used last year in each department did a great deal in getting the patrons of the Fair interested in the judging and many questions were answered by the judges and super - intendents. It is rather expensive but it would be a good investment to have all judges engaged for the entire Fair for the purpose of answer - ing questions in the department that he judged. The fundamental principle of education is to increase the earning value of the child and to prepare him for life's race. With our present system, some are prepared and many are not. My sympathy reaches out to those that need help. A boy starts to school, he may not get started just right or he may not be just as bright as the other members of his class, or his environment at home may not be such that would develop him intellectually and he finally gets discouraged and is carried along through school and finally graduates from the twelfth grade, or at least he is presented with his certificate that he has finished school and steps out in the world, but not educated, because he has built on the sand with no foundation. An education based on the period of time in school rather than what he has accomplished will never stand out and is of very little value to anyone, the individual or tho-e he comes in contact with. There are too many of our young people step - ping out of school with nothing but a diploma to carry them through. We have robbed the boy of his education and the school district of their money. We have no right, as desirable citizens, to criticize the raising of funds by taxation for the purpose of educating our young people, but we do have a right to criticize the way it shall be expended, and the quicker that those that are responsible for the education of our young people realize that every young person as a member of society, whose protection they enjoy, owes to civilization a debt which can be discharged only by increasing the wealth of the state where they reside both financially and morally, by putting into life more than they take out of it, by creating or producing more than they consume. Every man owes to himself and to those dependent upon him the duty to earn a livelihood, but the country owes no man a living simply because he elects to live in it, but only an opportunity equal with every other man to make one. The highest scale of education in my judgment, is to make yourself useful and apply what you know. After investing mil - lions of dollars annually for education in Nebraska, we have a right to expect that our young educated people will be an inspiration in the community where they reside and give service to society. The Nebraska State Board of Agriculture realizing their responsibility to our Boys </seg>
            <seg id="p026">26 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture and Girls that need help are by their demonstrations, graphic exhibits and Club Work doing a wonderful educational work. Few people realize that the United States is now the greatest dairy country on earth. I take it from a letter written by Professor Davis to the Nebraska Farmer of October 31st issue, that we have twenty-five million dairy cows in the United States valued at one billion three hun - dred million dollars. When you speak of millions it is hard to compre - hend. If you were going to transport all the dairy cows from the United States it would require 625,000 cars; this would make a train 4,735 miles long or a train reaching from New York to San Francisco and then have a train that would reach from Omaha to the extreme western part of the state and return. This country has one-fourth the producing capacity of the world. From these twenty-five million cows are produced one hundred fourteen billion pounds of milk an - nually, which is made into one thousand nine hundred fifty-six million pounds of butter, four hundred seventeen million pounds of cheese, one thousand seven hundred million pounds of condensed milk, two hundred eighty-five million gallons of ice cream, to say nothing of powdered milk, milk chocolate, etc. Each person in the United States consumes fifty-four gallons of milk per year. The total production of our dairy cows in Nebraska amounts to 2,111,440,000 pounds of milk, we consume 155,564,640 pounds and have; an annual surplus of 1,855,875,000 pounds of milk. It is no wonder when we come face to face with the facts that Nebraska's citizens have interested capital to such an extent that thou - sands of dollars are being invested in the improvement of the dairy interest in Nebraska. After visiting the dairy country of Wisconsin last fall, I am thoroughly convinced that what we need in Nebraska is not more cows but better cows and better business methods applied. If the Nebraska Dairy Improvement Association does nothing more than to put the dairy interests of Nebraska on a business foundation it has been worth while and should be encouraged. In fact, farming in general when studied and analyzed will be found to be, under present day conditions, a highly competitive industry and the products of the farm in bulk are subject to the same economic laws as the products of the factory or mine. Hence the farmer should consider his operation in a business way and in the light of national and even world wide competition. Today more than ever before the farmer and stock grower is at the mercy of organized consumers and is caught coming and going. The farmer must not only study his business, but he must inform himself on matters of world production, distribution and consumption and the laws and tariff that govern if he is to achieve success. Circumstances and conditions beyond the farmer's control have made agriculture a business </seg>
            <seg id="p027">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 27 subject to all the laws of business and dependent in a large measure for success upon the application of business principles and methods and the sooner the fact is generally recognized the better it will be for all concerned. Draft Horse Exhibit The draft horse exhibit was all that we might expect. Many classes were hotly contested and at each day's judging large crowds were as - sembled around the ring. This indicates that there is still an interest in good horses and the quality of the exhibit is improving very rapidly. The- markets are looking for the best draft horses regardless of breed. Every person likes a good horse. Next to a dog a horse becomes the most devoted companion of any of our domestic animals. We offered this last year the sum of $4,227.00, of this amount $3,330.00 was awarded. Most all breeds were represented and many mules, jacks and jennets. $1,202.00 was awarded outside of the state and $2,128.00 in the state. Cattle Show Our great Cattle Building was a wonderful sight. It has a capacity of approximately two thousand head and it was fairly well filled with the best in the land. There was one thing very noticeable however, and that is of the $10,762.00 won, $7,214.00 was awarded out of the state and $3,548.00 within the state. This does not include the calf clubs. A great deal of credit is due the cattle breeders for the great improvement made in the standard of beef cattle in the past years, not only have they improved their beef animal to the extent of many more pounds of beef from the food consumed, but by judicious breeding and care have developed an animal that manufactures more pounds of high priced beef. All the best cuts of beef are high up on any meat animal, the wider the backs the more high class beef and the improvement is very noticeable. Swine Show It seems by the report of our Superintendent of the Swine Show that as the years go by the exhibit is increasing in numbers, which is very encouraging. The sales of breeding stock are very satisfactory. Hundreds of head of males and females, the best the land affords, are being shipped into every state in the Union. There was a time not many years ba'ck, that a successful swine breeder must have at the head of his herd a male raised in Ohio or Illinois, but now we find Ohio and Illinois breeders coming to Nebraska for heads of their herds and it is very gratifying to know this. Production and Consumption of Pork Our annual crop of marketable hogs is 5,735,000. The average weight on the market is 250 pounds or 1,433,750,000 pounds of pork. We consume 78 pounds per capita or 101,117,016. This leaves a surplus </seg>
            <seg id="p028">28 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture i 1,332,632,984 pounds or 60,574 carloads. It would take a train 458 es long to move our surplus pork in Nebraska. Poultry Exhibit tThe Poultry Building was well filled, there were nearly sixteen dred of the finest birds ever shown at the Nebraska State Fair. ry breed was represented with birds of quality, representing the strains. Hard competition and very much interest shown. The State of Nebraska ranks fourth in the production of eggs and poultry per capita, compared with the states of the Union. Poultry on Nebraska farms is not a side line, it is an important business. The value of eggs alone exceeds the gold output of any state; it is exceeded in value by the two principle grain crops, corn and wheat only. Ne - braska's production for 1925 was 70,000,000 dozen eggs, which is 840, - 000,000 eggs. One can hardly grasp the immensity of the poultry business in Nebraska. Allowing six eggs to the foot you would have &amp; row of eggs 26,515 miles long or you would have seven rows of eggs reaching' from New York to Los Angeles. We consume in Nebraska 216 eggs per capita, our annual consumption is 280,016,352 or we would have a surplus of eggs amounting to the enormous number of 569,983,648. We raise approximately 12,000,000 birds annually and consume five birds per capita or 6,481,860 or we would have a surplus of chickens number - ing 5,518,140. Sugar In Nebraska I Nebraska has five large sugar refineries. In 1924 these five factories ed to the western farmer, four million, nine hundred seventy-nine iars for seven hundred and sixty-six tons of beets, or at the rate of dollars and fifty cents per ton. These beets were manufactured into i hundred and ten million pounds of sugar; the average wholesale :e of sugar in 1924 was around $8.00 per hundred, or the total value the 1924 crop of sugar was $16,800,000.00. The average consumption sugar in Nebraska is approximately one hundred pounds per capita, last census gave Nebraska 1,296,372 people, hence the amount con - ned annually would be 129,637,000 or we would have a surplus of ;ar of 80,363,000 pounds valued at $648,000.00. It would be neces - y, to move our surplus sugar, counting fifty thousand pounds of ;ar to the car, to have 1,620 cars. t Sugar beets are raised extensively in the irrigated districts of the em part of the state, we have 442,690 acres of land now under ation and the possibilities of many more acres in the very near Wheat Raised In Nebraska tThe 1925 wheat crop was short approximately twenty-four million els, but in the face of this fact we produced 34,150,000 bushels of and spring wheat, made into flour of forty-two pounds to the bushel, </seg>
            <seg id="p029">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 29 makes a grand total of 1,434,300,000 pounds of flour. The per capita consumption of flour in Nebraska, according to the report of the United States Department of Agriculture, is about seventy pounds. We in Ne- braska would consume 90,746,040 pounds. After deducting 2,676,000 bushels of wheat for seed, or if manufactured into flour would be 112,392,000 pounds of flour, we still have a surplus of 1,321,908,000 pounds of flour, or enough flour to last Nebraska for nearly fifteen years after the seed for the next year's crop has been deducted. To move this surplus flour from the state it would require 52,876 freight cars or would make a train four hundred miles long. While we boast of our great agricultural state and its per capita production of food products, after all it is hard to say where agriculture stops and manufacturing begins. Inasmuch as the raw material pro- duced in Nebraska are predominantly agriculture, the manufacturers of the state are linked up with agriculture. The total value of all field crops for the year 1924 was $362,534,000.00 but after it was manufactured into the many finished products, pork, beef, mutton, poultry, bakeries, crackers, breakfast foods, sugar and many other factories that convey Nebraska's raw material into food ready for the table, then Nebraska manufactured products have an annual value of $600,000,000.00. Nebraska stands third this year in corn production. The total bushels raised were 236,000,000. Eighty per cent of all corn raised will be man- ufactured into beef, pork and mutton on our 124,419 farms. We seldom class farms as factories, still their 1924 output of meats amounted to approximately $242,124,700.00. Production and Consumption of Nebraska's Products Beef Produced 1,400,000,000 pounds, Consumption 103,709,760 pounds Surplus 1,296,290,240 pounds 1,296,290,240 pounds Hogs Produced 1,433,750,000 Consumption 101,117,016 pounds Surplus 1,332,632,984 pounds 1,332,632,984 pounds Mutton Produced 39,050,000 pounds Consumption 8,628,418 pounds Surplus 30,421,582 pounds 30,421,582 pounds Surplus of all Meat 1,659,344,800 pounds Eggs Produced 1,086,487,560 Consumption 226,865,100 Surplus 859,622,460 </seg>
            <seg id="p030">30 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Horse Racing A Fair to be successful must respond to the demands of its patrons. Some pay their admission and are satisfied with the educational features, while others with an inventive turn of mind will be found in the machinery department, those interested in stock will be found at their particular department, but there are others that come just in time to get a good seat in the grand stand to see the racing. Horse racing at fairs has been the outstanding attraction for time immemorial. We had a field of horses entered at the Nebraska 1925 Fair second to none, but on ac - count of the heavy track our speed program was not a success. Camp Grounds The new method of handling the campers at this year's Fair was a decided success and met with the approval of those camping. Instead of being aroused at six o'clock in the morning by ticket collectors in the round-up, they were allowed to remain in their tents as late as they Eired, turning in their tickets at the camp ground gate as they visited fair. The new fence separating the two areas also served to pro - e greater privacy for the campers. At least 3,000 people took ad - vantage of Nebraska's Vacation Week and established their residence in the tented city of the Nebraska State Fair, they came from all parts of the state and many from other states; family groups, neighborhood companions and hundreds of old time friends meeting for the weeks. Aggressive dairymen and merchants supplied demands for milk and groceries, there seemed to be every convenience necessary. This department seems to be growing faster and spreading further than any other department of the state fair. It is one place in Nebraska that you can live almost as cheaply as you can at home and in addi - tion enjoy all the amusements and educational features that the great Nebraska Fair has to offer. We speak of the State Fair as a great educational institution in a'l of our advertisements. We like to emphasize the fact that it is a school of practical education where students from every walk of life may be iugar Produced 210,000,000 pounds Consumption 129,637,000 pounds Surplus 80,363,000 pounds Produced 1,434,300,000 pounds Consumption 90,746,040 pounds Surplus 1,345,553,960 pounds lilk Produced 2,111,440,000 pounds Consumption 155,564,640 pounds - Surplus 1,955,875.360 pounds lounds </seg>
            <seg id="p031">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 31 informed. But after all very little can be derived from an educational viewpoint in visiting the Fair but one day, and it seems that one of our greatest responsibilities is to educate and encourage the people and show the importance of Nebraska's Vacation Week, then I am sure it can truly be said that Nebraska has one institution of learning where people of every age and every walk of life may register, side by side with college students and professors and study the subjects taught, because it is not necessary to have a college education nor a technical knowledge of books to understand lessons taught by comparison and demonstration. We might as well face the situation as we see it. In five years from now, without a question of a doubt, we will have ten thousand people camping on the grounds. We must begin to meet the situation. With this thought in mind the Board has authorized the following improve - ments, the grading and planting of trees in the camp grounds, also provide more available space by building a bridge across the creek where there is about eight acres of land for camping. At this time we have three hundred sixteen elm and sixty-seven maple trees set out, covering the camp ground completely at a cost of $1,969.60, with a systematic ar - rangement that in the near future will make an ideal camp ground. Nebraska State Fair on Wheels Fairs should be a market place for inspiration, enthusiasm, co - operation and feature demonstrations that radiate farther and faster than any other wave link. We find too many people come just in time to get a good seat in the grand stand and do not familiarize themselves with the wonderful work that is being done in the different activities of the Fair. This year for the first time at the Nebraska State Fair, or any other State Fair, so far as we know, we»put the Fair in motion in front of the grand stand; the better babies, girls' cooking and canning club, boys' pig club, boys' calf club, boy scouts, horses, catt'e, mach'nery, automobiles, several bands, floats from exhibitors, in fact every exhibit on the fair grounds that could move was in this parade and the story of the State Fair was told through the loud speaker as the parade passed. The parade was pronounced a real success. The remarkable thing about this parade is that the different sections could be organized and gathered together from all classes over the ground and started with only ten minutes' delay. It never could have been accomplished without the full - est co-operation of all the superintendents of the different departments. This feature should be encouraged. It can be made the one outstanding day of the Fair. </seg>

In evidence of his fact I only need to call your atten- tion to the surplus of food products raised from our fertile fields. The amount of surplus Nebraska products was derived after a thorough in- vestigation of the report of the United States Department of Agriculture and the United States Federal Division of Agriculture and reports that come to our office, they are as reliable as is possible to get and might say is authority. Nebraska's agricultural record is a compliment to her farmers, it not only shows the fertility of the soil but the intelligence of our rural population. In closing I want you to know that I appreciate the co-operation received from all superintendents in staging Nebraska's Best Fair and to the officers and the Executive Board for their advise and labors. I would feel guilty indeed if I should close without in some way showing my appreciation for the one man above all that has done so much in the past seven years to build up Nebraska's Great Fair and Exposition, I have reference to Morris Reichenbach, our Superintendent of Grounds who has worked faithfully and through his wise council we have been prepared to say each year that we are ready, that the curtain will rise. He deserves a lot of credit for the success of the Fair. And to my efficient office help I can not find words to express my apprecia- tion for their splendid work.

Without efficient office help our State Fair would be a failure, because it would be impossible to dispose of the volume of business in such a short time. We can not give too much credit to our office help, I doubt whether their equal can be found for their particular line of work, the days are never too long for them, and it matters not who your secretary may be, the work of the office and the Fair grounds will proceed in regular form.

He said that he had served as Chair- man of this committee for many years and regularly made this report. Bat inasmuch as he had two new members on this committee, Senator Vance and myself, he insisted that we be thoroughly initiated.

BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: It has been moved and seconded that the report of the Auditing Committee be accepted and adopted. All in favor say "Aye", con- trary "No." Motion carried. BY SENATOR VANCE OF ADAMS COUNTY: As a member of the auditing Committee I feel as though I would not be doing my duty if I did not take a little time at this point to say a word or two as to the condition in which we found the books. I want to say that they were in the most up to date and complete set of books I ever had the pleasure of examining. I want to take this opportunity of commending Mrs. Gadd on her faithful manner in which she has handled those books. BY TREASURER BANNING: I would like to call the attention of some of the Treasurers of local fairs to the fact that if you have any trouble along the line of handling your ticket system that I would be glad to go into the matter with you individually and give you all of the information that I could. I think we have worked out a very thorough system on our State Fair Grounds with regard to handling the tickets. As the fellow says we have prob- ably stolen our plunder from Des Moines but we have changed it some and applied it to our individual conditions until we have got it work- </seg>
            <seg id="p044">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 44 ing so that we know how our tickets are going. We are able to check up on a man at a time and know whether he is short or long. I haven't ff of the tickets here. They are out at the Fair Grounds. But I can ; them for you upon short notice and if any of you are interested ng that line I will be very glad to give the information to you as how to handle that ticket system. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: The next order of business is the report of the revision committee, on the revision of the premium lists. I don't think that committee has finished their work and they have been working for two days now. BY MR. WEAVER: Before we take up any other matter I want to explain part of the report as to the receipts and expenditures which was prepared by the Secretary as part of his report. The basis of his information was the report we made outside of the item of the receipts of the dog show. That was not received in time to be printed as an item. Then there is the item of the interest in that automobile building which now a - mounts to one-tenth the value of the building because in time we will receive all of the concession money and will own that building. But the Auditing committee has concluded that when the report is printed we ought to charge a balance. Everything is in that report but we feel that anyone could get at it a little easier if they would strike a balance. Mr. Jackson has said that they would do that hereafter. There is a big item there of probably forty-two thousand dollars maintenance and another item of three thousand dollars for permanent improvements. We believed that this report should hereafter show our interest as it accrues in that building. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: The Committee on resolutions should be ready to report.

But no doubt as the time is yet early, there are other matters somebody would like to take up before this meeting. There is one matter that we always take care of at this annual meeting. And I think we might as well take care of it at this time as at any other. That is the matter of paying the delegates. What do you desire to allow. This is always done by motion. The chair will be glad to entertain a motion at this time if you desire to take it up. I would say for the information of those here that the custom is to allow the railroad fare together I think with possibly four dollars per diem for three days. BY MR.

If not the chair will entertain a mo - tion to adjourn at any time, but we want to give opportunity to every - one to take up anything that you would like to have taken up. BY SECRETARY JACKSON: We have a report of the first annual school of fair management held in Chicago in 1924. In fact it is the first one ever held in the United States or in the world, at the University of Chicago. They have prepared a book and there is so much good information in that publication that our board has seen fit to purchase some of these and will present one to each county fair in the state. I think it would be well if you would get these tomorrow morning at about the time we hold the election, and they will be ready. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: I want to add to what Mr. Jackson has said and I have reason to believe from looking over that book that there is very considerable valuable information to fair people. It is an outstanding work. I am sure you will find it of great value and would suggest that the delegates take these books with them and keep them for their fair managements of the various counties. BY MR. CHARLES GRAFF OF CUMING COUNTY: Mr. Chairman: The hour not being late it seems to me that we might have just a little experience meeting for this short time. I am inclined to think that a good many of you people here today are at least interested in the great movement that is making a tremendous headway and is rapidly crystalizing in this great central west, composed of about a dozen states. To begin at the beginning, gentlemen, I might say something re - garding where this great movement started. It started about a year ago in the States of Illinois, Minnesota and Iowa chiefly and is called the American Council of Agriculture. This movement has been grow - ing very rapidly. It has now reached the point where on the twenty - eighth of this month a great meeting will be held in Des Moines, Iowa. You no doubt have read that our Governor of Nebraska has taken no small interest in this movement. The purpose of this movement, gen - tlemen, is to interest our national Congress in legislation which will eventually put agriculture on an equality with the other industries and business of this country. I don't know whether it would be regarded as proper here in this meeting or at this time to take this matter up but </seg>
            <seg id="p047">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 47 I feel that while we are representing this great chief industry in this state in particular that we should interest ourselves in this movement. We should inform ourselves in regard to these matters. I know that in the national Congress today there are more bills being thrown into the congressional hopper that sound nice prepared by Congressmen who present them chiefly for the purpose of making their election perhaps a little more easy the next time. Hundreds of these bills we know will never be taken up even in committee and that when they are introduced the introducer doesn't expect that they will ever be given an oppor - tunity except have these bills printed so they can point them out to the constituents in his district. I don't think there is anything wrong, gentlemen, in calling attention to the fact that those people who are our public servants down there should be responsive to those who send them there. I am afraid there are times when those representatives forget who they are representing when they get down there and they get into environment that is so much different than what they have at home that many of them, though well meaning, and no doubt with the best of intentions go more or less astray on these big problems that you and I are interested in out here. Now, gentlemen, this movement has for its chief purpose the going before Congress with a concrete program of demands and not requests, but demanding. The word re - quest is all very nice but the word demand has so much more strength to it. I don't think there is anything out of the way for this body to discuss and take up our personal in this matter and that before we adjourn tomorrow that we pass some resolution of some sort recognizing the efforts of those handling this great movement. I do not want to go into details in this matter. I have been away from home a num - ber of days and I have just returned from a session of three days in Kansas City where I was on the stand and was razzed around for the biggest part of a day by a regiment of railroad lawyers. It seems that those fellows had me spotted and that they had my record and consequently I wasn't handled very roughly. The meeting at Kansas City at the present time, as you know, is before the Interstate Com - merce Commission and is held for the purpose of a hearing upon the five per cent increase in freight rates but they confined the testimony only to such interests of this company as were supporting or non - supporting this proposition. The producer had his inning yesterday an&lt;j[ he was allowed to tell of the woes, trials and tribulations he had passed through in the Missouri and Mississippi Valley section of this coui\iry in the past four or five years. Some of them testified to an awful story and some of them spoke in a rather pessimistic tone. We don't always • feel just that way. You know I have always been classed in puhlkj life as being somewhat of an optimist. I have tried to continue to be such but you know sometimes in the last couple years at least when I read a good many articles some of which are mostly bunk and are written up by fellows back in the industrial portion of this country tell - ing how well off we are and how you know and I know as compared. </seg>
            <seg id="p048">48 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture to those industries that the Nebraska farmer is not getting a square deal, at least in this grain growing section of this country and this live stock region, we don't consider it hardly fair. Here we are raising food for the rest of the world to give them a fair compensation for our labors. I believe, gentlemen, that the State Board of Agriculture is an appro - priate party to consider such a matter and that we should stand up and declare ourselves and I suggest that before we adjourn this session this evening that you will discuss these matters and perhaps we can fix up. We can't take up as much time as we would like to but I want to assure you now that we should enter into this discussion further. In closing I will say that I really think it is right that this body should have an endorsement of some kind in favor of that movement as I have outlined to you. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: I would like to say to Mr. Graff that the Committee on Resolutions has never been dismissed and they are still open for suggestions for work in their line. We would like to hear from somebody on this matter for it is a very important matter. (Calls came from different parts of the house for Mr. A. J. Weaver.) BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: Mr. Weaver has been called for. He is another one of the com - mittee of fifty that recently met with our Governor. BY MR. A. J. WEAVER: Mr. President, Gentlemen of the Board, I want to congratulate this Board of Agriculture upon having as able a fighter as Charlie Graff. Every time I see Charlie Graff, and especially when I see him in action, I am reminded of the story of the man who was considered a great hunter at home. He was going to try his luck in the jungles of Africa hunting lions. He had his equipment ready and bad engaged a gu'de to go with him into the lair of the lions. They subsequently ran into the tracks of a lion. This Englishman went back to his guide and said, when he was confronted with the cries of the lion, you go ahead and see where he went and I will go back and see where he came from. Now Charlie Graff never did that because Charlie Graff believes in Ne - braska and because he believes in this great basic resources of our State he has attempted to do something to put the production of the farm on a parity with industry and business. He knows and you kmw that we are an agricultural state. The statistics read today by your Secretary show that Nebraska can be proud of her production and her success as an agricultural state. We are not busted. We are not im - poverished but all we do ask is that we be placed upon an equality with other great businesses of America. This is our great business. We have forty million people throughout our nation dependent upon agriculture. We have an annual production of eight billion dollars. We have several times as much represented in this great industry as </seg>
            <seg id="p049">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 49 we have represented in the investment of the railroads of the United States. This is our great resource and if we cannot be satisfied to stand up for this great resource we reflect discredit upon our state. We know that in the last five years the farm dollar in Nebraska has been cut down to an average of seventy cents. They say now that it is worth eighty-five cents but for five years we have suffered a discount on the value of our farm dollar. That is the reason that the great industries and businesses have grown by intensive organization and that is what the great farm leaders like Governor Lowden have been talk ; ng about for years in explaining cooperative organization, which is fine when we have it. But it is hard to get six and one-half million pro - ducers to co-operate effectively against the great business interests of this nation. We know that we have set up in America what is called in the American system of government a protection in the way of artificial barriers which we have erected for industries and buvness. We know that we are likewise justified in demanding that if this is set up for manufacturing that the same form of protective tariff apply for agriculture; we know that the same barriers are operat'ng for em - ployers. We know that we have the same artificial barriers set up for labor in the United States in the way of the Railroad Labor Board, and we know that we have even set them up for labor in the way of what is known as the Immigration Law, we know that we have set them up for the railroads of the United States in the way of the Esch- Cummins law and in the way of the Interstate Commerce Commission. We know that we have all of these protections in America because we are maintaining this American system. We recognize that there is a difference between our standards of living in the United States and the standards of living in other countries of the world, in countries of Europe and in the countries to the south of us and if those standards, the American standards of living that are created and protected by these artificial barriers are justified in those instances and for those factors, then we feel that we are justified in asking that that system include agriculture and that agriculture shall not be left out, that that system should be extended to make application to agriculture. We contend that it is un-American and indefensible to continue leaving out agri - culture. Now, I don't know just what should be done but as Charlie Graff says I think we should demand an equality in affairs of the productive world and demand an equality for the producers of this region. Now this organization that he speaks of is doing a great work. It is building a wholesale public opinion to call attention to these inequalities and to the fact that either this system should be extended to include agricul - ture or that it is basically wrong. Public opinion is the greatest factor in America and when kindled by the fires of free discussion then it brings forth a correction of such ills and when backed by a correct public opinion then the public authorities write the correction into law. I believe that it is absolutely right that we should discuss a question of </seg>
            <seg id="p050">50 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture such public importance as this one raised by Charlie Graff. We should make known our position on such questions. These resolutions adopted by this conference held by the Governor recently do not set forth a specific plan but say that in a way that an expert surplus, a surplus of possibly ten or fifteen per cent controls the price of the other eighty - five per cent of our production, and when this small surplus is put on the European market it becomes the basis for setting the price for the great majority of production. It is a fact that we will endeavor to outline a plan by which the great production market may be protected •gainst this unbalanced condition. And if this highly protective tariff is necessary for manufacture and necessary for labor we should apply it to agriculture. We should either do that or we should go to a free trade market. Either we should include agriculture in this American system or the American system should be revised entirely. We cer - tainly have a right to insist that the farmer should be allowed to sell in the same kind of a market in which he buys. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: Is there anything further? I think we are developing some orators here. BY SENATOR WOOD OF GERING: I can't see how there could be any great amount of reluctance in this body, or how this great State Board of Agriculture should be reluctant to take up the consideration of a question of this kind. I think we have listened to a couple very able presentations of this situation and that our position should be presented to the public. I do not believe we should throw any larger burden on the Committee of Resolutions so I am won - dering if it might not be in order at this time to suggest the appoint - ment «of a sub-committee to prepare resolutions to be taken up through the main committee. I believe that it would also be in order to sug - gest naming upon that committee Mr. Graff, Mr. Weaver, and some other gentleman, possibly Senator Perry Reed or Senator Vance, and put that sub-committee to work to present such resolutions through the general committee. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: The chair will entertain such a motion, BY SENATOR WOOD OF GERING: I move that appointment of a committee of three for such a purpose as I just outlined. Motion seconded. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: It has been moved and seconded that a committee of three be ap - pointed by the chair to form resolutions along the line of the talk that we have just heard with reference to this great agricultural movement, to report such resolutions to the main Resolution Committee. Are you </seg>

The chair is going to appoint on that committee Mr. A. J. Weaver, Mr. Charles Graff and Mr. R. R. Vance. BY SENATOR VANCE OF ADAMS COUNTY: Mr. President. I do not want to beg out on any such important duty, but I have a lot of things to do from now on. I've got to look up a number of attractions and take care of some other matters which could not be looked after while I was busy upon the Auditing Committee. So I feel as if I cannot give the proper amount of time to this new duty and I wish to ask you to appoint someone else in my place. BY SENATOR PURCELL: Then I will name Senator A. B. Wood on that committee. BY MR. A. J. WEAVER OF RICHARDSON: I wish to suggest that Mr. Graff be made Chairman of that com - mittee. BY MR. A. B. WOOD: As the third member of the committee I wish to concur in the sug - gestion that Mr. Graff be chairman. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: If the committee wishes to change the order in which the appoint - ments were made they can get together and name their own chairman. I want to say this committee is capable of giving us some very good resolutions. BY A MEMBER: I now move that we adjourn. Seconded. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: If there is nothing else to come up before the meeting we will now entertain this motion to adjourn. All in favor say "Aye," contrary "No." The motion is carried. BY MR. E. J.

            <seg id="p052">52 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture BY SECRETARY JACKSON: There seems to be one question that should be settled before the official roll-call is made. It seems that in previous years Dodge County has had two fairs and that they have been heretofore allowed one-half vote each. It seems this year there is just one representative present, Mr. Rogers for Scribner, though there are two fairs in the County. There should be a definite decision upon that matter made by this meeting. What will you do in this case ? BY MR. UEHLING OF BURT COUNTY: I would move that where there is a County having two fairs repre - sented here by only one member present that the member present cast the full vote for the county. BY MR. QUIG OF HOLT COUNTY: Last year I represented a county that presented such a situation, Chambers was given a full vote and O'Neill a full vote, each having someone present. But that was the first year that was done. Mr. Uehling's motion duly seconded. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: You have heard the motion made and seconded. (Question). AH in favor say aye.

Also, we beg to report on premiums asked for for Smith-Hughes students, that your committee can see much good in making a separate Class for students in the Smith-Hughes School, but on account of the additional expense we would not recommend taking up this work at this time. Also we do not recommend adding Berkshire hogs in Class C. h. j. Mclaughlin A. W. LAMB PERRY REED CHAS. GRAU R. WILDE (At conclusion) BY MR. McLAUGHLIN: Mr. Chairman, I am going to ask Mr. Grau to report on Class F and Mr. Lamb to report on Class R. BY MR. GRAU: Mr. Chairman and Fellow Members of the State Board of Agri - culture, if Mr. Von Seggren is in the room he has some data explana - tory of some of this matter. But I will proceed. I will say in the start, that I do not want to step on anybody's toes or hurt anybody's feelings, but I have things in my system that I want to get out. I want to say that I have never been satisfied with Class F, or the way it is classified or grouped for a number of years. It has been so mixed up that it has been hard to find what you want, or to locate any particular item, and almost impossible for you to systematically arrange articles in Class F on a series of shelves. Consequently, we have practically re-written Class F. We changed it almost entirely. We cut out some items which aggre - gated $198.00 and added those which aggregated $188.00, so leaving a difference of $10. in favor of the State Fair Board. The classification, as tendered and written now, I am sure will meet with the approval of the exhibitors, because it will be so much handier to arrange the exhibits. In the rules, Paragraph Number 2 has been changed to read: "Such grain and grass seeds may be shown as do not mature during the current year prior to holding the Fair" cutting out the language "the seeds maturing during the prior year (may be shown) clarifying this provision. The rest of the rules remain the same. Mr. Von Seggren has the score card and when he returns he can explain that to yon. </seg>
            <seg id="p055">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 55 Now if you will take the 1925 premium books that have been dis - tributed to you a moment ago, you can follow some of these changes easier. Turning to page 98, where we come to Lot 13, County Collec - tive Exhibits. Paragraph 2 has been entirely re-written, and it is now tendered this way: "Nothing herein shall prevent an individual exhibitor from having his exhibit scored and receiving equal consideration for score made. He shall receive the same amount of money as under county agricultural society's awards under rules governing. But in no case will two col - lective exhibits be recognized from one County." It has been a ticklish situation to leave this up to the Superin - tendent, but with that rule in there, that situation will be better. Upon page 100, the score card is corrected, but no substantive changes are made. Upon page 101, the same division of the districts is retained. Upon page 102, there are some discrepancies corrected. In item 11, it was marked on 50 points and should be 100. Going down to item 15, that was given a rating of 100 and should be 50; In item 16, miscellan - eous field and garden crops were marked 50 and should be 100, all added together adding the proper total of 1600 points. All of those changes are corrective and none of them go to the substance, or to the score card proper. In re-writing this classification, we have attempted to get it in such shape as to be handy. We start out with Red Winter Wheat, con - tinue with Red Spring Wheat, with White Spring and White Winter Wheat cut out. On oats there is one condition, divid.ng into Early White and Late White oats. Under Sorgo, Milo had been added. Black sorgo has also been added. Under pea, instead of cow peas, it is changed to cow peas — black eyed" and "cow peas — other." Hemp has been omitted. Sweet clover has been added to Lot 2. Going back to Lot 1, soy beans have been divided into black and yellow and Sunflower seeds likewise divided into white and black. Returning to Lot 2, a number of additions have been made, notably: Golden Millet and Common Millet, chanking Liberty Millet to German Millet. That change was made originally during the war period when a prejudice arose to the name, and this present change restores the for - mer name. In the Sheaf display, there is one addition, that of "Late White Oats." For several years, I have tried to get some scheme worked out other than alphabetically. That may sound well in theory, but it does not work out in practice, so we re-arranged the lots by logical group - ings and classifications. Now when we reach Alfalfa. We have heretofore had first cutting, second cutting and third cutting, but to this we have added "fourth </seg>
            <seg id="p056">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 56 catting." We cut out No. 1850, "Collection of sheaves separate from above." Alfalfa, Sweet Clover, white and Sweet Clover— yellow, have been added. Golden Millet and German Millet have been added to this class. In our new Lot 6, Stalk Display, we add under Sorgo, to Amber Sorgo — Black— add Amber Sorgo — Red to Kaffir, add Kaffir— Pink and to Milo, add Milo — Red, along with Milo — White. In Lot 11, Vine Products, add Blue Hubbard, Boston Marrow, and Crookneck. We divide Summer into White and Yellow, add Mammouth and in Pumpkins, have Mammouth, Yankee, or heretofore designated in the list as "Cow," retain Cheese and drop Sweet, and add to it Sweet Potato and add Cushaw, white, yellow and striped. In Watermelons, we divide "dark" and "light," they having hereto - fore been in one class or item. Muskmelons are now divided in "long," "round," and cantaloupes. The collection of gourds which has appeared in the list previously has been cut out. I never took much stock in a collection of gourds. In Potatoes, there has been no change, except the "Collection" at item 1973, which offered premiums respectively at $10.00, $6.00 and $4.00 has been changed to $10.00, $8.00, and $6.00. In Sweet Potatoes, Red and White are added to the Yellow classi - fication. Further, I might say in the Potato Collection the requirement "marketable % bu." has been changed to read "and to contain hi bu. of any varieties." Now going to Garden Products, Onions remain the same; to Beans are added Garden Peas and Field Peas, at the end of the classification of Beans. To Cabbage, are added "White Late" and "Savoy." To Peppers, are added " Red in Pods " and " Green in Pods." To - matoes, and Carrots and Beets under Root Crops remain the same, but under Turnips, are added " Yellow " and " White." To Garden Products is added " Celeraic." That never was within the list. Now coming to " Corn." For Corn grown in the Eastern Division — whatever applies in one of these lots will apply to all four lots. The description of territory of division remains the same. In the sub - divisions, defining and retaining White, 9 inches and over, Yellow 9 inches and over; Yellow, 9 inches and over, Yellow, 9 inches and under, but cutting out White, over 7% and under 9, and Yellow, over 7% and under 9 inches. It has simply been a case of offering an oppor - tunity unfairly for another exhibit of the same growth or crop. We never had exhibits of the intermediate division grown in competition with the other or larger grouping. There is no further change there until you come down to Flint. This recognizes the distinction between Yellow Flint corn and White Flint corn, all the way through and carries the two classifications throughout and cuts out both white and yellow, 12 rows in a number of </seg>
            <seg id="p057">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 57 places. They are allowed any corn in that division, that is 90 day corn, even if it is calico, or any other corn. Further down in the classification, you will notice the item " Ninety day other than white or yellow." which has been followed by the item " Other than yellow, white, calico or white cap dent." This latter item has been stricken out. We had a lot of trouble last year in judging the corn. In the last item, "Best and Largest Collection by a County," has been changed as to premium items from $8.00, $6.00 and $4.00 to $10.00, $8.00 and $6.00. We then come to the lot, Stalk Display. In the Flint, we have added " Other than white or yellow," and under Sweet Corn, we have added " Late Yellow." There was some contention in favor of cutting out the stalk display entirely. After due consideration we decided to retain the collection of stalks. But we have cut the premiums in this lot from the original figures hereto - fore paid, $1.50, $1.00 and 50c respectively to $1.00, 75c and 50c respectively. We decided the number who would want to bring them was limited anyway. This revision has cut out $198 and added $188, leaving a balance in favor of the State Fair Board of $10.00. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: Mr. Lamb will now present the report as to the class assigned to him. BY MR. LAMB: Class R deals with Boys* and Girls' Clubs. If you will turn to page 156 of the former premium list under this topic. We make no change in page 156 except where the word " Exhibit " is used, it is changed to the word "Show." On page 157, fourth paragraph, strike out the words, " in poultry 10c per coop." Further down it is made to read: through this addition: "First, second and third place — club breeding swine and sheep must be regis - tered and in case of breeding cattle application must be made for regis - tration at the time of showing to be eligible to go in the open class." Those are all of the changes on that page. On page 158 (1925 premium list). At the beginning of the second paragraph, strike out the word and figures "Fifteen (15)" and put in place thereof "Ten (10)", placing ten minutes as a minimum. In the following paragraph under " Team Demonstrations ", in Item 3501, where appears the word " Calves " add the word " Beef " as that judging work is done in both Dairy and Beef cattle. On page 160 (1925 premium list) under Lot 3, insert the words "Purebred pigs eligible for registration, farrowed on or after March 1st of the current year, are eligible for entry in Numbers 3538 to 3552. Registration number of sire and dam must be furnished with entry." "Each member will be limited to two entries in the Junior Sow Class </seg>
            <seg id="p058">58 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture and one entry each in the Junior Boar Class, the Litter Class and Junior Fat Barrow Class." On page 162 (1925 premium list) under Lot 4 — Cattle, we are changing it to read "Pure Bred Breeding Class" and "Heifer Class." Following right on down on the same page, at item No. 3572, "Dairy calf club bull — pure bred bull of service age, and owned and used by dairy calf clubs are eligible to show in this class." We make a few changes in the amount and relationship of premium money through here: Guernsey, 1st $18, 2nd $15, 3rd $12, 4th $10, 5th $8; Holstein, 1st $18, 2nd $15, 3rd $12, 4th $10, 5th $8; Grade dairy cattle (insert from p. 168 original copy). Ayrshire, under six months, 1st $10, 2nd $9, 3rd $8, 4th $7, 5th $6, 6th $5; over six months and under twelve months, 1st $10, 2nd $9, 3rd $8, 4th $7, 5th $6, 6th $5; over twelve months and under eighteen months. 1st $10, 2nd $9, 3rd $8, 4th $7, 5th $6, 6th $5; over eighteen months and under two years, 1st $10, 2nd $9, 3rd $8, 4th $7, 5th $6, 6th $5. Same classification and money to be offered for Guernsey, Holstein and Jersey cattle. Now going to page 165 (1925 premium list) under Lot 6, Poultry. There are no changes in the premiums. Just a little difference in the rules governing. The rules at the head of Class "E" — Poultry will govern except when given otherwise in Class "R." Where not more than two birds or pens are shown, one-half money will be paid. No coop rental will be charged. An individual club member will be limited to enter not more than two breeds. Now going to page 166, under Lot 7 — Corn and particularly under "Eastern Section" taking Items 3638, 3639, 3640 and 3641, as shown heretofore the ratio of premiums were at 1st $3.00, 2nd $2.00, 3rd $1.50, 4th $1.00, 5th 75c changed to read for premiums 1st $3.00, 2nd $2.50, 3rd $2.00, 4th $1.75, 5th $1.50 and add 6th $1.25, 7th $1.00, 8th 75c, 9th 50c. Now, on page 171, under "Style Show," change Best County 1st $7.00, 2nd $7.00, 3rd $7.00, 4th $7.00, 5th $6.00 Each other contestant, $5.00. Gold, silver and bronze medals will be given winners of first, second and third prizes. Each county is entitled to enter one clothing club girl in the style show. The girls will model Wednesday, September 8th, at 4:00 p.m. on Home Economics Demonstration platform in the club building and be - fore the Grandstand that evening. Her costume will consist of a dress made in her club project, with shoes, hose and other accessories chosen by her. Now on page 172 (1925 premium list) in Lot 16, Health Contest; following item of offer for high scoring Health Girl, and high scoring Health Boy, add the following "Gold, Silver and Bronze medals will be given winners of first, second and third prizes." </seg>
            <seg id="p059">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 59 Then in Lot 17, county premiums, strike out that part. I believe that is all of the changes in Class R. BY MR. LAMB: I move the adoption of the Revision Committee's report. Motion seconded. Question. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: It has been moved and seconded that the Revision Committee's re port be adopted. BY MR. GRAU: Mr. Von Seggren is here now, with a list of what has been cut out. Would it not be well to have that before we act upon the motion and adoption of the report. BY. MR. VON SEGGREN: (Reading list with reference to pagings of 1925 printed premium list) Page 90. Items 1729, 1730, white spring wheat, white winter wheat; Item 1748, Soudan grass, Item 1747, slender wheat grass. Page 91. Item 1765 under flint, white, 12 rows; Item 1767, under flint, yellow, 12 rows. Also on page 91, Item 1769. Page 92. Item 1788, under flint, white, 12 rows; Item 1790, under flint, yellow, 12 rows. Page 92. Item 1811, under flint, white, 12 rows; Item 1813, under flint, yellow, 12 rows. Page 93. Item 1815, cut out; Item 1834, flint, white, 12 rows; Item 1836, flint, yellow, 12 rows; Item 1838, other than yellow, white, calico or white cap dent. That item is a duplicate in the premium list. Such a duplication opens an opportunity to take the same kind of corn and enter it for two premiums. Page 94. Item 1850, "Collection of sheaves separate from above." Item 1855, white pearl barley; Item 1872, slender wheat grasses. Page 95. Item 1894, spring, white wheat; Item 1895, winter, white wheat. Page 96. Item 1914, hemp; Item 1929, beans, white field — -in pods. Page 97. Item 1955, pickling onions. Under Lot 10, on this page, Baled Hay the entire class has been cut out. Item 1982, collection of gourds. Those are all of the changes in that list. BY MR. GRAU: There is another matter, on which the Committee did not pass. It came to my attention last year. It is covered in the 1925 premium list, on Page 99, under Money Offered, under County Collective Exhibits. It reads there: "Money will be paid on the following basis Eastern District, thirty cents per point scored. Central District, thirty cents per point scored. Western District, forty cents per point scored. Irrigated District, forty cents per point scored. </seg>
            <seg id="p060">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 60 Last year it has been recommended that the Irrigated District should have 35 cents per point score, and immediately afterwards it was printed as 40 cents per point scored. If there are no objections to 40 cents per point scored in the Western District, the Dry District, and in the Irri - gated District, which should be the same, we think it should remain as K cents in those districts. But in that event, we further feel that the ltral District should be raised five cents, and made 35 cents, but allowing it to remain at 30 cents per point scored in the Eastern District. The Committee have had no recommendation to make in this matter, but thought we should bring it to the attention of the members and permit it to come up for discussion on the floor. BY MR. SMILEY, SEWARD COUNTY: As a matter of information, I wonder if a rule has been made in - creasing Class E, Lots 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 where first and second money only is paid so it takes only two entries to fill, or in other words, where there are only two entries, is the money paid; does second entry get second money? Or does this come under the rule on page 82 (1925 printed premium list) that says "Two entries, fourth money paid." The way it now reads, it would indicate that it takes four entries before any first money is paid, and where there are only two entries, only fourth money is paid. I think it should read, if only two entries, all money is paid, and one entry only, then only second money paid. BY MR. REED: I believe the Committee probably overlooked that fact, and that it should be included in their report. BY MR. LAMB: I believe we can take care of that, or of anything that may have been overlooked, in this way. I shall move, if the original motion is passed, to adopt the report of the Committee, that: I move that the recommendations of the Revision Committee be adopted, and that the Board of Managers be empowered to cor - rect any errors or anything that may have been overlooked in the revision of this premium list. Motion seconded. BY MR. KEEDLE, KEARNEY COUNTY I would like to make an amendment. That the Central District be allowed 35 cents on their collective exhibits. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: You have heard the motion, duly made and seconded that the report tthe Revision Committee be adopted and that the Board of Managers authorized to make any corrections to this premium list, with xhe endment that the Central District be changed from 30 to 35 cents ' point scored.

            <seg id="p061">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 61 We will vote on the amendment first. All in favor of the amend ment say "Aye." Contrary "No." The amendment is carried. Now we will vote on the original motion as amended. All in favor of the motion will signify by saying "Aye." Contrary "No." Motion is carried. The report of the Revision Committee is adopted with the amendment in regard to the Central District and carrying the authorization for the Board to make any necessary amendments, cor - rections or replace omissions in the revision of the premium list. BY MR. A. H. MILLER OF KENNARD: The Credentials Committee were not discharged last evening. I think our business has all be transacted, and therefore, I move that the report of the Credentials Committee be accepted and the committee be discharged. Motion seconded.

Contrary "No." Motion carried. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: I think we have another committee that has not reported, that is the special committee on resolutions that was appointed yesterday. Is that committee ready to report ? BY MR. A. J. WEAVER: The resolutions are ready but are typed upon the typewriter. As soon as they are typewritten they will be referred to the main Committee on Resolutions. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: We will pass that for the time being. Is there any other business that anyone else wishes to have come before this meeting before we proceed to the election of members of the Board. BY MR. MITCHELL: I notice from the report of the Revision Committee that certain classes have beeen greatly changed or in fact have been re-written. The county premium lists are generally arranged in the same order as the State Fair premium list. So would it not be a good idea if we can have this revised arrangement of the State Fair premium list before we arrange the county list, so in order that this year we can have the county list arranged along the same classifications. In order to do that we should have this new list of classifications in advance of its appear - ing in the printed premium list. I presume that the secretaries of other </seg>
            <seg id="p062">62 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture County -Fairs would be in the same position that we would so I make a motion, if it is necessary to have a motion, that advance sheets of this revised list be sent to the secretaries of the various fairs so they can arrange their county premium lists in the same way. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: That will be done. It is all right to bring it up as a motion. BY MR. MITCHELL OF THAYER COUNTY I then make that as a motion. Seconded. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: You have heard the motion, gentlemen, that this part of the pre - mium list relating to Class F, to Class R, and other changes made in the report of the Revision Committee, be prepared and printed or circulated in some form and sent to the secretaries of the various fairs and others interested. All in favor of the motion say "Aye," Contrary "No." Motion carried. BY MR. GRAU: Well I just want to say that I think that is a very good idea. That is going to help out the counties in making their classifications for this year. When I first came to the State Fair, I started in 1895 working along this line and have been continuously striving to accomplish this. I have been advocating the classification in Class F from the standpoint of the raiser. I view it from the point of acting in the capacity of a judge for years and by the evidence of its effect on the crop growers. Here is another thing that I would suggest to the Board, that the first thing they do is to get out this advance sheet of the premium list at least as to class F, because we aie not working to an advantage in that class until we have this new revised arrangement. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: Is there anything else that you want to come up at this time preced - ing the election of members of the State Board. It is necessary to have some tellers. I will appoint two for each side of the building. I will appoint Erie Smiley from Seward, A. H. Miller of Washington County, W. E. Von Seggren of Wayne County, and Clinton Congleton of Buffalo County as tellers. We have the ballots printed and if the four tellers will come up and please distribute them. Give one or two to each dele - gate just as they are entitled to vote, or one to each delegate and two to the few who also represent a county and then are a regular member of the board. BY MR. QUIG: There is a man present here today who could not be here yesterday when we elected him as vice president of the Association of County Fair Managers. We would like to have him introduced to the gathering. </seg>

TOLEN OF VALLEY COUNTY Gentlemen of the Board. We have the resolutions this morning prepared by the sub-committee that was appointed from this body yes - terday to be submitted to the Resolution Committee. RESOLUTION NO. 1 WHEREAS: Agriculture is the basic resource and the most im - portant business of the people of Nebraska, and WHEREAS: In our agricultural production, surpluses of grain and livestock and their by-products inevitably occur which safeguard the nations food supply and are therefore essential, and WHEREAS: The surplus of such products must necessarily be sold at world price levels in competition with countries having a lower cost of production and a lower standard of living, and WHEREAS: The small exportable surplus determines the domestic price for the major portion of our production which is required for domestic use, and WHEREAS: This situation is inequitable in view of the protection given by law to the products of industry, business and labor, and WHEREAS: The agriculture of the nation is not receiving its just share of the national prosperity because it is compelled to buy its manu - factured necessities, its transportation and its labor in a highly or - ganized and protected market and to sell its entire production on the basis of the world market, and </seg>
            <seg id="p064">64 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture WHEREAS: The middle west which is the surplus producing area of the United States, maintains that it is fundamental and just that agriculture should be entitled to buy in the same kind of a market in which it sells, thus giving equal opportunity to every citizen and business. NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED: That the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture demands in behalf of the greatest industry of this state and nation, the business of agriculture, as an economic necessity, either the repeal of the laws which have created the artificial barriers for business, industry and labor or that the system of stabilization for such be broadened so as to include agriculture. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that we approve of the efforts now being made by the middle western states for such legislation as will place the production of the farmer on a basis with the products of in - dustry, business and labor. BY MR. TOLEN: I move the adoption of this resolution Seconded. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: You have heard the motion that the resolution be adopted as read. All in favor say "Aye," contrary, "No." Motion carried. RESOLUTION NO. 2 RESOLVED: That this Boaid demands a readjustment of the freight rate structure so as to insure railroad rates on a basis of the comparative value of farm products with those of industry. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED: That we are opposed to the in - crease of freight rates now asked by the railroads of the Interstate Commerce Commission as to the products of agriculture as not only unjust but unnecessary. BY MR. TOLEN: Mr. President, I move you the adoption of this resolution. Seconded. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: You have heard the motion that this resolution be adopted. All in favor say "Aye," contrary "No." Motion carried. RESOLUTION NO 3 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED: BY THE NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE, that WHEREAS the government has recognized and approved projects for inland water ways such as the upper and lower Mississippi, the Ohio, </seg>
            <seg id="p065">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 65 the Missouri from St. Louis to Kansas City, the Tennessee, the Cumber - land rivers and other streams, and WHEREAS, the President of the United States, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of War, the Secretary of Agriculture, have rec - ommended and approved the early completion of such adopted projects as necessary to meet our future transportation needs and to place the middle west on an equality with the Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf coasts in the matter of cheap water transportation, and WHEREAS the upper Missouri river from Kansas City to Yankton, South Dakota, which constitutes the eastern boundary line of Nebraska is one of the feeders of the Mississippi inland water system already ap - proved, that we favor as a matter of economic necessity, and economic justice, the approval by the Government of the upper Missouri river as a navigation project and its early completion as a part of the Mississippi Valley inland water system IRLE D.

BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: Is there anything further to come up before we proceed to the election of officers for the coming year? If not we will elect officers. I will call Mr. Vice President Wake to the chair. BY VICE PRESIDENT WAKE: The first order of business will be the election of a President for the ensuing year. BY MR.

We have before us the election of a </seg>
            <seg id="p066">66 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture President of this organization. You younger men and men who prob - ably haven't had the opportunity to work with this organization it might be well for me to introduce the man whom I have in mind to nominate for President during the coming year. A gentleman who has been very active in the organization for some fourteen or fifteen years to my personal knowledge and a man who lives in the central part of this state. He is a man who has been very active in all of the things that we as Nebraskans stand for, a man who has good business ability and initiative, who is a good mixer. But that doesn't mean the time comes that a real fight is taking place that this fellow will do as Mr. Weaver told in his story, he will not go on any back-tracking to find out where the bear came from. He is a man who will stand up and fight for what he believes is right even though he doesn't court a fight. He is a gentleman who is rather modest. He doesn't fit in very well in what we term real dress parade functions. I recall some years ago when we sat down to a wild duck and cranberry sauce supper in the Gov - ernor's Mansion that this gentleman was really not in his element and in trying to get started on this good feed he met with a terrible misfor - tune, in fact, he spilled a two gallon bowl of cranberry sauce all over the dining-room. His friends could not help but feel very sorry for him. But he fits in well with such people as you and those whom you repre - sent. In business this gentleman is a newspaper man. He edits what is called the Custer County Chief. It has the reputation of being second to none in the State of Nebraska as a weekly publication. I understand he has a monopoly in that town of Broken Bow, that is the capital of the great state of Custer, a county in Nebraska. What I want to say to you is that it gives me no little pleasure to nominate Emerson R. Purcell for President of this organization for the coming year. BY MR. QUIG: I second the nomination. BY VICE PRESIDENT WAKE: Are there any other nominations. BY MR. CON MCCARTHY OF YORK COUNTY I move that the nominations be closed and that the Secretary be instructed to cast the entire vote of the State Board of Agriculture for Emerson R. Purcell for President. Seconded. BY VICE PRESIDENT WAKE: It has been moved and seconded that the nominations be closed and that the rules be suspended and the Secretary be instructed to cast the entire vote of this convention for Emerson R. Purcell for President, during the coming year. All in favor of the motion say "Aye," op - posed "No." The motion is carried unanimously. </seg>
            <seg id="p067">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 67 BY SECRETARY JACKSON: I'm sure it is a pleasure for me to have an opportunity to cast the vote of this convention for Emerson R. Purcell for our President next year. I now cast the entire vote of eighty for Mr. Emerson R. Purcell for President for the ensuing year. BY MR. WAKE: Mr. Purcell. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL Mr. Chairman, after that elaborate introduction by my friend Charlie Graff I feel something like the story of the man who died. He hadn't been a very good citizen. In fact, he had been rather wayward and it happened at the particular time he died there had just come to the community a new minister who was asked to preach the funeral ser - mon. Their family and friends and other people gathered at the little church and the man's wife and children gathered about. The minister got up and delivered the most elaborate discourse bringing out all of the great qualities that he imagined this man had possessed. The wife looked on and listened in growing astonishment. She stood it as long as she could and finally she said to her little boy at her side, "Oh, Jimmie, walk over there and take another look in that coffin and see if that actually is your pa in there or not." But I do want to say that I deeply appreciate this honor that has just been conferred upon me. I think that the service in this capacity and the honor that is conferred is one of the greatest in the State of Nebraska. It is a pleasure to be associated with such men as we find in this body in the membership of the State Board of Agriculture, and the large number of County Fair men throughout the State. You find in every part of Nebraska that they are the leading people of their various communities. The work that they have done for the State of Nebraska can hardly be measured or estimated. I have had a great interest in fair work, gentlemen, long before I came upon the Board of Agriculture, and I was connected with County Fair work for many years, I think I started in more than twenty-five years ago in that work and I have been connected with County Fair work most all of the time since then either in an official capacity of some kind or later on in connection with the State Board of Agriculture. In whatever activity I have been engaged all during my entire life time I have never been so decidedly - interested as I have in this fair work and some of its various angles. I believe the State Board of Agriculture is a great factor in the up - building of agriculture in this state and I am proud of what it has done in its various lines. I feel very proud of the accomplishments of the State Fair during the last few years. I think this good work has resulted not only in this institution but we may rank as one of the great organizations, not only of this state but of the nation. The Ne - braska State Fair has measured nearly at the top among the State Fairs </seg>
            <seg id="p068">68 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture of this nation. It has been a pleasure to be associated 1 with such a splendid bunch of men as those who have constituted this State Fair Board and the management of this Fair during the past year. Our work has been very agreeable and we have had splendid co-operation among the members of this Board, and a splendid co-operation from all the employees, the fair people generally over the state, and again I want to thank you for this honor. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: The next order of business, gentlemen, is the election of a First Vice-President. Who will you have as your First Vice-President? BY MR. McGAFFIN OF POLK COUNTY: Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of this convention, I would like to have the pleasure of placing before this convention the name of a man who has served in the neighborhood of eight or ten years with this association and who has climbed the ladder commencing with the first rung and gone to the top. He has been tried and not found wanting. That man is Thomas H. Wake of Seward. BY MR. SMITH: I move that the rules be suspended and the Secretary be instructed to cast the unanimous vote of this convention for Mr. Wake for Vice- President, for the ensuing year. BY MR. H. L. WEBSTER I second the motion. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: Are there any other nominations. You have heard the motion that the rules be suspended and the Secretary instructed to cast the entire vote of this convention for Mr. Wake for Vice-President during the ensuing year. Question. All in favor say "Aye," contrary "No." The motion is carried. BY MR. JACKSON: The Secretary takes pleasure in casting the entire vote of the con vention for Mr. Thomas H. Wake for First Vice-President, for the en - suing year. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: The chair declares Mr. Wake duly elected. The next order of business will be the nomination for Second Vice President. BY MR. MILLER: Gentlemen of the convention. I wish now to suggest the name of one whose silvery tongue comes with sound advice and words of ad - monition to us and whose words of advice we have always found fitting. </seg>
            <seg id="p069">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 69 He has made a good start in the political world as well as in the fair world. This man is A. J. Weaver of Falls City.

IRLE TOLEN OF VALLEY COUNTY: I want to place in nomination a man who has a broader vision </seg>
            <seg id="p070">70 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture of fair work than any man in America. I don't make that statement as a flatt -ring remark. I make it in paying a tribute to a man who has served » ie Nebraska State Fair for one year in that position and it has been my pleasure to work with Mr. Jackson during the past year. I have found that he has had his heart and soul in the work. He has the capacity to visualize the needs of Nebraska and the needs of this country for twenty-five to fifty years ahead. He sees the possibility of development of the boys and girls of this state into the future farmers and future citizens of the state. He devotes his time to the business of the fair, the State Board of Agriculture, and to the development of those who are coming forth to take the places of the present business men and farmers of Nebraska. It gives me great pleasure gentlemen, to place the name of George Jackson before this convention as Secretary for the next year. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: Are there any other nominations ? BY MR. J. A. BOYD OF BUFFALO COUNTY: I move you that the nominations be closed and the President in - structed to cast the entire vote of this convention for Mr. Jackson. Motion seconded. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: You have heard the motion, gentlemen, that the nominations be closed, the rules suspended, and the President instructed to cast the entire vote of this convention for Mr. Jackson as Secretary. All in favor say "Aye," contrary "No." Motion carried unanimously. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: I want to say it is a pleasure for me at this time to cast the entire vote of this gathering of delegates and members for Mr. George Jackson as Secretary during the coming year, and in doing this I want to say that from our work with Mr. Jackson during the past year we are finding him a very able Secretary. BY MR. JACKSON: It isn't necessary for me to say that I appreciate this nomination and election. Such a nominating speech that was just made in my behalf ought to enthuse a man to speak at least a whole hour but I'm not going to do it because it is late, but I do want you to know that I really appreciate this, not only for the opportunity to be associated with the class of men we have in this association, but for the oppor - tunity to serve. And you younger fellows will I trust get your interest aroused if you want to be of service to your country and to the state in which you live. That is what I want to do. I want you to know that I appreciate very much that I am mighty glad to know that this cranberry sauce deal has finally been fully decided as to who did spill </seg>
            <seg id="p071">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 71 the cranberry sauce. I had that up for two or three years and I am glad to see it decided. BY MR. H. J. McLAUGHLIN: May I say just a word? I think probably that there may have been an injustice done here. Charlie Graff in his nominating speech laid all of the blame for spilling the cranberry sauce at the Governor's dinner on Emerson Purcell but I think that is a mooted question that has never been fully proven or decided whether Emerson Purcell or George Jackson spilled the cranberry sauce. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: I will say that I will admit that George was a factor in it. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: It now becomes the duty of the President-Elect at this time to ap - point the four members of the Board of Managers. You all know that the Board of Managers consists of the President, First and Second Vice - presidents, and four members who are appointed by the President and ratified by this meeting. I now wish to submit the following names for these four places as members of the Board of Managers, for the coming years as follows: A. W. Lamb, Albion; Perry Reed, Henderson; Irle D. Tolen of Ord; and A. H. Miller of Kennard. BY MR. CON MCCARTHY: I move that this board and convention ratify the appointment of the board of managers that has just been announced by the President. Second the motion. BY PRESIDENT PURCELL: You have heard the motion, gentlemen, that this board ratify the appointments just made. All in favor say "Aye," contrary "No." Motion carried. The appointments are declared to be ratified. BY MR. QUIG OF O'NEILL: Now you may all take me for an Irishman because I live up at O'Neill, but I'm not. I was born in Kentucky. Now when I went up to O'Neill I could tak so that anyone could un - derstand me. But there are a lot of fellows in this fair grounds, who don't seem to have the nerve to get up and tell what good treatment they have had during the last year, but I know they appreciate the prompt replies that they have had to all of their correspondence. I'm going to say this for the bunch of fellows who may not have the nerve to get up and say it for themselves, Mr. Jackson, that they are all mighty well pleased with the way that you have handled all of your correspondence.

During this period of time the legislature of Nebraska has appropriated $705,000 for the purchase of the grounds, erection of buildings and minor improvements. During this same period of time this organization has staged the twenty-six fairs, paid out for premiums during this time the sum of $794,833, and have put back into the grounds in the way of permanent improvements and upkeep a total sum of $797,913. You will note that from our receipts during this twenty-six year period we have paid out $89,000 more for premiums than the total state appropriation for grounds and buildings. The Nebraska State Fair is conceded by all to be the greatest advertising medium in Nebraska. We are proud of its record. It not only advertises our resources but finds buyers for our products. During the twenty-six years residence in Lincoln it has developed to such extent that the institution is valued at one million and a quarter dollars. </seg>

            <seg id="p219">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 219 THE PURCHASING POWER OF NEBRASKA FARM PRODUCTS PROFESSOR H. C. FILLEY College of Agriculture The prosperity of the farmer is measured by the amount of desirable goods that he can secure in exchange for his surplus products. When all his surplus is required to pay for absolute necessities, the farmer is far from prosperous, irrespective of the size of the surplus or the price at which it sells. Price and Purchasing Power Price is exchange value expressed in terms of money. In measur - ing the value of a product in dollars it must be remembered that the purchasing power of a dollar is somewhat variable depending upon the quantity of money in circulation, the rapidity of circulation, the abund - ance or scarcity of goods, the credit situation and possibly upon other factors. The amount of money received for any commodity is of second - ary importance because we neither eat money nor wear money, nor use it for shelter. The amount of goods that can be bought with the money received is the real factor in determining value. The true value of a bushel of wheat, for example, depends not upon the price per bushel but the amount of desirable good for which the wheat, or the money recieved for the wheat, can be exchanged. High and Low Prices Much has been said concerning high and low prices, but no price can be said to be high or low except by comparison. One dollar a bushel for wheat would have been a high price in 1896 and would have helped bring prosperity to Nebraska because other products were rela - tively low compared with the dollar. One dollar a bushel would have been a very low price for the 1920 wheat crop because nearly all com - modities were high compared with the dollar. In other words, a dollar had a much greater purchasing power — in fact, about 4 times as great — in 1896 than it had in 1920. A comparison of the prices received by the Nebraska farmer for his grain with the prices which he pays for other commodities is necessary before we can determine whether grain prices* are "high" or "low." The term "normal times" as ordinarily used really means that a fairly definite and logical relationship exists between the prices of various articles. When the prices of farm products rise, people speak of the pros - perity of the farmers. Hasty generalizations are made, but the con - clusions drawn do not always reflect true conditions. For example, since 1922 many writers and speakers have proclaimed the return of prosperity of the grain-belt farmer because his grain and livestock have sold for approximately pre-war prices. The actual fact is that despite the rise in the price of farm products, the farmers of Nebraska, Iowa, South </seg>
            <seg id="p220">220 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Dakota, and other states have been less prosperous since 1922 than in the years immediately preceding the World War. The Use of Index Numbers Changes in price levels, that is in the purchasing power of money, are indicated statistically by the use of index numbers. The average prices of a considerable number of commodities during one year or for a term of years are taken as a base and always given a value of 100. If the purchasing power of money decreases, that is, if prices go up, the index number will rise above 100, but if prices go down the index number will fall below 100. Two separate indices are necessary for determining the purchasing power of any commodity. These are the index number of that com - modity and the index number of all commodities. In order to determine the purchasing power of corn for example, we must compare the index number of corn with the index number of all commodities for the cor - responding time. The Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor has been assembling information upon prices for many years. Its "all commodities" price index is at present based on the wholesale price of 404 commodities. The wholesale price for each month is compared with the average price for 1913 taken as a base and the result is an index showing the general price level. Wholesale prices are used be - cause they are more stable and more nearly uniform than retail prices. The wholesale price index is not an absolutely accurate index of what the farmers of the western part of the grain belt pay because the aver - age margin added by retailers may vary, and because the difference between the average wholesale price in the United States and the whole - sale price in any group of states may increase or decrease due to changes in freight and handling charges. The Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes each month not only an all-commodities price index, but a table giving the index numbers of wholesale prices by groups of commodities. These indices are widely quoted to show the relative prosperity of different lines of industry, but unfortunately it is impossible to estimate the prosperity of any one agri - cultural area by giving figures for the entire United States. For ex - ample, cotton which is one of our most important farm products has been relatively high for several years, and this high price has helped raise the general agricultural index. In a similar manner the agricul - tural index has been increased by the relatively high price of lemons, soft shelled walnuts, and some other specialized products, the high price of which may add to the cost of living of the middlewestern farmer but certainly adds nothing to his income. The increase in freight rates and handling charges has increased the spread between the wholesale price of hay, corn, oats, wheat, hogs, cattle, and other bulky products in regions of surplus production and in regions where not enough is produced for home use. Since Nebraska, </seg>
            <seg id="p221">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 221 Iowa, and other middle-western states lie for the most part in surplus areas, the average wholesale price of farm products in these states is considerable less than the United States as a whole. It is, therefore, essential in order to obtain even an approximation of the purchasing power of Nebraska farmers that we use the price which they received for their products in the basic period and the prices which they receive today rather than a national average wholesale price for all farm commodities. The prices paid to farmers for grain at Columbus, Nebraska, have been selected for comparison with wholesale prices because they are available for a long period and are believed to be fairly representative. Purchasing power of a bushel of corn, wheat, and oats at Columbus, Nebraska, 1921-1925. 1913 = 100. Figures for November and December, 1925, are preliminary. The 1924 corn crop was the smallest since 1903. As a result the price per bushel was high, but few farmers had corn for sale. The crop, therefore, gave farmers a relatively small purchasing power. The high index number for 1925 is a result of the scarcity of corn until the new crop came to the market. The December 1 purchasing power of corn was only 75. The purchasing power of a bushel of wheat on December 1, 1925, was about 25 per cent higher than the average purchasing power for 1913. To the superficial observer this looks very favorable for the farmer. The thinking man remembers that the 1925 crop was consider - ably smaller than the 1913 crop, and that a very large part of it was out of the producers' hands before the recent rise in price. In 1925 wheat crop will return to Nebraska farmers but little if any more money than did the 1913 crop. The purchasing power of the crop is small because the present purchasing power of a dollar is only about 63 per cent of what it was in 1913. Oats were about 20 cents per bushel higher in the early spring than in the late summer and autumn of 1925. The purchasing power has not been above 78 since the first of August. </seg>
            <seg id="p222">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 222 Fie. 2 — Per bushel purchasing power of corn, wheat, and oats at Columbus. Nebraska — 1918-1925. In Figure 2 is presented graphically the purchasing power of corn, wheat, and oats by months from January, 1913, to December, 1925, in - clusive. The average for 1913 is 100. The low purchasing power since 1920 is of itself sufficient to account for the financial depression existing in the Grain Belt. Table 2 — Purchasing power of hogs, feeder steers, butter, and eggs Year Hogs Cattle Butter Eggs Hogs are one of the staple products of the corn belt. The purchas- ing power per hundred pounds has been law until recent months as is indicated in Table 2. The farmer has been congratulated upon the present high hog prices but unfortunately the purchasing power of hogs is below the pre-war level and the number to be marketed is less than normal. Cattle producers have been in dire straits ever since the closing in the Middlewest, 1921-1925. 1913 = 100. 921 97 922 72 63 92 ■ 923 .924 .925 58 64 90 61 64 74 102 96 92 81 8: 9 Oec. 1, 1925 82 75 91 161 </seg>
            <seg id="p223">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 223 months of 1920. The present outlook is encouraging, although the pur - chasing power is far below the 1913 level. Butt erf at and eggs have been two of the mainstays of agriculture in the Middlewest ever since the beginning of the deflation period. They have provided ready money for the purchase of groceries and other es - sential commodities. Most people have come to think of them as being relatively high in price. A study of Table 2 reveals that they are lower in purchasing power than in 1913. The price illusion is the result of comparing the price of butterfat and eggs with the price of hogs, cattle and corn. The fact is that these products instead of being high in price are merely not so low as are cattle, corn, oats, and most other gTain belt farm products. It is probable that cattle have passed the low point and will continue to increase in purchasing power for several years. The production of cattle, horses, hogs, and to some extent other farm products tends to move in cycles. When the purchasing power of some products is low for several years, production naturally decreases. As production de - creases, the price rises until production again becomes profitable. The increased price stimulates production. As the supply on the market increases, the price declines, and the cycle is completed. Cycles of cattle production are about 15 years long; cycles of hog production are only 4 or 5 years long. Nebraska has an advantage in the production of hogs, butterfat, poultry, eggs, and some other commodities over states farther east or west. As has been already stated, the price of feed is cheaper here than in those areas where not enough is produced to supply home needs. Since it costs less to transport live stock and livestock products than to trans - port the feed necessary to produce them, the Nebraska farmer has an advantage over the farmers in other areas where feed is high in price. Wherein Lies the Trouble Proving that the middlewestern farmer is suffering because he has a lower purchasing power than he had in pre-war years does not tell the whole story and does not answer all the aspersions that have been cast upon the farmer in recent years. It is necessary to diagnose the case and ascertain the trouble before prescribing a remedy. Inflation and Deflation A change in the general level of prices neither creates nor destroys wealth. It does effect the distribution of wealth, because it is impos - sible for all prices to rise or fall at the same rate. For example, people who have their capital invested in lands, buildings, and merchandise are benefited by rising prices, but people who have their capital invested in bonds or other securities yielding a fixed income, or who work for a fixed salary such as preachers and teachers are affected adversely. De - flation decreases the value of real estate and nearly all kinds of mer - chandise and increases the purchasing power of the man with a fixed </seg>

During every recorded deflation period farm products have dropped more rapidly in price than have manufactured goods. As a result the farmer has had to pay for high priced goods with low priced products. For example, in the United States as a whole in the last six months of 1920, the price of farm products decreased nearly 50 per cent and the fall in Nebraska, Iowa, and other middle-western states was even more rapid. Other commodities decreased in price during the same time only about 15 per cent. Farmers Unable to Restrict Production The farmer because of the nature of his business is not able to restrict production as does the manufacturer. Referring once more to 1920, we find that the farmers had planted a very large acreage of corn which produced the largest crop on record. They could not reduce their acreage because more than 6 months intervened between the time of planting and the time of harvesting. The crop was produced when labor, farm equipment, food, clothing, and practically everything else pur - chased by the farmer were very high in price, in fact, the highest aver - age prices measured in dollars of which we have a record. In December when the corn was husked and ready for market it was worth from one-fifth to one-fourth as much per bushels as was corn during the spring and summer. The farmer produced a large crop under high cost condi - tions and naturally expected that the crop would bring a relatively high price. The time of maturity and marketing was, however, so far re - moved from the time of planting and cultivation, that he was compelled either to sell his crop at a relatively low price or else to place it in storage for an indefinite period with no certainty of ever securing a price that would give him a better net return. In the production of winter wheat the ground is prepared for sowing almost a year before the crop can be marketed and in the raising of livestock the time from planning production until the animals are ready for market is consider - ably longer. The farmer is seldom able to reduce his operating expense by "lay - ing off" his employees because the major portion of the farm labor is performed by himself and family. According to the 1920 census there were only 36,199 hired men on the 125,000 farms in Nebraska. As a result a single year of low prices has little effect on agricultural pro - duction. The farmer continues to plow and plant, to cultivate and har - vest because he wishes to utilize his time and there is nothing else that he can do. His fruit trees continue to bear and he is inclined to be even more careful of egg and milk production. Nearly all farm products are perishable or semi-perishable. The consumer demands that his fruits, vegetables, eggs, and milk shall be fresh. Livestock can be kept on the farm after it is ready for market only at a heavy cost. The storage of such products as grain, hay, and </seg>
            <seg id="p225">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 225 cotton is expensive, not only because of the cost of storage, but because of the danger of deterioration. The farmer is practically forced to sell on a fast moving market subject to rapid fluctuations. Among all pro - ducers the farmer doubtless finds it hardest to wait before selling until readjustment reachest the point where he will sustain the least loss. High Priced Land The increase in corn-belt land values following the World War has been suggested as the principal reason for the agricultural depression existing in this region. It is a matter of common knowledge that a large acreage of land did change hands, and that in some localities the price paid was far above the 1914 level. It is also well known that the land mortgage indebtedness in this area is higher than it was 10 years ago, and as a result interest payments are larger. The agricultural de - pression is not limited, however, to the men who are paying for land bought at the peak of prices. Men who have owned for many years the farms upon which they live find themselves unable to maintain pre - war level standards. Fib. 3 — Agriculture has always paid taxes out of all proportion to agricultural income. In Nebraska more than two-fifths of the farms are operated by tenants, the majority of whom pay a share of the crop for rent. The terms of share rental for the most part are the same today as in pre - war years. Information obtained from many sources indicates that these share tenants are less prosperous than formerly. The financial diffi - culties of the share tenant can certainly not be traced to inflated land values. Land owners are interested in the income received from their investments in land. Opinions differ as to the rate per cent which such investments should return. One farm paper suggests that a farm should return "a good living and 10 per cent." Many men who have lived on the land believe that a good farm is at least equal in security to a gov - ernment bond and should return about the same rate of interest. Other men place the proper return at the current interest rates paid upon </seg>
            <seg id="p226">226 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture farm mortgages and others at the rate charged by banks for short-time loans. There has unquestionably been considerable speculation in corn belt farm land. The land speculator is willing to accept a small annual re - tarn when the land is first purchased if he believes there is reasonable ground for the hope of a large return at some future time. Other fac - tors, the combined effect of which has doubtless had a greater influence upon the price of corn belt land than has speculation may be listed as follows: 1. Productive land is generally regarded as a safe investment. Safe investments usually yield a low rate of return. 2. A good farm furnishes not only a safe investment for capital but furnishes also a home and a job. 3. Many farmers know little of stocks or bonds. They keep their savings invested in land, because it is the only form of investment which they really know. 4. The land owner can usually take some part in the management of his farm. The small investor has no part in the management of a large corporation. 5. Many men feel a pride in land ownership. 6. Land ownership is regarded as an indication of financial secur - ity. Bankers sometimes retain possession of farms because of the in - fluence which such ownership has upon depositors. In pre-war years good farm land in the western half of the corn belt was capitalized at a point where it would return about three and one-half per cent upon the investment. Good management often secured considerably more. It is returning less today. Should the owners of farm land be satisfied with a valuation below pre-war when city real estate and most other types of property are well above the pre-war level? Influence of Money and Credit Upon Price The per capita circulation of money in the United States July 1, 1914, was $34.35. October 1, 1925, it was $42.17, an increase of nearly 23 per cent. It is generally believed that "the value of money under the simplest conditions is exactly inverse to the quantity." If the quantity of money in circulation; is increased 23 per cent, other conditions re - maining the same, prices will be 23 per cent higher, and the purchasing power of money will be proportionally lower. As a matter of fact, con - ditions are far from simple and are constantly changing. The rapidity with which money circulates is also a factor affecting prices. Increasing the work that a dollar does is just as effective as increasing the number of dollars. The increased use of bank checks and other instruments of credit since 1914 has affected prices. When money remains in the bank as a reserve and is replaced by checks in actual use, the effect on price is the same as increasing the volume of money. Increased volume of </seg>
            <seg id="p227">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 227 money and increased use of credit and credit instruments are probably responsible for a very large part of the 60 per cent increase in the gen - eral price level since 1914. No one denies that we are upon a higher price level than in If 14. Some doubt has been expressed as to whether or not the new level is permanent, but it is generally agreed that we will not drop to the pre - war level for many years. Is there any logical reason why farm land should not share in the general price increase? Logically, it should advance in about the same proportion as city property, farm machinery, furniture, and various other commodities. The fact remains that corn belt land is not selling today at 60 per cent above 1914 prices. The reason is that the price of land depends upon the purchasing power of farm products which at the present time is very low. Railway Rates Railway rates affect the price of nearly every commodity that the farmer buys and of nearly every product that he sells. It is an old adage that the consumer pays the freight. It is certainly true that the farmer pays the freight upon the manufactured goods which he purchases. In the middlewestern states the prices of many farm products are often the prices at the seaboard less freight and handling charges. Wherever or whenever the condition is true, any increase in freight rates decreased the farm price of the product. Increased freight rates must unquestionably be taken into account in considering the causes for pres - ent conditions in the grain belt. Influence of Taxes The general property tax falls heavier upon agriculture than upon any other industry. Farmers and farm land owners pay a higher per - centage of their income for taxes than has ever been suggested as a direct tax upon income. It is not at all uncommon for a man with a relatively small income from land to pay 20 per cent of that income for taxes, while a few men have paid more than 50 per cent of their land income for taxes. In Nebraska, farm property bears about two and one-half times as much of the state tax burden as does all city property. There is no doubt that since 1920 the total income of the residents of cities and villages has been considerably greater than the income of the farm population. In Iowa in 1925 farm people paid $8.47 per capita toward state ex - penses and town people paid $2.23 per capita. According to all indica - tions and the data available, the town people were the more prosperous. State, county, and school taxes have increased since 1914 and in the middlewestern states agriculture is paying a very considerable part of this increase. The influence of taxes is not indicated in the tables which give the present purchasing power of farm products. </seg>
            <seg id="p228">228 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Business Judgment The middle-western farmer has been characterized as an inefficient producer and criticised for his poor business judgment. He has been repeatedly condemned for not saving the profits of the post-war boom to carry him through the deflation period. What are really the facts in the case? It is admitted that many farmers do exhibit poor farm management and exercise poor business judgment. On the other hand, middle-western farmers as a whole are quick to utilize labor saving equipment. Not only the farmers themselves but usually all members of the farm fam - ilies work long hours during the busy season. The practice of milking cows and caring for the garden as overtime jobs is so common a prac - tice that comment is made when it is not followed. It is safe to assume that if farmers were limited to an eight hour day, and each farm work - man limited to the performance of one certain kind of work, that farm products would become scarce and the price would necessarily increase. We can admit that agriculture is not 100 per cent efficient and at the same time maintain that it is carried on more efficiently than almost any other major occupation. The farmer was not the only entrepreneur who failed to build up a reserve when prices were high. One reason was the high cost of production, and another the constant urge to increase his scale of pro - duction. He was urged to utilize his credit for the purchase of more cattle, or better cattle, or to purchase a tractor or to modernize his home. Bank deposits were large, and most bankers were desirous of keep - ing these deposits at work. Many bankers also maintain that even as late as the early spring of 1920 they were encouraged to utilize the re - discount privileges offered by the Federal Reserve banks. The farmers were not the only business men unprepared for defla - tion. In Nebraska alone 90 state banks went into the hands of a re - ceiver between January 1, 1920, and July 1, 1925, and 31 more were in such bad condition that they were taken over and operated by the Guaranty Fund Commission. There were also several failures among the national banks of the state. Other banks, both state and national, were saved only because the stockholders were able to come to the rescue with private funds. Bankers are supposed to be in touch with financial conditions. They ought to know better than any other group of business men that inflation is always followed by deflation and appreciate the necessity of maintaining ample reserves. When I recall who urged the farmers to spend their money and borrow more, and then look over the list of bank failures, I sometimes wonder whether or not the bankers really exercised very much better judgment during the days of inflation than did the farmers. When I recall the excuses given for the unneces - sary post-war inflation, I sometimes think that at least a part of the men who occupied high positions and were supposed to be exercising statesmanship and business sagacity were after all only engaged in po - litical maneuvers. </seg>
            <seg id="p229">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 229 A country town banker with whom I have been long acquainted told me early in 1920 of the good natured raillery to which he was being subjected by some of his banker friends because he was restricting loans although his bank had reserves of about one million dollars. They felt that he was missing an opportunity of making a good profit. When de - flation came this banker took care of every legitimate need of every one of his regular customers, and of some men who were not regular customers, without borrowing a single dollar from a Federal Reserve Bank. The farmers and merchants who took his advice in 1919 did not over-extend their business. Conditions in Iowa and other middlewestern states have not been so very different from conditions in Nebraska. In fact, losses from bank failures have been greater in several other states than in Nebraska. No one can be certain that the epidemic of bank failures has ended. The primary cause of most of these failures was the failure of the bankers themselves to foresee economic conditions. The more immediate cause is the slow recovery of agriculture and related business) enterprises which in turn is due to the continued low purchasing power of farm products. In states without an adequate bank guarantee law, some fail - ares have been precipitated by the withdrawal of deposits, due to lack of confidence. Who Has Gained According to data assembled by the National Bureau of Economic Research, our per capita purchasing power in 1921 was considerably greater than in 1913. It was unquestionably greater in 1924 than in 1921. If the purchasing power of the middlewestern farmer has de - creased the purchasing power of some other group must have increased. Who is it? The wages paid railway employees are approximately double the 1913 level, while the price index is about 60 per cent higher. It is, therefore, very evident that railway laborers have a greatly increased purchasing power. The increase in railway wages accounts for the in - crease in freight charges because the railways have never been operated more efficiently than in 1925. Hourly wage scales in the building trades, in union coal mines, in printing and publishing, in ready-made clothing trades, and in various other industries have also increased more since 1913 than has the general commodity price index. It is very evident that these workers are receiving a part of the income taken from agriculture. Less data are available to show the increased profits in manufacture and trade, but indications are abundant that efficiently operated plants in many of our highly protected industries are not only able to pay their employees higher wages, but that their net earnings are greater than in pre-war years. The stock boom of 1925 reflects the profitable condition of manufacture and trade. Whereas farm land is considerably lower in price than in 1920, the average price of industrial stock is now far beyond all previous records. </seg>
            <seg id="p230">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 230 Summarizing the Evidence Since the autumn, of 1920 the purchasing power of the middlewest - ern farmer has been lower than in pre-war years. This is not his fault. He has worked hard, produced abundantly, and doubtless managed his individual business as efficiently as have entrepreneurs in other lines of industry. There are several causes for the present condition. When deflation came the farmer was less able to protect himself than manufacturers or merchants. Forces over which he has no control have so far prevented him from regaining his pre-war position. All middlewestern farmers have suffered since the beginning of de - flation. Farmers who went into debt for the purchase of land or farm equipment during the post-war boom have suffered most severely. They have had to pay debts contracted when prices were high with products sold at relatively low prices. This has been doubly difficult because nearly all commodities which the farmer must buy are relatively higher, compared with pre-war, than are the products which he sells. Since the general price level is about 60 per cent above pre-war, the owner of middlewestern farm land might reasonable expect that his land ought to be worth considerably more than in pre-war years. The increase in the money in circulation, the increased use of bank checks, and the in - crease in credits have been important factors in maintaining the present level of high prices. If we continue to hold so large a part of the world's supply of gold and to utilize credit instruments freely, we can logically expect the general price level to remain relatively high. Transportation charges ordinarily increase the margin between the price received by the producer and that paid by the consumer by the amount of the charge. It is, therefore, evident) that the increases in freight rates since 1913 have either decreased the price paid to the pro - rir or increased the price paid by the consumer, or both, or possibly increased cost has been divided between the producer and consumer. There is abundant evidence to show that the farmer has suffered both as a producer and as a consumer. Agriculture has always paid taxes out of all proportion to agricul - tural income. Since the war agriculture has paid a large part of the increased burden of state and local taxation. Many farmers did over-expend and spend money unwisely during the post-war boom, but their record on the whole is no more unfavorable than that of bankers, merchants, and industrial workers. Our national income is not only much larger than it was before the war, but enough larger that the per capita purchasing power is greater than at any previous time. The question at issue is, therefore, a ques - tion of the distribution of the national income. The middlewestern farmer is receiving considerably less than his pre-war share. It log - ically follows that someone else is receiving considerably more than his pre-war share. The fact is, as everyone knows, that it has been possible </seg>
            <seg id="p231">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 231 for many labor organizations to maintain wage scales at near the post - war peak, and for the manufacturers of many kinds of goods to protect themselves by an increase in tariff schedules. We may say that to a limited extent, capital and labor through the aid of legislation and or - ganization have been able "to fix prices." The rniddlewestern farmer has not been protected by either favor - able legislation or a powerful organization. It may be said in fact with a fair degree of accuracy that he has received only that part of the na - tional income remaining after labor and capital have taken generous pay - ments. It has not been enough to maintain his pre-war standard of liv - ing and he has freely suggested that he believes something is wrong. Farmers as a class are not Bolshevists, or communists, or socialists, or even pessimists. They do have a sense of equality and justice. They have a little difficulty in understanding just how any group of men who object to working more than 30 or 40 hours per week should expect to receive a high labor income. They are not troubled by the higher brack - ets of the income tax, and perhaps believe that men who are so for - tunate as to have a large income should be willing to pay rather liberally for the benefits of government. Perhaps some of the remedies which farm leaders have suggested for righting the present maladjustment may not be economically sound. Perhaps the leaders themselves do not consider all of the ideas and plans economically sound. Perhaps they have been induced by the long estab - lished policy of government interference with national prices to think that it is the duty of the government to assist in the alleviation of pres - ent conditions by enacting legislation that will tend to increase the price of farm products. It is not difficult to find farmers who will neither argue that the policy of increasing the price of manufactured goods by a tariff is eco - nomically sound, nor that the policy of increasing the price of farm products through an export corporation or other legislation is econom - ically unsound. Most farmers will agree that price fixing by legislative enactment is price fixing whether the statute which permits it is called a tariff or by some other name less sweet. The undisputable fact is that labor and capital have profited at the expense of agriculture and largely as a result of legislation. The ques - tion at issue as seen by the farmer is: Shall we enact legislation to give agriculture relief by increasing the price of farm products, or shall we lower tariff walls, repeal the Adamson law and various other stat - utes, and permit competition to perform the equalizing process ? The present situation is unequitable and should not be permitted to continue: Labor and capital have so far offered nothing except the hope that time will eventually bring about a readjustment. Is it any wonder that after five years of waiting, agriculture is demanding relief legisla - tion? </seg>
            <seg id="p232">232 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture PRESIDENT DANLY: Prof. Filley has presented some very interesting questions. There may be queries in the minds of some of you which you would like him to answer. I am going to ask him to state what he considers the reason for the recent drop on the price of corn. PROF. FILLEY: Supply and demand. We had more corn, and this last year we didn't have aa many hogs as the year before. It is reasonable that there would be a drop in price. Question.- — Does not speculation have a great deal to do with the low price of farm 'products ? PROF. FILLEY: There is always a bushel of corn bought every time there is a bushel sold. No, I don't think speculation has anything to do with it; in fact the speculative market serves for what we might call a clearing house. The variations in the prices of corn, wheat and oats are much less than they were before we had a speculative market. For a time in Germany they did not have a speculative market, it being done away with by statute, but they found so much variation in prices that they permitted speculation again, and I am inclined to think that speculation is not much of a factor in depressing prices. Sometimes it may depress a price, and other times it may increase it; but I would say that it keeps the prices within narrower limits than if we did not have the specu - lative market. MR. AYE: The Professor gave a very interesting and truthful talk, but he wound up with kind of a question mark; what is the remedy? PROF. FILLEY: I leave that to the audience. They must either put agriculture up on wheels and level it up with the industries by drafting favorable legis - lation, and so on, or protect it in some other way. That is the easy thing. I think the economically sound thing to do is to lower the tariff walls, and repeal the Adamson law and some other legislation which is not favorable to the people in general, and in that way to get down to a plain, honest basis. MR. AYE: That brings us all on a level with Europe, and I don't think we want to be put in that position. MEMBER: Who is the speculator ? The man who buys this wheat and corn to feed or manufacture is not a speculator, but the man who buys it to sell again is a speculator. And isn't most of the grain bought and sold in that way? The great bulk of the wheat must be bought by people who expect to sell it again. </seg>
            <seg id="p233">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 233 PROF. FILLEY: Of course we know a part of the traffic in grain is speculation. A part of it is hedging, and some may be future speculation. MEMBER: I think it serves a good purpose. When the wheat comes in and the millers don't want it, there is someone to buy it. MR. DANLY: There is no question I think but that the speculator serves the farmer, just so he doesn't get to the point where he can corner the product and control it. MEMBER: They usually help the farmer, as when they buy they raise the price of corn do they not ? PROF. FILLEY: Yes, temporarily. But later on they sell which has a depressing affect on price. MR. FUNK: I think I have been as much interested in our national economic affairs as anybody. I don't know how the American people can live by themselves, economically or any other way, except insofar as we are able to call upon the stored up supplies and natural resources, which we had been storing up before the so-called civilized world got into action. Primitive man did not waste anything; civilized man has wasted the forests and many other things. I don't know how we are going to keep on going forever and expect to dump the surplus on the rest of the world at high prices. Some one made the statement not long ago that if the rest of the world could not sell to us they certainly could not buy anything from us, and that looks to me like an economic and sound ar - gument. Here is one other point touched upon by Professor Filley; he referred to that as a per capita tax. Now as to the difference in the tax between the farm and the city. There is a factor entering in there that I don't believe many farmers think about. The schools get the bulk of the taxes. Two or three years ago Lincoln increased the school levy against the protest of some of the best business men in Lincoln, those who actually pay the property tax. Then three years ago they voted three million dollars of bonds for school purposes. I have a personal friend on the Board of County Commissioners in this county, who is well acquainted with most of the business men and familiar with most of the property in the county. This county commissioner said that two-thirds of the people who came into his office denied that they voted for that three millions of bonds, but the bonds carried by a big majority. I think you will realize that it is reasonable to say that while the per capita tax in the city is $2, on the farm it is $8. It needs no argument to explain that, as so many people in the city work for wages and live </seg>
            <seg id="p234">Report op Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 234 in rented places and have no taxes to pay. They don't come in contact with this County Commissioner or tell whether they voted in this bond election and for this bond issue. But the taxes are increased. So I think there is one serious drawback to our modern civilization. People who pay no taxes vote for bond increases and the result is increased taxes. This commissioner told me school houses were being torn down in Lincoln before they were paid for. How many of you farmers can practice things like that on your farms? How many of you have resi - dences that cost $40,000 or $50,000? PROFESSOR FILLEY: The figures I gave on taxes both in Iowa and Nebraska did not include local or county taxes; they referred only to state taxes, and that has nothing to do with the schools. MR. AYE: I am getting scared; when a man wants to deprive people of the right to vote because they don't pay property tax, and do it by legis - lative act, he may be doing the wrong thing. MEMBER: I think in the last two sessions of the legislature a bill was intro - duced trying to increase the amount of vote necessary to carry a bond issue from one-half to two-thirds. If it would take a two-thirds vote to impose bonds upon the people that might remedy the difficulty. EFFICIENCY PLUS By H. C. TAYLOR Agricultural Economist What is needed to bring prosperity to the farmer, besides efficiency in production and marketing? In the January number of the Review of Reviews, Secretary Jardine says, "Increasing efficiency and decreasing costs are the foundation of a prosperous agriculture." He says also on the same page, "It is estimated that the aggregate production per person engaged in agriculture has increased 25 per cent since 1900. Before concluding that these statements are out of harmony with the facts, we should inquire what is meant by the phrase, "a prosperous agriculture." If by "a prosperous agriculture" is meant an abundant supply of cheap food and raw material without regard to the welfare of the farmers and their families, the Secretary may be thinking straight, but if by "a prosperous agriculture" is meant prosperous farmers, and that farm - ers are securing a fair share of the annual income of the nation as a basis of living in accordance with an American standard, the facts should </seg>
            <seg id="p235">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 235 be looked into a little farther before we accept efficiency as the founda - tion of prosperity in the presence of efficiency and bankruptcy. Reduction of Agricultural Income Before the World War and also in 1919, the farmers and their fam - ilies was receiving about 18 per cent of the current income of the nation. In 1920 they received about 13.4 per cent. In 1921 they received less than 10 per cent. Since 1921 the farmers' shaTe has increased but is a long way from being restored. There are reasons for believing that when figures are available they will show that the position of 1920 has been regained, or that farmers are receiving less than 14 per cent of the national income. Efficiency Does Not Necessarily Mean Prosperity Evidently something besides efficiency is essential to the prosperity of the farmer. What is this plus which must be added to efficiency if the farmers are to be prosperous? Obviously justice in distribution is the thing which must be added to efficiency in production if farmers are to prosper. It is only from the short time industrial, business, or city point of view that large crops sold for prices which leave the farmers in distress can be looked upon as a prosperous agriculture. When viewed from the National standpoint, or from the standpoint of the farmer we do not have at this time a prosperous agriculture in spite of an increase of twenty-five per cent in the aggregate production per person engaged in agriculture in this country. Efficiency in production is a good thing. Efficiency in marketing is a very important thing. Justice in distribution is a necessary thing. What can be done about this? Let the farmer help himself, by in - creasing his efficiency and lowering his costs is the answer we hear from Washington today. What Can Farmers Do to Help Themselves Obviously the farmers are under the necessity of helping themselves. What are the lines of action open to them? (1) Adjustment of Production — The farm manager and what he must hold in mind as a basis of wise farm management should have full consideration. The agricultural outlook reports are helpful but perfect adjustment of the relations of the various lines of production will not readjust price ratios. To quote from the 1925 report of the Secretary of Agriculture, "It is not enough to produce crops at the lowest possible cost. Nor yet does it suffice to have various farm enter - prises in their right relationship to one another, efficiency in cuttmg costs and in keeping a proper balance among the different farm enter- </seg>
            <seg id="p236">236 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture prises frequently benefits the consumer more than it benefits the pro - ducer." (2) The dropping from use of the least useful lands — Professor Richard T. Ely of the Institute for Research in Land Economics, empha - sizes the importance of governmental action which would take out of agricultural use the least useful farm lands and put them to use as forests. This would take a part of the supply of farm products off the market, the part which is being produced at the highest cost. A certain amount of this class of land is being given up as farmland. The Federal and State Governments have stimulated land settlement at considerable expense in times past, why not give some attention to helping people who have been reduced to poverty by efforts to farm submarginal land to get away from this land and find an opportunity to make a decent living. (3) The Movement from Agriculture to Other Occupations — It would appear obvious that if farm incomes are not adequate, farmers should quit farming and do something else. This movement is going one. The agricultural population is shrink - ing, but this process is slow. In 1922, two million men, women, and children left farms for cities, towns and villages. In 1924, two million seventy-five thousand made this move. But the back-to-the-farm move - ment is large and increasing. The back movement was 880,000 in 1922, and 1,396,000 in 1924. A large proportion of those who attempt to get out of agriculture into other occupations are unable to find remunerative occupations in the city. This is due in part to the fact that a man may be highly skilled in farming and be without skill in other occupations. Furthermore, while there are many farmers who are skilled in city in - dustries, the labor organizations do nothing to facilitate and what they can to retard their securing satisfactory positions. From the movement of population we cannot hope to find early re - lief from unsatisfactory ratios between the prices of farm products and city products. The movement will be slow in making itself felt in price ratios, but in the long run the consuming public will pay the price. Many good farmers feel the strain of the present depression, but realize that it is not possible for them to improve their situation. They are, many of them, encouraging their sons and daughters to secure an education and seek another occupation. There are more farm boys looking toward other occupations now than ever before. The process of population ad - justment is slow and painful, but it is in action, and the danger lies in the withdrawal from the farm of the best elements of the rural popula - tion to the ultimate detriment of agriculture and the nation. The whole subject of population movement should be studied from the standpoint of ways and means of providing for an adequate flow to keep a right balance between farm and city population and at the same time main - tain the quality of the rural population. </seg>

No method of bringing this to pass has been suggested. In fact the idea of reducing wheat, pork, land, and cotton to our present national needs is little more than an idle jest made perhaps to divert attention from effective remedies. A move to produce more for home use on the farm and depend less upon purchased food is worth considering. More time spent in the beautifying of the home and Fig. 4 — More time spent in the beautifying of the home and its surroundings is to be recommended ( Taylor ) . its surroundings is to be recommended. Shorter hours on the farm and more time for recreation would tend to limit supply and improve price ratios if indulged in generally, but without a general movement in these directions the individual who attempts to make these moves will be in danger of being driven out of business by the unmerciful competition of other farmers. (5) Concerted Action to Build a Higher Standard of Living — In the long run any class of producers get what they consume. If farmers as a class will not farm or encourage their sons to farm unless they can secure prices which will enable them to secure as many of the com - forts and conveniences of life as their city cousins are able to secure, then the prices will tend to be enough to provide the standard. As we have seen, it is not easy to make this adjustment quickly, and thus while the standard of living principle is one to keep in mind it is not the means of making an adjustment when a crisis has been brought on by the </seg>

It has truly been said that in the modern world you must eat your cake to keep it; the truth is no less important that you must get your cake be - fore you can eat it, (6) Economic Legislation — Other classes have helped themselves by securing special legislation which helps them hold for themselves a larger share of the national income than they would otherwise secure, and by the same token reduce the farmers' share. When farmers have asked to be in on this class of benefits it has been termed class legisla - tion, and who will deny that it is? What Hope Does Legislation Hold There are two lines of attack which the farmer can make on this question of economic legislation affecting his share in the national in - come: (a) the repeal of laws now in force which put the farmer at a disadvantage, and (b) the enacting of laws which will give like benefits to farmers. Repeal of Some Present Laws Some of the laws which put the farmer at a disadvantage because they tend to elevate the level of the price of the products the farmer buys without having the same influence upon the price of the things farmers sell may be enumerated as follows: The tariff on imports, the immigration law, railway legislation, and labor legislation. The effect of the tariff is not only to elevate the price of the protected goods, but also to make it more difficult for foreigners who desire to buy our agri - cultural products to send to the United States the products with which to pay for our farm products. The importance of making it easier for foreign products to be sold in the United States, if we are to sell our farm products abroad, is brought home to us when we realize that since the World War conditions with respect to the ability of European countries to pay for our products has greatly changed. Before the war we owed large sums of money abroad on which we paid the interest and some of the principal from year to year in agricultural products. At the present time the private investments abroad are said to run as high as 12 billion dollars, the interest on which must be paid by shipping goods from other countries to the United States before any credit balance is available with which the Europeans can pay for farm products. Furthermore, the governments of Europe are indebted to the gov - ernment of the United States about twelve billion dollars. The payment of this will further aggravate the situation by making it more difficult for the Europeans to buy our products. Not being able to raise the funds to pay interest and indebtedness and to pay for our farm products out of the exports of the United States owing to the restrictions put upon imports into the United States, the manufacturing industries of </seg>
            <seg id="p239">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 239 Europe have been somewhat depressed, and more and more people are looking toward agriculture as a means of subsistence thus stimulating agriculture in the countries to which we desire to ship our surplus farm products. Furthermore, the immigration law has the effect to hold more people in Europe who in turn enter agriculture and stimulate agricul - tural production at home, or else go to the Argentine and other agricul - tural countries and stimulate agricultural production in those countries which are competing with us in the European market, thus further de - pressing the prices of our agricultural surplus. All that would be necessary, it would seem, to stimulate the manu - factures of Europe and increase the flow of manufactured goods to the United States and thus stimulate the buying of farm products in Europe would be to lower the protective tariff on goods entering the United States. This, however, would depress the manufacturing industry of the United States and lower the labor rate. While this would serve the purpose of helping to readjust price ratios between farm products and city products, it would not be looked upon with favor by manufacturers nor by organized labor who would recognize that the ultimate effect would be to depress the wage rate. Those who put up the argument that this would depress the price of farm products by reducing the demand for food in the United States are overlooking two points. First, that the price of our products of which we produce a surplus, is determined abroad and not at home, and a stimulus to the demand abroad would tend to raise the price. Further - more that the wage rate in city industries is now about 225 per cent of what it was before the war. Those who are familiar with the conditions recognize the fact that laborers have not proportionately increased the quantity of potatoes, bread, and pork they have consumed as a result of their increase in wages. Furthermore, the demand for food would not greatly decrease as a result of a considerable decrease in the wage rate. The reduced expenditure would be in other lines rather than the neces - sities of life. Enactment of Laws From Farmer Standpoint The farmers in general seem to be more favorable to the idea of elevating the price of farm products to the level of city products than to reduce the price of city products and city labor. This, I believe,, should be more favorably received by labor interests also. The problem' is: How can the surplus be handled in such a manner as to maintain prices for farm products in the home market corresponding to the prices of city products? The remedy that has been suggested many times is: Make the protective tariff effective for those products of which we have a surplus by segregating the exportable surplus and selling it abroad for what it will bring in order that the domestic price may rise behind </seg>
            <seg id="p240">240 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture the tariff wall and levy an excise tax upon the producers of a given crop to cover the losses due to selling this surplus at a price below the do - mestic market price. In accordance with my understanding of the export commission plan as proposed by the late Secretary Wallace, it was neither "price fixing" nor "government subsidy." It was not government subsidy for the rea - son that the farmers were to carry the cost out of their own pockets. It was not "price fixing" for the reason that it did not propose that the price should be "fixed" but that they should float up and down with the world price level but be maintained some distance above the world price level by means of the protective tariff, just as the price of steel is maintained at a higher price level in the United States than abroad and rises and falls with changes in world conditions. It is not the price that is "fixed." It is the relation between the price at home and the price abroad that is "fixed." That is what the protective tariff has always done but has never before been called "price fixing." Effect on Production One objection brought forward to the export commission plan as proposed by Secretary Wallace was that it would stimulate over-produc - tion. While the export commission plan would have tempered the wind to the shorn lamb during the period of readjustment, it would not have stimulated over-production. It proposed to limit the rise in price to the ratio or purchasing power of these products before the war and then take from this price enough to pay the costs of handling the surplus. Thus the price of products of which we produce a surplus would have remained below the pre-war level in purchasing power. Prior to the war agriculture was not so profitable but that thou - sands of people were moving from the farm to the city industries every year, more than were moving from the city industries to the farm. This movement would continue under the proposed export commission plan, so that there would be no danger of agriculture expanding for the reason that city industry would still be more profitable than agriculture. Furthermore, there would be no new stimulus to move from one line of production in agriculture to another for the reason that all lines of pro - duction would be taken care of on the same basis, and since there would be no new tendency to move from one line of production to another nor to stimulate an increase in the number of persons entering agriculture, there would be no danger of undue expansion of agriculture as a result of the, export commission plan. The whole problem is that of securing a fair share for agriculture. Any sound method of accomplishing this result should be acceptable to farmers. Those who claim the export commission plan unsound are making a thrust at the protective system which may in the end cause serious trouble to those who favor the pro - tective tariff for manufacturers. </seg>
            <seg id="p241">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 241 Consumers Out-number Producers We are told by the President that the consumers outvote the pro - ducers. Therefore, producers of farm products cannot hope for legisla - tion improving their share of the national income. The question which naturally arises is: "How then do other producing groups get con - sumers to vote for special privileges for them?" Cannot farmers learn the methods used by the industrial group? Perhaps the President is right and consumers will come to see things this way and repeal the laws which increase their living costs. Through such action farmers might secure a fair share of the national income. Politics Versus Statesmanship In any event, farmers should know the state of mind of those who are in Washington to look after their interests. Washington is not crowded with statesmen who would serve the nation as a whole with full consideration to every occupation, but Washington is crowded with politicians who are looking after special interests. Why not recognize that under these conditions the farmers will suffer unless farmers are represented by men who will look after their interests. That the center of our national life should be a scene of class struggle is indeed un - fortunate. What is needed in Washington is not a greater number of business men with their shortsighted class point of view, but more states - men who take a long-time national point of view. Pending the day when statesmanship rather than class politics dominate in Washington, farmers must make up their minds either to be content with what is given them or fight for their rights. EUROPEAN CORN BORER A CORNBELT MENACE By W. W. BURR Nebraska Agricultural College The European corn borer is the most serious menace to corn pro - duction that has yet appeared in the United States. That this pest may not only render corn production unprofitable, but may utterly destroy the crop, is now an established fact. A few years ago a great deal was said about checking the spread of the corn borer and probably every practical measure was taken to prevent its reaching the Corn Belt. It is no longer a question as to whether or not the European corn borer will reach the Corn Belt; it is already at its very edge. The possible damage from this pest can hardly be described. To fully appreciate what it is capable of doing its ravages must be seen. </seg>
            <seg id="p242">242 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Present Location of Corn Borer The spread of the corn borer has been so rapid during the past several years and its menace to the corn industry so imminent that officials of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, the Canadian Govern - ment, and of the states where there is already corn borer infestation, called a conference late in September to awaken a more widespread in - terest among the farmers of the corn belt states. Representatives of all the states where corn is an important crop were invited to this con- Fitr. 6 — Nine corn borers were found on 6 inches of stalk in a corn field in Ontario. ference. Professor Swenk and the writer attended the conference from our state, therefore the statement that one has to see the ravages of this insect pest to fully appreciate its menace. The Bureau of Entomology of the U. S. Department of Agriculture has been working on this pest since it was first discovered in this country, and has rendered invaluable service in preventing its spread, and work - ing out its life history and means of control. The Canadian Depart - ment of Agriculture is also making every effort along these lines and several states have already expended large sums of state funds to assist in the work. After visiting some of the corn fields in southern Ontario, men attending the conference were fully convinced of the dangerous pos - sibilities of this insect. The corn borer knows no state lines; it is a na - tional problem and the seriousness of it warrants the expenditure of </seg>
            <seg id="p243">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 243 every effort to control it, even though eradication is out of the question. Every mile and every year that the spread of this pest can be hindered or delayed means an enormous saving for some sections and that much more time to develop means of control. A tour in connection with the conference gave opportunity for ob - serving the damage from the corn borer not only in areas where the infestation was light, but also in areas where it was exceedingly heavy. One or even two or three borers working in a corn plant does not do much damage, but when 30 or even 80 or 90 were operating in the same corn stalk, that particular plant had no chance for development. In a field in southern Ontario of especially heavy infestation, there was an average of 40 borers per stalk and a member of the party took 87 borers from one stalk. In this section the pest had first been noted in 1921 and at that time the infestation was light. The damage as seen during the present year in both Ohio and Michigan was not serious, being the second year of the appearance of the pest in these localities. The European corn borer is supposed to have been brought into this country about 15 years ago in shipments of broom corn from Hungary. It was first identified in the United States in 1917, when found causing severe damage to sweet corn near Boston. In 1919 it was discovered in several places in New York and at one point in Pennsylvania. At the present time it is known to be in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Con - necticut, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Ontario. The largest area of infestation is in regions of Lake Ontario and Lake Erie, comprising northwestern New York, Northwestern Penn - sylvania, northern Ohio, southern Ontario, and southeastern Michigan. This area comprises some 30,000 square miles. The damage by this pest is done when it is in the larval or cater - piller stage. In this stage it is quite similar to other stalk borers known to the entomologists of the country. When full grown it is a small worm about one inch long and one-eight inch wide with brown head and grayish to pinkish body, with two dark brown spots on the back of each segment. The borer lives over winter in the caterpillar stage, wintering in corn stalks and the stems of other crop plants and weeds. In the spring 1 it changes into the pupa stage and about two weeks later emerges as a moth, depositing its eggs preferably upon corn plants. A female moth lays from 300 to 400 eggs and has been known to travel as much as 20 miles. In Massachusetts there are two broods of moths each year, but in other sections of this country only one brood is customary. Borers Spread Slowly It is in the moth stage of the pest that the natural spread takes place. The moths frequently fly considerable distances and if wind con - ditions are favorable, they may be carried for long distances. The rate </seg>
            <seg id="p244">244 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture at which they may spread is shown in an article by Professor Cox, pub - lished in the Michigan Farmer of October 17th, in which he says that in 1921 fourteen townships in Michigan were known to be infested. In 1923 there were four more townships infested in the state of Michigan. In addition to the natural spread there is grave danger of an ar - tificial spread through the corn borer's being carried into new territory in corn stalks, ears, or other plant material in which they may be con- Fig. 6 — In a field of flint corn planted May 15 in Ontario, the cobs and stalks were 100 per cent infested and there was an average of 33 borers per st*lk. cealed. During the past summer in the government quarantine main - tained throughout the infested area, upwards of 170 thousand roasting ears were taken from the cars of tourists and among these ears were found a considerable number of larvae. Had these not been intercepted, the pest might have taken a long jump into the Corn Belt. The corn borer will infest any above ground part of the corn plant. The injury consists in their eating their way into and burrowing within the stalks, ears, ear shanks, and tassels of the corn plant. This fre - quently weakens the corn plant so that it easily breaks over and gen - erally the first notice of infestation is the broken over tassels. It also interferes with the movement of moisture and plant food from the soil into the upper portions of the plant, thus seriously retarding growth. Furthermore, through the wounds made by the borers diseases may enter which cause rotting of the plant tissues. In one heavily infested field which was visited on the first day of October, not a single plant tassel was standing. More than 95 percent of the plants were broken at or below the ear. In many of the plants the pith was largely eaten out. The stalks were rotting and would not even make feed — not one plant in 300 even attempted to form kernels and not one marketable ear of corn was produced in the whole field. </seg>
            <seg id="p245">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 245 The field looked much as it would a few weeks after a severe hail storm, or after it had been trampled by cattle. Professor Swenk remarked that he had never before seen a pest that could so muss up a crop. The question naturally arises from the foregoing, can the corn borer be controlled? To a large degree this can be answered, "yes." Control measures have already been worked out, and these may be improved as more information becomes available. The control measures recommend - ed are largely cultural practices. Spraying and poisoning will not work, since the caterpiller spends most of its life inside the plant where it can not be reached by spray or poison. Trapping the moths is not feasible, since they fly mainly at night and are not attracted by light. The methods of control recommended are based on the fact that the borers winter over in the above ground part of the plants. They are found in the stalks, stubble, and cobs of the corn plant. It is necessary therefore, that these be handled in such a manner as to destroy the bor - ers. Where corn is put in the silo, the borers are killed by chopping up the plants and by the fermentation that takes place in the silo. Experi - mental work done in Ohio shows that the corn should be cut low, so as to leave less borers in the stubble, but even those left may be destroyed. Where corn is harvested as it is over much of the Cornbelt, pastur - ing the stalks early and burning all of the refuse, together with deep plowing will destroy most of the borers. Ohio has found that the borers are less apt to get to the surface where they are turned under to greater depths. After shelling the corn the cobs should be burned before the time of emergence of the moth in the spring. In addition to carefully hand - ling the parts of the corn plant itself, coarse grass and weeds in and adjacent to the field must be destroyed. Corn borers have already been found in more than 100 species of plants, including weeds, coarse grass, flowers, rhubarb, and in fact anything that has a large enough stem for them to burrow into. Other methods of control have been tried. Late planting of the corn has been decidedly beneficial, as there is a much lower percentage of infestation. This means that early varieties of corn that will mature from late planting will be desirable for infested areas. In a comparison of varieties there seemed to be no difference when planted on the same date, and the borers attacked flint corn as well as dent and sweet corn. They do not attack the sorghums to the same degree. Parasitic Control The U. S. Bureau of Entomology is and has been searching for parasites that will control the borers. It has already imported a number of species from Europe where they were parasitic upon the corn borer. A laboratory where these are studied and propagated is maintained at Arlington, Mass. </seg>
            <seg id="p246">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 246 Will It Reach Nebraska Will the corn borer come to Nebraska, and how will it affect corn production here ? There seems little doubt but that it will come to Ne - braska, and the question is — when ? Just how seriously it will affect our corn industry is problematical. If the present strict quarantine can be maintained and obeyed, so that no one will give the pest a big boost in this direction, it should be a number of years in reaching us. It has been estimated that by natural means the spread should not be more than twenty to forty miles per year. This would put off its advent into our Fig. 7 — Corn borers have injured the shanks and have also eaten thru the husks to reach the ear. state for some time, during which control measures both parasitic and otherwise may be worked out.

            <seg id="p247">Nebraska Chop Growers' Association 247 no one is anxious to see what the effect will be. The longer this can be delayed, the better off for Nebraska fanners. However, the danger, though it may not be immediate, is nevertheless real. When the borer does reach Nebraska it does not mean that corn pro - duction will be destroyed, but it probably means increased cost of pro - duction, on account of the extra control measures necessary. Further - more, as with the advent of the boll-weevil into the cotton belt, it will probably bring about certain changes in our cropping systems, if the pest flourishes under our conditions. WM. BALL— AUBURN: Why are they so particular about keeping it out of New York City ? PROFESSOR BURR: They say that if it gets into the New York markets it will take an army of men to control it. The volume of business there is so great, and the spread over the surrounding territory so rapid and so wide from the shipment of vegetables, fruits, and so on. It will bore into almost any plant that has a stem large enough for it to work into, according to the information we now have. MR. BALL: I am interested in knowing whether sweet corn is bothered more than field corn. PROFESSOR BURR: Yes sir, it particularly likes sweet corn; I think it is a recognized fact that sweet corn is more infested. MR. BALL: We shipped sweet corn from Connecticut last year and in shelling this corn we found some mouldy spots which in my opinion was diseased. I kept those ears separate from the rest of the corn and planted it by itself. It produced a great deal of smut and about double the amount of ear worms that our Nebraska corn did. A great many of the farm - ers in our locality are raising sweet corn which seems to have more ear worm infestation. A great many of our farmers are wondering if it is safe to raise sweet corn because of the likelihood of introducing these insects to attack the field corn. I would like to get your opinion re - garding this Connecticut corn and whether there would be danger of getting the European Corn Borer from its corn and whether it would be all right to plant that corn in this locality. PROFESSOR BURR: Sweet corn cannot be brought in legally from infested areas unless it is shelled. The European corn borer is not carried in shelled corn. </seg>
            <seg id="p248">248 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture It would have to slip by the quarantine somehow to be brought in. Of course bringing in corn from an infested area will not bring in the borer unless the borer is in either the moth or the larvae stage. PROF. SWENK (State Entomologist): The Federal quarantine does not cover the infested states as a whole, but is applied by townships, and it is aimed to cover only the townships that are known to be infested. The Federal authorities main - tain in the field all summer a corps of men who examine the corn fields and other susceptible plants, in the areas surrounding the known infested district, and if they find, in any township, any evidence whatever of the borer, that entire township is included in the quarantined area. The quarantined area is revised at least once a year, and it is anticipated that revisions will be made even more rapidly in the future. The corn belt states are now insisting that considerable latitude be used in de - limiting the quarantined districts, and that if there is any possible doubt as to the presence of any infestation that the whole township be in - cluded in the quarantine. It is now perfectly possible to get shipments of corn from parts of Connecticut lying outside of the quarantined area because the entire state of Connecticut is not within the quarantined area. This corn the gentleman speaks of probably came from some lo - cality outside of tha quarantined districts. There would certainly be very great danger in securing corn in the ear from any part of the quarantined area. MR. BOCK (Butler Co.): I would say that we have a big insect problem right here at home. The problem of the cutworm is important and the corn ear worm is so bad that you can hardly find one full ear of corn in a thousand ears. I would like to hear a discussion of the insects that are already here, rather than about this one that is not yet here. PROF. SWENK: I don't want to divert the conversation from the European corn borer, but I will comment on the gentleman's statement briefly. We do not have in the cutworm problem a problem similar to that of the European corn borer, in that one single kind of insect is concerned, but the cut - worm problem is a difficult one because in Nebraska there are no fewer than seventeen different kinds of cutworms, each different from the others in its habits of life and its life-history, and each presenting in it - self a unit problem. These cutworms are distributed in different parts of the state, and in different kinds of soils. They have different times of working their injury,' some beginning as early as April while others do not complete their feeding until well along in July. Some have one brood, some two, and some three, in a year, which broods come at different times. They have different methods of summering; some complete devel - opment in the spring at different times, while others lie dormant in the soil all summer. Some winter as eggs, others as larvae. The thing is such </seg>
            <seg id="p249">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 249 a complicated question that to talk to you about "the cutworm" would be more than you could follow without a great deal of explanation. I could talk to you about any one kind of cutworm, but I cannot talk to you about cutworms as a whole any more than about the general disposi - tions of men, because every one has his own disposition. For several years we have been carrying an active project in the Experiment Station with the hope of getting more information about our different kinds of cutworms, the damage they do, and their varying habits and life-his - tories. At the present time we are forced to recommend the poisoning method, which, except in the case of three or four species, gives fair to excellent results. With a mixture of bran, white arsenic and molasses, mixed up to make a wet mash that will break readily into fine flakes, broadcasted in the evening evenly through any portion of the corn field that is being cut, you will find you will usually get a very heavy kill of cutworms. In some cases you may get as high as ninety per cent of control, but in others much less. In those three or four species which do their feeding wholly or largely underground of course you can't use this method. Two of the worst cutworms we have in the state — one in the northeastern part of the state along the edge of the sandhills, and another in the southwestern part of the state — in particular one cannot get by this method, but the others one gets fairly well, and some ex - cellently, with this poisoned bran mash bait. We are giving this whole problem our careful attention, and we hope eventually to work out a practical cultural method of control for each species concerned that can be included in our regular agricultural practices. Regarding the efficiency of the Government corn borer inspectors, I know personally the man in charge of these inspectors; he is a dynamic fellow, and if he thought a man on the job was sluffing, I venture to say that man would soon be out of a job. The men doing this work in the corn belt area are mostly students in our colleges and universities, employed in the summer only. They went over more than two and a half million acres, and I think there were only a few hundred of them, so you can judge the number of cars each man searched during the sum - mer, and if you think of that a little I believe you will be satisfied with their services. </seg>
            <seg id="p250">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 250 THE VALUE OF THE HAY GRADES TO THE FARMER F. D. KEIM College of Agriculture Recognized standard grades for most of our commodities are usually valuable. This fall when I purchased a bushel of peaches which was marked U. S. Grade No. 1 Colorado Free-stones, I fully expected to get just that quality product and I was not disappointed. If a car of grain is graded by a licensed inspector in Omaha, we fully expect this car to grade exactly the same in Chicago or St. Louis. This same condition should hold with hay. To illustrate: let us say that a carload of hay with all the qualities that go to make up a U. S. No. 1 alfalfa is loaded at Overton, Nebraska. When this gets to Omaha it is in - spected and may be given a No. 1 grade or it may not, depending on the standards used at that market. Suppose that from there it is sent to some southern market, like New Orleans, and thereupon inspection it is graded No. 2 or No. 3. Now if this car of hay is really a No. 1 product then it is unfair that it should be graded a No. 2 or 3 in New Orleans. If you ask who is to blame for this difference, it is a little difficult to place the blame. Every man who had anything to do with grading it may have been perfectly honest and graded it to the best of his ability. The chief difficulty lies in the fact that the inspectors were not trained alike and simply had different standards. In other words our hay stand - ards are at fault. We need uniform hay standards for the entire nation just as we now have uniform grain grades. Fig. 8 — We need uniform hay standards for the entire nation just as we now have uniform grain grades. Need National Standardization It seems to me that about the only way we will be able to standard - ize hay is to place this work in the hands of some organization which has enough experience and broad enough knowledge so that the system will hold no matter in what part of the country it is applied. The Fed - eral Government through the U. S. Department of Agriculture, with it» </seg>
            <seg id="p251">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 251 machinery already established, is the only organization general enough in its scope to undertake this standardization work. It is in a position to train and license inspectors. It is also in position to make a study of the hay grown all over the United States, and to formulate a set of rules that will fit all kinds of hay no matter where it is grown. A splendid illustration of this is seen in Table 1. In the first column headed "Class" there are 9 different classes of hay listed. Nebraska is chiefly interested in the classes "Alfalfa," "Alfalfa lieht jrrass mixed," and "Alfalfa grass mixed." The eastern part of the U. S. is chiefly interested in the classes "Alfalfa," "Alfalfa light timothy mixed," "Alfalfa timothy mixed," and "Alfalfa clover mixed." The southern part of the U. S. is interested in the classes "Alfalfa" and "Alfalfa light Johnson mixed." The Pacific coast is interested in the classes "Alfalfa," "Alfalfa light grain mixed" and "Alfalfa grain mixed." Here then we have a system of classes of alfalfa hay that cover the U. S. in general, with each particular market of the United States paying attention only to those classes in which it is most interested. Every inspector who is trained under the supervision of the Federal Government is required to know these classes and to understand thoroughly the percentage of mixtures that go to make them up, as well as to understand the chief grading factors that establish the class and grade of hay. In grading alfalfa hay there are three grading factors, namely, per cent of leafiness, color, and foreign material. By examining Table 1 we can readily learn the grade requirements for No. 1, 2, and 3 al - falfa in leafiness, color, and foreign material for each one of the classes. For example, if a car of straight alfalfa grades No. 1, it must contain 40% or more of leaves by weight, have 60% or more natural green color and may have not to exceed 5% of foreign material. Your atten - tion is called to the special classes for coarse and fine soft alfalfa hay. Most of the alfalfa raised in Nebraska will fall into the first class men - tioned in our table, i. e., straight alfalfa. However, when 30% of the stems have diameters greater than a No. 13 steel wire, the word "coarse" is attached and it is called coarse alfalfa. On the other hand when the hay is unusually fine and contains no stalks having diameters greater than No. 12 steel wire and not to exceed 30% of stalks having diameters greater than No. 14 steel wire, it is called fine alfalfa hay. Then if the hay in addition has very fine, soft stems and clinging foliage, the word "Soft" is attached. This fine, soft alfalfa in some places is called "dairy alfalfa," "Rabbit alfalfa," "extra fancy," and "fourth cutting." Leafiness, Color, and Foreign Material </seg>

            <seg id="p254">254 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Fig. 9 — When the new Federal hay grades come into general use it will pay the farmer well to put onto the market the best quality of hay that he can produce. — Photo by courtesy Nebraska Conservation and Survey Division Tobacco-brown Alfalfa Hay It will be noticed that there is no special class for brown hay, or as some call it tobacco-brown hay. This particular type of hay is usually formed when alfalfa is -put up very green and allowed to cure in the stack. It is suggested that this type of hay is more or less acci - dently formed and I think practical experience will back up this thought. For instance, if green alfalfa is placed in the stack during fine drying weather, it is very likely that the hay will cure into the tobacco-brown type. On the other hand if the days following stacking happen to be extremely damp and cloudy, it is very likely that this hay, or at least quite a large part of it, will spoil. It seems to be the experience of growers and consumers alike that where this brown hay is cured properly it is very palatable and makes excellent feed. But owing to the fact that it is so hard to cure it just right, its production is to be discouraged and it is considered best to feed what is produced rather than to place it on the market for sale. If it is placed on the market, it would simply be called tobacco-brown hay, and described as to leafiness, mold and other qualities. Another important grading factor is foreign material. An outstand - ing practice which furnishes a lot of foreign material in alfalfa hay is that of not raking the fields after the sweep. Much scattered hay is allowed to remain on the field only to be raked up with the next crop. Many times there is enough of this old, discolored alfalfa raked up with a new cutting to lower the grade from a No. 1 alfalfa to a No. 2 or even No. 3. Other foreign material such as weeds, worthless sedges, rushes, and wire grasses, and injurious material such as sand burs, poisonous plants, and wild barley, should be carefully guarded against because these will materially lower the grade and thus reduce the price. When these new hay grades have been adopted in all U. S. hay </seg>
            <seg id="p255">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 255 markets, it is certainly going to pay the farmer to make every effort to put onto the market the best quality of hay that he can produce. This is going to be practical because hay is going to be sold on a definite grade and the shipper will no doubt be paid for just exactly what he has to offer. Percentage of Leaves and Stems by Weight It has occurred to me that you might be interested in some data that has been collected relative to the problems dealing with quality in hay. Foster, Merrill and Widtsoe in Utah Bulletin 61 gives us some interesting data on the proportion of leaves, stalks and flowers in alfalfa hay. Table 2 shows these percentages in the first, second and third cut- tings when cut at different stages of growth. The authors in summariz- ing this work state: "An average of the percent of leaves in all of the cuttings shows them to constitute more than 37 percent of the dry mat- ter in alfalfa hay when they are not lost by improper curing and handling." In summarizing the material from 5 or 6 authors on the subject it appears that about 2-5 of the total weight of the alfalfa plant is in the leaves. Table 2. — Proportion of Leaves, Stalks, and Flowers in the Dry Matter Cuttings Percent of Percent of Percent of Leaves Stalks Flowers 1st crop Early cutting 38.42 58.75 2.82 Medium cutting 34.56 59.62 5.82 Late cutting 25.26 67.45 7.29 2nd crop Early cutting 43.71 54.58 1.71 Medium cutting 39.58 53.18 7.24 Late cutting , 35.15 56.20 8.65 3rd crop : 43.93 55.43 0.64 Average of 1st &amp; 2nd crops Early cutting 41.07 56.67 2.27 Medium cutting ; 37.07 56.40 6.53 Late cutting 30.21 61.83 9.79 Average of all cuttings 37.23 57.89 4.88 </seg>
            <seg id="p256">256 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Analysis of Nutrients in Leaves, Stems, and Flowers Foster, Merrill and Widtsoe, again in Utah Bulletin 61, show that when the stems are compared with the leaves and flowers, the leaves and flowers contain almost 3 times as much protein, more than 4 times as much fat and half more nitrogen-free extract than do the stems. Table 3. — Composition of Alfalfa Leaves, Stems, and Flowers (Dry Matter Basis) J. M. Westgate discussing this same subject in Farmers Bulletin 339 says 3-5 of the protein is in the leaves, i. e., 44 pounds of leaves con - tain as much protein as 100 pounds of stems. Analysis of Nutrients in 1st, 2nd and 3rd Cuttings Little data has been published on this particular subject at the Ne - braska Station. In one of the older Nebraska reports was found some data which is summarized in table 4. Table 4. — Composition of Cuttings (Dry Matter Basis) It is quite obvious that the cuttings in the various parts of the United States would differ materially and data collected in Idaho or Utah might not apply to our conditions here in Nebraska. In this brief table (No. 4) it is readily seen that the protein and fat increase from the first to the third cuttings and that there is comparatively little difference in the nitrogen-free extract.

            <seg id="p257">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 257 Relation of Maturity to Total Nutrients Foster, Merrill and Widtsoe in Utah Bulletin 61 makes the following statement on this subject: "Comparing the time of cutting, it is found that the largest per cent of protein occurs in all parts of the plant in the early cuttings, the amount gradually decreasing through the medium and late. The same may be noticed in the fat contained in the leaves." Knight and Hepner in Wyoming Bulletin 78 state: "Hay cut when one- tenth in bloom contains a much larger percentage of both the total pro- tein and digestible protein than when cut one-half in bloom or in full bloom, both diminish as the alfalfa matures but the carbohydrates in- crease." The same thought is shown rather strikingly by Swanson and Lat- shan in the Journal Industrial Engineering Chemistry, vol. 8, No. 8, 1916, in the following table: Table 5. — Analysis at Different Periods of Growth of Plant (Dry Matter Basis) t,. . „ . . , Crude Crude N.-free _, .

Headden in Colorado Bulletin 111 (table 6) shows that the damaged hay contained much less crude protein, considerably less nitrogen-free extract, and much more fiber. Of the original nutrients 60 per cent of the crude protein, 41 percent of the nitrogen-free extract and 33.3 per cent of the fat, or 31.7 per cent of the total dry matter were lost. He makes the statement that the actual damage was even greater because the nutrients lost were those most soluable and hence most easily digested.

            <seg id="p258">258 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture In looking over other reports all of which I am not able to give here, I find that a rather distinct loss usually occurs when hay is allowed to leach in the field. In a Kansas Report issued in June 1916, the following quotation was taken: "Green alfalfa was made into hay. This green hay was then put under a faucet and water permitted to run upon it or wash it for about two hours corresponding to a heavy rain. Analysis taken before and after washing show a loss of 14 per cent protein. This experiment was varied in amount of water and dryness of the hay. Var- ious degrees of losses occurred ranging from 20 to 52 per cent of pro- tein. Four to eight per cent of the ash was also washed out and 25 per cent of the fat." Losses of Organic Matter in Making Brown and Black Alfalfa Hay C. D. Swanson, C. E. Call, and S. C. Salmon of the Kansas Experi- ment Station published in 1919 a rather striking table showing the loss sustained when hay was stacked so that it would be cured as brown or black alfalfa. Table 8. — Percentages of Chemical Constituents of Brown and Black Al- falfa Taken from the Stack. ..(Water Free Basis) Description of Sample . , of- Crude N.-free Ether Ash Protein _.., _, , ; _, , Fiber Extract Extract Charred hay 16.01 19.75 27.64 34.56 2.04 Partly moldy hay... 26.11 20.51 24.99 26.91 1.48 Black hay 15.52 19.03 32.80 30.49 2.16 Stack bottom, bad odor 19.55 13.61 33.33 30.54 2.97 Green hay 14.24 16.40 35.20 31.52 2.64 Dark brown hay 14.44 18.58 22.76 42.55 1.66 Moldy and charred on top of stack.... 21.41 26.61 19.16 32.69 0.13 Green hay from out- side good 10.97 14.41 33.76 40.09 0.77 Light brown hay ; 14.75 17.03 29.30 37.98 0.94 Green alfalfa before being stacked 9.27 17.25 38.97 31.83 2.68 In examining the table it can be seen that there is not such a strik- ing difference in the chemical analyses of these different types of hays. As one might expect, a close examination of the data shows some rather conflicting evidence. One of the most striking points, however, was the distinct loss in total dry matter. The stack of alfalfa contained 80,115 pounds of dry matter when it was put up, 48,806 pounds of dry matter were taken from the stack showing a loss in organic matter of 39.1 per- cent. In general it appears that the loss of organic matter varied with </seg>
            <seg id="p259">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 259 the condition of the hay being greatest for these samples which were charred or moldy. The loss for brown hay appeared to be less than the black, but in both cases it was much greater than would be expected for hay cured in the usual way. Shrinkage in Stack, Mow or Bale W. A. Cooke in Colorado Bulletin 57 shows in table 9 a distinct sav - ing in dry matter between hay stored in the barn and that stored in the stack. The author states that these figures are for the first cutting. He also states that the losses with the second cutting are much less, while the third cutting has practically no loss. Table 9 Percent of loss Percent of loss Percent of loss in weight in dry matter in feeding value Stack 17.7 10.0 12.4 Barn 12.2 2.5 2.5 J. T. Willard in Kansas Bulletin 155 states: "Hay loses 20% in weight after it is put in the stack or mow until sold or baled, not count - ing loss in stacks due to damage by rain. After baling each bale of alfalfa will shrink from one to four pounds." H. D. Hughes in Iowa Bulletin 137 states: "As an average the cured hay will shrink from 20 to 30 per cent of the field cured weight." Spontaneous Combustion There is always more or less of an interest in spontaneous com - bustion. W. H. Beal of the U. S. Department of Agriculture in Farmers Bulletin 105 has this to say about the subject: "When moist hay is stored under favorable conditions fermentation takes place, which may produce a considerable amount of heat. The amount of heat may be sufficient to set fire to the hay. Under suitable conditions some of the organic matter of the hay is oxidized by the oxygen of the air. Carbon dioxide and water are produced. The water moistens the hay and the moistened material ferments. Fermentation produces carbon dioxide, water and small amounts of other compounds. Heat also is produced. The fer - mentation is more active if the material is moistened at the beginning. However, the water produced by the oxidation of the materials is suf - ficient to start it. This fermentation produces a temperature of about 132.8° Fahrenheit. At this temperature a second and more violent oxida - tion takes place and the temperature rises to about 194° Fahrenheit. Other processes then take place which char the material and cause a slow rise of temperature to 266° Fahrenheit. When this temperature is reached the hay chars rapidly. All these processes destroy at least half </seg>
            <seg id="p260">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 260 of the material present. Theoretically, the temperature may rise to 374° F. According to tests clover hay will become ignited at 302-392 ° F. Spontaneous combustion is indicated by the hay becoming darker in color until it is finally black, by a sooty odor, and by smoke irritating to the eyes. The ash of the burned hay is surrounded by a layer of charred but not burned material." In closing I might say that there are still several points that might be discussed. Bailing and shipping hay on the winrow market is an interesting topic. The feeding of the discolored or poorer quality hay and selling the very best is another. Poorly baled and uniformly loaded cars would also prove to be an interesting subject. These we will have to postpone for a later date. REPORT OF THE 1925 CORN YIELD CONTEST Of the Nebraska Crop Growers Association and the Nebraska College of Agriculture Cooperating P. H. STEWART and D. L. GROSS The 10-Acre Corn Yield Contest continued to grow in popularity during the 1925 season. One hundred fifty-three men enrolled in the contest, 87 finished the contest completely, and several others were prac - tically complete but failed to give full reports or to submit a 20-pound sample of corn, and so were disqualified. Much credit for the success of the contest is due to the county extension agents who enrolled contest - ants and assisted in checking up on yields and records. The officials of the Association feel that the contest is well worth while. The records as to rotations and cultural practices aid greatly in. advocating better corn production and cropping practices in the state. It is felt that each year the contest records become more and more valuable. They also give excellent material on which to figure the cost of production. Labor costs as given in the records are felt to be aver - age and representative for the different parts of the state. When these labor costs are used in conjunction with average yields, they should give figures representing the average cost per bushel of corn. By comparing the average yields and costs per bushel with the yields and costs per bushel of the various contestants, the great importance of high yields in determining profits is emphasized. Since rotation methods and par - ticularly legumes are responsible for these high yields, at least in the eastern Nebraska region, the importance of soil building crops is there - by shown. The 1925 contest was conducted in much the same manner as in </seg>
            <seg id="p261">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 261 1924. Contestants were scored on the basis of 65% for yield, 20% for profit per acre, 10% for quality and 5% for reports. Thus the winner must have not only a high yield, but it must have been produced cheaply and be of good quality. This scoring in several instances resulted in the placing of a man down on account of high cost even though his yield was high. The following is a digest of the rules used in conducting the contest: "The state shall be divided for this contest into three regions with goals of 50, 70, and 90 bushels in the western, central, and eastern sec - tions of the state respectively. The goal for irrigated fields will be 20 bushels above that of unirrigated fields of each region. "Any contestant who equals or exceeds the goal for his section shall be entitled to membership in the Nebraska Maximum Corn Yield Club. A 'Recognition of Achievement' certificate will be conferred on all such successful contestants at the annual session of the Nebraska Crop Grow - ers Association at Lincoln in January. "Each county may have its own contest directed by the County Agent and Farm Bureau, with contestants scored on the same basis as in the state contest. The highest scoring contestant in each county contest will be awarded a medal by the Nebraska Crop Growers Association. Other county premiums will be awarded. Yields are to be carefully and uniformly determined by husking out 2 rows 10 rods long in 5 different parts of the field. A 20-pound sample of field-run corn shall be shipped to the Agricultural College. This corn is to be dried and the shrinkage and shelling per cent determined. Qual - ity is determined by grading a sample of shelled corn on the commercial basis. Rent is figured at 2-5 of the crop in the eastern and 1-3 in the central and western sections. Man labor is figured at 30 cents per hour, and horse labor at 20 cents — the latter cost also covering machinery cost. Husking is charged at 10 cents per bushel to cover board, wagon and team, and wages. Silver medals are to be given to the high man in each county con - test. Gold medals are to be given to the high man in each section of the state contest. Cash prizes of $25, $20, $15, $10, and $5 are also given as premiums for first, second, third, fourth, and fifth places, re - spectively, in each region. The Omaha Grain Exchange offered $180 in premiums, and the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association offered the other premiums." The highest men in each region of the contest are as follows : Eastern Region First — E. P. Noyes, Valley — 101 bu. per acre— Gold medal, $25 cash. Second — John Gilmore, Valley — 91.5 bu. per acre — $20 cash. </seg>

Perhaps the most outstanding thing: shown by the records of the 38 contestants in the eastern region is the effect of legume crops on corn yields. The average yield per acre of these 38 men was 69 bushels per acre. According to official statistics the average yield of all corn in the eastern region this past season was about 35 bushels per acre. What made the 34-bushel increase per acre on the 10-acre fields entered by the contestants ? A look at the records shows that of these 38 men only 5 did not have alfalfa, red or sweet clover on these fields within the last four years, and most of them within the last two years. No doubt this Fi* 10 — The importance of legumes in increasing the yield of corn was strikingly shown by the records of eastern Nebraska contestants. is one of the chief reasons why the yield of the fields of the contestants was practically twice the average yield of all farmers. It cannot be said that the contestants entered bottom land or creek land field because the majority of them did not do so. Let us take one or two examples to show the effect of legumes on soil fertility and the yield of corn in eastern Nebraska. J. H. Cooper of Washington, Nebraska, was third in the eastern region of the Ne - braska Yield Contest with a yield of 87 bushels per acre. This field is a part of an upland farm in northern Douglas county. The field, how - ever, had been in sweet clover the past 2 years. It was a sight good for a pessimistic soul to see the corn crop on this field this fall when the yields were checked up. There is no crop like sweet clover to put a piece of thin soil into a wonderful state of tilth and fertility. Two years of sweet clover will probably equal 4 years of alfalfa from the soil build - ing standpoint. And while it is doing this it will furnish as much or more feed than the average permanent pasture. Up in Madison county, County Agent Stewart lined up a county corn yield contest entering 10 men in different parts of the county. Frank White of Madison won the county contest and ranked 8th in the eastern </seg>
            <seg id="p264">264 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Nebraska section with a yield of 76 bushels. The history of his field is interesting. This land a few years ago was badly rundown and cockle - burs and sunflowers grew better and thicker than it grew anything else. After 8 years of alfalfa on a part of the 10 acres and 2 years of sweet clover on the. rest, a splendid crop of corn making 76 bushels per acre was produced this year. This again shows the result of legume crops in the rotation in eastern Nebraska. In the central and western parts of the state, the lower rainfall makes the cropping of land that has been in alfalfa and sweet clover more of a problem than in the eastern part, and the yields of grain crops on such lands is sometimes reduced for a season or two because of extreme fertility coupled with a lack of soil moisture. We have said that the fact that the 38 eastern Nebraska contestants, EOUfKL Fig. 10A — Cartoon. as a group, had a legume crop precede the corn crop was largely re - sponsible for the high average yield of 69 bushels per acre when the average corn yield in this section of Nebraska this year was about 35 bushels per acre. Let us see how the acre profit of these contestants compares with the profit of the average man. In figuring the profit of the contestants, 2-5 of the crop was charged as rent in the eastern section and 1-3 in the central and western sec - tions. A charge was made of 30 cents per man-hour and 20 cents for every horse-hour spent in growing the corn, this latter cost also covering </seg>
            <seg id="p265">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 265 the machinery cost. Husking was labor, board, and team and wagon. charged at 10c per bushel to cover Corn was valued at 60c per bushel. Figuring on this basis it was eastern Nebraska contestants 37.8 found that on the average it cost cents per bushel to raise and crib their corn. Likewise figuring that the average man in eastern Nebraska puts in just as much field work as did the 38 contestants and that he raised an average yield of 35 bushels, his cost was found to be 57 cents per bushel. Putting this on the basis of profit per acre, the 38 eastern Nebraska contestants showed an average profit of $9.49 after taking out rent corn- and labor costs, compared to a profit of 61 cents per acre for men with average yields of 35 bushels per acre. Figuring that the men owned their own farms and could consider the rent corn as their own, each contestant would have 27 additional bushels as compared to 14 bush - els, in addition to the acre profts of $9.49 and 61 cents per acre, re - spectively. Putting it in another way, the contestant with a 69-bushel yield would make as much on one acre as a man with a 35-bushel yield would make on 15 acres. These figures very strikingly call attention 1o the fact that it is the high yields that pay the big profits. We want in this contest to call attention to the importance of high yields per acre, and to the methods for securing high yields. Fewer acres of corn, with more land seeded down, is the idea we have in mind rather than to sug - gest greater corn production on the farms of the state. Forty acres of corn making a high yield will leave more profit than 80 acres making only one-half as much per acre. There is where the efficient production comes in. Fig. 11 — The close correlation between labor cost, and profit per acre is shown in graph. Profit per acre tends to follow the yield per acre. this </seg>

In each case the man with the lowest cost received a greater profit per acre notwithstanding the fact that he had in most cases a lower yield per acre. In the eastern region, although the men with the low cost had a lower yield per acre, they received twice as much. This would seem to indicate that it might pay to cut down on the cost of producing the corn even though it might mean a slightly lower yield per acre. Whether subsequent contests will bear out this conclu- sion is a question. A factor which must not be forgotten is whether or not less work on the corn land will materially affect the crops which follow the corn. At any rate these figures indicate that it is important for the grower to determine at what point or points in his cultural opera- tions, additional work will cease to pay. The importance of the use of machinery in an efficient way is in- dicated by these general comparisons. It has already been shown in the </seg>

            <seg id="p269">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 269 is losing something the next year, providing the man who did the most work cultivated when the ground was in proper condition. A man should have the ground in good shape for the oats crop that is to follow the corn. A MEMBER: One year is hardly a test because you might farm a piece of land rather poorly one year and get a fairly good crop, but the next year you will not get so much, so the man who does good farming will get a better crop next year. PRESIDENT DANLY: I don't think the fellows did that in the contest. They put in the average amount of work. Question — Don't you think the kind of men and the amount of time make a difference? PRESIDENT Indeed it does, and also the kind of machinery he uses MR. AYE: I want to bring out some points here; we are going at it wrong. We have been feeling sort of blue the last few years because we have not been making any money, and this morning we are making ourselves poorer and poorer. Farming is not done by the hour, week, or month, but it is a yearly business. It is not a job for one year, it is a lifetime job, and it seems to me we are getting blue and saying we are not mak - ing a dollar raising corn and alfalfa, and we are raising the Dickens. I know people who are making money right along, and when we take it at so much an hour we are doing ourselves an injustice. It is a yearly job instead of a daily or a weekly job. These figures that have been given us are all all right from the hour standpoint, but they are not right on the general basis. MR. BALL: A man has a right to make money on his own farm the same as a man in business. If you hire a man on the farm you should pay him so much a month. If you don't figure this by the day or by the hour or on some basis, I don't know how you are going to figure what your farming operations are worth to you. I claim the farmer can so manage his business that he can have a profit in it, or he should let some of these other fellows farm. I figure that this contest is a good thing. These fellows go into it and find how much it cost to produce their corn. A MEMBER: I was not a farmer until I began to attend these meetings, and I have since become a good farmer, and I have gotten more out of it than almost anybody else. Now if you raise corn or oats, how much time will you put in on an acre ? I know when I was not making any money </seg>
            <seg id="p270">270 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture I had 80 acres of corn, and 40 acres of oats. Some of these men are farm owners and others are making a living for them. When I live on the farm I can cut wood, and I am exercising, cleaning up the place and cutting fuel; but when I am paying wages it is too expensive to cut that wood. A MEMBER I can remember twenty years back when we only raised corn and oats and we didn't think our time was worth very much, but I would like to go out and find a fellow who has farmed eighty acres of corn and forty acres of oats today. If you will go with me, and not far from Lincoln, you will find fellows producing corn, oats, wheat, alfalfa, milk - ing cows, and all such things. That is a daily job and I figure we should have daily pay; while it is a yearly job also, there are very few farmers I know but that are busy, and not only busy eight hours a day, either. If the gentleman who just spoke knows very many thousands of farmers who are making a lot of money at this time off the farm I ■would like to have him name them. I think these things Mr. Aye brought out here are past, if they ever did happen at all. We have been trying to do something the last few years on an uncertainty, and until we get some facts and figures we will not get very far. A MEMBER: I have been on a farm a little while; of course I am not nearly as old as some of these fellows back here, but if I live through this year I will be 70 years old. I came to Nebraska in 1868, and I was here before they raised corn, and I farmed until a few years ago and now I live in the city, but it is the fellow who stays on the farm and does the work who gets anywhere. We have too many Ford farmers. I raised fourteen boys on the farm and I did the bossing and they did the work, but we made money. My father was not much of a success as a farmer because he came from Canada and all they raised there was potatoes and such like and they wheated the land till they wheated it out. It is not the man who gets the biggest profit one year by listing a little, for he moves to another farm the next year. You have to farm the land so you will get a good crop every year. There is a good profit in farm - ing in Nebraska if a man sticks with it. Our boys wanted to stop and go to the city and get some big wages, and I said, "Boys, I have made over $5 a day for twenty years and we have many farmers in Nebraska who made money all through these depressing times because they at - tended to business and did the work." MR. GROSS: We don't want you to understand that the results of this contest will be the same every year. We are merely bringing out what was in this contest this year. When this contest is carried on for a number of years the figures will give us something worthwhile. </seg>
            <seg id="p271">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 271 A MEMBER: When one figures by the hour on the production of a crop, there is much time put in that is not recorded. One could figure out how many days he worked in a year, but if he tries to earn a year's wages in five or six months he will fall behind. If he plans his work so as to be busy every day, his business will likely show up on the right side of the ledger. PRESIDENT: I think perhaps there is a little misunderstanding of these figures. It is a fact that you can do a certain amount of labor on your land and up to a certain point it will yield you better than a fair return. After you get above that point the proportionate return for the labor you expend is that much less, and when you put twice as much labor on the same land your return for the labor will be considerably less. We have a farmer in our country who lists his ground every year, and he never cultivates his corn but twice. It so happens that he owns a lot of land around there and does not need to care what the landlord has to say, so each year he does as little work as he can get by with and he makes more money than any other grain farmer around there. This question has caused considerable discussion; it is not an argument for less work on the farm, but it shows the income from your labor will be propor - tionately less as you increase your effort. D. L. GROSS: I think we all agree that a man can put too much labor on the land to secure the greatest profit. It is pretty hard to tell, however, at just what point additional labor will cease to pay. A MEMBER: Mr. Aye says a farmer's job is a yearly job. In our part of the country you will find men who take a little recreation and do not put so much time in on the farm, make more money than the men who spend all their time and pester around for nothing. Those men who raise just grain don't work the year round, they put the corn in the crib and leave it there until they can get a good profit. PRESIDENT: At this time we want to present to the winners in these different sections their medals, and I am calling on Professor W. W. Burr to present these medals to these gentlemen. PROFESSOR BURR: I want to say that the Crop Growers Association is putting on this contest, and that the College connection is mostly that of bookkeeping. I am glad to hear this discussion. I don't know but what we are getting at the real meat of things when we get into a discussion. This contest is serving a real purpose. One hundred and fifty men entered this year, and seriously competed. They worked for the highest yield and kept </seg>
            <seg id="p272">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 272 and reported a record which we have compiled and analyzed as you have just heard from Mr. Gross. There is a purpose in this contest. First, it is to show what can be done on a ten-acre field. We require ten-acre pieces, so that a man can't pick out an acre or two of creek bottom land. That gives us some - thing for which to work. Second, when we get the data and analyze it, it gives us some enlightenment on the problem of corn production, which I think is a splendid thing. I believe that the men by entering into this contest in the serious manner in which they have, and by keeping these records, are adding materially to the stock of information we have on corn production in the state. It will lead to good results. We can't hear of 101 bushels of corn per acre without getting some inspiration. I am tempted to tell you a story. Someone .said it was a good one because it was 500 years old, but maybe some of you have not heard of the rooster that one morning found an ostrich egg. As he looked at it he had an inspiration, and he rolled it back into the chicken yard and said to the hens, "Now, just see what you can do with a little inspiration." That is what this contest will do. I think it is an honor to win in such a contest. The whole world loves a winner. Every man can't win. The man who won this year may have had just a little luck in getting the proper Nebraska weather; but he couldn't have won if he hadn't tried and had not used good rota - tion and cultural methods. I admire not only the winner but the man who tried. It is a lot of work to keep these records straight, to tell when you cultivated and how you cultivated and to give a history of the field but it adds to the fund of information on which we can base what we hope will be a profitable agriculture. So I want to say I deem it a pleasure to present to the winners in the three regions these medals as mementoes for having tried and hav - ing won. The high man in each district gets a gold medal. Whenever a county has seven or more contestants they are considered to have a county contest, and in the county contests, the winner gets a silver medal. Those who pass the goals of 50, 70, and 90 bushels for their respective regions get a certificate of achievement; it means something accomp - lished. The medals these men get for winning are probably something like the letters fellows get for playing football and making the team. They get a letter which represents an achievement. We want to hear from these men at this time, and again I want to say that I think it is an excellent thing that the Crop Growers Associa - tion has inaugurated this contest and that we are getting this infor - mation. PRESIDENT: Now I am sure everybody will be much interested in hearing how these men produced these high yields of corn, and we will hear from them, calling first on Mr. Noyes. </seg>
            <seg id="p273">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 273 HOW I WON FIRST IN THE EASTERN NEBRASKA SECTION OF THE 10-ACRE YIELD CONTEST ED NOYES, Valley, Nebraska I believe I can grow corn better than I can talk, and I might not have entered this contest if I had known it meant that I would have to make a speech here. But there are perhaps a few things that I might say, and the first thing would be to go into a history of the land. The land on which this corn was raised is part of an eighty that has been broken for fifty years. It belonged to the Government and had been poorly fanned. I rented the land in 1915 and the first thing I had to do was to break the cockleburs down so as to get the horses through. For several years I had a lot of work to do in keeping these pests down on the land. Since that time I have been changing the crops back and forth, red clover, oats, corn, and red clover in succession. However this ten acres was right on the east edge of the piece and I had never had any red clover on it. About 5 years ago I began with one piece and seeded down about five acres to alfalfa, and the next year I seeded the five acres next to it with alfalfa. That is the ten acres I cultivated this year. I covered that land with manure lightly about 3 years ago. I covered it with about half the usual spreading a year ago last spring. It is our experience down there between the Platte and the Elkhorn Rivers that alfalfa will only last four or five years, or possibly six years, because the blue-grass will take it. So last year I plowed this up on account of the blue-grass. Last year I planted five acres of this piece to corn and the other five acres was in alfalfa, but last season that winterkilled. This year about the first of May I plowed both pieces of land with a tractor. This land was plowed seven or eight inches deep, and my little fifteen - year old boy plowed the greater part of it with the tractor. On the next Saturday he took a ten-foot disc and harrow and disced and harrowed it. That put the land in splendid condition; that was about the tenth of May, and it was in fine condition to plant. Then we listed it. That is rather an unusual performance I guess. I will admit it was a little mean listing it. I had a German working for me and he said to me afterwards, "The Devil won't get me because I didn't swear when I tried to list that corn." The seed was a smooth selection of Reid Yellow Dent. I have been grow - ing that in Douglas County for quite a number of years, and use it on my home place and have for some years. I had six or seven bushels of it when I went to picking seed corn for the usual crop, and when I found something that just suited me I laid it aside and saved it for this 10 acres, and it came up very nicely. Shortly after the corn was up we had some </seg>

We cultivated it with one-row ma - chinery because the boy could handle the horses better than on a two - row machine. We threw it out and the next day the little boy took the harrow and harrowed it down. We cultivated it three times with a single row cultivator using just an old-fashioned shovel cultivator.

            <seg id="p275">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 275 found out that the main idea in growing corn is to keep the weeds out, and that we did with a good deal of work. I want to say that I am more than sold to the using of legumes on corn land. I might mention my home farm where I have used a six-year rotation for a good many years. I have been growing red clover, and alfalfa, and have tried growing some sweet clover with very good success which shortened the rotation. One Ohio man raised 140 bushels to the acre, and I believe that if he can do that a Nebraska man can do as well, and I shall not be satisfied until I raise as much as the Ohio man. HOW I WON FIRST IN THE CENTRAL SECTION OF THE 10-ACRE YIELD CONTEST GERALD WILCOX, McCook, Nebraska Fig. 14— Gerald WUcox McCook. Nebr. I have been on this land about 35 years. I first had it in corn, then in beets, in alfalfa, and in hog pasture part of the time. For the last few years I have had it in listed corn. We irrigated this from a well, and had raked the stalks and burned them. I put this corn in myself with a two-row lister, and tended it with a two-row machine that took all the weeds out. Then we went through it with a single row cultivator with a large shovel. We then furrowed it out with a large single shovel and in every other row we irrigated it from the well. It turned dry and I got over it that way in a hurry, because I was afraid I would lose it. After we irrigated it we cultivated it,and then we went over it on the opposite rows from what we did the first time and irrigated it again. That is about all the work we have had on it. </seg>
            <seg id="p276">276 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture HOW I WON FIRST IN THE WESTERN SECTION OF THE 10- ACRE YIELD CONTEST In 1922 I had thirty acres of alfalfa on the first bottom of Sappa Creek. It got thin and along in April I broke it up, plowing about 8 or 9 inches deep with a sulky plow and 4 horses. I disced it, and about the first of May I listed it with a one-row lister. In Furnas County we figure the first year on alfalfa ground a crop burns up because the land is so rich, so I made up my mind we would lose our crop. It made only 7 or 8 bushels to the acre. The next year I cut the stalks, double-disced the ground, and about the 27th or 28th of April I started to listing. I always disc just about the time the weeds start. I like to disc before the weeds get well started, and sometimes I disc twice — it always holds the moisture so much better. We had a flood just when I got ready to list and I didn't get to list until the third day of June. I had about 15 acres where there was an extra good stand which made 107 bushels to the acre. The next year I disced the ground, cut the stalks, and listed it about the first of May. I had the finest stand I ever had in my life. About the first Saturday in July we had the worst hail storm Furnas County ever saw, and I had nothing left when night came. This year I disced the ground again and cut the stalks and started listing about the 28th of April. We got a rain which washed my ground, buried my corn some, and besides the cut worms got some of it. They say there are 17 kinds of cut worms, but I think I had eighteen kinds in that field because I didn't have any corn left. Then my boy and I replanted 12 acres. We never know when we list the second time what we are going to get, and I didn't want to take chances. Mr. Claybaugh helped to shuck the corn in this contest and it made 89.4 bushels per acre. I was pretty well pleased over that. I know it was not as good corn as I had two years before. W. R. NICHOLSON, Beaver City, Nebraska Fig. 15— W. R. Nicholson, Beaver City, Nebr. </seg>
            <seg id="p277">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 277 QUESTION BOX ON ALFALFA Led by PROFESSOR T. A. KIESSELBACH MR. DANLY I think Professor Kiesselbach needs no introduction to this audience. He has appeared before us many times. MR. KIESSELBACH: I understand my whole purpose here is not to talk but to hold the watch on you folks while you do the talking. I will hold the watch on myself as well as everybody else. We have two question boxes, one on alfalfa, and one on sweet clover. We have about an hour's time for each of these. We want everyone to talk, but must limit the discussion in - dividually to about two minutes each. This will give us a chance to get the experience from over the entire state. It will be appreciated if you will give us your names and addresses when talking so the reporter can get your experiences down for the particular sections of the state from which you come. These discussions will appear in the report and should prove of great value. We are very proud that Nebraska leads all states in alfalfa acreage, even though we are one of the newer states in growing this crop. We had probably better take up the topics as they appear on the program . These are merely suggestive, and if you have other questions in which you are interested let us have them. What are your experiences with varieties of alfalfa and cultural practices in its production? MR. REAM, Custer County: We have had considerable experience in our section of the country with sowing alfalfa early in April, but our greatest objection to seeding so early is that the water grass and foxtail come on so rapidly and strongly that they are liable to choke the alfalfa out more or less. We all should remember that our climatic conditions vary so much in this state that a practice which might do in Central Nebraska might not do at all in Eastern Nebraska. Our best idea is to plow early in the spring and not too deep. They told us in early times to plow deep, but this has not proved to be the best practice. Our theory is that the roots of any crop are able to work into the subsoil. It is easier to secure a stand on a firm seed bed. Plow early and not too deep, keep the field well cultivated, and free from weeds until the 20th of May. By that time you will have killed a good many of the plants of the water grass and foxtail as a result of having worked the soil. Then seed your alfalfa. MR. KIESSELBACH: Mr. Ream has started a discussion of seeding problems. He has brought out well-recognized principles for his section of the state, name - ly early plowing, followed by sufficient cultivation to get rid of the weeds and thereby increase the likelihood of securing a stand. MR. REAM: And seed it with a light nurse crop of oats or barley. Not over </seg>
            <seg id="p278">278 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture half a bushel to the acre. I prefer barley. It does not grow so tall as other small grain and yet makes a good shade for the alfalfa seedlings. MR. SCATTERGOOD, Otoe County: I have sown alfalfa in the fall and in the spring and my experience is that I have better success sowing it in the fall. Once I sowed some alfalfa in August and it grew 15 inches high that fall and I never had a better stand. When I sowed in the spring there were patches that didn't catch, for some reason. In our region I would suggest seeding about the middle of August if there is plenty of moisture. Clean sum - mer tillage before seeding conserves moisture and ensures a better stand and vigorous fall growth. MR. KIESSELBACH: Your summer fallowing agrees in principle with Mr. Ream's sug - gestion to keep the soil clean tilled until early summer when the seed should be sown, whereas you propose summer fallowing until August. It might be open to question as to whether or not you want to sacrifice the use of the ground during the entire season before seeding. That is practically what you did; you didn't harvest a crop that year. MR. RING, Lancaster County: I will say a little more on that proposition. I plow my ground for oats so that I get it in better shape than by merely discing and drilling. If you will disc the ground immediately after the oats are harvested, and then plow it early, you will make a better seed bed of it. The best alfalfa I ever raised was on that kind of ground. Mr. Gregg out at Cheney also had the best crop anywhere around by doing it that way. MR. KIESSELBACH: Your method differs from that of Mr. Scattergood in that you raise an oat crop followed by discing and plowing before you put in the al - falfa whereas he proposes leaving the land idle during the entire season before seeding. MR. SCATTERGOOD, Otoe County: The first crop of alfalfa I ever sowed was twenty years ago. I sowed it in the fall. I cultivated that all summer to hold the moisture, and the next year after I sowed it I got two and a half tons to the acre. When I sow it in the spring, with a nurse crop, that seems to take the moisture so the alfalfa does not do so well the next year. Another time I sowed alfalfa in October and it winterkilled, so I sowed it again in April and the foxtail got it. But when I cutivated the ground all sum - mer I got a perfect stand. MR. KIESSELBACH: Mr. Ream, is this a common practice in Central Nebraska to seed with a nurse crop? </seg>
            <seg id="p279">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 279 Fig. 16 — In eastern Nebraska the practice of sowing: legumes with a nurse crop is a common one. It is most likely to be successful in the Missouri River counties and in Northeastern Nebraska . MR. REAM: It is a good practice and quite common MR. KIESSELBACH: Do you consider it as successful as seeding by itself ? Do you think on the average it is fully as good ? MR. REAM: As to the percentage who use a nurse crop I could not say, but I know in our neighborhood there is a division of sentiment about a nurse crop. I desire to give one word of caution in central and western Ne - braska about fall seeding. If conditions are favorable, and you have preserved the moisture in your subsoil and have a reasonably damp fall, you are fairly safe; but too often we trouble. have a dry fall, and then there is MR. KIESSELBACH Now perhaps we better pass on to some other of the topics and we can come back to the seeding problem if we have time. These men </seg>
            <seg id="p280">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 280 who have talked are pioneers with this crop, and their experiences are valuable. The importance of a firm seed bed has been brought out. Certainly for alfalfa we should prepare a seed bed that is mellow on the surface and compact beneath. The ground will not dry out so rap - idly and. the roots will become better established and the seedlings will come through better in the case of fall seeding especially. Alfalfa seed is high priced, and why take unnecessary chances. When we wish to change the alfalfa from one field to another it is a good plan not to plow up good, established fields of alfalfa until we get a new stand com - ing on. Then the old field may be broken up without taking chances of being without alfalfa. MR. CLAUSEN, Gage County: I have been trying to farm for the last 49 years in Gage County. I am retired now and have some renters. I have had a little experience with alfalfa. Mr. Kiesselbach just mentioned to leave the old alfalfa stand until you got a good new stand and then plow the other up. One year I plowed forty acres of wheat stubble perhaps six inches deep. I like deep plowing. It didn't rain for awhile and I thought I would give up sowing alfalfa that fall, but the first part of August we got a good rain and it soaked all through the ground until that land was in pretty good shape. I harrowed it and sowed alfalfa and it came up very nicely and the next spring I said to the boys, "let's plow up the old alfalfa." This was probably twenty years ago, and the second year was a dry year and the next spring our alfalfa was winterkilled. I investigated and I found that the soil was not packed below; there was not enough rain and it didn't pack the soil and the alfalfa winterkilled the second winter. I dont like to summer fallow on account of losing a crop. MR KIESSELBACH Winterkilling is a matter not only of an unfavorable seed bed perpar - ation and seeding conditions, but also a matter of varieties and seed from unhardy sources. MR. FRENCH, Holt County: I come from Holt County, in the Sandhill Section There are 18,000 square miles of land in the Sandhill section of Ne - braska. In addition, there are smaller areas of sandy soil scattered over the state. Not all of this soil will grow alfalfa. I never expect to see alfalfa growing over the tops of Nebraska's sandhills. But there is a lot of land around the edges of the sandhills and spots scattered through the hills that will grow good alfalfa. As a general statement, I think that I am safe in saying that sandy land that is worth farming to corn will raise alfalfa in paying quantities. Sandy land needs rotation with a legume more than other types of soil, due to the fact that it is usually deficient in organic matter and nitrogen, due to the open structure of the soil and the consequent rapid oxidation. </seg>
            <seg id="p281">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 281 It is unfortunate that on the soil that needs alfalfa the worst, it is usually the hardest to get a stand. The sand blows and cuts off the tender plants, the weeds grow and dry out the soil, and the alfalfa can hardly survive. The upper part of the soil dries out so rapidly that the alfalfa plant dies before it can get rooted down to moisture. I have worked out the following method which has been successful in Holt County. I try to manure the land that I intend to sow to alfalfa. I do not think that manure is absolutely necessary, but I do think it helps to give the young plants a start. The last of May or the first of June, as soon as possible after I am through planting corn, I list the ground. Then I handle it just as I would corn, cultivating it twice with a listed corn cultivator, being care - ful to leave the ground as level as possible. Then I harrow the field crosswise. This brings us up to the middle of July, with the ground free from weeds, smooth, and well-packed and full of moisture. The soil cannot be too hard. I drill the seed immediately after the first good rain after the middle of July. From this time till the 1st of September the winds do not bother much. The spring annual weeds such as sandburs, sunflowers, and fox - tail do not sprout after this time. I use a common grain drill with a grass seed attachment, and with press wheels behind. It is very im - portant that the seed is not put in- too deep. One inch is about right. It had better be less than more. If it is too deep it can never get out, but if too shallow it will come up the next time it rains. I have been sowings 6 pounds to the acre. This makes about 30 seeds to the square foot, and usually gives a good stand. I do not use a nurse crop as I find that alfalfa sowed in midsummer will make enough growth to pro - tect itself during the winter. There is always more or less volunteer rye on land that has been in rye recently. Then there are some weeds. I do not like late summer seeding because it is hard to get enough growth on the ground to keep it from blowing during the winter. One objection to seeding in July is the grasshoppers. Some years they will take a strip from one to two rods wide clear around the field. I use a poison mixture recommended by Prof. Swenk of the Agricultural College. This consists of 1 pound Paris green, 25 pounds bran, mixed dry; about 3 gallons water and 4 to 6 lemons which have been run through a meat grinder, and 2 quarts of strong dark molasses. It should be just moist enough so the mixture will form small pellets. I sow it thinly around the edge of the field just after the alfalfa comes up. I have found this very successful in controlling grasshoppers. One year the garden webworm took part of my alfalfa. I understand that dragging the field with a brush drae before the worms leave the webs will kill them. In the northern part of the state they never bother except after several mild winters. In 1923 they did a lot of damage in Holt County but the hard winter of 1923-4 killed them off so they haven't bothered since. </seg>
            <seg id="p282">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 282 The main things in seeding alfalfa on sandy land are: 1st — Have the soil in proper condition: i. e., clean of weeds, full of mois - ture, smooth and very compact. 2nd — Drill the alfalfa in after a rain. I have never had any success with harrowing in the seed. If it is harrowed in after a rain the soil will dry out before the plants get rooted down. If harrowed in before a rain the rain will smooth off the ground so that the least little wind will start it blowing. On the other hand if it is drilled in the drill will rough up the ground and prevent blowing. The seeds are put down in the moist dirt and the dirt pressed over them so that they can sprout and get rooted down before the ground dries out. If it rains right away after it is sowed it is not so good, but if it is drilled shallow it will come all right. The drill must have lever with a fine adjustment so that the drills can be raised if they begin to run too deep. 3rd — Seed in mid-summer; after the spring winds and spring weeds, and yet early enough so that the alfalfa will make a good growth before winter. This will make a better crop for the next year. MR. NOYES, Douglas County: I would like to say that seeding in July we found the cut-worms destroyed the young alfalfa. Two years ago I seeded alfalfa the 15th of July, and it came up as fine as you ever saw. I went away on a vacation for about two weeks and when I came back the ground was as bare as this floor. A number of my neighbors told me that they had the same trouble, and they said it was a small white worm. MR. FRENCH, Holt County: Two years ago I had some trouble with a web-worm and I lost my alfalfa. We never had anything of the kind before in Holt County, and I hope we never will again. It works above the ground and makes a little web and starts working very much like the cut-worm. MR. NOYES, Douglas County: Some of my neighbors sowed two weeks later on the same ground and got a good stand. MR. KIESSELBACH: Some farmers in the sand hills sow a little oats in the fall with the alfalfa to keep the sandy soil from blowing. MR. FRENCH, Holt County: I have sowed as late as the 20th of August, but I don't like that. MR. KIESSELBACH: You prefer to list rather than plow? MR. FRENCH: Yes, for the reason that it works better with the other work. I can list and then cultivate the ground which makes it easier to keep the weeds down. </seg>
            <seg id="p283">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 283 MR. BUTTMAN, Otoe County: I sowed twenty acres three years ago in sandy ground and the first year it blew out; I sowed it early in the spring; and the next year I sowed it the 20th of August in oat stubble and I have as fine a stand as anybody in the country. Question — How do you seed your oats in the spring? MR. BUTTMAN: We plow the ground and drill. MR. BROUSE, Cherry County: I would like to give the experience of a number of farmers in Cherry County in disking the ground in April and seeding about the first of May. We are getting good results one year with another with that system. The weeds come up, but I don't know of more than a very few fields that were lost as a result of seeding that way. MR. KIESSELBACH: I think we will have to pass to some other subject, MR. AYE, Washington County: We have heard about the sand hills and the southeastern part of the country, but not the northeast. We ordinarily seed with oats and if we fail in that, reseed in the fall and get a stand then. We have tried to do what some have told us to do, wait until early May and destroy all the weeds, but we prefer to sow early in the spring with oats. Don't be afraid of sowing alfalfa early. I have sowed it early in the spring and in the summer, and in the fall, and always got a good stand if I did my part. We sow it earlier up there than I have heard mentioned here. We sow it in northeastern Nebraska in early April. The best time for seeding oats is early April. Early seeded oats and early seeded alfalfa work well together. Question — Do you have any trouble with it freezing out in the spring ? MR. AYE: No, ordinarily not. Once in a great while we hear of damage from late spring freezes but not often. MR. KIESSELBACH: Do you consider alfalfa as hardy as clover? MR. AYE: More so. Some of our people sowed it early with oats and after - wards there came a freeze that killed the oats but they got a good stand of alfalfa. MR. KIESSELBACH: Just to summarize this nurse crop subject, we have had experiences from central Nebraska where it is recommended to harvest the nurse . crop for hay, I suppose to get the nurse crop off the ground before it </seg>
            <seg id="p284">284 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture has used up an excessive amount of moisture and so the alfalfa has a better chance than if the nurse crop had grown to maturity. Through - out the eastern counties, near the Missouri River, experience suggests to sow early with oats and let the crop mature. Some recommend a rather thin seeding of the nurse crop, but others sow at the regular rate getting 40 to 50 bushels of oats per acre and still a good stand of alfalfa. It depends on conditions. Probably we could sow a modified nurse crop in these eastern counties, but it is a good idea to watch and if it is getting dry, cut the small grain for hay. Would you recommend a nurse crop, Mr. Aye, for the counties west of the river counties? MR. AYE: I have quit recommending, because so many people are successful in so many different ways. MR. KIESSELBACH: Who has had experience with inoculating alfalfa to get the neces - sary bacteria established in the soil? Do we have these bacteria in our Nebraska soils without artificially introducing them? Has anyone had experience in the use of commercial inoculating cultures or in using soil from another field ? By far the majority of the farmers do not inoculate alfalfa seed. MR. FRENCH, Holt County: I usually inoculate mine from another alfalfa field or places where sweet clover is growing. But sometimes I am so busy I seed it without inoculation and I can't see that it makes much difference. The second year there may be some yellow plants in the uninoculated, but after the second year the plants are all green and have bacteria whether or not I inoculate. MR. KIESSELBACH: How do you do this inoculation? MR. FRENCH: Fill up buckets with soil from another field and scatter it. I do not work it in, just follow with the drill. I presume the most of the bacteria died, but I did it, I guess as a matter of superstition. MR. RUSSELL, Agricultural College: I would say to the people in the sand hills to inoculate with a com - mercial inoculant. I saw where a man had loaded up a wagon with soil from a healthy field of sweet clover and then he drove along and threw out a shovelful here and there. Then he seeded sweet clover and today there is sweet clover wherever he threw a shovelful of dirt and in no other place on the field. I think this is due to the inoculation. MR. KIESSELBACH: Probably these isolated sandy soils where alfalfa and sweet clover have not been growing should be inoculated. Where sweet clover has </seg>
            <seg id="p285">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 285 been growing, the soil becomes inoculated for alfalfa. The Government Bulletin suggests equal quantities of inoculated soil and seed would be sufficient to inoculate the seed so if you seed ten pounds of alfalfa seed and ten pounds of soil mixed that should be sufficient to inoculate the field. These bacteria reproduce very rapidly. Let us ask a seedman who sells alfalfa seed how much inoculating material we should use. Mr. Aye, you sell bacteria do you not? MR. AYE: I issued thousands of catalogs listing cultures one year and paid for a whole page of advertising in a farm paper, and sold 15 cents worth. We don't need it in Nebraska. Where sweet clover is grown you will find the bacteria in the soil. You go into these sand blow-outs and sow sweet clover and you will have the bacteria there. MR. KIESSELBACH: This is a matter of real concern to those of us who are always won - dering whether possibly we should inoculate. I think it would be a very fine thing and give us individually much satisfaction if, when we sow a new field of alfalfa, we would scatter a little inoculated soil on a strip through the field and satisfy ourselves whether or not for our conditions we should perhaps have inoculated. Now here is a question concerning the thickening up of a field of old alfalfa. MR. AYE, Washington County: I have tried that for years and years and never succeeded at all It would come up, but in the fall I would have only the original stand We plow it up. MR. KIESSELBACH: They used to say if you would run over a thin stand with a disk it would thicken it up. This might help for a year or two, but it is usually better with an unprofitable stand to plow it up and seed down another field. Such a practice would facilitate the much-needed crop rotation any way. MR. AYE: Of course, what constitutes a profitable stand is a subject open to debate. To begin with we put on 20 pounds of seed to the acre, but now it is cut down to about 15 pounds. Twenty pounds of seed per acre will supply 100 seeds per square foot. MR. KIESSELBACH: We might possibly spend just two or three minutes crowding on another man's time in discussing the matter of alfalfa varieties. It is an important consideration just what variety of alfalfa we should plant in this state. The varieties under consideration could be limited to not more than three, the Common variety, which most of us are growing; </seg>
            <seg id="p286">286 Report op Nebraska State Board of Agriculture and the Grimm and Cossack varieties which are rather similar variegated kinds and have become rather prominent in more northern states. Has anyone had experience with the Grimm in comparison with the Common, as to hardiness ? Very little Grimm is grown in. the state. MR. YOUNG, Lancaster County: I sowed nine acres of Grimm for hog pasture and it is fine, if we just have rain enough. But when it is dry, and we don't have enough rain for it, it does not produce enough, and when I plow this field up I shall not use it again. The cattle and hogs like it. In the summertime when it is dry weather if we get a good soaking rain, it will come up thick and fine like bluegrass. But I really believe I do not get more than half the hay off of Grimm that I would get off of the Common alfalfa. It has been in four years and it is just as good a stand today as the day we seeded it. MR. KIESSELBACH: Perhaps you have not had a good comparison with the Common al - falfa under the same conditions. Grimm does not grow very differently from Common at the Experiment Station. MR. YOUNG: Yes, I think so. I have used this for hog pasture only, but it didn't produce the hay. For hog pasture the Grimm is fine. It will hold down the bluegrass; the bluegrass doesn't crowd it out. The stand is just as good today as when it was sown. This field was a hog pasture before but seeded to Common alfalfa and bluegrass got it. MR. ANDERSON, Agricultural College: In the spring of 1922 Grimm alfalfa was seeded along with Common alfalfa and a number of other varieties at the Agronomy Farm. Up to the present time there has been no very decided difference in plant growth nr in yield where comparable stands have been maintained. There is only one way that you can definitely tell the two apart, and that is by the bloom. The Grimm flowers, the same as in all other variegated al - falfas, will show a certain percent of variation in flower color. Some blossoms will be almost pure yellow, and there will be all shades of color between purple and yellow. Up to the present time there has been no apparent difference in hardiness between Grimm and the hardier strains of Common alfalfa. However, we have had a number of strains of Com - mon alfalfa; namely, those from Argentine, Italy, and Spain, which win - terkilled considerably, but the Common alfalfa grown from seed pro - duced in Nebraska and bordering states has not, to the present time, shown any evidence of winterkilling. These have been as produc - tive as the Grimm. It may be that a more severe winter will tend to thin, out some of these domestic strains of Common alfalfa, and the Grimm may then show some superiority in hardiness. We feel, however, that the northern-grown Common strains are hardy enough for our con - ditions. Possibly farther north the Grimm or the other variegated al- </seg>
            <seg id="p287">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 287 falfas might be used to advantage. There is no question but that the Grimm is a good alfalfa, and if you want to pay the extra price for it, you will not be disappointed, but I doubt whether in eastern or southern Nebraska you would be justified in paying the extra price for Grimm alfalfa provided hardy strains of Common alfalfa can be secured. Fig. 17 — The matter of hardiness in alfalfa seed is of great imp ~tance to Nebraska farmers. All alfalfa seed is not good seed for this state. MR. KIESSELBACH: Grimm alfalfa is not being grown very extensively in Nebraska and merits a further trial. Mr. Anderson's experience is different from Mr. Young's. I think it might be well to include a strip of Grimm alongside of Common alfalfa when you sow a new field so that you could get some experience as to varieties. Grimm may have a very valuable place. We do not have severe winterkilling winters more than once in four or six years, and it is in those years that the stand is lost. If we had a com - parison of these two varieties side by side, we could determine this on our own premises. MR. H. WOLDEN, Seward County: I have had experience with both Grimm and Common alfalfa in the same field, and I find the Common one year with another will yield al - most as much again as the Grimm will. The Grimm starts to grow all right but it does not grow anything like as tall, and on the second crop you don't gpi heirly as large a crop of the Grimm as of the Common, and the thn d crop you don't get any at all, yet it will grow up five inches and will seed. It will seed when the common will not. I am through with the Grimm. J. M. ZERBEL, South Lakota: Let me say a word about Grimm alfalfa to the north. I live in the northern part of South Dakota near Aberdeen. A good many years ago </seg>
            <seg id="p288">288 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture the Government sent me a smail sample of Grimm alfalfa and I sowed it near my house, and that alfalfa stayed there for years and years, and I think it was four years ago that it first got hurt by freezing, but it had been punished all the time by pigs and chickens, and everything run on it and kept it down, but every once in awhile I would get quite a bit of hay on it. It will stand everything better than the other variety. I don't know about its giving less hay, for most of the alfalfa up there is Grimm. We figure Grimm is the alfalfa up there. MR. KIESSELBACH: That seems to be the idea in Dakota, and in Montana, Utah, Idaho and some other northern states they believe it yields as well as the Com - mon and has the added advantage of greater hardiness. MR. THOMAS, Lancaster County: I have the Grimm and the Common alfalfa both. This year I had three cuttings and I can't tell the difference one with the other. MR. KIESSELBACH: Since we are growing three times as much alfalfa as sweet clover I think it may be proper that we should use three times as much time as on the sweet clover discussion which is to follow. At least this idea may justify our running a bit over time. There is one subject on the program that we have not discussed and I think it would be well next year and worth our while to devote an hour as we have this morning to the question of what crops shall follow alfalfa. Personally I should like to get all the information I can from experiences out in the state on the time to break up alfalfa, what crops shall follow, and if you plant corn how shall the corn be planted on this ground to avoid drying out the first year or two — plant it thin, list it in, or surface plant it. Next year perhaps we can discuss these points. QUESTION BOX ON SWEET CLOVER Led By PROFESSOR P. H. STEWART MR. STEWART: Professor Kiesselbach may be right in saying that since alfalfa oc - cupies a lot more acres than sweet clover that they can talk about it three times as long. But if we used as the measuring stick the number of questions that come up about sweet clover as compared to alfalfa, we would talk all morning about sweet clover. There is a big interest in the crop and a big increase in the acreage. We now have 245,000 acres of sweet clover in Nebraska. It is a timely subject to bring up here for discussion. As Mr. Kiesselbach said, all I am to do is to hold </seg>
            <seg id="p289">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 289 the watch, and we now have about an hour left for discussion. The first question we have here is, "How and when would you sow sweet clover on thin pastures?" That is a question often asked. A good many pas - tures are getting thin and weedy and folks want to thicken them up. They are perhaps on rough ground which they can't plow up for other crops. Is there anyone here who can discuss that point ? MR. THOMPSON, Cuming County: From the experience I have had with sweet clover I would say all that is necessary is to plant it sometime early in the spring, and the cattle will tramp it in sufficiently to make it grow. I had a place in my pasture where I put some salt and killed the grass out, and it hap - pened to be a place where the water washes down off the ylace and it made a bare spot. Sweet clover grows along the road from where it has gradually spread all over that blue-grass pasture. I imagine if it is seeded early in the spring and the cattle tramp it in, that is all that will be necc-ssaiy. MR. STEWART: Has anyone here tried that out? MR. OLMSTEAD, Lancaster County I have tried that several times. It started all right but the cattle running over it all summer, will never let it get started enough and it finally kills out. If I wanted to use sweet clover for a pasture I would disk it in and keep the cattle off of it all or most of the first year. If you would take sweet clover pasture and my silo away from me, I would not know what to do. Some people say stock will not eat sweet clover, but I could not be without my sweet clover pasture. A MEMBER: I have had some experience sowing on thin pastures but the sweet clover kills off; I think you have to keep the cattle off of it the first season. MR. STEWART: I noticed this summer one old pasture near York which had been thickened up with sweet clover. It had been drilled in with excellent success. I don't know whether this farmer kept his stock off of it or not. That was the best example of a good stand on an old pasture that I have ever seen. The second question we have here is regarding the best way to harvest sweet clover seed. Some of you in eastern, or in other parts of Nebraska may have tried to harvest sweet clover and will let us have your experience. Mil. RING, Lancaster County: I have had a little experience in that, and also some instructions I got from Missouri this year. My own experience in threshing sweet clover is that it is an awful hard job. This fall I was down in Missouri where a friend of mine has about 100 acres of sweet clover. He made his binder into a threshing machine by taking the packers off and making </seg>
            <seg id="p290">290 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture a fan of the reel to beat the seed off. He harvested his seed and that of several of his neighbors and had good success. MR. STEWART: The idea was to run the reel from the bull wheel beating the seed off into the boxed-in platform, was it not? MR. RING: Yes. MR. SCATTERGOOD, Otoe County: Last year was my first experience with sweet clover seed. I had seen some of my neighbors try to thresh it and they had made a failure of it. I got an idea from the papers on rebuilding an old binder as Mr. Ring has suggested. I had an old binder which I stripped until there was nothing on it but the platform and the bull wheel. I fixed the reel so it would run direct from the bull wheel. I got some old wagon tires Fig. 18 — A binder rebuilt for the harvesting of sweet clover seed. for the arm of the reel, but instead of using one, I doubled the wagon tires. I also made 4 heavy slats for the reel. Next I put canvas all around the binder platform and also overhead. I would build awhile and then tear down and rebuild, but finally I got it so it would work. My wife and the girls laughed at me as I went over the hill where the neigh - bors couldn't see me trying it out. I was afraid someone would make me pay a license on it; but it worked all right. I had taken the guards off leaving a sharp edge which cut the sweet clover plants off. I put a piece cf cottonwood lumber edgeways along the front of the platform which fixed it so it would knock the seed pods off without breaking the plants off. But it knocked off a great many small branches and leaves; so I got some hardwood cloth, with a quarter inch mesh which I used </seg>
            <seg id="p291">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 291 to clean up the seed. Then this winter we run the seed through the feed grinder and then through the fanning mill to hull and clean it which did a good job. I believe you will get about 98 percent of the seed. A little will fall off, but if you watch you will get practically all the seed. One difficulty in harvesting sweet clover in this way is that the seed does not ripen evenly and some of the green seed, leaves, and small stems are also knocked off by the reel and mixed with seed. It is necessary to scatter the seed thinly on a floor where ventilation is good so that it may be dried. A corn crib or barn loft will prove satisfactory. The seed should not be over 4 to 6 inches deep and should be stirred fre - quently to prevent heating. Question — Is the reel in the same form as a regular binder wheel ? MR. SCATTERGOOD: I have four slats instead of six. This thing may be improved on, I know, but it serves us well. I have never named this contraption but we use it and it does the business. It is much better than a binder. It saves more seed, requires no twine and leaves the entire growth standing on the field. MR. WETZEL: Was that the first or second crop of sweet clover? MR. SCATTERGOOD: It was the second crop. We mowed the first crop early for hay, I think during the latter part of May. MR. BRACKETT, Agricultural College: In the Engineering Department we have had a good many inquiries for plans for a machine of this kind and we have gotten out blueprints showing how to make it. These will be furnished on request. MR. STEWART: The next question on the program is "Should the sweet clover seed crop stubble be plowed as soon as the seed crop is cut, or should it be left on the ground to hold the moisture? This subject was suggested by Mr. Ream, and I will ask him to discuss it. MR. REAM : In the central part of the state we are commencing to grow sweet clover in quite large quantities, and I submitted this question because it is of real importance to us. We can't plow under a very large amount of coarse material unless it is in condition to decay soon, or it will cause us a good deal of trouble by causing the soil to dry out. I haven't had any experience except with 15 acres, on which it is too early to decide results. I am here for information on this subject. I think it is a very important one and especially if we harvest sweet clover leaving all the material on the ground, it will be a very important question for central Nebraska and western Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p292">292 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture MR. STEWART: Mr. Ream has brought up an important point for Nebraska, where we are concerned with the moisture question when we plow under coarse MR. REAM: If we can leave some heavy growth of stalks or stubble on tha ground we hold the snow and have the moisture in the subsoil in the spring, and I think it is quite important which method we follow. If we fall plow most of the snow will blow off and we will not have the snow for moisture. I feel it is an important question' to us. MR. STEWART: Another question we have been asked a good many times is "What about seeding alfalfa and sweet clover in- corn at the last cultivation?" A good many are wondering about seeding alfalfa and sweet clover in corn, not only in the eastern part of the state, but in the central part and in the Sandhill Section, and no doubt there are men here who have tried that out. Has anyone anything to say on that, whether they have tried it themselves or have watched their neighbors try it? MR. FRENCH, Holt County: Last summer I seeded some alfalfa in corn at the last cultivation. Last fall it seemed to live but I don't know what it will be next year. The alfalfa didn't grow very much, but it is alive. MR. MILES, Hall County: I tried the plan you suggest and in my experience it is a question of moisture. If you get the moisture you will get a stand. I have tried putting it in the corn and it works fine. Put it in in August between the rows and cover it in some way. I put it in that way when it was moist and it did fine. We took the stalks off. MR. WOLDEN: I think we should take our cue from nature. We have heard a great deal of talk about seeding sweet clover. Nature grows sweet clover along the road where the seed falls off and comes up in good shape. My idea of sweet clover, so far as I can see, is to sow it wherever you want to along about this time of year. But give Nature a chance at the seed. She will put it in the ground and in the spring the seed will come up. But keep the cattle and the horses off of it while it is young. Give it a chance and it will grow on almost any kind of ground, old pastures, corn stalk ground, or anything of that kind, or anywhere else that you may put it. MR. STEWART: In regard to sowing sweet clover in corn, during July I know of one man in Madison County who seeded sweet clover into his corn this sum - mer, and got a fair' stand. The corn was tall and rank and the clover </seg>
            <seg id="p293">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 293 was shaded so that it made only a fair growth. The stand was reason - ably good last fall. The next point for discussion is in regard to hard seed in sweet clover. A good many ask about "hard seed" and how do you scarify it. I think in taking this up we had better hear from Miss Norris, who is our State Seed Analyst. I have asked Miss Norris to give us a report on. the amount of hard seed found in sweet clover and to discuss a number of other points along that line. MISS ELVA NORRIS, State Seed Analyst: I am glad to have this opportunity to talk about hard seed, because so many farmers send in alfalfa and sweet clover seed for analysis and germination tests, of which perhaps 30 or 40 percent are hard seed. The report from the laboratory is rather discouraging to the one who sends seed in. I try to explain that these hard seed are not useless but are no doubt of considerable value. Out of 214 samples of sweet clover seed sent into the laboratory I found 21.86 percent hard seed. Alfalfa shows a lower number of hard seed; 256 samples showing 18 percent of hard seed. Mr. Stewart also had in mind some other phases of this question for discussion. It is so important that the Wholesale Grass Dealers As - sociation have hired a man, Dr. David Schmidt, to investigate the ques - tion, and last week in Kansas City I had the privilege of hearing him give his report. In his discussion on hard seed he said: "The variation in the percent of hard seed of sweet clover depends to a great extent on the method of threshing, hulling, and scarification. The percent may range from one to two up to 50 or 60 at times. The natural percentage of hard seeds in sweet clover ranges from 90 to 99 percent if the seeds are hulled by hand." So you see sweet clover seed in the hull as it often is sent into the laboratory will show a very low germination percent. I think yesterday I found some six seeds in 200 that germinated. Often, unless the seed coat is scratched so that moisture can get it, we will not have germi - nation. In answer to my question "Do you find that hard seed tend to dis - appear in 2 or 3-year old sweet clover seed, Mr. Schmidt says, "I have found no evidence that it tends to disappear in&gt; the course of a few years and I personally do not believe that this takes place." I am working on an experiment now with some different lots of sweet clover seed that have been in- the laboratory for two or three years, and from observing these I believe he is correct. I don't believe the age of the seed has very much to do with it. In answer to the question "Do you feel that the seed which shows up as hard seed in the germinator would also fail to germinate in actual field planting?" Dr. Schmidt says, "It is now quite definitely known that the field germination is very similar to that in the chamber or germ - inator, providing there has been no exposure to freezing and thawing." The germination of hard seeds is very slight and they are of little agri- </seg>
            <seg id="p294">294 Report op Nebraska State Board of Agriculture cultural value." So. Dr. Schmidt advocates sowing the seed of sweet clover so that the seed will be exposed to freezing and thawing, and as a result of that he thinks you will have a higher percent of germination. MR. STEWART: I think that agrees very well with the usual practices for handling sweet clover. The common experience in seeding sweet clover on pas - tures and on winter wheat during the winter is that you can use it in the hull, but in the spring after the season of freezing is past it is better to use scarified seed. I think the information just given bears out that practice. It also brings out the importance of hard seed and scarified seed, and the difference between them. Question — Do you find hard seed in scarified seed? MISS NORRIS: I couldn't say, because we are not always able to tell whether the samples sent in are scarified or unscarified. They are sent in from dif - ferent parts of the state and under many different conditions. MR. STEWART: I think we are pretty well agreed that the use of the scarifying ma - chine will cause a larger percent of germination. MR. DALBY, Gage County: You should not sow scarified seed during mid-winter; warm days may cause germination after which one may get cold days in March which will kill it. Nature is a pretty extravagant seeder, I can't afford to seed as nature does. I think it is safer to save that seed and scarify it and sow it when you want it to come up. I am a pioneer sweet clover grower in our county. Ten or fifteen years ago they wanted to ride me out of the county because I was sowing sweet clover seed. I now think the best time to sow it is in the spring after the danger of freezing is over. The best way I have found is to harrow the corn stalks down, sow the seed and harrow it in during late March. It is necessary to have a solid seed bed. If you loosen the soil too much you will lose your crop. I also sow a bushel of oats to about 15 pounds of seed. I have had very good results sowing sweet clover with a thin seeding of early oats. If you sow it by itself, don't pasture it too soon. The second year you have to cut the first crop high to keep from killing it. You will then have a second crop for seed. And I tell you anybody who says sweet clover is not good hay does not know what he is talking about. The second season you want to cut it high the latter part of May or early June, and the second crop will then be in nice shape for the binder to handle for seed. Cut it with a mower with extra shoes on the sickle bar. It is too extravagant to sow seed with the hulls on, and it doesn't cost much to scarify it. We thresh the seed with an ordinary threshing machine and then put it through the scarifier and it is all ready to sow. </seg>
            <seg id="p295">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 295 MR. STEWART: The next question has been partially answered, "Can a farmer hull and scarify sweet clover with a grinder or other common farm tool?" What grinder did you use, Mr. Scattergood? MR. SCATTERGOOD: International. MR. STEWART: One man recently suggested taking a cement mixer and putting in a pail or so of good-sized stones along with the seed to be hulled. It is hard to say what the scarifying effect of that would be but probably it would hull the seed. I think it is true, isn't it Mr. Aye, that about all the seed which the seedmen handle now is scarified? MR. AYE: Yes, practically all the seed you buy from seed houses today is scarified. Question — How does Mr. Dalby handle the scarified seed? MR. DALBY: We use a commercial scarifier; a wind blast blows the seed against sand paper which scratches or scarifies the seed. MR. STEWART: Mr. Quick of the Griswold Seed Company says that the old type of scarifying machine wastes a good deal more seed than the newer ma - chines. He reports where they formerly had a 10 percent loss of seed they now lose only a percent or so by cracking and breaking the seed. MR. SCATTERGOOD: How can you tell whether seed is scarified or not, MISS NORRIS: You can't tell definitely by looking at it. But I believe that if you work with seed very long and become familiar with it by looking through a binocular you can see little scratches on it from the machine and it shows a little difference in color. I don't know whether this is imagina - tion or not. But just a word about the seed that often comes in. I don't know what they have run it through but it is ground up to such an extent that it is wasted, and I suppose it has gone through some home-made scarifyer. A good deal of seed is wasted that way. Question — Mr. Dalby, do you prefer the white or yellow sweet clover? ME. DALBY: I understand the yellow is better for some purposes than white. I have never had the yellow. MR. STEWART: We might at this point discuss sweet clover varieties a little. Prob - ably 80 percent of the sweet clover in the state is the white blossom </seg>
            <seg id="p296">296 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture biennial although the interest in and demand for the biennial yellow is apparently increasing. The white biennial grows taller, has larger stems and blooms some 10 to 14 days later than the yellow blossom. It also has a somewhat larger root system I believe. The advantages of the yellow blossom seem to be that it makes somewhat finer stemmed hay when cut for this purpose the second year. On account of its less Tank growth it is easier to handle as a seed crop than is the white variety. This is particularly true where the crop is neither cut back nor pastured during the second season. There are selections of different strains in both the yellow and white biennial sorts. The so-called Madison County Yellow is a more viney type grown considerably in Madison County. The Grundy County White is a selection of the common white biennial which rather resembles the common yellow biennial in its growth habits. There has recently been developed in Northeastern Nebraska a rather favorable feeling toward Hubam the annual sweet clover. While it is admitted that Hubam does not make any more, if as much, root and top development than do the biennial sorts and that the crop is rather stemy and poor for hay, yet its being an annual fits it for one particular use. For instance, in Northeastern Nebraska sweet clover is commonly seeded with oats. If the biennial type is used one usually cannot fall plow it because of the danger of the sweet clover coming on again next season. If plowed in the spring of the second year, there is the con - tinual danger that the growth will dry the soil out to the detriment of the corn which usually follows. The advantage of the Hubam is that the land may be either fall or spring plowed as preferred without danger of the sweet clover acting as a weed or drying the soil excessively. It yet remains to be seen how important this use of Hubam will become. MR. STEWART: The next question we have is "When should sweet clover be plowed under in eastern Nebraska?" The question is often asked whether it pays to plow it under in May of the second season rather than keep it the full two years. A MEMBER: I have had experience in doing that and I won't try it any more. I plowed half a field and it was a week or ten days before I could get in to plow the rest. Then I disked it and harrowed it before I put it to corn, but I couldn't get the cultivator into it. It bothered considerably. MR. STEWART: Mr. Noyes, can you tell us about this in your part of the state ? MR. NOYES, Douglas County: I have had experience in plowing it under in the spring. We have raised a great deal of sweet clover. We sow it with oats in the spring but it grows too fast for us. I have seen sweet clover that was higher than the oats. Some years when we sowed it with wheat it absolutely took the wheat. We had to sow it a little later in the year so that it </seg>
            <seg id="p297">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 297 gets less of a start. We have always found the time to plow it under was the next spring. I plowed 25 acres this year, and while I had a little bad luck with it because the wind blew it out, I replanted it in June and got 75 bushels to the acre on that ground. I pastured it until the middle of May and then turned it under which killed it. If you plow it under in the fall you have a lot of trouble. It will branch out and grow and interfere with the crop in the spring. ME. THOMPSON, Cuming County: I have had some experience in handling sweet clover in both ways. This spring I plowed some under that was in pasture the first and second year and put it in corn. Unfortunately I had put some timothy in with it, and while it made excellent pasture, it did take almost as much at - tention to work it down as would blue-grass sod. I also plowed under a second year crop of sweet clover the 25th of April that was just two feet high. The point I wish to make is that if you are going to plow sweet clover under you must plow it under in time. Don't let it get two feet high. We could see exactly where this sweet clover was as it loosened the soil so that a dry spell interfered with the corn. It took jaEt enough moisture before we plowed it that the corn didn't do so well. It was the poorest corn, I think, that I have had in 25 years. And it was on ground where I thought it would be the best. So plow your clover under in time and don't let it get over a foot high. If we had had plenty of moisture this might have been all right, but as it was it did not do well. MR. DALBY, Gage County: In turning under a crop in the spring in our section of Nebraska you don't get a large corn crop on account of a lack of moisture. This year I plowed under sweet clover that was two years old on a kind of a stony ridge where oats wouldn't grow well, in fact hardly tall enough to cut with a binder. This had been in sweet clover pasture for two years, and last spring we decided to put it in oats. It just happened to be the right thing to do as we threshed around 2500 bushels of oats off of that field whereas before it was seeded down we could not have got - ten anything off of it. We had also had a fine stand of volunteer sweet clover in this year's oat crop. We turned this under this fall and put it to wheat which is looking fine. I have made new ground where I have been using sweet clover. So I believe with us the time to turn it under is in the fall. I turned under some this fall which had been pastured closely all summer. We wanted it to take up all the moisture it could this win - ter. Nine years out of ten we have had too much dry weather for the next crop if you turn under a hearty growth of sweet clover in the spring. The most important thing I think is this, you can take a piece of gumbo ground and plant it to sweet clover and make it a good soil. You can put a plow in that ground to any depth where it would have been like rubber before. </seg>
            <seg id="p298">298 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture MR. STEWART: A number of states have carried on tests to study the soil building effects of plowing under sweet clover at different times of the year. Since nitrogen is the element most likely to be deficient in Nebraska soils, the addition of this element was considered particularly. It seems that sweet clover plowed under the first part of May will add from 60 to 75 percent of the nitrogen added by a full two years' crop. This will vary, of course, depending on the earliness of the spring growth. The maxi - mum amount of nitrogen is present the latter part of May. In Nebraska, however, as has already been brought out, even in the most favorable part, we run a great deal of risk of having too little rainfall to produce a spring growth of sweet clover and then to properly mature a corn crop. If sweet clover is plowed under in the spring, it must be done early before there is a great deal of growth and yet sufficiently late to be sure that plowing will thoroughly kill the sweet clover. There is, however, a very important soil building affect secured by plowing under sweet clover in the spring of the second year. Our time is now up for this morning's program. How do you like this type of program compared to the type where two or three men make up the program? How many like the question box type of pro - gram best? I see that the vote is unanimous for it. Next year we will have a similar session. SOIL FERTILITY PROBLEMS AFFECTING NEBRASKA FARMERS J. C. RUSSEL Agricultural College Soil, the basic agricultural resource of the country, can be exhausted. It is being exhausted in many sections. Many Nebraskans have boasted that they have a soil which will never wear out. Not all farmers have been lulled to sleep by this doctrine, but many have. Slowly, without their being aware of it, the inherent fertility of their land has declined. In order to maintain the standard of yields set in earlier years, they have applied better methods of tillage, they have used better seed, and have worked harder. Slowly, the cost of production has crept up on their gross returns until they have very little left for profit in their agricultural enterprises. A Typical Farm of Yesterday I have in mind the case of a particular farm. Forty-five years ago this farm was broken out of the virgin sod. In course of time an ade - quate set of farm buildings were erected, fences were built, and trees were planted. As a home it was one of the average homes of the coun - try. It was a grain farm, like all of the other farms in its section of </seg>
            <seg id="p299">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 299 the country. Soon after it was homesteaded, it came into the hands of its present owner at a price of $25 per acre. As time went by land around it sold piece by piece, for gradually increasing prices until today the owner feels that his land is worth $100 per acre. In early days this farm was plowed with a walking plow, harrowed with a pile of brush or an antiquated wooden harrow, and drilled to wheat with a hoe drill. The crop was harvested with an old fashioned reaper, and threshed with a machine run by horse-power. In good years, wheat yielded 25 to 35 bushels per acre, corn yielded 35 to 60 bushels per acre and other crops in proportion. Labor, machinery, and all that the farmer bought, was, as prices go today, relatively inexpensive. But, what was most important of all, the soil yielded bountifully with little effort on the farmer's part, and so he made money, in spite of the fact that wheat brought him only 48 to 70 cents per bushel. And Today Today this farm is handled by a tenant, as are more than half the farms in its county. It is still a grain farm. The buildings are becom - ing delapidated, the fences are falling down, and the orchard and shade trees are all dead. The owner maintains that he cannot afford to spend money on the buildings, and new trees if planted would die, for the renter cannot be expected to take care of them. The labor of pride and love and hope, performed by the owner in pioneer days, cannot be evaluated in dollars and cents and cannot be duplicated by a tenant system. The tenant plows the ground with a gang and tractor; he pulverizes it with a steel harrow, and disc, and seeds it with, a disc drill. His labor operations are numerous and expensive. He knows very well how little he would raise if he used the same machinery and methods of 30 or 40 years ago. He is a better farmer than the owner ever was. Experiment Sta - tion bulletins, and the agricultural papers, delivered at his door, and the County Agent, and Extension Service bring to his attention agricultural science that was unheard of 30 or 40 years ago. He uses better methods and better seed. Indeed he works longer hours and denies himself and family the simple pleasures and the luxury of leisure that characterized the home life of a generation ago. This tenant farmer is not getting ahead; he is making no more than a very modest living. The landlord, after paying taxes and necessary upkeep, is realizing less than 3 per cent on the estimated value of bis farm. If he carried — as many do — a sizeable mortgage on his land, he would realize no income at all. Fertility Has Declined This particular farm is not an isolated case. I refer to it because I believe that it contains all of the elements typical of our agricultural situation today. You know what these elements are. It is not my place </seg>
            <seg id="p300">300 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture to discuss them. There is however, on this farm one situation of which the farmer is not sufficiently aware. It is the reduced fertility of his soil. I know that this farm is not capable of producing, even in good years with improved methods, more than half or two-thirds as much per acre as when the land was new. The soil on this farm was analyzed recently in our laboratory. The analysis showed that 45 per cent of the original organic matter and nitrogen content had been lost. It has been dissipated by cultivation, lost by erosion, and exhausted by crops. Organic Matter Has Been Lost In these respects, this farm is not an isolated case. The average Nebraska farm that has been under cultivation 45 years has likewise lost from 30 to 45 per cent of these constituents. One per cent per year; 1000 pounds of organic matter and 50 pounds of nitrogen an - nually! Some farms have lost more, as much as 56, 60, or 70 per cent, where erosion has been serious. These figures are not guesses, they are based on very inclusive statewide studies. This is a serious loss. Organic matter is the most important constituent of Nebraska soil. Its complete exhaustion would be ruinous. Organic Matter All Important Organic matter it is, in new land, which makes the soil crumblj and granular and friable. Farmers have told us that plows in old land which has lost a third or more of its organic matter, pulled a fourth heavier than when the land was new. We can believe this for we are accumulating data in our laboratory that indicates such a possibility. Our virgin soil once scoured on the moldboard at 40 per cent water con - tent. Today the soil must be as dry as 30 per cent before it will scour well. Old soil is generally stiffer when moist, harder when dry, shrinks more and cracks worse and is generally inferior to new soil in all tilth properties. Soil that has lost organic matter requires more work to put it into good condition. It loses water more readily. It is less porous and does not take up rainfall so readily. There is more runoff on our sloping lands and more erosion. We have no data on the subject as yet, but wo hazard the opinion that rainfall in Nebraska is 5 inches less effective today on old cultivated land than on new land originally. Organic matter is the food stuff of bacteria which are essential in making plant food available. In the process of bacterial decay, organic acids are produced which dissolve the mineral elements of the soil, and make them available to plants. Nitrogen likewise, becomes available to plants through bacteria feeding on organic matter. Nitrogen Also Important Next to organic matter, nitrogen is the most important element in fertility in Nebraska. Nitrogen it is which gives plants a luxuriant healthy green foliage that indicates a productive crop. Lack of nitrogen </seg>
            <seg id="p301">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 301 it is which leads to the sickly, yellow, stunted appearances of crops in old fields, and on hillsides, where the valuable surface soil has washed away. Exhaustion of organic matter leads to a reduction in the rate at which nitrogen becomes available. On farms in which 40 per cent of the organic matter has been lost, the production of nitrates is only about half as rapid as on new land. On badly eroded farms where the soil is yellow and thin, it is impossible to raise a good crop of corn or wheat, simply because the bacteria are unable to produce enough avail - able nitrate plant food. We believe that the restoration of organic matter and nitrogen is the solution of the present problem of depleted fertility on Nebraska farms. The question is can these constituents be restored; bow; and will it pay? How Can Organic Matter Be Restored? Let us come back to the case of the farm mentioned in the be - ginning. It has lost 45 per cent of its original organic matter and nitrogen. It is a grain farm. The only materials which can be put back into the soil are crop residues, corn stalks and wheat straw, and the little manure produced by the horses and the few cattle that a grain farmer has. This farmer concluded 25 years ago that corn stalks should not be burned and not a stalk has been burned since then. By this procedure 3-8 of the nitrogen removed by the corn crop has been returned. This is a saving certainly worth while, although it is admitted that they have been a nuisance and occasionally larger crops would have been raised had they been burned. Straw Spreading Straw stacks however, frequently have been burned, though many stacks have been allowed to stand for years and rot, until, with a little spreading, they could be farmed through. It is common observation that old stack bottom spots are abundantly fertile for years, and one thinks that if this straw could be spread over the entire field, the benefits would be enormous. Straw spreading has been tried on this farm several times. Its immediate effect has been to decrease the yields of corn and wheat invariably. This seems to be a quite general experience with straw the country over. Investigations of soil scientists during the past few years show that the return of fresh straw to the land is not justified. When used as a top dressing, straw keeps the soil cool, represses the formation of ni - trate plant food, delays the growth of crops, and reduces yields. It may help wheat to go through the winter, and it may conserve some water, but so far, it has not been found to be of enough advantage in these respects to be generally recommended in this state. If plowed under, fresh straw represses the formation of nitrates, </seg>
            <seg id="p302">302 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture allows the soil to dry out readily, and represses yields. If used year after year, a time would probably come when straw would show returns, but experience has been that it takes a great number of years for this time to arrive. Straw contains about 3-7 of the nitrogen removed by the crop and it should not be burned. Well-rotted straw plowed under apparently does not repress yields. The best way to use straw is to thresh it into the barnyard, and let the animals bed-down on it. After it has become well-mixed with manure and thoroughly rotted it may be used with some assurance of returns. At the Agronomy Farm, 3 plats have been getting one ton of fresh straw each year for the past 5 years. This straw has been worked into the soil before each crop of wheat, oats and corn. To date the results have been very disappointing for the straw has reduced the yields, and so far has been used at a loss. In addition, the soil is 3100 pounds per Fig. 19 — The use of straw as a top dressing has not given increased yields in Nebraska. It should be put thru the feedyard and be made into manure. acre poorer in organic matter today than it was 5 years ago. However, where no straw was used 5580 pounds of organic matter had been lost. The difference of 2480 pounds represents the saving due to the 10,000 pounds of straw used. Perhaps 2 tons per acre would have overcome all of the loss, however, we have no reason to expect that it would have been done with profit. High Quality Organic Material Essential to Soil Improvement The grain fanner cannot hope to maintain his soil by the return of crop residues only. At best he is returning only about 40 per cent of what the crops remove, and that in the farm of relatively low quality stuff which introduces adverse factors into productivity that makes it relatively unprofitable. The organic content of the soil can only be built up with profit with relatively high quality materials. Legumes and barnyard manure are such materials. </seg>
            <seg id="p303">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 303 At Agronomy Farm there is another set of 3 plats alongside the atraw-treated plats. These received 1 ton each of cured alfalfa hay in - stead of straw. The hay that was used was generally hay of inferior quality from stock butts or feed bunks. In 5 years, the soil has gained 2480 pounds per acre in organic content. Add this to the loss of 5580 pounds per acre discovered on untreated plots and we have a gain to the soil of 8060 pounds of organic matter from the use of 10,000 pounds of alfalfa. This is more than three times the effect of the same quantity of straw. In addition, the alfalfa hay has generally increased the yield of all crops each year, the gross value of the increase being $1.99 per ton of material used. The experiment was not planned to show that alfalfa hay could be used with profit as fertilizer. It does show, how - ever, that nitrogenous waste has a high fertilizer value. Manure the Best Fertilizer for Nebraska Manure used judiciously is the best of all fertilizers for general farming. Experience has taught us that manure can be used to disad - vantage as well as to advantage. Ordinarily manure is used too heavily and too frequently on some parts of the farm, and not enough, or at all, on the balance. Too many farmers look upon manure as something to be got rid of the cheapest way possible, without inquiring how to turn this common farm product into profit. At Agronomy Farm, we are attempting to find out what is the best rate of manure to apply, to what crop it is best to apply it, and what a ton of manure is really worth under our conditions. A number of experimental plats are manured at the rate of 2 tons per acre per year, some getting 2 tons every year, some 4 tons every two years and others 8 tons every four years. This manure is applied to a rotation of wheat, corn, and oats. Manure Worth $2.00 Per Ton At the end of the first four years, we find on averaging all data, that 24 tons of manure applied to 3 acres of land has given a total increase in crops amounting to approximately 20 bushels of wheat, 30 bushels of oats and 5 bushels of corn. At current cash prices, this makes manure worth about $2.00 per ton. Our experiments indicate quite clearly that manure is worth much more when applied at a thin rate and frequently, than when applied very heavily and at less frequent intervals. It is common observation that manure often causes crops to fire in dry weather. This is particu - larly the case on corn in the southern half of the state. We believe that much of these adverse effects can be overcome by using manure at thinner rates than are generally common. Five years ago when our manure experiments were started, we analyzed the soil, and we reanlayzed it last summer. We find that where no manure was put, the soil has lost 1116 pounds of organic matter an - nually. Where manure was used at the rate of 2 tons per acre per year, </seg>
            <seg id="p304">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 304 Fig. 20 — According to figures from the Nebraska Experiment Station barnyard manure has increased the yields of all grain crops considerably in Eastern Nebraska. the soil has almost exactly the same organic content today that it had 5 years ago. Furthermore it is becoming gradually more responsive each year as measured by adjacent unmanured land. For the plat which gets 2 tons of manure per acre each year, the increase in wheat the first year was 3.3 bushels, the second year, 5.5 bushels, the third year was not a good wheat year and the increase droppd to 3.1 bushels. In 1924, this plat yielded 59 bushels and 40 pounds of wheat per acre which was 16.8 bushels more than the check. In 1925, which was a very poor wheat year, the check plat yielded 10 bushels per acre, and the plat receiving manure, 17 bushels. Legumes Must Be Grown Theoretically it is not possible to produce on the farm from products raised on the farm enough manure to permanently maintain the organic matter and nitrogen content of the soil at any desired high point, unless a considerable portion of the feed is leguminous hays. Some nitrogen is converted into animal protein and marketed on the hoof, and some is unavoidably lost from the manure in the barnyard. The exact percent - age that can be returned to the land depends much on the animal, its facilities for handling the excrement, than a third of the nitrogen ingested age, and condition of feeding, and Probably on the average not more in the feed is returned in practice, gen content of the soil, the farmer take nitrogen out of the air, or he In order then, to maintain the nitro - must either grow legumes, which will must be a heavy purchaser of feed. The heavy feeder of livestock is one individual who does not need to worry about maintaining soil fertility. He often has more manure than he needs. There are numerous farms in various sections of Nebraska that are extravagantly fertilized. </seg>
            <seg id="p305">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 305 It is well known that putting land into legumes increases its pro - ductiveness. If legumes are used for pastures, if they are mowed for hay, and the hay is fed on the farm and the manure returned, or if the legumes are turned under, the soil is built up in nitrogen content and organic matter. If the legumes are sold as hay, the soil may not be built up much in nitrogen content, however, it is built up in productive - ness for the time being, because bacterial activity is stimulated and more nitrates are produced than on land never in legumes. When items of seed, rent, and labor are taken into consideration, the grain farmer usually concludes that he cannot afford to grow legumes simply to turn under as green manure. There are, however, very many badly worn fields on farms in eastern Nebraska, which like a scrub cow, are not earning their keep. These had better be abandoned to sweet clover for two years. The subsequent increased crops will justify the practice. Fertility in Northeast Nebraska The maintenance of fertility in eastern Nebraska is not a complicated problem. The first thing is to know what is to be done, the next is to know how to do it, and the last is to do it and do it right. Organic mat - ter and nitrogen is the problem, legumes and manure will turn the trick. The farmers in northeastern Nebraska have their fertility problem well in hand. They raise legumes, lots of them, and they are fortunate in being able to use red clover in rotation. They feed livestock and they have plenty of manure. Farms are well kept up. Last fall, in hunting for farms on which to get soil samples for a certain study, we literally searched townships over in Cuming and Burt Counties to find farms that had not been seeded down. We took samples of soil from C. Y. Thompson's farm at West Point. Mr. Thompson knows how to keep up his soil fertility and he is doing it. One field that we sampled had been under cultivation for 35 years. It had been manured well and seeded down at intervals. For the last 2 years it had been in sweet clover. This year it was in corn. The soil in this field is higher in organic mat - ter than the virgin sod. Another field also 35 years old has been in alfalfa for 15 years. The last 8 years it has been cropped and manured occasionally. It likewise was richer than the virgin sod. Both soils had an ability to produce available nitrate plant food 3 times higher than the average soil of eastern Nebraska. Fertility in Southeast Nebraska Farmers in southeastern Nebraska have not done as well as they might in maintaining their soil fertility. They have a more serious prob - lem. They raise more wheat and less livestock and they raise less le - gumes. They also have more serious erosion problems. They should be able to do everything with manure and legumes that we do at Ag - ronomy Farm, and we know it will pay them. </seg>
            <seg id="p306">306 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Fertility in Irrigated Sections Farmers in the irrigated section of Nebraska have the same prob - lem that eastern Nebraska farmers have; i. e. organic matter and nitro - gen. However, the problem is more acute for they have a soil with less of these constituents naturally, and they are farming intensively. The Scotts Bluff Station has demonstrated that the solution of their problem is manure and legumes. Fertility in Central Nebraska The farmers of Central Nebraska and the dry land section of West - ern Nebraska have a real problem. Soil fertility is not worrying them so seriously yet. Moisture is admittedly their big problem. Their soil seems to have a somewhat greater inherent ability to produce nitrates than eastern Nebraska soil, and when they get moisture, they raise a big crop. Their fertility cannot last forever. Already we are hearing complaints in some sections. I believe that the destruction of organic matter is slowly reducing the efficiency of their rainfall on some types of soil, fortunately not on all types, for the sandier types of soil will not be affected so soon. The thing that should worry farmers in these sections is the fact that they cannot restore their fertility in the same way that we see to restore it in eastern Nebraska. They cannot use manure as we use it, and they cannot grow legumes without damage to subsequent crops for several years, thereafter. I was on a farm near Cozad last June when a crop of wheat was burning up. I was told that it was the seventh crop after alfalfa sod, and six other crops had burned up ahead of it. Too much available plant food for the moisture supply is the obvious explanation. I wonder if crops burned up on new land in early days? I do not believe that they did to any great extent. We know, however, that plant food was turned loose in new land in abundance just like it is after alfalfa sod today. Somehow the physical condition of the. soil brought about by the high organic content seemed to make the moisture more effective and crops did not fire so badly. It seems that the trouble with manure and legumes in dry sections is that they add more to the soil in the way of chemically available constituents' than they do in the way of physical improvement. No method of getting around this difficulty has yet been worked out. Perhaps the farmer should go ahead and rob his soil for all he is worth now while he has a chance, trusting that when his soil is worn out, a way will be found to restore it, how - ever he should not be too careless. As I see it now, woe to agriculture in a dry land section if its soil ever does wear out. Nature took thou - sands of years to put the virgin fertility into her soil; can man bring it back so easily that he can let it run down without turning his hand? I think not, and I would certainly advise the most careful management with respect to the crop residues and manure which the dry land farm produces, lest the day come too soon when fertility will be exhausted, and before the method of restoring it is known. </seg>
            <seg id="p307">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 307 Fertility Problems in the Sandhills Comparatively speaking, crop production in the sandhills is secondary to grazing and the production of wild hay. There are sections, however, particularly along the outskirts of the sandhills proper, where the rais - ing of crops is of major concern. It is generally considered that soil moisture and wind blowing are the principle soil problems in these sec - tions. It is not sufficiently appreciated that these sandy soils are too low in nitrogen for best crop returns. Chemical analysis shows only about one-fifth as much nitrogen in the surface soil as is found in the heavy soils of eastern Nebraska. The subsoil of the sandhill soil types contains almost a negligible quantity of nitrogen. Too often, crops suf - fer for moisture simply because there is not enough plant food in the subsoil to entice roots downward. To what extent the nitrogen content of sandhill soil can be increased and how, are problems that should com - mand more attention. Where farmers have grown legumes and where they have had manure to use, crop increases have been encouraging. Other Fertility Problems Nitrogen and organic matter are the big problems in Nebraska soil management. If we take care of these, we have taken care of our other problems for a long time to come. As far as we know, potash is not a problem in this state. With respect to phosphorus, our soil in eastern Nebraska is only moderately well supplied. If we had the rainfall of Ohio and Illinois, we would be using considerable phosphate fertilizers today. Phosphate fertilizer invariably gives crops in this state a big boost as if they were hungry for phosphorus. They do not increase yields because we do not have the moisture to carry the crops through. If we can keep our soil up in organic matter, we can keep our crops from suffering for phosphorus. If we can produce enough manure we can stall off the phosphorus problem for a long time. I have seen many phosphorns-hungry soils in my travels, but I have never yet seen a soil so phosphorus-hungry that the deficiency could not be met, at least for the tims being, by a liberal use of manure. French farmers for centuries had a dictum that manure was the foundation of agriculture. They raised livestock to produce manure. We in America have antiquated that dictum. We have taught that man could live by bread alone. We have said that livestock farming is ex - travagant agriculture; extravagant because it takes 10 pounds of corn to produce a pound of beef, and a pound of beef is of no more food value than a pound of corn. Nevertheless, a prosperous agriculture goes hand in hand with livestock. Nebraska generally ranks fourth in the Union in livestock, third in corn, and second in alfalfa hay. Take away our live - stock and where could we market our corn and hay? How long would we maintain our supremacy as the Cornhusker state? They tell us that we produce too much. Perhaps we do. Yet we are continually being told how to produce more. I believe that this is right; we must produce more- we are not all producing enough now to </seg>

Recently it was reported that Iowa will sell the biggest corn crop in her history for $16,000,000 less than she received for last year's crop which was only 64% as large. Where is the joker! The joker is that the American Farmer is too dependent for his yields upon climate and not dependent enough on himself. He has tremendous acreage of a few things. In a good year he has a tre - mendous yield — down goes the price. A few bad years come — up goes the price. Then he jumps in and expands his acreage — good years come — he is in a hole. And all the time our soil is wearing out and the situation is getting worse, not better. Tie. 21 — A prosperous agriculture goes hand in hand with livestock. Photo courtesy Conservation and Survey Division Manure and legumes! You cannot have manure without livestock. You can not have livestock without legumes and pasture. You cannot have legumes and pasture without having fewer acres in corn and wheat. You cannot have more livestock without making a market for corn. If you cut the acreage of corn and wheat in the interest of livestock, and in the interest of your soil, you will have as much corn and wheat any - way. The world consumes all that we raise; none of it spoils. If we raise less, somebody will go hungry. Your livestock men may say, "Hold on, we do not want to increase the production of livestock; there are too many now, and we are not able to get our price from them as it is." The world is hungry for meat. Meat is too high in price for all the world to eat. Meat is too high because corn is high. Hold on! Corn is not too high. Where is the joker! The joker is that some sections are raising grain, and their soil is wearing out, and grain is going up in price. Some sections are feed- </seg>

Let John Jones in Fillmore County go to producing beef and putting it on the market cheaper than Pat Murphy in Cuming County, and Pat will go to raising wheat On the average quarter section of Cuming County land there is only .9 of an acre of wheat today, and 49 head of cattle and hogs. On the average quarter section in Fillmore County there are 50.3 acres of wheat and only 17.3 head of cattle and hogs. Yet Cuming County soil will produce just as much wheat per acre as Fillmore County soil, and Fillmore County can raise livestock. Call it diversification! Call it good farm management. Call it wholesale agricultural reorganization if you will. Reorganization of agriculture must come. Some of you were here when Nebraska was an open range. The day of the open range is gone. Cattle raising is a business now, not a romance. Some of us grew up on these prairies when the sod was fresh, when all was corn and wheat for miles and miles. The romance of those days is still in our blood. We tingle to hear of Wilcox at McCook with 10,000 bushels of corn in the crib. The clatter of the com - bine, or the chug of the giant tractor, or the panting of many horses teamed abreast, thrills us through and through. We fret for the open spaces and a panorama of wheat and corn. Yet, the romantic days of big grain farms are passing. They must pass like the open range. Farming is a business, 365 days in the year. We must have wheat and corn and hay, and cows, and hogs, and steers, and manure to haul; something to keep us busy all the time. The French were right. Livestock, and dairy animals, and poultry, to con - sume on the farm all that the soil produces, these are the foundations of permanent agriculture in Nebraska. Theoretically there is only one way to keep soil from wearing out. This is the formula. Raise legumes. Feed them to the old cow. Sell her butter. When she gets old butcher her, and eat her. Grind her bones and scatter them to the four winds from the center of your farm. If you get tired of beef, try the same formula on a hog for a while, eat pork, and sell lard. Butter and lard are the only farm products which carry away from your farm, neither nitrogen, phosphorus, nor potas - sium. This is meant to be facetious. We cannot farm by theory. Farm - ing is a practical proposition. After all, the practical question in the maintenance of the fertility of Nebraska farms is not what should be done, but how can we do it. I began this address by an allusion to a typical farm whose fertility had declined, and which is no longer paying reasonable interest to its owner. It was a tenant farm. Forty-three percent of the farms in Nebraska are operated by tenants. Let me say in concluding that the practical problem of the maintenance of fertility in Nebraska soil, now, and in the future is most vitally connected with the problem of landlord - tenant relations. </seg>
            <seg id="p310">310 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture SUCCESSFUL FARMING PRACTICES ON FARMS IN MY COMMUNITY C. B. NOYES Waterloo, Douglas County, Nebraska We have been so interested in the soil problem that I am afraid it will be difficult for us to switch onto another subject. My experience has been entirely in the extreme eastern part of Nebraska where we are relatively close to the markets. The greatest advantage of this is that we have strong prices. Land is higher than it is farther west and farm questions are on an intensive scale. There is no cheap pasture, nor is there any cheap hay. Being close to the city we can market many things in the city because they are raised especially for the city trade. This is not a particular advantage to those of us who are a little farther away. Raising things for the city trade is a business in itself and it is conducted by those who live right up near the city — and in a way that the farmer cannot afford to compete a great deal with them. Now there are two or three points that I want to take up. Here is one of them: Diversified farming. Corn is our big crop. Every - thing is built around corn. We raise small grain because it pays to change our land, but corn is our important crop. Last year a manu - facturer from the east visited our state. We showed him around the city of Omaha. But when he went out to the country he was most im - pressed — he said he had never seen anything like our corn fields any - where. Now we have always thought that we were in the corn belt, not only in it, but a little farther than anyone else. I got quite a jolt the other day to learn that a farmer from Me Cook, Nebraska, had had such success in raising corn — and more of a jolt when I learned that he raised his fine corn right next to the "poor farm." If he could raise such corn as that next to the Poor Farm, I would like to know what he might do on a good farm. Farming is like any other business — if you didn't have so many ex - penses you could raise a lot and make a lot of money. Especially the renter is complaining that there is nothing left after all the expenses are paid. I do not think, however, this is so serious as most of us are making at least a living. Another point I want to emphasize is sidelines. We have a sideline that we are strong for; something that we can do without taking too much time from oar regular crops. I think this is so important that I believe we should make it a part of our regular business. I have known some to use hogs as a sideline. Perhaps they are all right in the way of a large sideline. With us dairy products and poultry are the things we can use best. I know a man who had a few cows and a few hogs on his 160-acre farm. He figured that they cleared him $760 last year. That pays quite a number of bills these days. I know another farmer who milked a few cows. They pay all the running expenses of his </seg>
            <seg id="p311">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 311 farm. He also raises hogs and feeds cattle every winter. Those two farms I know absolutely always pay out, and in years of good crops they make good money. The next farmer I shall tell about is a renter. There are several men that are very good renters in our section and a good many of our best farms are now owned by their former renters. This particular man said that it took all of his time to care for his livestock. I asked him how much his milk brought him per month, and he told me more than $130. I think he must get an extra price for his milk, perhaps it is of high butter content. A few of us fanners were talking about this problem one day and I asked one man what he thought about it and received a reply to the effect that he had farmed about half his life and had known some men who made money by just running their own business — maybe that is a helpful hint for all of us. There is just one other point I want to bring up. When you raise a crop you are only half through. The business part of it is what makes up our profits. The world is willing to pay for what it wants. If you can produce what it wants you are all right. We send from our locality to South Dakota for our alfalfa seed. We buy dairy cattle from the east because they produce better stock than we do. In our locality there are many farmers who have built up a big special business. We have a man who gives his time to raising seed corn and he can get from three to five times as much as the rest of us. Try to work out some plan. Nebraska offers a very wide range of opportunities to do this. We grow a great variety of things. But get this point. Any business must en - large on its own profits. There are very few businesses that are profit - able enough to stand the rates of interest that the farmer has to pay for borrowed capital. What we need is not more credit but less credit. When the farmer will do what he can do on his own capital and what it will support he will be on the way to making money. This West of which we are so proud was developed by good management, hard work, and thTifty habits. I do not believe that we are going to find any very immediate substitutes for the old-time virtues. Success comes to us who are willing 1 to pay its price in painstaking care and hard work." SUCCESSFUL FARMING PRACTICES ON FARMS IN MY COMMUNITY V. J. HEINE "In discussing this problem in Central Nebraska I believe we have taken on a pretty big subject. You will find a great variety of soil con - ditions and different conditions generally that will affect farming con - ditions in that part of the state in its many different localities. I am perhaps more acquainted with the conditions in the south central part. County Extension Agent, Holdrege, Nebraska </seg>
            <seg id="p312">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 312 We have the question of limited rainfall. I heard a fellow say that he had farmed in a number of different states, but that he always came back to central Nebraska because nowhere else could he farm so big. It isn't the sporty fellow who has spent a good deal of money on build - ings and equipment who has been successful in our section. It is the fellow who has stayed with it year after year. It is said that some of the old-time farmers had crop failures so often that the railroads were compelled to bring in free seeds to keep them from moving out. We have tried alfalfa, but it is quite a question with us. We can raise the alfalfa all right, but we have considerable trouble in following it up because it is likely to burn out the crop. It seems that the alfalfa saps the subsoil moisture so much that it is impossible for us to grow a crop for several seasons after breaking up the alfalfa. We have found that the pit silo is a necessity. You can tell by the appearance of a man's stock whether he is using a pit silo or not. I know of one man who even uses the silo in the summer time. Out in our part of the state we are bothered considerably with smut in our winter wheat. They have introduced the new treatment and we are now treating our seed with copper carbonate. This has proven very satisfactory and is helping to make wheat growing more profitable. We have also found that hog lot sanitation is a good thing for us to adopt if we are raising hogs. Sooner or later the fellow who raises hogs will run up against this problem of pig disease and roundworms and be forced to adopt some system of sanitation. We have also found that it is a good plan to raise a little kafir corn for roughage — most of us raise quite a little every year. Some of the grain sorghums and sweet sorghums are valuable feed crops for our part of the state. In general the fellow out in our country who runs his business on an even keel, uses his head, tends to business, treats his grain for smut, uses hog sanitation, he is the man who is getting ahead. SUCCESSFUL FARMING PRACTICES ON FARMS IN MY COMMUNITY W. P. SNYDER, North Platte, Nebraska "I have been very much interested in the discussions this afternoon and I certainly think the discussion by Mr. Russel on soil fertility was full of fundamental facts. I think we all realize that he was giving us something that we needed. We must take some thought of soil fer - tility. When I was assigned this subject I began to think about it. It is very hard to pick out and separate the system from the man. I think some men will make a failure of any system on any farm, and I am equally sure that there are others that would make a success under </seg>
            <seg id="p313">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 313 almost any conditions. There are men who work out their own* prob - lems. Take some men and give them the best farms and they will run them down and make a failure. It seems to me that it is largely the man and not the system that he follows — the superiority of the man counts not that of any particular system. I know and you know of men who no matter what they put their hands to in the way of a crop, seem to produce a good one, and other men following somewhat the same lines fail dismally. The difference is that one man is putting all of his time and effort into it and the other is not. Fig. 22 — On our western table lands farmers are getting settled to a rotation of corn and winter wheat. It is a good combination. On our western table lands farmers are now settled down to certain systems of crop production. We are getting down pretty well to the raising of winter wheat and corn in rotation. Our experience at the Sub-Station at North Platte bears out the farmer in this decision. We have the results of sixteen years' experience. We have tried winter wheat and summer fallow, but are getting away from it. We plow the ground early in the fall. In alternating the two we have secured an average of 19 bushels of wheat as compared to 22 bushels of wheat fol - lowing summer fallow, but it takes two years for one year's crop. If instead of summer fallowing we had grown corn we find that we have 3 bushels of corn to offset each bushel of wheat produced by fallowing. We also have the hazard of losing the two years at once. We have found that we get the most grain by rotating the two, and we play a lot safer, and it is not so hard on the ground. Some years we get a failure on one or the other, but we seldom get a failure of both so that the farmer seems to be safest by alternating these two crops. In the sandhills they are getting settled down to a matter of corn and rye. These farmers have found that the Rosen Rye gives the high - est yields, and that is the variety that most of them are using. My own observation has been that in our part of the country unless a man is a good livestock man he had better let someone else do the feeding. In our country the men who have made the easiest money have sold their corn to the livestock feeders. I do not believe that we can afford to let the winter forage go to waste where we have any, but there are many farms where we do not have it. In many parts of Colorado </seg>
            <seg id="p314">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 314 so much of the land has been broken up that there is no longer sufficient pasture, and in that part of the country it is very difficult to get the land seeded back, after the native grass has been once thoroughly killed out, but in most of Western Nebraska we do not have that trouble. We must get around to the question of milk cows. I believe that our farmers are going to do more milking in the western end of the state. I believe that the farmer who takes care of his cows in the winter time finds it is worth while and that it makes him money. The thing that is most discouraging is that the average farmer will not give his livestock the right kind of care. I am thoroughly convinced that we can no longer take several years to develop a steer for the market. When grass cost nothing in the range days of Nebraska, that may have been the thing to do. That day is long since past. Every - thing that goes into our animals today has more value. Corn is high — forage crops are worth money. We have discarded the old steer and are putting calves on the market at the age of one year or two years at the most. We used to raise big hogs, now we are putting them on the market lighter and younger. I doubt if we can let the pig run on grass chiefly for a year — we must get him on the market, and do it quickly at an early age. We must not put up with anything in the plant or animal line that is stunted. The stunted pig never makes the gains that the thrifty pig does. I can't believe that we can profitably run spring pigs all summer with a very small gain and feed them out in the winter. Our experience has been that it is most profitable to market hogs young putting them on feed early and keeping them gain - ing rapidly from weaning time on. The young hog makes the most economical gain just as does the young steer. I do not believe that all farm practices with these high prices for feeds and low margins of profit will be successful. We must push these animals and take better care of them in that way. I think the crying need of the livestock in - dustry today is better care. That applies to breeders particularly. It is mighty discouraging to see the lack of care that the pigs and the calves are getting during the winter time. I think that every pig in Nebraska ought to turn in a profit, but they can't unless they have a chance. It is not so much a lack of equipment although that is a crying need in many sections. The most successful man is the man that has a job the year around, not the man that has one-half the time; the man who has a job every day in the year, and one that turns him a little profit every day in the year. The system that gives the greatest return for the investment, the greatest return for the labor involved, that produces the best re - sults is the best system — and that system has to include the cow, the hog, and the hen." Question — I would like to know how the tenant can make a success on the farm under the landlord-tenant system. The land is put in for one year. Forty-five percent of our farmers are tenants. How are we </seg>
            <seg id="p315">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 315 going to get this matter adjusted so that we can get the tenant to take care of the land as it should be taken care of. MR. CLAUSSEN, Gage County: I have been farming in this country for 49 years. Most of my tenants have always had long leases if they were the right kind of ten - ants. This system works all right. I like Mr. Snyder's talk very much. The trouble with Nebraska is not so much that of worn-out farms as that of worn-out farmers. ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE TREND OF FARM PRACTICES H. C. TAYLOR, Madison, Wisconsin Agricultural Economist "I am very glad to be here this afternoon, and have taken a very marked interest in listening to the discussions of the questions you have had before you because they are very important, and from some of the sentiments that have been expressed I think we may have much to learn from Nebraska farmers. One of the reasons that makes me feel that we in Wisconsin have much to learn from you is that you seem to make ends meet when prices are low as well as when prices are high. The topic "Economic Factors" brings up a number of questions, and perhaps each of them would bring up others in turn. The relation of l;he farmer to the land is perhaps one of the hardest of these questions — whether he is landlord, owner, or tenant — whether he is free to pro - ceed or not. I am sure that the gentleman who answered the last ques - tion before I began to speak would be a good landlord, particularly if he could guarantee to control the market conditions a little bit. Then we come to other factors aside from the farm — things that affect the farmer regardless of whether he is producing to feed or to sell. The important thing, in fact the most important thing is the relation be- Uveen the cost of a product and the selling price. It makes no difference whether they are high or low, so long as the margin is satisfactory. A chemist analyzed some sugar beets. He concluded that sugar beets could be grown in a certain locality, and quite an investment was made in the project. The beets grew as he predicted — what was the result? The first question was what did it cost to raise them? That question satisfactorily answered, the next was: What could they be sold for? And in this instance it was found that they could not be sold at all. There were other things that could be grown there that paid better — the prices of other products were better. The other discussions have taken up some economic factors. I couldn't raise a question with Mr. Russel's discussion — but we must remember that it is not so much the supply that controls price as it is the demand in relation to the supply. </seg>
            <seg id="p316">Report op Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 316 I agree with Mr. Russel very heartily — we must watch out for the fu - ture, or we are going to be without source of supply regardless of the price we may be able to get. The chief difficulty is that there is not enough production in other lines to make an equal exchange with the farmer for what he produces, and the exchange results badly for the farmer. Farmers' Income Reduced In 1918 the farmer received 18% of the national income, in 1919 they still retained that much, in 1920 they fell to 14% of the national income, and in 1922 still lower to 10% of the national income. The best information available at the present time shows that the scale is now back up to about 14%. How are we to bring about a real adjustment? I can't tell you. I can tell you what will be the tendency on the part of the organized farmer in comparison with other organized groups in getting his larger share. Production Control The other question relates to the matter of controlling production so as to exercise some control over these ups and downs. Prices are up sometimes, and they are down sometimes. The big crop sometimes sells for less than the small crop when we get a small crop. One cause is the swinging back and forth in the plans of the farmer. The other cause is in the influence of the weather over which man has no control. He may adjust himself better, but he has no control over the natural forces themselves. The first question he has control over. But how is the independent farmer to know what to do. He will have to study. Careful study over a long period of years shows that high prices stimu - late production in any line. Prices at this time differ from prices at some future time when the products now being produced will be ready for the market. That is one thing we need to learn — to begin to think in terms of the prices that are probable to exist at the time the product will be ready for sale. The Government, and many of the states, aTe trying to help on that subject. In the case of wheat, for instance, we know how much fall wheat has been sown and we have the intentions of the farmers regarding spring wheat, and we can begin to see in ad - vance what the crop is likely to be in case that acreage is actually planted. It may be that by getting this information from your county agents and the papers it is possible that we can swing back and not overplant, and even cut the acreage from year to year. In the case of livestock the effort is made in June to find out how many pigs have been saved and it is possible to predict the number of hogs that will go on the market at a given time. Possibly we can even out the supply of hogs. Production and Price Ratio You are aware of how the hog and corn price ratio goes up and down and that as a rule they run vice versa. Why is this true? It is caused by a swing in the breeding of hogs. We must get this across to </seg>
            <seg id="p317">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 317 the farmers and see what the probable trend in prices will be in the future. The adjustment of the price at the time the product will be for sale is the problem. Again, take potatoes. In 1923 we had too large an acreage of potatoes. The number of acres was reduced. The next year new factors came in, but during that season there were climatic conditions that made a very large yield in spite of the short acreage. We need to learn to control our acreage, and all those factors that we can, but we will find that even then when we have adjusted all that we can, that we can do nothing when nature steps in and takes a hand. For instance, you would think the dairy industry near a large city would be about as far removed from this influence as any, wouldn't you. In New York State one year there was an exceptionally late season, and there wa3 a great deal of grass until very late in the season — the result — an overproduction of dairy supplies, and the filling of the cold storage Fig. 23 — The wheat farmer of Nebraska is in competition with the wheat growers in the rest of the United States as well as those in all other countries of the world.. World conditions affect the price he will receive at the country elevator. stores long before the usual time. The farmer can do a great deal, but nature steps in and has an enormous influence, so much so that the large crop may sell for less money than the short crop. It has been suggested that the peak be taken from the large yield, and put in again when the supply is short. It looks like it might be a good thing if it could be handled in a satisfactory way, but it must be handled in a way not to injure any interest. Whether the ups and downs are the only questions that should be taken care of is a question that a great many people should be thinking about at the present time. There are ways and means of taking care of the difficulty. Some are in favor of some sort of a pool, and some are not. It is true that some men have used their very best judgment and still have gotten into difficulty. Surplus Disposal Let us take up those that are in favor of this matter. Our govern - ment has done a great deal to get these matters before our people. Things are happening in other countries, particularly in Western Europe. </seg>
            <seg id="p318">318 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Before the war most of those people were tenant farmers, now most of them are beginning to own their own farms. They used to produce wheat for the landlord and corn for themselves. When the tenants took over the land they proceeded to eat the wheat and feed the corn to livestock. It meant more livestock — and less wheat. That was not on such a large scale as it might have been, but it is beginning to have an increasingly large effect on the world situation. Many a farmer has appreciated this in more ways than one. Farmers of Whole World in Competition We must not only take the United States into consideration, but we must add to it all the world, and everything the rest of the world is likely to do. We must consider all the changes that are likely to take place and make our decision about what we are going to do. In making that decision it must always be at most a prediction of what may be — not what actually will be. We cannot adjust our farm practices without we know what these conditions will likely be — and we must have an idea of what kind of competition we will have throughout the world in our picture if it is to be accurate. And, as we view this picture we nust see whether there are other operative forces that may come in. If you do this you will see that farmers compete with each other more unmercifully than any other class of people, and they do it more in - tensively than any other industry in the world. They will work longer hours:, live more cheaply in order to continue to produce their products for the market. That in turn is explained by another economic condi - tion. Competition is different on farms than in any other business — because the farmer seems often to work for nothing and board himself. If a farmer is not going to live up to the standards of other people then he had better get out of the business. One reason that more have not done this is that it is so difficult to find work in other industries. With these results in mind the final result will be carried into future genera - tions. It is only through a concerted action on the part of the farmer that he is going to bring about a right relation of prices in the long run. In the short run legislation might be effective, if a considerable number of people were interested in making it effective. Economic Problems Important I have tried to speak in general terms. On my own farm I have had to do away with labor when it was too expensive, and some of my laborers have quit — then I have quite a problem. I have tried the dairy business — requires less labor. In the question of power on the farm the cost is a very important item — whether to run the horse or the tractor — feed horses or feed the tractor. If a farmer produces both his feed and his power the cost is about the same. The main thing I wish to stress is that as time is going on, more and more time is being given to economic questions. We are gradually learning to market in the right way, and at the same time get the right price. We must get </seg>

When we accomplish this we have set the foundation for our real solutions. REPORT OF THE FIRST ANNUAL ALFALFA AND SWEET CLOVER SEED SHOW AND PROGRAM, BRIDGEPORT, NEBRASKA D. L. GROSS, Lincoln Ninety-four Nebraska seed growers from twenty-one counties were represented at the First Annual Alfalfa and Sweet Clover Seed Show held at Bridgeport, December 16 and 17. Keith County with 25 entriea in charge of their County Agent, Jay Hepperly, carried away the hon - ors and the silver Loving Cup presented by the Griswold Seed Company for the largest and best county collective exhibit. Morrill County took second place and Dawes County was third. In the individual winnings growers from nine counties were represented. An unusual feature of these winnings was the fact that the first six places on alfalfa seed went to as many different counties which were as follows: Dawes first, then Keith, Morrill, Furnas, Dawson, and Sioux. The ten premiums given for sweet clover seed went to seven counties, the order of win - ning being: Keith, Cuming, Dawes, Morrill, Adams, Dawson, and Lincoln. The judges of the show, Mr. F. D. Keim of the Agricultural College, and Frank Quick of the Griswold Seed Company, commented very favor - ably on the quality of the seed shown. Although the grower as a rule is handicapped in not having the necessary machinery for the proper clean - ing of the seed, a very commendable showing was made. The sponsors of this first legume seed show had the following ob - jects in mind: to arrange for an exchange day where the buyer and the grower could get together; to bring out the importance of using only the best seed of the proper variety and origin; to create more in - terest in seed production; to bring out the importance and value of Ne - braska-grown seed; and to foster the idea of providing central cleaning plants where the seed may be cleaned and graded and put on the market in uniform grades. These points were all stressed in the program which was held in connection with the show. A number of seedsmen who were present expressed the need of central cleaning plants in seed-growing areas where the seed could be assembled, cleaned and graded, thus allowing for a reduction in the cost of marketing seed and at the same time in - creasing the price which the grower receives. These points were stressed by D. L. Gross in his talk on "Shall we continue the seed show?" He brought out that at the present time buyers can secure seed only in small quantities from each grower, and much shipping and travel ex- </seg>
            <seg id="p320">320 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture pense is entailed. It is generally the case that the seed must be pur - chased in an unclean condition and freight must be paid on the weed seeds and trash as well as on the seed. All this adds to the expense of putting the seed on the market. This reduces the price which can be paid to the grower and increases the price at which it must be sold. If the growers were organized and could procure the services of one who was equipped for cleaning and handling the seed, these losses could be eliminated to the profit of both grower and the consumer. Close to 50,000 lbs. of seed were listed for sale at this show. Much more would have been offered but owing to the unfavorable fall weather, much of the seed is still unthreshed. Much of this seed, however, is in an uncleaned condition, and will no doubt have to be recleaned before it is sold to the consumer. Although the heaviest snow storm that western Nebraska has ex- perienced for the past 5 or 6 years blocked the roads almost entirely, thereby cutting down attendance at the show, those who were able to dig through the drifts found the program of much interest. Most of this year's program dealt with legume crops although it is expected that in the future more general crop programs will be planned. J. A. Holden, Superintendent of the station at Mitchell, opened the program with a discussion of "More legumes and how to grow them" in which he used his very practical experiments as a basis for his remarks. "North Platte Valley farmers are beginning to appreciate the value of alfalfa and sweet clover in rotations," he said, "as is shown by the fact that the acreage of these crops is increasing and that this past season beets averaged 16 tons per acre where heretofore 12 tons has been a high average. Of course this season has been especially favor - able climatically but the acreage of sugar beets on alfalfa and sweet clover land has also had its effect in making a high average beet tonnage." The effect of alfalfa and sweet clover on the yield of sugar beets is strikingly shown by the figures giving the average yields of fields cropped in different ways the past 4 years as is shown in the follow- ing table: Yield of Sugar Beets on Fields Cropped in Different Ways Sugar beets after alfalfa and sweet clover have made twice the yield' of those on land cropped to beets continuously. This work also shows that two years of sweet clover, using the second year for pasture, has equalled 4 years of alfalfa in its soil building effect. One ton of manure has increased the yield of beets three-fourths of a ton which indicates that every ton of manure applied to beet land will make a return of $3.75. Tons Continuous sugar beets, no manure or legumes 10.8 I I. i. i. I. Manured 19.8 After alfalfa 18.3 After alfalfa and manure 21.3 Sweet clover , 21.4 Second year after sweet clover 18.4 </seg>
            <seg id="p321">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 321 Alfalfa and sweet clover have also doubled the yield of potatoes. Mr. Holden gave figures to show that where potatoes have been grown on the same land continuously there has been a loss of $42.00 per acre annually compared to a $75.00 profit where potatoes have followed alfalfa. According to Mr. Holden a 7-year rotation has been found most satisfactory for the average 80-acre irrigated farm. This farm would be divided into 7 fields each containing 11 acres cropped as follows: (1) Alfalfa seeded with oats as a nurse crop; (2) Alfalfa (1st year field); (3) Alfalfa (2nd year field); (4) Alfalfa (3d year field); (5) Potatoes; (6) Beets; and (7) Beets (manured). Actual yields show that there would be as much profit in 22 acres of beets in this rotation as in 275 acres of beets grown in a beet and potato rotation. Small grain has rarely proven profitable under irrigation, and can best be used as a nurse crop for alfalfa or sweet clover. Seeding about April 10 has proven most successful on the average. Ray Shannon who farms in the Pumpkin Creek Valley south of Bridgeport discussed his seeding experiences. He has had good success in drilling sweet clover in February on a good, firm seed bed. Mr. Shannon reports that he has gotten excellent stands of sweet clover with as little as 4 pounds per acre. He has used first year sweet clover for hay and found it very satisfactory. Mr. Frank Quick of the Griswold Seed Company attended the meet - ings and discussed Nebraska's alfalfa and sweet clover seed from the seedman's standpoint. "The seed business," said Mr. Quick, "has problems that many folks do not appreciate. The prospective customer, for instance, often remarks that he can buy seed much cheaper from growers or certain seed houses. He pointed out, however, that all seed firms cannot avoid certain costs incurred by collecting data as to the amount of seed avail - able, in traveling about to locate small amounts of seed here and there and in collecting it into carload lots. Additional costs for cleaning ma - chinery, rents, taxes, interest in holding seed for several months until it is in demand, and for shrinkage all go to make up costs." When asked regarding the cheap and bargain prices for seed feat - ured by some firms, Mr. Quick replied that they could sell seed of equal quality just as low if they saw fit. However, many such firms are not in Nebraska and hence do not need to comply with the Nebraska Seed Law as to labeling. Alfalfa seed 90% pure would have 10 pounds of weed seed per 100 pounds, and although 90% pure might have and usual - ly, if of the "bargain" nature, does have, a lot of shriveled light, low quality seed making up the 90% of seed that is alfalfa. The best qual - ity seed is the cheapest in the end for the farmer. Less needs to be sown per acre; good quality seed germinates strongly and there is not a fresh seeding of weeds to offer competition as is the case with cheap, weedy seed. </seg>
            <seg id="p322">322 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture E. C. Nelson, County Agent at Bridgeport, summarized the exper - iences of men in his county who have harvested sweet clover seed. Har - vesting sweet clover seed is rather difficult as it shatters easily and the crop is often rank and difficult to handle. The average yield of seed in Morrill County the past year has been about 4 bushels per acre. Those in attendance at the meeting were very much interested in the remarks of Nick Caspers, President and Manager of the Western South Dakota Alfalfa Seed Growers Association. This association has its headquarters at Rapid City, South Dakota, at which place it has a warehouse and cleaning machinery. The association has grown from 140 members to about 500 members in 4 years time. Mr. Caspers brought out, however, that they have had many problems and that it has taken years to accomplish what he, in the beginning, thought could be done in 6 months. He has found that the members are sometimes attracted by temporary higher prices, sacrificing future results for the dollars im - mediately in sight. • The idea of this association is to stress quality, offer a supply of genuine, South Dakota seed, and extend a service to growers in the way of cleaning up and grading seed, collecting it at a central point where buyers are attracted by the quantity offered. SEEDING ALFALFA H. D. LUTE Paxton, Nebraska Along about 1886 my father seeded the first alfalfa ever sown in Keith county. The ground was plowed and harrowed. A farmer of the neighborhood who had done this kind of work in the east was secured to broadcast the seed by hand. As a boy I had the job of harrowing the ground after the seeding and I well remember that the soil was loose and lumpy and dusty. And if recollection serves me rightly the time was after corn planting. The resultant stand was mediocre as we of a later day would expect but the results were such as to justify further efforts to secure this rather little known but much touted forage plant that made hogs as big as steers, as reported to my father by a man who had seen alfalfa grow and used for hog pasture down on the Republican river. We did not early learn the necessity of a firm seed bed but we very soon commenced to use the press drill for seeding and this probably to some extent offset packing the soil to secure the necessary firmness. In this county there are three types of farming to consider and the methods used to secure a good stand are necessarily quite different. In the sand hill regicn, except in the harder valleys, about the only </seg>
            <seg id="p323">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 323 successful way to get a stand of alfalfa is to break the sod, usually done in June, disk and pack the sod and drill the alfalfa with a press drill. If moisture conditions are not right some wait till August or September before seeding. On the dry land well cultivated land is best. If plowed in the spring shallow plowing gives the best results. Packing for a firm seed bed, usually done with a disk, is essential and seeding with a press drill is just about indispensible. On irrigated land some carelessness in preparing the land or seed - ing may be overcome by the use of water though thorough preparation and careful seeding gives the best results even where watered. Irri - gated land has the further advantage that it may be grown with a nurse crop and secure a crop of grain while the alfalfa is getting a start. While in very favorable seasons seeding with a nurse crop on dry land may give results to justify it on the whole, one year with an - other, it means a loss of both seed and a stand of alfalfa. The first requisite in securing a stand of alfalfa in a thoroughly prepared seed bed and the big thing there is to have it firm. An old German friend said to me one day "We can get a better stand of alfalfa right there in the road than on loose ground. To my mind the press drill is the only kind of seeder to use in this section. However care should be used not to plant too deep. The depth depends on the type of soil and the moisture content. Lighter soil will stand deeper seeding. A fault with a good many press drills, especially old ones is that they sow to much seed. On irrigated land some small grain crop is drilled in and then the alfalfa seeded crosswise. If the soil is inclined to blow it is best not to put in the alfalfa till the small grain is up enough to stop the soil drifting. The seeding should be done early in the spring as in this way the alfalfa gets ahead of the weeds. The moisture conditions on dry land are usually not favorable early enough for fall seeding. A late fall start means winterkilling. On irrigated land with the use of water al - falfa can be seeded after the small grain crop is taken off with good success but so far not much of this has been done. That is a very busy time of the year with the irrigation farmer so he fails to get his ground prepared and seed planted. One Keith county farmer planted seed on August first this year and on October first cut a good half a ton of hay per acre. Fall seeding has the advantage by having fewer weeds to contend with. Then, too, if we follow alfalfa after grain rather than with grain we can seed a full stand of grain instead of a somewhat lighter seeding as is usually followed where alfalfa is put in with the grain. Wheat and barley are the best grains for a nurse crop as they do not have so heavy a foliage as oats. However, probably more alfalfa is seeded with oats as that is the more common grain crop under irrigation. So far so little sweet clover has been seeded in this section that </seg>
            <seg id="p324">324 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture the methods used are the same as for alfalfa. But I understand that at Belmont, for instance, a favorite practice is too broadcast in the fall on fall wheat without covering. Alfalfa is so valuable a crop that it justifies every effort and re - peated efforts if necessary to secure a stand. But with care in getting a fine firm seed bed, seeding early good seed and clipping the weeds high there should be no trouble in getting a stand if the season is at all favorable. ALFALFA SEED FOR NEBRASKA By P. H. STEWART Extension Agronomist, Agricultural College The state of Nebraska might well be named the "Alfalfa Empire" as we now lead all states in the acreage of alfalfa. We are very for - tunate, in fact more so than we are likely to realize or appreciate, in that in all parts of the state our soils are exceedingly favorable for al - falfa growing. We need have but little, if any, concern over a lack of lime or other elements which might prevent our successfully growing alfalfa in Nebraska. Although our alfalfa acreage is large, those who have studied this crop feel that it might well be increased considerably. Because of its great value and uniform seasonal production as a crop itself, and be - cause of its soil building effects, the alfalfa acreage could well be greatly increased. Others on this program will deal with that subject in detail so it need not be discussed at greater length. Fig. 24 — Nebraska's deep, fertile, sweet, and naturally inoculated soil is wonderfully adapted to the growing of alfalfa. </seg>
            <seg id="p325">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 325 Winterkilling Reduces Acreage What keeps our alfalfa acreage from rapidly increasing, may be asked, since practically everyone is agreed that a rational increase would be beneficial and each year a considerable new acreage is seeded. There must be some rather definite factors which tend to offset increased seed - ings. For instance, in 1924 official figures showed an acreage in Ne - braska of 1,211,161 acres while figures for 1925 show and acreage of 1,151,006 acres. This is in spite of the fact that during this period a great amount of alfalfa seed was sown. The most important factor in holding down the alfalfa acreage is, of course, weather conditions. A lack of precipitation or its unfavorable distribution during the season may often adversely affect new seedings. This can only be offset by more care in preparing the seed bed and by Eowing at times of the year and in ways most favorable for the estab - lishment of satisfactory stands. Weather conditions which cause winterkilling are also likely to re - duce the alfalfa acreage much. Such adverse winters as 1917-18 and again in 1924-25 play havoc. For instance, during the past winter many counties lost from one-sixth to as much as one-third of their alfalfa acreage. Many fields not plowed up in the spring of 1925 were seriously thinned and will have to be plowed up soon. Much Imported Seed Unhardy Just what the exact cause of winterkilling is, is not definitely known, but we do know there is a marked difference in the winter hardiness of alfalfa grown from seed of different varieties and from different sources. During the past few years we have been importing much alfalfa seed from other countries. The following table shows the importations for the past six years and the countries from which the seed has come. </seg>

            <seg id="p327">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 327 There is no question but that a lot of this imported seed gets into Nebraska. It is next to impossible to identify it, although an expert may perhaps do so by identifying weed seeds characteristic of certain countries. The Nebraska Experiment Station has found that alfalfa seed from Argentina, Italy, and Spain winterkilled badly at Lincoln while fields from Common alfalfa seed grown in Nebraska came through the winter in good shape. Seed from these areas does not seem to be adapted to Nebraska conditions and should not be knowingly seeded in any part of the state. Such seed undoubtedly has had much to do with the loss by winterkilling. Classification of Alfalfa Varieties There is considerable confusion in the minds of the public as to the different varieties of alfalfa and the characteristic of each. We may classify all alfalfa into the following groups: Turkestan, Variegated, Non-hardy, Common and Yellow-flowered. Turkestan alfalfa was first introduced by the U. S. D. A. in 1898. The first importations apparently gave better results than have the lat - ter importations. This alfalfa has to some extent a lower, more spread - ing growth, smaller and slightly more hairy leaves and finer stems. Some seed is still being imported which according to the U. S. D. A. is, gen - erally speaking, inferior to our seed in yield, hardiness, and length of life and is not to be recommended for average conditions. Under the variegated group of alfalfa we have such varieties as the Grimm, Cossack, Baltic, Canadian variegated and Sand Lucerne. This group is called variegated because of the variation in flower color which ranges from purple to yellow. The variegated alfalfa varieties are gen - erally credited with being more hardy than other varieties. The moat common variegated variety is the Grimm. It is a common claim thai this variety has a much more branching root system than has the com - mon alfalfa, although actual observations in several states in regard to this characteristic fail to show that it is so common and so truly char - acteristic that it can be used as a means of identification. The seed of the variegated alfalfas is high in price costing approximately twice what Common alfalfa costs and then unless seed is bought in states conduct - ing very careful certification systems there is considerable uncertainty as to identity. Grimm alfalfa is undoubtedly more hardy than Common alfalfa and some farmers particularly in the north half of the state feel that the extra price is not excessive. The grower of Grimm alfalfa does not need to fear winterkilling. The non-hardy group of alfalfa consists chiefly of the Arabian and Peruvian varieties, the former being grown little if any in this country and the Peruvian being confined largely to Arizona and California. Most of the 6 million pounds of alfalfa seed grown yearly in Arizona is Pe - ruvian which should most certainly be kept out of Nebraska. While the Peruvian variety may live through mild Nebraska winters a severe one, as has been shown, will kill out such fields practically 100 percent. </seg>
            <seg id="p328">328 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture The Common alfalfa is a rather distinct variety having been brought to this country from Europe, going first to Chile in South America and then to California from where it worked eastward. It is somewhat var - iable in its growth habits but on the whole it is well adapted to Nebraska and is to be recommended for average conditions if care is taken to get Nebraska or other northern grown seed. Common alfalfa was brought into Nebraska from California. S. C. Bassett in his "History of Buffalo County" reports: "In 1876 S. P. Boker of Curtis, Frontier County, re - ceived some alfalfa seed from California costing $22 per bushel. In 1878 J. C. Mitchell of Alma, Harlan County, tried alfalfa on upland and got a good catch. From this time on others took hold of it and in 1882 - 1885, we find it growing with good success in the South and Southwestern part of the state. In 1895 alfalfa was found in nearly 80 counties of the state. It was planted for the first time at the Nebraska Experiment Station in 1892." The yellow-flowered alfalfa is not important commercially but repre - sent the wild alfalfa of northern Asia being very hardy and offering studies and opportunities in hardiness investigations. Domestic Alfalfa Seed Production The following figures are the best estimates of the Bureau of Agri - cultural Economics on alfalfa seed production in the United States. 1919—25,000,000 lbs. 1920—28,000,000 lbs.. 1921—29,000,000 lbs. 1922—30,000,000 lbs. 1923—36,000,000 lbs. 1924—46,000,000 lbs. 1925—48,000,000 lbs. In order to be clear in our minds as to where the most alfalfa seed is grown in the United States and as to the variety and adaptation of such seed, it may be worthwhile to see what states are producing seed. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics at Washington has recently is - sued a report which gives the 1925 production by states as follows. This probably indicates the seed that goes into commercial channels and prob - ably does not consider seed used locally. Annual Production of Alfalfa Seed— 1925 . 5,000,000 lbs. . 3,200,000 lbs. . 3,100,000 lbs. .. 2,700,000 lbs. .22,500,000 lbs. .. 2,700,000 lbs. .. 2,600,000 lbs. .. 1,300,000 lbs. .. 1,200,000 lbs.

            <seg id="p329">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 329 Texas and New Mexico 1,100,000 lbs Colorado 1,000,000 lbs As to the varieties and adaptation of Arizona seed, it is reliably learned that approximately 85 percent of Arizona's seed comes from the Colorado River in the Yuma District. Of the 85 percent, three-fourths is of the Peruvian sort. The Salt Creek Valley produces less than 15 percent of Arizona's alfalfa, 50 percent or more of which is not to be recommended at all and Common alfalfa grown under conditions suitable for Peruvian would also be lacking in winter hardiness and not at all suitable for Nebraska. The Utah seed composing almost one-half of all the seed produced, while probably considerably more hardy than Arizona seed may be less desirable for Nebraska conditions than seed raised to our north and west. Utah raises no Peruvian alfalfa seed, but of the 22,000,000 pounds produced, something like 20,000,000 are of the Common variety with the rest Grimm and Cossack. The acreage of the so-called hardy alfalfas is being rapidly increased for seed purposes as is shown by the fact that in 1922 Utah had 600 acres of Grimm, in 1925 6,070 acres, and in 1926 she will have 12,000 acres producing seed. The alfalfa seed producing areas are high-lying valleys, many of them being isolated valleys separated by ridges. These valleys have an elevation of from 3800 to 5000 feet or so and minimum temperatures ranging near -30° F. Weather changes are less sharp than in Nebraska. Practically all the alfalfa is irrigated, the first crop being taken off for hay. Alfalfa Seed Production in Nebraska What about alfalfa seed in Nebraska? I do not intend to take up the practical phases of this subject since other speakers are to handle that subject, but a few remarks about the industry in general may be in place. Recently revised figures of the Bureau of Crop Estimates for Ne- braska give us these figures: Estimate of Alfalfa Seed Produced in Nebraska Year Av. Yield ! Production Production Acreage (Bu.) (Bu.)

            <seg id="p330">330 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture In Nebraska the central Nebraska counties such as Buffalo, Hall, Dawson, Custer, Lincoln, and Keith are the heaviest seed producers. Little Danger of Overproduction of Seed Would alfalfa seed be a profitable crop in other parts of Nebraska, particularly in the Panhandle Section? There is no lack of a market. Recently a Missouri man stated that he could get among Missouri farm - ers orders for several carloads of alfalfa seed of the Common variety if we were in position to supply it. The alfalfa acreage is rapidly in - creasing in Michigan, Wisconsin, and the corn belt states. All of this area will pay a premium for high quality seed of both the hardy and common alfalfa varieties, produced in this region. This whole area into Fig. 25 — Altho Nebraska leads the nation in alfalfa acreage we might well be growing more acres of this valuable crop than we are. which alfalfa is gradually moving is one which will continually call for seed as their climatic conditions are such that seed cannot profitably be raised there. Eastern Nebraska farmers will also consume a great deal of Nebraska seed at a premium. With a greater alfalfa seed production, particularly of the hardy varieties such as Grimm and Cossack seed cer - tification may be desirable. There is much work yet to be done along the line of alfalfa seed production studies in Nebraska. Should federal legis - lation requiring the staining of imported clover and alfalfa seed be passed, this would stimulate the demand for Nebraska seed. verage 'rice 'er 100 Pounds Paid Growers for Alfalfa Seed — 1918-1922 itate or State Subdivision 1918 1919 1920 1921 j 1922 | Av. lontana $17.50 $26.00 $17.00 \ $17.85 $21.05 j $19.88 louthern Arizona 17.00 35.50 '. 17.00 | 14.35 15.50 i 1937 iouth Dakota 16.75 31.45; 18.75' 13.20 j 17.00 19.43 Northern Utah 16.75 33.50 16.00; 11.75 i 15.50 18.70 Jalifornia 15.50 30.00 15.90 . 14.00 14.75 18.03 iouthern Idaho 16.50 31.65 11.80 ; 12.00 14.95 j 17.38 Vestern Texas 14.50 23.50 20.65 1 14.75 ! 13.10 17.39 Nebraska _ 14.25 26.00 15.20 i 10.10 1 13.90 16.01 louthwestern Kansas 13.70 26.60 14.70 11.35 i 12.90 15.85 Jorthwestern Kansas 13.20 26.75 14.25 10.65 j 12.10 , 15.39 </seg>

            <seg id="p335">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 335 ANNUAL BUSINESS MEETING OF THE NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS ASSOCIATION January 6, 1926 Meeting called to order by President Danly. The minutes of the last meeting were read and approved. The treasurer's report, a copy of which is printed in this report, was read and approved. It was moved, seconded and carried that a committee of two repre - sentatives who are familiar and in close touch with, the International Grain and Hay Show be appointed to use their best efforts to bring about improvements along the line of having a Nebraska representative on the Committee of Judges at the International Show. The President appointed Messrs. Grau and Kiesselbach on this committee. The election of officers was taken up which resulted as follows: President — W. W. Magee, Bennington. Secretary-Treasurer — P. H. Stewart, Agricultural College. Vice-President, First District — B. Wolph, Nehawka. Vice-President, Second District — W. Lonergan, Florence. Vice-President, Third District— C. Y. Thompson, West Point. Vice-President, Fourth District — J. D. Hasik, David City. Vice-President, Fifth District — Cecil Crowell, Red Cloud. Vice-President, Sixth District — J. D. Ream, Broken Bow. PROFESSOR GOODDING: Last year our department sent a judging team to the International Hay and Grain Show. We deem this a good thing, and would like to send a team this year, but we would like to have some money to pay the expenses of such a team. This judging work answers a purpose, because of the fact that it is largely the identification of weed seeds, crop varieties and grading by the United States standards, along with some judging. The judging of corn, threshed wheat, oats, and so on is only a part of the contest. These boys, of course, are taken from the best students through competition. Another part of the contest is the identification of many different kinds of weeds and different plant dis - eases. The boys must identify these diseases and tell what crops they attack and in what portion of the United States they are found. It broadens one's view in crop work. Last year every boy who made that team was working his way through school. I might say that the Ne - braska Livestock Improvers Association, an organization which parallels the Crop Growers Association, puts up $25 for each man on the live - stock judging team and we would like very much if a like amount could be given the members of our crop judging team. The expense is $50 or $60, and we felt if we could get $25 to help defray the expenses it would probably stimulate more interest because most of these boys are pretty hard pressed for finances. On motion it was voted that the Secretary draw on the funds of the Association the amount of $25 for each of four men, a total of $100 to defray a portion of the expenses of this team. The business session then adjourned. Signed, P. H. STEWART, Secretary-Treasurer. </seg>

Since the President is absent and the Vice-President has also been unable to be here it is going to be necessary for the meeting to appoint someone to fill this vacancy. Before the meeting proceeds further I will take the chair and entertain a motion to select someone to fill the position as presiding officer of this meeting. </seg>
            <seg id="p361">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 361 The names of A. L. Haecker and E. W. Frost are presented from the floor, but the name of Mr. E. W. Frost was withdrawn. BY MR. LAWRITSON: Those in favor of the selection of Professor Haecker will say "aye." Selection made unanimously. BY PROFESSOR HAECKER: Gentlemen, I thank you for the compliment and I will try to fulfill this duty this afternoon. There is a fair attendance here at the open - ing of this meeting of the State Dairymen's Association this afternoon and there will probably be more come in later. If the regularly chosen President has prepared an annual address it will probably be forwarded later. It is unfortunate that our President, Mr. Gutzmer has not been able to be with us today. This association of ours for many years, since 1885, I believe, has followed a custom every year of selecting as President, not only one who has performed notable service for the dairying interests of this great State but has also complimented and recognized the service, that particular service of dairying or in any line of dairying and when Mr. Gutzmer was selected I believe it was partly on account of his own service but no doubt in part in recognition of that of his wife, because Mrs. Gutzmer, I believe was as well posted a woman on breeding of fine cattle as any woman I have ever met. Of course we had hoped that he would be here today we are sorry that circumstances have arisen that kept him away. I cannot give Mr. Gutzmer' s address there may be some things that I can say in this hurried moment that will be of some interest to this association. As I remarked, since this association has been functioning, since way back in the winter of 1885, we have pub - lished annual reports, with the exception I think of one year, and these reports are now a real history, such as we have of this great dairy in - dustry of Nebraska. It may be of interest to you that I am now trying to compile a volume covering the last years of the Dairy Industry of this State. I find that I must go constantly to these State Association reports for facts and figures and items of interest relating to the business. But even before the reports were published there were some things of in - terest that I am trying to get hold of and I want to secure such data, and if any of you have anything of interest in the way of facts, figures or data, concerning the breeding of pure-bred cattle forty, or fifty years •go, I wish you would send it to me because I wish sometime before I die to complete a volume which will bring up to date the history of this great industry in Nebraska from its beginning and then probably at some future date, perhaps fifty years from now, someone as foolish as I will attempt to bring this matter down, to that period. I just mentioned that at this time thinking that some of you may have material that will add to this work something of interest. </seg>
            <seg id="p362">362 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Now we will just talk a moment about the Dairy business this year. Gentlemen, I believe we have experienced one of the best years that we have ever seen in Nebraska for Dairy farming. I don't know as I could prove this. It may be somewhat exaggerated but it is my best guess, of course, but I sincerely believe that is true. Thirty years ago this fall I came to your State, brought here by the Board of Regents and the President of your University, and Chancellor McClain to found and establish a dairy department and to help set a school at the College of Agriculture. I think it was in September of 1896 that I came here, and brought together the first few cows so I have had an opportunity to see the growth of the Dairy business of Nebraska, and a real oppor - tunity to look at the mile-posts as we have gone along, and to take stock of what we have actually accomplished. I want to say that we are gaining very rapidly and we are making splendid progress. There is nothing that has occurred for many years that has given me as much joy as the splendid co-operative work of all of our institutions during this present year. When I think of those splendid railroad trains, the Dairy trains of these two big roads, that went clear across Ne - braska and spread information regarding what the modern Dairy in - dustry is doing and so encouraged the business, and when 1 think of the work of our Dairy Development association, and this State Associa - tion which is doing such a great work for agriculture, and then our other organization such as Cow Testing Associations all working with the State Department, and the County Agent, the press and the busi - ness men, bankers and others who are assisting in the upbuilding of this business, it makes us feel that we are really doing something worth while. We are working together and not apart, and working in a con - structive way, as we ought to do as sensible men. We have accomplished some fine results. I trust that everyone who is present here today will be here and persuade others to turn out to - morrow when the Dairy Development Society have their annual meeting in this room so that we may hear the reports of what this Dairy De - velopment Society has been doing and what they have accomplished. (Announcement was then made that the Ayrshire Cattle-men will meet in Professor Davis' office Thursday noon). (Announcement was made that the Holstein-Friesien cattle breed - ers will meet at 12 o'clock Thursday noon in Room 204 of the Dairy Building). (Mr. Holcomb then announces that the Jersey Breeders will meet in Room 206, Thursday noon). (Announcement is then made that the Guernsey Breeders will meet Thursday noon in the Library, Room 207, Dairy Building). BY MR. HAECKER: There being no other announcements to be presented at this time, the Convention will now hear the report of Secretary Lawritson. </seg>
            <seg id="p363">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 363 BY MR. LAWRITSON: In making my report this afternoon I have summarized some of the principal activities of this association during the past year and will now present this report to you. SECRETARY'S REPORT Mr. President and Members of the Nebraska Dairymen's Association: Your association has been doing everything possible during the past year to further the interests of dairying throughout the State. One of the most outstanding activities in which the Nebraska Dairymen's As - sociation cooperated was the Boys and Girls Calf Club Special Train operated by the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific Railroad in cooperation with the Nebraska Dairy - men's Association, the Nebraska Dairy Development Society, the Ex - tension Service of the College of Agriculture, various breed associations, and local committees in 22 towns and communities organized 22 Dairy Calf Clubs and furnished each club with a high class purbred bull. The Nebraska Dairymen's Association furnished the exhibits for the train which brought out the value of proper methods of feeding and caring for dairy cattle. They emphasized the importance of a balanced ration, proper shelter, weeding out the boarder cows by the means of the milk scale and the Babcock test. The importance of a good sire in building up a herd of dairy cattle was also brought out by an exhibit showing that a scrub sire would never improve a herd, but a purebred sire might in many cases improve a herd as much as fifty per cent in the first generation. We have put forth an effort in creating a demand for milk and other dairy products by educating the consumers as to their value. A great many people consider milk just a drink, or to use as cream in coffee, etc., not realizing that it has great food value; in fact, it is the greatest food we have. There is no other food known to science that can take the place of milk. The past few years have seen a great awakening in this respect. The schools in the larger cities, as well as in the smaller towns, are teaching its food value, and are giving milk to undernourished children which is proving a great success. In addition we prepared and sent out over the State a number of picture panels showing the advantage of proper feeding and manage - ment of Dairy cows, weeding out the unprofitable cows, breeding up the herd through the use of a good purebred sire, suggesting methods of improving the quality of dairy products. Professor E. O. Anderson and Prof. H. P. Davis deserve a great deal of credit for their splendid work in preparing these panels. In addition to these exhibits the "Me - chanical Cow" exhibit which shows the various ways of using milk; the "Wheel of Health" and the "Health Builders" exhibits showing the value of dairy products as a food were sent out over the state. We feel that these exhibits have been worth while and have been a greater factor in improving dairy conditions and creating a demand for more dairy </seg>
            <seg id="p364">364 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture products. The more dairy products that are consumed, the greater will be the demand; and the greater the demand, the higher the price. There is yet a great deal of work to be done along these lines and we need the cooperation of every person in the state who is interested in the development of the dairy industry. One way in which you can all help is to use more dairy products. I should like to have each member of this association consider himself a committee of one to see that his neighbors, as well as himself, use butter and not any of the so-called substitutes; butter contains vitamines that are essential to health, vigor and growth. Eat only butter. Accept no substitutes. In this way we can benefit every dairyman as well as ourselves. The manufacturers of the various butter substitutes are spending millions of dollars to put their products before the people while we as dairymen are doing comparatively little to advertise our dairy products. A recent investigation shows that there are enough butter substitutes being consumed in the State to replace the production of 56,000 average Nebraska dairy cows, which represents the dairying on 14,000 Nebraska farms. If everyone of you will start a campaign to use only butter and no substitutes you will be surprised what effect it will have in the way of improving your health and at the same time increase the profit* in the dairy industry. There is however one thing we must keep in mind and that is im - proving the quality of our dairy products. If we are going to try to create a greater demand for dairy products we must place a good quality product upon the market. This can best be brought about by the United efforts of the producer and the manufacturer to put out a product of high quality. The producer should cooperate by delivering a good quality product to the manufacturer who in turn should put forth every effort to place a high class product on the market. When the time comes that we can all cooperate in this way we will not only be pro - ducing the most butter of any state in the Union, but we will also on account of the superior quality of our product, be receiving the moat money of any state for our products. Our association had its usual display at the State Fair, and it was bigger and better than ever. The exhibits consisted of panels and pic - tures which showed the importance of having better cows, better cared for, mated with high class pure bred sires, the importance of producing a good clean product, the food value of dairy products, etc., all of which are factors in making dairying more profitable. A great deal of credit tdue Professor E. O. Anderson, Professor H. P. Davis and Professor K. Crowe who planned and arranged the exhibits. Your association is doing as much as possible to encourage Dairy Calf Club work among the boys and girls in the State. This year we presented medals to the boy or girl in each county who was the champion in Dairy Calf Club work in that county. During the past year a great deal of work has been done along dairy improvement lines, but this coming year we want to do even </seg>
            <seg id="p365">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 365 more; and we want the cooperation and help of everyone who is in - terested in dairying, for without your help and support it is difficult to accomplish as much as we should. There is no reason why Nebraska should not become one of the leading dairy states. We can produce an abundance of roughage and feeds, which along with a favorable climate make the ideal conditions for profitable milk production, that is, providing we have the proper kind of cows to work with. However in spite of the natural adaptability of the state to dairying, and the advancement made during the past years, there is still room for improvement. We need to improve the quality of the dairy farmers in the state as well as the quality of cows. In closing I just want to relate an incident that occurred not long ago. Sometime ago a woman wrote in to one of our great educational institutions and said that everytime her husband went to drive a nail he would hit his thumb with a hammer, and what should she do about it. The answer came back, "Tell your husband to get both hands on the handle." Now that is what we want to do today. Let's get both hands on the handle and make this association a real factor in develop - ing the dairy industry in Nebraska. The new working arrangement of the state affairs, puts the various allied organizations under the charge of the State Board of Agriculture. They have the authority to distribute the appropriations, as they think best, and all bills incurred are turned over to them and they pay same, so there is no treasurer's report to make only as outlined. They also have charge of printing our year books. They very kindly consented to have printed for the Dairyman a year book as usual. They print and bind all reports in book form so by their kindness we are able to furnish you the individual reports as usual. I am herewith submitting a report of expenditures during 1925. FINANCIAL STATEMENT, 1925 (Motion is made that the report be accepted, placed on file and published in the proceedings of this association) BY MR.

            <seg id="p366">366 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture that this report be accepted, filed and published. All in favor say "Aye." (Ayes all). BY CHAIRMAN HAECKER: We will next proceed to the appointment of some Committees. The Chairman has been making some study and inquiry for names suggested, and will make the following appointment: NOMINATING COMMITTEE— Prof. H. P. Davis, E. W. Frost, W. F. Holcomb. To serve upon the RESOLUTIONS COMMITTEE— Prof. Morgan, O. H. Liebers, H. C. Young. To serve as an AUDITING COMMITTEE-^Prof. Flack, Prof. Morse, Will Doubt. BY CHAIRMAN HAECKER: I think Gentleman that we ought to have at this time a Committee appointed to draw up a suitable resolution regarding the death of our old-time member and good Friend, Mr. J. K. Honeywell, who was taken from us within this past week. There is inscribed upon this gavel, which I am using, the names of all of the Presidents of this Association since 1885. His name is here. I think he has been a member in good standing in this association ever since its beginning some forty years ago. He was one of the first men in this State to take a live interest in the improvement of dairy cattle. I remember when I first came here thirty years ago that I always found Mr. Honeywell laboring hard and gener - ous in his wise counsel, and always ready to give service. One of the first men I think to bring improved Jersey Cattle into Nebraska was Mr. Honeywell and he also brought in some of the earliest Berkshire Swine for breeding purposes. Now that he has passed away I suggest that the least we can do is to recognize his service. BY MR. E. W. FROST: The association took some action this morning by sending flowers out to the home in the name of the State Dairymen's Association, but I move also that a Resolutions Committee be appointed. Motion seconded. Motion put to a vote and carried unanimously. BY PROFESSOR HAECKER: The Committee will now meet so that we can expedite the business of the association. Now we come to the next number on the program, when we will present Professor E. L. Anthony of West Virginia. He has just re - turned from a year of study of the Dairy Industry and Agricultural conditions in Europe. BY PROFESSOR ERNEST L. ANTHONY (West Virginia) Mr. Chairman, you have mentioned the fact that I am from West Virginia. But I want to make one little additional note; that is the </seg>
            <seg id="p367">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 367 fact that I was born and raised in Nebraska so that I feel at home. I was raised in Custer County, and though I haven't been back for quite awhile, it already seems like home to me. There are a few points that I am going to discuss with you this afternoon and then later I am going to use a few slides that will perhaps better illustrate to you some con - ditions in Europe. First I just want to draw a little map. This will be a rather crude map. But it will show that the Dairy Development in Europe which is very, very old, something like 2000 years old has passed through cycles and development very much the same as we will meet in this Country. But this map will also show that this develop - ment has largely been within a circle of 1000 miles across. It is a small circle, not so very big and you will notice as I draw this map that it takes in part of England, some of Scotland, some of France, Holland, Denmark, Sweden and Northwest Germany, the main dairy sec - tions of Europe. On going through these sections one finds very old fashioned barns, that were built sometimes two hundred years ago and very old-fashioned appliances, used for the care of their stock and there is a very noticeable lack of labor-saving devices. After one has observed these conditions there is a tendency to come back home and think right away that there is nothing new to be done here in extending the dairy business, and that if there is anything new to learn about the dairy business one can learn it at home. One im - mediately feels sort of stuck up and gets rather chesty about our own development. When it comes to some of the points on the develop - ment of machinery and certain development of labor saving de - vices and from the standpoint of a development of housing establish - ment and appliances we are much ahead of the European Dairy districts. There is no question about that at all. But I am going to go a little bit further back into this thing this afternoon. I am going back into things that are very vital to us. For instance, the question of economy of production, what it costs to produce a pound of butter-fat, or to pro - duce one hundred pounds of milk or one hundred pounds of cheese. We have a lot to learn from the European people upon points of economy of production. There is no question but what they are producing more economically than we are. They can not compete with us in some things but they can do so in that phase. One of the things that struck me rather forcibly and that we have been trying to do with a limited ex - penditure of money is to reach this goal. Even with our large amount of labor saving devices and the other things that we have tried we are not as successful proportionately as they are in this phase. Sometimes I think if you place an excess amount of machinery or equipment in the hands of a man who doesn't know how to use it you may simply add to his burden. If he has such equipment but does not have the ability to use it he is perhaps no better off than one who does not have so much equipment. We are often in the habit of looking upon the older settled sections of the world in a rather deprecating way. We sometimes think they are slow and old fashioned and that they have nothing to show us that </seg>
            <seg id="p368">368 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture we cannot equal or better them here in America. With regard to many phases of farming this is true. It is no less true with reference to many phases of the dairy industry. When we go into some old fashioned poorly lighted, and poorly ven - tilated stables, which abound in many sections of Europe, and see the rather unhandy arrangements and absence of labor saving devices, so common to every real dairy farmer here in the United States, we are very apt to decide at once that we could show our European brothers a few things about the dairy business. When in addition we follow the milk from the dairy farm to the city consumer and the old fashioned, unhandy, and often unsanitary way in which so much of it is handled, we are more sure than ever that all the new things about the dairy business can be learned here at home. I think that there is no question but that from the standpoint of modern equipment, accessories, sanitary features, etc., that we are far ahead of the rank and file of European dairymen. We have developed all the refinements of our pres - ent great commercial business without also keeping apace with it our basic factor, the economy of production. However, self-satisfied we may be with our advanced methods of handling when we begin to inquire into the economy of production, and the methods of breeding and herd development we begin at once to ap - preciate the results that the European breeders are securing and to realize that in these things they have indeed real lessons for us. They have already developed practices in herd management and breeding which in the end we must adopt in a greater or less degree if we are to continue to move forward in this, our basic side of real permanent dairy progress and improvement. It is not possible in the limits of this paper to go into greater de - tails with regard to the feeding and management other than with refer - ence to breed and herd improvement progress which the dairymen in Europe are now advancing so rapidly. It is general knowledge, I believe, that the registration systems in Europe are much different from ours. While cattle in a given section are more generally of one special breed, the exactness of pure breeding is not nearly so closely followed as with us. I think it is a generally accepted opinion that our present system of cattle registry here in the United States is fundamentally unsound in its basic principle, that just because the sire and dam of a calf may be pure bred and registered, that it follows that the calf is automatically fitted and qualified also to be registered and worthy to be used for breed development. Such a system continues in ever increasing numbers to propogate and carry on undesirable animals and lessen the value of the registration of all animals. Such a system as we now practice with our breeds is genetically unsound and one of the greatest drags to breed improvement that it is possible for us to practice. This practice is daily becoming worse. As we start new breeders into the dairy business and into improving their herds with purebreds, unless they have very wise </seg>
            <seg id="p369">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 369 guidance and consul it is natural that they will be fitted out with the cheaper pure-bred cattle from purebred herds, which in the majority of cases are really cull pure breds and should in reality have been culled out and not be allowed to be used for breeding purposes. New breeders saddled with such a handicap, as we see them being constantly saddled with, are indeed to be pitied. Our present system of registry and dis - emination of pure-bred cattle fosters this practice. In Europe such a system could not be developed. In Denmark, Holland and Scotland, which are the most progressive dairy cattle sections and in most other cattle sections of Europe there is practically a much more rational system of cattle registry. The Dan - ish system, which I think one of the most rational, fairly well typifies the rest and is a system which we can well study. In brief, only animals may be registered in the Red Danish Herd Books, or Jutland Black and White Herd Books, if they come from dams with certain known production records. These animals for whom registry is sought cannot be registered even if from satisfactory producing an - cestry, unless they themselves are of satisfactory type and conforma - tion. This practice, together with certain other agencies has brought about and developed in seventy-five years time a new breed of cattle in the Red Danish breed, of whose remarkable high average production and fixation of type is a marvel in the history of dairy cattle develop - ment and could well be the envy of any of our best breeds in America today. The European dairymen are also much ahead of us in the rational development and use of records. Their whole record system has been developed to benefit the mass rather than the individual. The whole idea of the purpose of a record is different with them than with us. The idea of a record being fraudulently made is not in their conception. Their control work is not developed on the basis of authentacy, but on the basis of locating undesirable cows. Records are naturally honest. There is no purpose in being dishonest. They have not developed their record work on the idea of singling out a few high producing animals for the purpose of animal, herd of family line exploitation, but have developed them on the basis of eliminating the unprofitable cow and also eliminating them from the animals which are selected for herd and breed development. The whole idea of record work is to raise the aver - age for the herd unit and in turn the breed, not by spotting occasional high producing cows, but by quickly spotting out the low and undesirable producers. The European breeder cannot point out to you any world's record cows or class leaders for some seventy-five different classes, but they can point out with pride their whole herd average — not only for one year but more often for a five, ten or fifteen year period. They can and do point to their district average, their county average and their aver - age for the whole land, which is well above the line of unprofitable pro - duction. The European cattle breeders are using their records for the </seg>
            <seg id="p370">370 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture real purpose and justification of records, the spotting out of undesirable cows and breed improvement. Cow testing association records are the basis for all record work in Denmark, Holland and Scotland. There are no separate systems of Advanced Registry as we have here. In Denmark there is now a total of approximately 1,275,000 cows in milk. In 1923 approximately one-fourth or 25% of all the cows in Den - mark were under control in cow testing association. (In the dairy sec - tions this runs as high as 50%). This would give, allowing one calf per cow per year and 50% of these bulls, approximately 150,000 bull calves each year from tested dams. There are a total of 63,000 bulls over one year of age in service in Denmark. Allowing the use of a bull for four years each there is an estimated bull replacement each year of some 15,000 head. With the 150,000 bull calves born each year and still keep every breeding bull in Denmark a bull from a tested and selected dam. Contrast this with the herd sire or bull situation in the United States, without occasional tested cow and see who has a rational breed im - provement plan. What can be said of Denmark in this regard can be said also of Holland and Scotland. In Scotland more than 50% of the Ayrshire herds are in the test association under a herd test plan. With their present attitude towards testing and the purpose and use of records, the Danish and Holland breeders can follow very closely all blood lines and quickly spot out those lines that are bringing about improvement and use these to the best of advantage and also to eliminate those which are showing a detrimental influence on the breed. In a random selection of the records of fifty living Danish bulls, most of them in use in Bull Associations, the following figures showing the in - fluence of these bulls were secured: Fifty bulls — 862 daughters average 8997 pounds milk, 4.08% fat, 369 pounds butter. 826 dams same age average 7814 pounds milk, 3.83% fat, 330 pounds butter. It must be borne in mind that this information was available to the breeders using these bulls. The cattle breeding societies each year compile information on countless numbers of bulls and the breeders are making the great use of this information. Every new bull is carefully watched and his daughters production quickly tabulated against the dams records to see whether he is a desirable bull to use or not. The whole attention of the breeders, breed associations and workers is cen - tered on using every agency which will help to improve the average rather than to produce the phenomenal. They have found out as we must in time find out, that after all it is not the occasional phenom - inal cow or successful breeder who makes the dairy business a profitable and successful thing, but rather the development of the average by the constant and consistent elimination of the undesirable and unprofitable to where it brings a profit and benefit to all. The feeding of dairy cattle in Europe is considerably different than </seg>
            <seg id="p371">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 371 in the United States and is well worth of study by our dairymen. It is true of course that much of the difference in their practice and ours is naturally due to their peculiar or natural conditions as is true of our feeding practices here, but some of their methods have lessons for us. In all of northern Europe, such as Scotland, England, Denmark and Holland, the greatest possible use is made of pastures. In the develop - ment of good pastures they greatly exceed us. We do not know what is meant by good pastures nor do we in any way appreciate their value or importance in a right system of dairy farming. I am certain that we will in the future pay much more attention to the proper handling, development and use of pastures than we are now doing. Pastures in Europe naturally are good due to an especially favorable climate and is almost the sole source of nutrients for dairy cattle during the grass season. In Denmark as well as most of Europe the cows are tethered out each day by a short chain or rope and allowed access only to such grass as they can consume each day. In this way the feeding from pastures is carefully rotated throughout the Summer, the cows being moved across the field as it is used, the grass growing up in a few days and the rota - tion repeated. In thisway the manure is directly applied to the land from which the food came. The cows do not destroy by tramping four bites of grass for every one eaten, and it is possible to carry from three to ten times as many cows per acre per Summer as we do here in the United States. To better understand the high value of pastures it might be stated that land that rents for from Twenty-five ($25.00) to Forty Dollars ($40.00) per acre is used for pasture only, such of it not having been plowed for more than 100 years. This is also true in Den - mark and England. A great use is made of roots in dairy cattle feeding in Europe. In Denmark nearly 15% of the cultivated land is used for root production. Roots constitute one of the main sources of nutrients for dairy cows. Roots are easily digested, are very succulent and favorable to milk pro - duction and are used in much the same degree and manner that we use silage here. It is not uncommon to see whole herds of dairy cattle in Scotland, England and Denmark fed as high as 80-100 pounds of roots per cow per day for the whole Winter. I feel certain that in general we do not pay enough attention to supplying our dairy cows here with sufficient wet and succulent feeds for the most satisfactory production. In the feeding of concentrated feeds we far surpass Europe. But perhaps we have gone too far. Concentrates are in general high in price and scarce, and cows in Europe make the most of their production on roughages rather than concentrates. In fact, in most herds it is only the very heavy producers that get any grain and then in much less amounts than is generally practiced here in our feeding. For this reason especially high records are never made in Europe, in fact, it is certain that they have much better high producing cows in their herds than are known, due to the fact that they never push the individual with </seg>
            <seg id="p372">372 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture heavy concentrated grain feeding. It was my observation, however, that cows stay in their herds to much older ages, and that graget, indigestion and troubles of this sort are much less frequent there than here. Such concentrated feeds as they use are very carefully mixed with great re - gard to the nutritive values and needs. It is a rare case indeed to find any farmer who does not know how or is not using a properly blended ration. They universally call their mixed concentrated feed "Cakes." These "cakes" are usually made up of barley, rye, oats and wheat by-products such as middlings and bran. Also some imported corn or maize meal and a mixture of protein "cakes" such as cottonseed, linseed, rape seeds, sunflower seed, seasamine, and cocoanut cake. These cakes vary in their balance, but due to the relatively low protein content of the roughages used, such as straw hay and roots, these cake mixtures run fairly high in protein, being from 24 to 35 crude protein. It is doubtful even here in the United States with our cheap con - centrated feeds, if there is any extra profit or real economy in pushing out cows for extreme production. It is possible that the law of diminish - ing returns set to work an all production above 600 pounds fat. That is all fat produced by a cow above 600 pounds per year costs more in extra feed and labor than it is worth, outside of its possible question - able value in breeding work. Our European cousins seemed to have sensed it and while they do not express it just as we do, it is certain that they all unconsciously feel it as is shown by their unified efforts and interests in raising the production of every cow to between the 350 - 500 pound yearly production. They do not seem to care for extreme high production but are dead set aganst the low producers. In the matter of disease control unfortunately for them they have made many sad mistakes and failures which should serve as admirable lessons for us in our own efforts in disease control and eradication. It is true that the dairy sections of Europe are much older than our dairy development and that much of it is also very intensive and also that many diseases had secured a very high development and sure foothold before much of our present information for eradication and control was available to them. But it is also equally true that through lack of foresight and misdirection of effort many failures have resulted. Tuberculosis has such a strong hold on nearly every dairy section of Europe that the eradication, even reasonable control looks very doubt - ful. In Denmark where the most comprehensive work has been done the disease has been reduced from 40% to about 27%. Such a high percent is about what we have here in our most effected sections. In Germany the percent of tuberculin cattle runs about 50%. It seems to have been steadily increasing and for the reason that the methods and measures of eradication and control have been allowed to become hope - lessly bound up in red tape and technicalities. Breeders and owners have been led to believe that the burden of eradication, control and losses is a government problem, and that they do not have any respon - sibility in the matter. The biggest lesson this has for us is that dis- </seg>
            <seg id="p373">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 373 ease control and eradication is primarily a farmers and breeders problem and responsibility, that the burden is first of all his, and the benefits also first of all his and that he must be the aggressive leader and co - operator in this work, looking to state and government officials and agencies only for such assistance as' may come from the technical service of trained men, and the development of such regulations and interstate shipping regulations which will aid him in his work. I am thoroughly convinced that we are fortunate to be so well started on the control and eradication of tuberculosis while we still have so little of it, and that what we need is more efficiently trained men in the field with more money, both state and federal, available for the employment of properly trained men- and the availability of supplies, and less talk about money for indemnities and pay for diseased cattle. We can well afford to lend the fullest cooperation and to use all the money now available to push testing with no thought of indemnities rather than to allow ourselves to get in the shape the vast majority of Europe is in today with refer - ence to tuberculosis eradication. We have a chance at least at control, if not eventually complete eradication, while they are far past the pos - sibility of a chance at either. There is much tuberculosis in Scotland, England and Holland as well as the countries already mentioned. Abortion is more prevalent in Europe in the dairy sections than here with the same haphazard methods of cure or control that we use here. It is a little understood disease everywhere. Blood tests, isola - tion of reactors and sanitation are the methods in use that are showing to be of some value. Denmark is much ahead in an understanding of this disease and in the active effort at handling it. Dr. Bang, well known in the United States for his early work on abortion, is still the active leader in this work in Denmark and is a man who is idolized by the Danish dairymen for his help to them. Here is one instance where the old proverb, "a prophet is without honor in his own country," is not true. Foot and mouth disease is always present in Holland and Germany and very frequent in Denmark. It is also a frequent visitor to England. In Holland and Germany they do not seem to have the great fear of it as we do here, and only the most meagre methods of control seem to be in force. However, after spending a year among- foot and mouth in - fected herds in Germany, Holland, Denmark, and England, I am certain that the toll it takes through sick cattle, loss of flesh and lessened pro - duction is indeed and almost uncalculatable one and that we have fol - lowed absolutely the right measures in the United States by sparing no effort or money to stamp it out each time it came in our country. I feel sure that we should even be better prepared both with regulations, money and men to be ready to eradicate the first signs of this terrible cattle plague and that any one who fails to give his fullest cooperation or hinders in any way in this control or eradication should be publicly branded as a traitor to his country, and dealt with as such. In closing, I would like to say that there are many more and better qualified veterinarians in the dairy sections of Europe than we have here. </seg>
            <seg id="p374">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 374 There, an animal doctor is not looked upon as a "Hoss Doctor" as we look with more or less contempt and lack of sympathy here, but has a standing equal to the medical doctor in his community. Their veterinary colleges in Denmark, Germany and, Sweden are wonderful institutions filled with students that could well be the envy of ourselves here in the United States. We must have more and better trained men here held in the same respect as they are held in Europe, if we are to push to the fullest our problems of disease eradication. We must as a mass realize that disease control and eradication is first and foremost the problem of the dairyman and breeder himself, that in the end he is the one who benefits most by it, and that further, now is none too soon to get started. A penny's worth of effort and expense now while our cattle breeding industry is young and relatively free from disease will be worth thousands of dollars a generation from now, if we allow disease to go uncontrolled or irrationally handled as they have in Europe.

(At the conclusion of Professor Anthony's address about four or five inquiries and questions were propounded which Professor Anthony answered). BY PROFESSOR HAECKER: The next number that we have to come before us will be given by W. W. FITZPATRICK, field representative, American Guernsey Cattle Club. We took great pleasure a few moments ago in viewing the pic - tures shown by Professor Anthony of the Isle of Guernsey. Now we have with us a man who represents that breed of cattle and I was very greatly delighted as I came to know him when we had him with us on the dairy train. So some of you have met him before. We ap - preciated so much his association then and the service he gave us on that train that we thought we would like to have him come back and talk to us again. BY MR. FITZPATRICK: Mr. President, Gentlemen it is very kind of you folks to have me return. The little time that I spent in Nebraska this summer interested me very much and I am delighted to come here and talk again to Ne - braska farmers about dairying conditions in Nebraska upon this, only my second visit to Nebraska. The subject assigned me by Professor Davis, that of "What Is a Good Dairy Cow." I might say is a very broad subject. He told me that that was to be my subject and suggested that it was broad enough that he thought I might discuss almost any phase of Dairy Production that I risk and I am going to take advantage of that suggestion and I will not follow the subject very closely. My breed promotion work has been dairy sires. For the last three years I have been principally engaged in promoting the success of various bull campaigns, better sires trains, the formation of bull as - sociations, and the promotion of special sales of Guernsey bulls in car - load lots. In relation to the subject assigned me by Professor Davis, I think I can make an answer in one sentence that would be as effective as a lengthy discussion. A good dairy cow is one that makes for the owner a profit when the year's work has been summarized. I emphasize the Year's work because farmers are prone to speak of their cows largely by what they have done in one day or in thirty days, and in my opinion such short time records are of little value. In comparing the records of the highest producing Guernsey cowa we find that oftentimes the last three months fat production is greater than that of the first three months of the year's records. Invariably these cows are the most profit - able when the cost of production is figured against the price received for the product. Sustained production throughout the lactation period is the most valuable requisite of any good dairy cow. </seg>
            <seg id="p376">376 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Prof. Anthony has in a very interesting way shown you pictures of European dairy cows and has discussed the dairy conditions found there. The interesting: fact brought out in the study of these conditions is that in spite of the fact that the records of individual cows in the United States are so much greater than the best records of the dairy cows of the leading European dairy sections, the average records of the cows kept by the European dairy farmers are so much better than ours. The question naturally arises, "What is the reason for this fact?" According to statistics, Nebraska, of all the states in the Union, is first in cattle per capita, and has the least illiteracy of any state in the United States. One would think that a state having high average in - telligence and leading in the cattle per capita would be a good dairy state . Yet these same statistics show that the average butter fat pro - duction of Nebraska cows is not over 150 pounds annually. For years the University of Nebraska has had one of the greatest herds of Hol - steins in America. These cattle have been bred and developed under average Nebraska conditions. This herd has undoubtedly had a good influence in raising the average of the production of the dairy cattle in Nebraska. Why, then does the average continue so low? Government figures reveal the fact that there are approximately 25,000,000 dairy cows in the United States of which less than 4% are pure bred. It is said that less than 10,000,000 of these cows are actually profitable. In order to understand why there are so many unprofitable dairy cows, we must go back to the origin of breeds of dairy cattle. In prehistoric times wild cattle roamed the plains like other wild animals, and the cow, like other animals, gave only sufficient milk to nourish the young for from four to six months, or until the calf reached the stage when it could pick up its own living. Cattle were first domesticated for use as draft animals. Later they began to be kept for their milk. Not so many years ago thoughtful farmers with vision began by careful selection and breeding to develop certain types of cattle for beef, and others for the production of milk and butter fat. This has been con - tined until we now have cows which instead of giving a half gallon or a gallon of milk daily for four to six months, will produce an average of four to ten gallons of milk daily for the full period of 365 days, and entire herds average 400 to 500 pounds of butter fat in a year. There have been three factors in bringing this about. First, breed - ers of wisdom and vision; second, better feeding methods; third, the use of good herd sires. All of these factors are probably of equal im - portance, but it is of the third that I wish to speak. Last year in my work I visited 535 farmers on their farms in a territory east of the Rocky Mountains. During the same period I visited and inspected the herds of over 100 of the leading Guernsey breeders in the United States. After an impartial observation of conditions on these farms of both average dairymen and of the best breeders, I was forced to one definite conclusion: The successful dairy farmer or breeder is </seg>
            <seg id="p377">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 377 in nearly every case one who has by good judgment or accident had the use of a good dairy herd sire. . This leads to the question, "What is a good bull?" My answer is that a good bull is one whose daughters show increased production and type over their dams. For the average farmer interested in the econ - omical production of milk or butter fat, a good bull may only increase the production, but for the real breeder who expects to contribute some - thing to the breed he has chosen and at the same time get the maximum profit for himself from the sale of breeding cattle, it is essential that the herd sire get daughters of both increased type and increased pro - duction. Even though a breeder may develop a herd of great production he will never secure the prices for the cattle he may have for sale unless he has uniform type in the herd. In order to get a good bull, American farmers must use more care in the selection of their herd sires. My work has convinced me that 90% of the dairy farmers actually wait until it is necessary for them to have a herd sire and then select one that can be purchased con - veniently and cheaply. They do not take into consideration that it took hundreds of years to develop the breeds of dairy cattle that we now have to their present high production records, but that in two or three genera - tions of careless haphazard selection of herd sires it is possible to reduct the dairy herd to the point where the cows will closely resemble their prehistoric ancestors. The following factors should be taken into con - sideration in the selection of a bull: First, he should be a pure bred bull; second, from a cow with an Advance Register record; third, he should have uniformly high producing 1 ancestry; fourth, if possible he should be line-bred; fifth, whenever possible the buyer should inspect the three nearest dams at least. The fact that a bull is pure-bred does not always mean that he is a good bull. However, a pure-bred bull may be reasonably expected to get daughters of higher production than a grade or scrub bull. For instance, in the Guernsey breed our records show that 21,000 Guernsey cows have made A. R. records averaging 9600 pounds of milk, and 480 pounds of butter fat in a year; or one cow out of every seven that has ever been registered in our club and has reached sufficient age, has made an A. R. record. This insures records fairly close up on a son of almost any registered Guernsey cow. In spite of this fact, I Tepeat that it is important to not only get a bull from a pure bred cow, but from a cow that has made a good year's record, and more important, to get a bull from a cow that not only has a good year's record but has in her pedigree a continuous line of producing ancestry. My only reason for suggesting a line-bred bull is that such a bull is more likely to transmit uniformity of type, which is as stated above, absolutely necessary to successful breeders and is also desirable even for average dairymen having cows for sale. Uniform cows even though they be grades, will bring more on the market. In no phase of this industry is the personal equation so important </seg>
            <seg id="p378">378 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture as in selecting a herd sire. Good dairymen believe that they can afford to pay for their herd sires one-fourth as much as they have invested in cows. Even though a dairyman or breeder be wise enough to put aside sufficient to purchase a good herd sire he sometimes falls in the hands of a breeder who has bulls for sale and does not care whether he is doing the buyer a service, but merely intent on disposing of his bulls at good prices. My advice to beginners oftentimes is to go to a breeder in whom they have full confidence and place in his hands the selection of their future herd sire, acting entirely upon his advice. If more beginners would do this they would probably get better herd sires. Of course in any such transaction it is necessary that they be well acquainted with the breeder from whom they are making their purchase. In the section of the South in which I live there is a story of a negro who sold another negro a mule. The buyer later returned to bis friend with the statement that the mule was blind. Upon being asked why he thought so, the buyer stated, "I turned him in the lot and he walked straight into a post." The seller replied, "Why, Nigger, that mule is not blind, he just don't give a damn." It would seem that the attitude of a great many farmers in the selection of their herd sires is the same as the negro said of the mule. When more attention is paid to the selection of the herd sires, the dairymen of America will have more profitable cows in their herds. As stated in the beginning, a good cow is one that makes a profit for her owner. Last Spring a California dairyman, who is engaged in the pro - duction of market milk from a large number of grade Guernsey cows, came East and purchased twenty-five registered Guernsey bulls for a total of $20,000.00. These bulls were of the best breeding and in every case backed by several generations of excellent records. Practically all of them were out of cows with A. R. Records of more than 600 pounds of butter fat. It is interesting to know that this dairyman has been using such bulls for years and that the net income from the sale of milk from his herd has averaged 36% for several years. When more dairy farmers have the courage and wisdom to select their herd sires in this manner, I believe we will have more successful dairy farmers and better satisfied dairymen. BY MR. HAECKER: We certainly are thankful to Mr. Fitzpatrick for the splendid pre - sentation he has made of this subject. Before we proceed to the business meeting, we are fortunate in having with us today Mr. L. W. Morley, who comes here as a repre - sentative of the Extension Service of the American Jersey Cattle Club. He represents the Jersey breeders just as much as Fitzpatrick repre - sents the Guernsey breeders. We find all of these men representing a much bigger production plan than just their one breed. They represent the good dairying conditions and the development of good dairy cows </seg>
            <seg id="p379">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 379 and they promote a lot of good to the industry. I will now introduce Mr. Morley. BY MR. MORLEY: Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I am very glad to be here this after - noon. I want to say that I have enjoyed every minute since I came upon this campus this afternoon, and particularly the program that has been rendered this afternoon. Eleven years ago when I first went to College there were two men there, one, Prof. H. P. Davis who gave me some of my first valuable information in dairying. He went from Penn State to Washington, D. C, and then out to this country. The other man was the first speaker this afternoon, Professor E. L. Anthony, whom you have heard this after - noon. He was a splendid speaker. Professor Anthony remained at Penn State longer than Mr. Davis but bears the reputation of being the only man who left there for whom a petition was presented that he be induced to stay. I thoroughly enjoyed those addresses and also that of Mr. Fitzpatrick. I travel around a good bit and I find him to be a good fellow. I take pleasure in bringing greetings to you from the American Jersey Cattle Club. The American Jersey Cattle Club in its extension course is very eager to work with other organizations to improve dairy - ing conditions in the State of Nebraska. We recognize that Nebraska is a great State but feel that it is going to be a greater dairying State. We know there are a whole lot of mighty good organizations working here, your State College, its extension service, your Dairy Development Association, this organization itself, and we know of other organizations that are doing good work in this State. Mr. Lee, our Extension Service Representative in this State will be working the coming year. We are very anxious to help you put the good dairying organizations across. That is what we are trying to do. Of course with other organizations and other people you are going to put over a very good program in Nebraska. They are really increasing the production of dairy cows, be - cause that is the only way that we can help the dairy farmer and this will help those farmers who demonstrate that they desire to attain that goal. I know that there is quite a little more ahead in the way of business to be transacted by this meeting and the hour is late so I will not take up more of your time but in closing will say again that I am mighty glad to have the opportunity of meeting some of you personally and bringing you greetings this afternoon from the American Jersey Cattle Club. (At this point an announcement was made of the Fun Feed to be held at 5:30 upon Wednesday afternoon, and then the business session was taken up).

On these rings are inscribed the names and dates of office of all of the men who have served as Presidents of this association since 1885. As I think I told you earlier in the day this old organization has been in the habit of choosing from year to year some person who has rendered special service to the in - dustry. I think it is the custom for the newly elected presiding officer to take charge of the meeting. </seg>
            <seg id="p383">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 383 President Morse, will you please step forward. In the way of in - troduction I want to say this about Professor Morse. He is one of the most enthusiastic Dairymen I have ever known. He is developing a wonderful herd out there at Curtis, in that new School of Agriculture. He is inspiring young men to go out and become cattle breeders and good dairymen and he is in a position where he can do this association a world of good, and I know that he will do it. BY PRESIDENT MORSE: It is only fair after having Professor Haecker tell you about the herd at Curtis to tell you just a little more about it that he has left unsaid. The School of Agriculture at Curtis was started in the Fall of 1913. At that time there were four dry cows sent out there. Two of those cows proved to be barren, two of them turned out to be wonder - ful breeders. Those four particular animals were picked by two men. The two cows that were picked by Professor Haecker are the Mothers of our herd. There has never been since that day a female introduced into the herd that has not been born on the place. Today every cow in the herd is of advanced registration. I believe this is true that it was the first herd, the property of the State, to become tuberculin free and fully accredited. We really think we have a great dairy herd at Curtis. The students who are attending there are really of an impressionable age and have this opportunity of studying a good dairy herd and the breed - ing of it, the feeding of it, the caring for it and the results obtained from it. I believe that they are becoming interested in it. That is just one reason why I think that they are becoming interested in it. In 1920, Holdrege, Nebraska, which is right on the high line down from Curtis, where there are a couple little creameries showed that the freight receipts at Holdrege upon the Burlington line from all sources were less, in those days of lavish inflation than the freight receipts of that station were in 1923 when people had begun to have to go to work upon just the cream receipts. In other words, the cream receipts in 1923 were greater than the total freight Teceipts from all sources in 1920. Today there is a cream car on that train that goes through Curtis every other day. It comes down that line loaded and I believe that speaks for itself. Our Banker Friends tell us that the very best customers are those who have the cream can. Now I am going to say that in accepting the reins of responsibility of this great organization I will give you of such talent as I have and do all we can in building up better conditions in dairying and better dairy cattle in Nebraska. (The meeting is adjourned). DAIRY CATTLE JUDGING CONTEST The largest judging contest yet held by the Nebraska Dairymen's Association was given at the Agricultural College during the week of </seg>
            <seg id="p384">384 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Organized Agriculture on Wednesday, January 6, 1926. The contest was in two divisions, one for dairy stock breeders, and the other for college and high school students. Eleven breeders and 100 students took part in the competition to determine the best judges. Professor E. L. Anthony, head of the Dairy Department of West Virginia acted as official judge. He pronounced the six classes of six animals each as a real workout, and, safe to say, all of the contestants found them likewise. Four of the rings were cows in milk and the other two were two-year old heifers. All of the stock were from the Univer - sity of Nebraska herd. After the contestants had made their placings. Prof. Anthony gave the official placing and reasons. The reasons gave many of the breeders and students valuable points on the interesting game of judging. The Dairymen's Association followed their usual custom of donating medals to the high judges. The medal is in the form of a minitare milk can with the map of Nebraska on it. The words "Dairymen's Associa - tion" are stamped across the map. On the reverse side is engraved the information regarding the winning of the medals. The first prize medal is of gold, second and third prize silver, and the remaining ones are bronze. There was unusually close competition in the contest. In the breed - ers division only 59 points out of a total of 600 separated the first and eleventh man. For the student there were only 41 points between the first and twenty-fifth man. </seg>

            <seg id="p391">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 391 Program opened by Hon. Charles Graff, President Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders Association, and was as follows: BY MR. GRAFF: We are now ready for a little program, which had been mapped out for us. I see many faces here of those who are accustomed to being present at Live Stock Breeders banquets. Perhaps I might say, to be honest with myself, I see some faces that have become almost too fa - miliar to be at these banquets. You fellows in the livestock breeding game have been reading articles within the last year or two, in fact, for the last three, four or five years about how conditions are improving. That things are getting better. That we are now over the hill, and so on. To be sure, many of them are over the hill alright, but most of us, yet, my friends, are hanging on. I would say to you tighten the belt up another notch; keep a tight grip, there must be a better day coming. Now before we proceed with the program planned for the eve - ning, I want to say that immediately following the banquet, the Annual meeting of the Live Stock Breeders Association will meet here in this room. The program will be somewhat shortened for that reason. The week of Organized Agriculture has become so full and running over with good things that it is difficult to edge in and find time to hold the business meetings of our various organizations, so don't forget that im - mediately after the conclusion of this program the Live Stock Breeders will meet over in the north part of this dining room to transact the business of the annual meeting. Now, there is just one very regretable thing about this banquet. It seems as though there is always something going wrong. The man - agement had gone about their work so very carefully and deliberately in order to see that things might go on at this banquet very efficiently and smoothly but in some way a little mistake was made. We are again to have to put up with Frank D. Tomsen as Toastmaster. To those of you who don't know Frank, and perhaps you are the people who are better off, I will say that when I first became acquainted with the man we would always find him around in some country home where there was lots to eat. It seems he finally found a position with the Breeder's Gazette and judging from some whisperings we heard about his experience there, it appears that he was more or less of a nuisance around the office and they sent him out in the country. He seemed to live a great deal in the country, and it seems even now he hasn't been able to get away from that manner of living. Just what that has had to do with it, I don't know but within the past year he has appro - priated a fine young farmer as a son-in-law in order to have one more place to go out in the country to forage around. He breaks out in print once in a while and the boys of course, know what a blow it would be to Frank if they did not recognize his writing once in awhile, so with one thing and another he keeps himself busy. Now, ladies and gentlemen I am sorry but I must ask you to be </seg>
            <seg id="p392">392 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture tolerant, and to put up with Frank Tomsen as toastmaster, it is too bad that we could not have a better toastmaster, and out of this won - derful body of people that we could not have one who could do this with some little dignity. Ladies and gentlemen it gives me much pain to introduce Frank Tomsen. BY MR. TOMSEN Let me explain to the gathering here that if I ever get to Heaven, if they do not have banquets there I am not going to feel just at home, I am not going to feel as I do here because I will miss Charley Graff. You know I have always been looking around for information. In that respect, Mr. Graff and I differ somewhat. I was looking through the Geographic the other day and I came upon some information that pleased me very much. This number of the Geographic was devoted almost entirely to Breeders of Cattle throughout the world and from ancient times down to the present. I read page after page taking up cattle in India and found amongst the cattle of those regions the Red Polled mentioned. Now the management of this program have concluded that it is impossible to carry it out in its proposed length as evidenced by the printed program and they have said that at least four of the number indicated on this program must be elminated. Now that is a rather difficult thing for me to do. But they said it must be done. But if we are to get out of here around 9 o'clock it must be done and how on earth am I going to eliminate these people, when they put them on here. They suggested that I might put it to a vote. There is a sug - gestion that Charlie Graff be not permitted to speak again; that H. J. Gramlich might as well be eliminated and we do not consume three minutes on his "Influences of Vitamines on Mineral Assimilation." Then it has been suggested that we can dispense with "Factors Which In - fluence the Water Content of Milk" by H. P. Davis. We know all about that anyway; then there is "Vitamines in Oleo" by A. L. Haecker, the man whose original idea it was that there be vitamines placed in oleo so it is suggested that he also be eliminated at this time. Now I want all who are in favor of the elimination of these speakers to hold up their hands, and if enthusiastic, hold up both hands. It seems to be unani - mous, so that is accomplished. I will say concerning all of the speakers who have just been eliminated, that they are all alright. At one of these Banquets we had the Extension Service of the University send us a man, whose name was Gaines, and he exploded on us and we almost never got him shut off. Tonight they have sent us a Boomer. He is a man con - nected with the problem of Co-operative Marketing. I don't know his real name but they have him listed as George Boomer. His son used to work in our office and seemed to be a pretty intelligent fellow. When I met Mr. Boomer here tonight, I can readily see where the boy gets his rather superior intelligence, and while I do not know Mrs. Boomer, I can see the boy has a very intelligent mother. Now let me introduce </seg>
            <seg id="p393">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 393 MR. GEORGE BOOMER, who will discuss the subject "CO-OPERATIVE MARKETING." BY MR. BOOMER: Now, when I was asked to say a few words on this program tonight, it was indicated that I should not say anything that was very serious. I am always glad to be present at a Breeders' banquet, because you are an optimistic bunch; you are people who look into the future with op - timism, and who never burn your bridges until you get to them. I believe that is a pretty good policy. Now, I believe in being optimistic, in looking into the future with all of the hope and enthusiasm that is possible. I believe it is a good thing that we should not go into it blindly. We should get all of the information. I believe that is one of the policies of the people who are represented here tonight. I heard a little bit of biography relative to Frank Tomsen some years ago. This was before I became personally acquainted with him and when he was still out making those perambulations that Mr. Graff spoke about this summer out in the state. He was in one of the small hotels early one morning this summer and probably had been out a little later than usual the night before or he had gotten up a little before his accustomed time, but in any event he went to sleep in a chair, which is what a great many people will do. Anyway he went to sleep, no matter what the cause was. A friend of his came down and saw him there and thought he would play a joke on Mr. Tomsen, so he got some limburger cheese and put a little on his moustache, for, by the way, Frank wore a moustache in those days. Then he stepped over to the desk and called for Mr. Tomsen or anyway got him woke up at that time. Then Mr. Tomsen took a sniff and started for the door. When he got out of the door he started to walk down the street, smelling in this direction and that direction as he went along. He went a block and started back and was still bothered by the scent and then someone asked him what was the matter and Mr. Tomsen said "The whole damned world stinks." Now I would say that the trouble wasn't with the world at all. The difficulty was that he was looking too far away for the trouble. That is a difficulty that we all often have. That when things do not work out the way we think they ought to, we look around to find somebody on whom we can place the blame. You know they say that the frog in this process of evolution was intended to be a canary, but it didn't re - sult that way. He hadn't the advantages to develop his tendency and the result is that he is still a frog. Now you might apply that to co - operative marketing, if we don't take advantage of our opportunities as they are offered. BY MR. TOMSEN: I have never fully understood Co-operative Marketing until this time. I trust that it is as clear in your minds as it is in mine. Now Mrs. Tomsen and I have lived in Iowa for some fifteen years. We tried </seg>
            <seg id="p394">394 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture to raise a family over there but had a great time trying to do it. Finally on account of the lack of co-operation we came over to Nebraska and since then we have lived in Nebraska. But since then they have put in a Child Welfare Bureau. In doing this they went ahead and put a married woman in charge of the work. Who ever heard of a married woman being put in charge of a Child Welfare Bureau instead of an old maid. This has been done and we can't disarrange the plans from which they are working as there are a great many angles to raising children. We found that out, in our own experience. Now I am going to take great pleasure in introducing to you Mrs. Mary Pardee Yontz, who comes over here from Iowa and will take such time as she may to discuss this question of child welfare. BY MRS. YONTZ: My original instructions were that I was to have but ten minutes to deliver what I have to say. Now, I can't resist telling you what I told Mr. Tomsen before the banquet began. He made a remark similar to the one that he just gave, about the maiden aunt who sits around and thinks that she knows how to bring up children and my only suggestion is that the maiden aunt is a target for a good many thrusts, largely because she is right so often. The reason that she is often right about the children she is able to look at the problems and troubles of those children from an impartial viewpoint while we will look at the children just as we see ourselves, just as if they are our property. Too often we fail to realize that they come into the world not of their own choosing. Too often we fail to realize they are not being given chances to develop in a way they would like or lead their lives as they would like to do. A great many people have come to me as I have been here in these two days. There was a gentleman whose face I do not see here who came up to me and said that if he had it to do over he would take some classes in his college work on child psychology, in the university. He said if I had known what I know now, for he is the father of three children, and after talking with him awhile I concluded that he was a pretty good father, but he still said if he had known then what he knows now he would have taken some classes about child life while in the university. The day is coming when there will be some classes about children and when we are going to study in our university courses about the kind of a child life that little children should lead. For almost before we realize it these children of ours are grown people. Now one of the reasons that we have these live stock banquets is that we are trying to make money to improve that industry. Now if we will just think it over one of the most important things in our lives are our children. It has taken too long, in fact it has taken all of these ages for us to realize that after all the little children do grow up into adults. It does make a difference how little children are treated, what kind of food they have, the amount of care and sleep they have and the nature of the habits that they learn. How they live while they are little children will </seg>
            <seg id="p395">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 395 make a difference in their adult life. Last summer we had some child life courses in the University of Iowa and in that division we had fig - ured that if we had twenty-five people we would be doing well, but we had ninety people who came from nineteen states and represented thirty - seven universities. There we talked about child psychology and concern - ing the growth of children. There is a great show of interest on the whole in this subject. Some years ago in the City of Cedar Rapids there was a large banquet given over at the Douglas Starch Works there. The advertis - ing manager of that company was brought in and he spoke to the fore - man and the men and he said "If you can just arrange in the advertising to show that a product is good for children you can sell it." Such is the belief in this country that we want the best for our children that if you can just manage to advertise and show that anything is good for children you can sell it there is such a great interest in children in this country. BY MR. TOM SEN: I recognize among those present here the County Agent, Adair, of Polk County, which has furnished two of the judging teams which I believe was second in cattle judging in the International Show at Chi - cago. Now I would like at this time to ask Mr. Adair to present those two young gentlemen. BY MR. ADAIR: I am delighted I can have these two boys here this evening. These two boys have had four years of experience in club work and are mem - bers of the Pig Club of the Stromsburg High School in Polk County. They are not only good stock judges but they are good home workers. These boys are on one of the teams that won the State Championship at the Live Stock Judging Contest. I am sorry that we do not have Harold Johnson here tonight, who also represented the State of Ne - braska at Chicago. These boys had quite a race in their club work. It was first one and then the other who was ahead and I think their work came to a very fine climax when they tied for third place in the individual scores out of sixty-six. I am glad to introduce Ivan Sund - berg and Ancil Frederickson. BY MR. TOMSEN: I think at this time it would be interesting for us to have Professor Derrick introduce his Stock Judging Team. We are proud to have his boys with us. BY PROFESSOR DERRICK: Ladies and Gentlemen. I remember last year that I presented a stock judging team to the people who had gathered for this wonderful banquet. And I recall the intense interest that was shown by the people who were gathered here and who greeted this team of the boys whom I </seg>
            <seg id="p396">396 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture introduced to you, who had made a very enviable record. They were the champions of the United States, I might say of the world, because we defeated all comers, from Canada, and some from European shows. This year Nebraska did not get quite so far with the team so far as rank was concerned. We took sixth in the individual honors this year, but we feel just as proud of the boys who represented Nebraska in the International Show this year, and the stock judging contest at Chicago. This year we had to be contented with ninth place. Ladies and gentle - men when we consider it all that is doing pretty good, to even get in ninth place. We are really very well satisfied and proud of the boys for we are going up against all of the big teams, and we meet some of the cream of the entire United States and Canada. We meet teams from schools that are much older in their Animal Husbandry work and schools that have trained teams for a long time. When we get even into the top ten places, anywhere in that rank, we feel that we have done mighty good work. For even the men who get into the bottom place have some - thing to their credit because the competition has become so keen that it is not so very far between the top teams and the bottom teams. There is no very great spread between the top team and the last team, and it gives me very great pleasure to present to you the six men who rep - resented the University of Nebraska in the Chicago International Stock Judging Contest. (At this point the boys rose and were presented) : Walter Tollman, Lincoln, Nebraska. P. K. Pratt, Beaver Crossing, Nebraska. L. L. Hall, Petersburg, Nebraska, (who tried to tell us that he came from Idaho). R. E. Kendall, Lincoln, Nebraska. A. K. Gramlich, Papillion, Nebraska. M. B. Lewis, Ashland, Nebraska, BY MR. TOMSEN: Talking with the Governor this evening I was feeling him out a little on farming and cattle and was interested in observing that he knows a lot about farming. He made this remark that H. J. McLaughlin had a lot of very fine cattle at Doniphan. I was out there to his farm the other day because my daughter married his son and I went out there to get one of those meals that Mr. Graff spoke about. I asked her about farming, live stock, and so forth, and I found that she was enjoying the experience. I said to her, "How do you look at stock intelligently, and divide them in your mind or separate them so you would know which is which?" She said, "Well I had a great deal of trouble doing that, but the hogs are red and the cattle are red and I thought I was going to have a lot of trouble getting them separated and as I went through the herd I didn't know that I would always be able to tell them apart until I observed that all of the cattle had white faces. Then after that I could tell the cattle by their white faces." Now we have a cattle man here tonight. I am told that he is from </seg>
            <seg id="p397">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 397 South Carolina. Anyway he is identified with the Guernsey Breeding As - sociation. Now I don't suppose that any of you know anything about the Guernsey cattle out in this country. But there is such a breed and they make quite a showing as you go farther east. They are a very attractive cattle, I have seen a good many of them. I know that those cattle stack up a little better in appearance than many others. But that don't make any difference here, for this man represents the As - sociation and not the breed. I was interested at the International Show to observe that my old-time acquaintance and friend, W. W. Marsh of Waterloo, Iowa, whom I have known for over thirty years has devoted a good deal of his efforts toward dairying and showed some very fine Guernsey cattle. Mr. Marsh is one of the ablest men in the live stock business and one of the ablest men in any business. He has accomplished a work that any live stock man should be proud of and can profit by. Now I take great pleasure in introducing a representative of the breed that my good friend, Mr. Marsh, has successfully handled, Mr. W. W. FITZPATRICK, of the American Guernsey Cattle Club. BY MR. FITZPATRICK: Mr. Tomsen, ladies and gentlemen, I am very glad that your toastmaster made it plain that I come as a representative of the Guern - sey breed and of the Guernsey Cattle Club not just for Guernsey cattle. I attend a good many meetings of this character. Not long ago I at - tended such a meeting in Illinois. At that time along toward the fag end of the evening they called upon a friend of mine who is an Episco - palian rector. This was unexpected to him. He was taken by surprise but he looked the crowd over and said, "Mr. Toastmaster, ladies and gentle - men, I didn't come here to make a speech, as Mr. Marc Antony said when he walked into Cleopatra's apartment." Now I didn't come here to make a speech. But I am very glad to attend these meetings of organized agriculture here in Nebraska. It has been a great deal of pleasure to me. This is only the second time I have had the opportunity of coming to Nebraska. The first time was in last August when I spent about three weeks on the dairy trains on the Union Pacific and Burling - ton railroads. I recall the first occasion that I ever heard of Nebraska. It was when I was a youngster just about six years old and I was living then in Kentucky. We looked upon Nebraska as a great frontier state. A friend of mine when he got to be around seventeen or eighteen thought that he had to go west and he met another friend who decided to accompany him as far as the outposts, which meant that he would go as far as Louisville. When they got to Louisville where one crosses the Ohio River my friend said, "Jim, you are crossing the river, when you get to the other side you should turn and look toward Kentucky and say, goodbye old Kentucky, goodbye, old United States, I am going to Ne - braska." As I said I came to Nebraska last summer and spent about three weeks going up and down over the state I gained a decidedly </seg>
            <seg id="p398">398 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture improved opinion of Nebraska. I would like to say now that in my extension work extending over a period of years that I don't think I have ever seen any better conceived and executed work than that that is being done by the Nebraska Dairy Development Society, the Univer - sity of Nebraska, the Club Workers of this State and other organizations such as your Calf Clubs all of which have been co-operating together. My work takes me all over a territory in all states east of the Rocky Mountains and I haven't seen any state where the work is organized better than it is in this state and conceived to make it a greater success. I see here besides myself that there are only three, four or five men who are really in the dairy industry but I am glad to see that more of the people who have been handling beef cattle are becoming interested in the dairy work. Considering that Nebraska has the greatest number of cattle per capita of any state in the union and that Nebraska has the smallest illiteracy of any state in the union the conditions are right for a wonderful development of this state and dairy production even though the dairy production in Nebraska at this time is rather low, but you have wonderful leaders in the dairy industry in this state in Lawritson, Liebers, and Davis who are looking after things in the right way and you are going to be successful. They have improved from what they were in their younger days. I used to know Mr. Davis ten years ago when he did not have so much dignity as he has now. There is a story that when he first got out of school he was sent down into Missouri to address a farm meeting. He told them at the end of his talk that if they wanted to ask any questions he would be glad to answer them, which was a very dangerous thing for a young man to do. Some lady said, "Mr. Davis, I am going to ask a question. A goose has thirteen goslings how many of those goslings should it try to raise." This stumped him for he had not had any poultry work in the college where he took his work. But he thought he had to answer so after thinking it over he said, "Lady, I will tell you. I recommend that you kill at least seven of those goslings as no goose can successfully succor more than six." From what I have seen in Nebraska I am convinced that you have the cattle and if you are going to succeed in the dairy business in this state what you need is dairymen. I am glad to see some of the success - ful breeders are turning their attention toward dairying. Now your state is fifth in production of butter and your general dairy production has increased twenty-four per cent in the last few years. It is a ques - tion not so much of where you are but the progress that you are making and you have made progress. I think in closing of what Pat said to Mike. Now it would just spoil an evening unless somebody would tell a joke about Pat and Mike, and this will be my last one. I might say that when I was urged to attend this banquet and urged to be your speaker, I said, "Well I don't have anything of benefit that I can give these peoole and Mr. Lawritson said, 'Well you don't have to say anything that will De of any benefit. All they want is </seg>
            <seg id="p399">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 399 just a little foolishness, just be natural.' " So now I am going to tell you about what my ancestors Pat and Mike said when they got in trouble at the same time, one for stealing a watch and one for stealing a cow and they had them both in jail. Pat just had to get a joke on Mike so he said, "What time is it. You ought to be able to tell from your new watch." Then Mike said to Pat, "It is time to milk." It is now in Nebraska time to milk. You have the cattle here and what you need now in Nebraska is men who will milk and who will give the dairy industry their best efforts. BY MR. TOMSEN: Now I just happened to think of a story that was told to me the other day. A man went into a doctor's office where the doctor had a bottle of some drab colored liquid setting on the table and the man said to him, "What is that, doctor?" The doctor said, "That is a new drug that if you will just take one dose of it it will set you back twenty years in life and enable you to again do a day's work." The man be - came interested and wanted to know what it was worth. The doctor said, "One hundred dollars a dose." The man said, "Well I haven't just got the money right now but I certainly would like to have the medicine." "Well," the doctor said, "Unless you've got the hundred dollars you can't have the medicine." But he set the bottle down and went in his office room and came our presently and the bottle was setting on the table in its place empty but the man was nowhere to be seen. The doctor looked around and presently a monkey came out from under the table. Now my old friend who is next on the program is from Kansas. I am especially interested in his appearance here because Mrs. Tomsen was a student in the school at which he was of the faculty, and has always spoken very highly of his work in the College of Agriculture at Man - hattan. Now that was long before my time and I am not familiar with her experiences there but it must have been a great institution in which he gave such service and earned such recognition. The next speaker is the head of the Animal Husbandry Department of the Kansas Agricultural College. In his early experience at that in - stitution there was a custom of answering such questions as came in by mail. Someone wrote him and asked what could be done to kill grass - hoppers, and said that they were eating up their corn and was there some way by which they might be killed. It happened that right then they had put in a child welfare department and sometimes got mixed in the mail more or less. There was a request came in as to what could be done to cure sores on the head of the lady's twins. So the professor wrote a letter to the man who had the trouble with the grasshoppers and said that he could get a large galvanized tank and fill it with kero - sense and let the little suckers jump in and drown. Then he dictated a letter to the lady and said that she should rub a little ointment on their heads and they would soon be alright. But it happened that the sten - ographer got the letters mixed. The letter to the man with the grass- </seg>
            <seg id="p400">400 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture hoppers went to the lady with the twins, and so on. Now of course the college lost the respect and support of two reliable citizens. Doctor McCampbell of the Department of Animal Husbandry of the Kansas Agricultural College, is one of the aggressive, wide awake, intelligent and learned men identified with the industry. I have known him for many years and have observed his work and it is with the greatest pleasure that I introduce him to you at this time. BY DR. McCAMPBELL: Ladies and gentlemen. I want to express to you the advantage that the management has taken of your patience when they placed me upon this program. I talked over at the Pavillion this morning and then dur - ing the noon hour and a little while after dinner. Then I told the people that they were going to give me another chance tonight but then in com - ing here I was told to make it snappy and don't try to get serious. I suppose probably that the easiest way to get out of this situation and a way that would give me a very great pleasure, would be to introduce to your honorable toastmaster and his delightful wife as examples of Kansas moonshines and sunflowers of which we are exceedingly proud and whom you are very fortunate to have in your midst. Mr. and Mrs. Frank Tomsen. Now as a very personal matter I just want you to note that I did not say moonshine. I said moonshines, and the real kind, the Booey Wooey kind. I always enjoyed attending banquets if I am ab - solutely sure that I shall have to take no part in them. I have been accused of being queer but I have never been accused of being clever. I am always afraid that I will have to tell a story before I get through. Well I can just get this consolation that there are other great people who get into the same difficulty. I always tell a story of Secretary Jardine's for he was with us for a great many years. Now I don't want to get too familiar here in handling the names of the great citizens of our state and country but I do just want to tell one. A few years ago I was one of the speakers at a banquet and Secretary Jardine was one of the speakers there. He has a great difficulty in telling a story. It so happened that he delegated the task to the head of the Poultry De - partment who was a wonderful story teller. During the week Jardine went across the hall to get him to make some suggestions and said, "I want two or three stories from you." He gave the Secretary a storj about like this. "There was an American boy who had just graduated from a University who went to Mexico and went into the interior and settled down to work and after a few years hard work he struck it rich and then decided to go down to the City of Mexico where he could get an old fashioned American dinner. He went into a cafe and looked over the bill of fare and he didn't see what he wanted. Pretty soon he called over a waiter to him and tried to order some steak with mushrooms. He tried to tell the waiter that he wanted a pretty good sized steak and indicated where he wanted hie piece cut from. And then he took a pencil and drew a picture of a mushroom. The waiter smiled as if he </seg>
            <seg id="p401">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 401 understood it and rushed out. The man waited for quite a while and there was no steak and mushrooms appeared. He was getting rather impatient when in rushed the waiter with a sort of a sunshade or um - brella. Secretary Jardine thought that that was a pretty good story for an occasion of that kind so he tried to use it only he made the mis - take of having the man order steak and onions. He got into the thing so steep that it was touching to listen to him try to tell that story. Now there isn't any particular purpose to this story. Now something was said a while ago about your stock judging team, which was introduced to you. You should be very proud of the work done by your stock judging team. In working toward this end all of the other institutions in this section feel that if they can beat the bunch from Nebraska they will be pretty close to the top. Mr. Derrick whom I have known for quite a while, is always very thoughtful and considerate. He was at one of the International Shows and thought before going home it would be a good idea to take his good wife something. So he goes to Marshall Fields and tries to think what he is going to get, shall he get a clock, anyway he wants to get something that will please the wife, so he goes to one of the clerks and says, "I want to get something to please my wife. I can't think what it is. I don't know whether it is a camisole or a casserole." The hard boiled clerk answered, "Is the chicken dead or alive?" As I said I was specifically instructed not to say anything serious; but I never lose an opportunity to say a word about the live stock in this country so there are just a few points that I want to present to your attention tonight for just a few minutes. One is the importance of the live stock industry. Now our great financiers are coming to realize that agriculture is the basis of prosperity through industry as well as of importance to itself and they are realizing that if they do not have prosperity for agriculture and do not have a prosperous live stock industry that business will not be prosperous. We should take all the opportunities that we have to stress the importance of this great industry that we represent. If I might have time to give you some - thing on production I might bring you some ammunition more than you have for some of you who live in the city do not realize that three - fourths of every crop in this country goes away to market through the outlet of live stock. People do not always recognize this great area representing as large an area as your own state furnishes a supply of live stock. They do not realize that nine per cent of the cultivated area and two per cent of the total area of the United States is devoted to fibre crops, that twenty-eight per cent or more correctly that ap - proximately thirty per cent of the cultivated area must find its outlet through live stock. There are many more facts that could be given but our fibre crops represent about two and one-half billion dollars and crops used for animal consumption about four billion dollars. Those crops otherwise have no value. But the crops that have an outlet through live stock represent a total of eight billion dollars. We should not miss </seg>
            <seg id="p402">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 402 taking advantage of these opportunities to acquaint the general public with the fact that the whole prosperity of the country is dependent on live stock th.at we are maintaining in this country. Now there is one other fact I want to suggest to you. There is being a lot heard about exports of agricultural products. Now if I may make a suggestion there are a lot of people talking about this very glibly. They know very little about it. You realize that we are importing into this country more live stock products than we export. We import more animal products than we export. Do you realize that we import into this country agricultural products to the extent of one and one-half billion dollars a year. It seems to me that we have a real opportunity to improve the agricultural situation by improving some of the situations to which I have just called your attention. BY MR. TOMSEN: One of the things that is dear to the heart of every resident of this state and one of the things that is a great factor in the life of our people is our state of Nebraska. I believe it is true that the people of Nebraska are coming to a better appreciation of its resources and of its im - portance, its advantages and how it stands amongst the states of our union. We ought to all take advantage of every opportunity to recite these resources and to become better informed regarding our own state and appreciate it. The next speaker on our program is the best Gov - ernor that Nebraska has had. He is a man who can present the achieve - ments of his state so that it will make every one of you hold your head higher and to feel a little deeper pride in the fact that he does serve as our Governor at this time. We have never had a man occupying such a public office who had such a fine conception of the advantages which our state possesses, who has such a fine conception of those things as they relate to the state. I say this without a desire in any way to detract from any other public officer whom we have had, but you will be edified and informed by his presentation. It is with great pleasure that I introduce to you Governor Adam McMullen. BY GOVERNOR ADAM McMULLEN: Ladies and gentlemen. Your toastmaster has said some very fine things about me but they are not to be taken by me as too personal because he himself is a wonderful booster of our great state of Ne - braska and some of the finest expressions of tribute and sentiments bear - ing upon the state have been penned by your toastmaster. He must have believed them or he could not have written so well. It has been pointed out that Willie and his son who in their old time rube costumes have been the jesters for this occasion are from Gage County so I want to remark that they do not always act this way when out in public and they promised me that if I would let them come up here during Agricultural Week they would behave. When he is in an automobile he acts about like he has out here in public for he is a reckless </seg>
            <seg id="p403">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 403 driver. Now we have nice gravelled roads but we have some very reckless drivers. I told him he ought to drive carefully or he might end up like the man whose epitaph read, "Here lies the body of Daniel Gray, he died maintaining his right of way; he was right, abso - lutely right, as he sped along, but he is just as dead as though he had been wrong.'" So it is cooperation on the highway that we need so somebody isn't going to be knocked off. My wife became apprehensive tonight as she started me off with this warning, "Don't talk too long." The other evening I found this story about a fellow who was a stranger in town one Sabbath morning and as he went down the street he dropped into a church and during the sermon he fell sound asleep. After while he woke up with a start and looked around and said to the lady near by, "Pardon me, Madam, but how long has he been preaching." The lady said, "I don't know. We came here twenty years ago and he was preaching then." So the fellow says, "If he has been talking that long he ought to be through pretty soon so I will stick it out." Now I am not going to talk so long tonight. I am going to tell you one more about a fellow who went to a banquet where he was not on the program but was called upon and talked for a long while. The people started to go out. Finally by the time he had stopped there was only one man sitting there, and the speaker turned to him and said, "I want to tell you how I appreciate you staying here and the attention you have given me." But the other fellow remarked, "It isn't that at all, I am the last speaker and I wish you would get through." But I am going to talk tonight seriously about Nebraska. We have one of the most won - derful states in the union along with the state of Kansas. This ter - ritory formerly was called Kansas. It belonged to the territory known as the Louisiana purchase territory. It was designated in the early days as the Great American Desert. It would take too long to tell you of the many marvelous features of this state and I'm not going to do it. I read a little review recently and I took a clipping from it this afternoon, regarding the opinion of an Eastern writer of the state of Nebraska. This man is a brilliant writer and he has expert discernment, and he has attracted the attention of this country on account of his brilliancy of thought. This year he has issued a book called "Amer - icana of 1925" in which he attempts to give the salient features of all of the states of the union. He may have expressed this in a cynical vein, or he may have been attempting to be humorous but I want to read to you what he says about Nebraska. If I had known that Kansas would be represented here I would have brought that along because that is real good too, but this is what he says about Nebraska: "Nebraska is a typical cow state. The inhabitants with a few ex - ceptions, read the Bible daily. When they accumulate enough money they sell out their farms and go to Los Angeles. The State University at Lincoln is superior to most of the other universities in the middle west. There are no large cities." </seg>
            <seg id="p404">404 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture This is the summary of a real capable writer, no doubt given in a cynical vein. But we accept what he says in the way he says it, and as complimentary. Nebraska is a cow state. Not only that but it is a state that has attempted from the very beginning to improve the grade of its cows. The people that have made Nebraska the state it is today standing forth in wealth among the forty-eight states showed the same spirit that is bringing up the grade of our cattle. When we can say that we have the largest dairy and the largest creamery in the world we can reply to any brilliant writer whether he may live in New York, as this man does, or anywhere else that we can rely on his interpretation, but we also furnish him not only with the necessities of life, but with necessities of high standing. We are a typical cow state, and we are proud of it. The inhabitants with few exceptions read the Bible daily. I wish that were entirely true but I think Nebraska is a Christian state and we hope that we do read the Bible daily because there is no better guide than the Word of God. We know that the early pioneers who made a state out of this territory and it was then berated by calling it a desert must have had something to sustain them in the way of the Word of God. While we in this day depart somewhat from the discipline of the family still we maintain the moral fibre of this state. We think seriously that as this cynical writer says the majority of our people really try to keep up a reverence and sanctity that God is enthroned in the hearts of the people of this state. He never said a truer thing in his book than when he said that our State University is superior to others in the middle west. We do not intend to compare them inviduously. But we have the lowest per cent of illiteracy next to Iowa and then there is only a difference of one - tenth of a per cent. In Nebraska there are only twelve thousand people who cannot read and write or who do not have the advantages of an education. Then he says that when we accumulate enough money we sell out the farm and go to Los Angeles. Well, Nebraska is a state where men have prospered and accumulated money. There is no happiness in life that is derived from anything but work. It is a sham happiness. And I don't think that a man enjoys anything when 1 he is an idler. This state offers to people the opportunity to labor and accumulate. We offer them a difference in climate. We are glad that we can offer them distinct seasons of the year. We do not have flowers all the time, nor so much of the time that we fail to appreciate them. We have flowers in the spring, summer and fall and then they go back and disappear for the winter and then we have a great pleasure of seeing the buds unfold and their beauty come back in the spring. We are glad for certain things; we are glad that some of our people can make money enough so that they can go away to a climate where they can play. We are glad to know that you can make money out of a Nebraska farm. That is in - formation. We often have to go away from home to learn things. This </seg>
            <seg id="p405">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 405 New York man really encourages us. But we have made money out of a Nebraska farm, seriously, as we will in the future. Personally I be - lieve there is no better investment. I am not a real estate man. I haven't any farms to sell. I have some farms. But no use to offer them for sale now for sales are slow. But I think there is no better time for one who wishes to own a farm in the great state of Kansas or Nebraska than to buy now because the day will never come again regardless of temporary depression when land will be sold at any lower figures than those for which it is held today. That is the honest opinion of one who has been engaged in the farming business for many years and who means to continue in it. Nebraska has no bonded indebtedness. I don't think that is hardly true of any other state. We can say as much for our state capitol that is considered as a masterpiece along architectural lines that it will be paid for to the cent when completed. This state has the lowest per capita indebtedness in the union. If all of our indebtedness were to be paid at one time you and I would only have to pay seventeen cents apiece. There is no other state has such a low per capita indebtedness. The size of our state only means an opportunity for a young man to come here and build up our wonderful resources and gain a wonderful success. We have one county in Nebraska that if all the people in the world estimated at one billion five hundred million get into that county they could stand up and not touch shoulders. We have one county in Nebraska that could almost include the state of New York where this brilliant writer lives and from which he views the cow state of the middle west. Nebraska uses more seed in putting in its wheat than many states raise in their entire crop of wheat. But we must in some way make known these resources not only to people outside of Nebraska but to those of us who live here and who really do not know the volume of our resources. Forty years ago the volume of all Nebraska property was something like five hundred million dollars. Today it is three billion five hundred million dollars, a gain of over seven hundred per cent in forty years. That just represents the taxable property on the assessment rolls and not whatever property that fails to reach the assessment rolls, as you and I know actually exists. All this great wealth has grown up in the territory that not more than a half century ago was a rolling prairie, almost devoid of timber or vegetation. This shows the great volume of resources in agriculture and live stock production that we have built up. All of this has been built up from the soil. We have industrial and manufacturing resources in Nebraska that practically equal that of agriculture and live stock but those too we have built up from the soil. We have no mines. We have none of the things that some other states have but we have a soil that is practically inexhaustible. We have no oil wells, at least as yet, but we do have our dairy and poultry production that exceeds all the gold and silver mined every year in the United States. Our dairy and agricultural products exceed in value all </seg>
            <seg id="p406">406 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture of the coal mined in the United States every year. We are glad that we are a cow state, that our people are Christian people, that we depend on our schools, that our farms are managed in such a way that when men become old they have enough to go away where they can play and that our financial indebtedness is lower than any other state in the union. At this point the banquet program was concluded and the meeting was adjourned. </seg>
            <seg id="p407">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 407 THE ANNUAL CONVENTION OF THE NEBRASKA DAIRY DEVELOPMENT SOCIETY HELD UPON THURSDAY A. M., JANUARY 7th, 1926 AT THE DAIRY BUILDING On the UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE CAMPUS BY SECRETARY H. P. DAVIS: I regret very much that I must announce that an unforseen business engagement in New York City has prevented Mr. Gray from being able to attend this meeting this morning. Likewise we have received notice at the last moment that sickness in the family of Mr. Morris, the Vice- President prevents him from being here. Mr. Morris suggested that we ask Mr. Wayland Magee, one of our faithful members to preside. (The motion was then made and seconded that Mr. Magee be chosen as a presiding officer. Question voted upon and carried). BY MR. MAGEE: Gentlemen, we will have the annual report. We have a good pro - gram to carry forward here in a limited space of time. According to the precedent established last year and in accordance with the custom of the society the election of Directors is carried on by mail, but the polls are not closed until this meeting has been called. If there are any present who have not voted upon the election of Directors, and they will hold up their hands Mr. Gillan may have some ballots left and will fur - nish them to you and you can vote now and as soon as the people here have completed their voting we will ask them that election be consti - tuted of members of the society and retire and count the ballots. Most of the ballots have been received show the bulk of that work has al - ready been done. They will complete that work and certify to the election of the Directors. BY MR. MAGEE: If there is no other voting to be done I will declare the polls closed. Mr. Gillan will withdraw and prepare the certificate. The time for our program today will be a trifle curtailed because we have not yet re - ceived the manuscript of Mr. Gray's report which will review the activ - ities of this year and will be published in the proceedings although we cannot listen to it today. We will now have the consolidated report of Mr. O. H. Liebers and Mr. M. N. Lawritson. BY MR. LIEBERS: Before giving the report on the activities of the society I will take a few minutes and give you some statistics on the present situation of </seg>
            <seg id="p408">408 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture dairying. When we talk of Dairy Development, as was brought out by all of the speakers yesterday, we ought to take into consideration what we started from and how we are developing. I believe that by keeping in mind just about where we stand, and what we started from we can make better progress in development for the future. So I am just going to submit and give you some information on present situations in Ne - braska. First, I want to make a few comparisons with 1920, that is 1925 compared with 1920. The total number of cows milked in the State in 1920 was 438,459. About 39% of these were dry cows, or in other words about 175,000 of the cows milked in 1920 were dairy cows. The other 60%, 263,076, were ordinary red cows. In 1925, as compared with 1920, there were 510 cows, 454 cows. Statistics show that about 40% were dairy cows and 368,000 were red or beef cows, so that there has been a total increase of cows milked of the five years of approximately 30% while the beef cows showed there were 100,000 more cows than in 1920 against 55,000 more dairy cows so the chances are we could not be misguided upon the real percentage of this increase that may be due to farmers driving up a few more red cows and milking them. For during the last year or two there has been a substantial increase. Now we see this increase in dairy stock. In 1920 the statistics showed approximately 127,000 farms in the state. In 1925 the figures gave 3.9 dairy cows per farm. Now in the matter of silos I think this is quite surprising. They are not growing very fast in the way of silos. In 1920 there were 3640 to 3689 in 1925, hardly a substantial increase. That may not mean much but compared to Wisconsin which had 110,000 and close-by Kansas that has over 5,000 silos and even South Dakota exceeds in the number of silos. It certainly leaves us lots of room to help reduce the cost of the production of butter fat. The estimated volume for dairy products in 1920 was $30,000,000.00 and in 1925 was $50,000,000.00. The number of creameries in Nebraska was 84 and in 1925 it was 87. The pounds of butter fat manufactured increased from 56 million in 1920 to 90 million in 1925, which places Nebraska fifth in United States in butter pro - duction. The number of ice cream factories was 132 in 1920 and prac - tically the same in 1925, but the number of gallons of ice cream in - creased from one million nine hundred and eighty-six thousand in 1920 to 2,052,000 in 1925, practically a very small increase. In looking over the statistics of other states and the United States we find that the industry as a whole in the United States upon the in - crease in ice cream manufacture such factors have remained practically unchanged in the last five or six years. The number of cheese factories increased from two in 1920 to six in 1925, and the amount of cheese manufactured from 135,000 pounds to 495,000 pounds for last year. The number of condensaries increasing from 4 to 5, the condensed and evap - orated products amounted to a million pounds, quite a successful increase. t(l) The total production of our dairy cows during 1925 amounts 2,411,440,000 pounds of milk which our 81 creameries, 132 ice cream </seg>
            <seg id="p409">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 409 factories, 6 cheese factories and 5 milk condensories manufacture into butter, cheese, ice cream and condensed and powdered milk valued at $50,000,000 and there was enough left to supply each man, woman and child in the state with 54 gallons of milk. (2) 17% of Nebraska total agricultural wealth for 1925 came from our dairy cows. (3) The 81 creameries in the state manufactured 90,000,000 pounds of butter during 1925. (4) Nebraska cow ranks fifth in butter production in the United States. (5) Omaha leads in the United States as a butter manufacturing center. (6) The 132 ice cream factories in the State made approximately 2,486,000 gallons of ice cream. (7) The six cheese factories produced 495,000 pounds of cheese. In 1924 we only had three cheese factories producing 135,000 pounds of cheese. (8) The 5 condenseries in the state manufactured approximately 900,000 pounds of condensed milk and 100,000 pounds of powdered milk. (9) Nebraska has increased her annual production of milk by 522,000,000 pounds from 1920 to 1924 and now ranks 5th, of all states in increased dairy production during the past five years being excelled only by Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa. It is interesting to note that the greatest increase in dairy produc - tion since 1920 was made by the regular dairy states, Minnesota, Wis - consin, Michigan and Iowa. For example, creamery butter production for the United States increased 493,000,000 pounds from 1920 to 1924 and 306,000,000 pounds of this increase, or 62%, came from the four states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa. (10) Both the number of cows and production per cow have been increased in the United States but consumption is still keeping ahead of production as is indicated by the chart showing an increase per capita consumption of all dairy products during the past six years as follows: Milk 27%, Butter 17%, Cheese 20% and Ice Cream 4%. The Nebraska Dairy Development Society conducted 151 meetings during the year in 62 counties and directly reached 37,472 people. These meetings required practically 4 months of our time. A large number of these meetings were held in the form of one and two day feeding schools. Many of them were held out on the farms where the care and feeding of dairy cows could be discussed with the problems close at hand. The subjects receiving most attention at these meetings were: 1. Eliminating the unprofitable cows by testing for production, 2 — Feeding balanced rations and using home grown feeds wherever possible, 3 — Better care of dairy cows, 4 — Equipment and conveniences such as stan- </seg>
            <seg id="p410">410 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture chions, gutters, mangers, etc., so as to make the work easier and more desirable, 5 — The value of better sires, 6 — The organization of dairy calf clubs, 7 — Producing a better quality of product. We had a splendid attendance at our meetings and especially our feeding schools. We have many favorable reports from farmers that attended our meetings stating that they were practicing the methods brought out at the meetings and were being benefitted by them. A number of men reported that they had tried the simple balanced rations as suggested and were getting an increase in production. Others are making improvements in their barns by putting in gutters and stanchions so that the cows can be better cared for and with less labor. Some have reported that through testing for production they have discovered the unprofitable cows and have eliminated them. TESTING COWS FOR PRODUCTION One of the most important steps in developing dairying on a perma - nent basis is to make it profitable by eliminating the boarder cows and bringing the average production per cow up to a point where they will pay for the feed and labor and leave a profit. We have strongly urged the forming of Cow Testing Associations wherever it is possible to get a sufficient number of men with large enough herds in a community so that a tester can be employed to visit and get a record on each herd once each month. On account of the organization and supervision of the Cow Testing Association work being supervised by the United States Department of Agriculture and our State Extension Department the actual organization, supplying of material and supervising the work of the tester must be done by these departments. We cannot enter into that phase of the work but we have cooperated closely with these agen - cies and have taken every opportunity at our meetings, by correspond - ence, and personal contact to urge the farmers to test their cows for production. During the past year the Cow Testing Association work has grown from two associations with 778 cows to six associations with 2462 cows on test. With this start this work should go forward with even a greater pace during 1926. DAIRY CALF CLUBS The Dairy Calf Club work creates a real interest among the hun - dreds of boys and girls taking part in the work and also in their parents and neighbors. Fully three months of our time during the past Summer and Fall were devoted to assisting the Extension Department in or - ganizing 27 Dairy Calf Clubs with 288 members. The Dairy Develop - ment Society selected and purchased 242 of these calves. We secured as many of these calves as was possible in the State and getting the balance from Wisconsin. Calves for club work should be the best obtainable. They should be good enough so as to serve as a measuring stick for type and production for the particular herd that </seg>
            <seg id="p411">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 411 they go into. A large percent of the hundreds of boys and girls taking part in this club work will become enthusiastic and competent dairymen during the next 5 or 10 years providing they are started out in the right way. If a boy or girl gets a poor calf to start with they find that after working with it for two years up to the time of freshening and then discovers that instead of a good economical producer they have a scrub. It is very apt to discourage them in the business and give a wrong im - pression of dairying to the entire community. So in selecting these calves we made a requirement that the calves must not only be good individuals and well bred but must have a dam who has actually pro - duced 300 pounds of butter fat for the year. We are safe in saying that through this movement the number of grade heifers in the state whose dams have 300 pounds of fat production or better were doubled in the past year. The real stimulant for this widespread dairy calf club movement for the past year was the Union Pacific Calf Club Special train which toured the State during the last half of August and the first days of September. This special made half day stops in 22 counties. At each stop the local community cooperated in organizing a standard Dairy Calf Club with 10 members or more who exhibited their calves on the day the train arrived. At each stop the Union Pacific Special exchanged a fine pure-bred dairy bull for a scrub. These pure-bred bulls became the property of the local calf clubs with an agreement that after they have outlived their usefulness in a community they are to be exchanged with the bull in some other community. This plan assures the service of a very good bull for the Calf Club Members in these 22 communities during the next 6 or 8 years and without question will make a definite improvement in dairy cattle in these 22 counties. The Dairy Development Society cooperated fully with the Union Pacific Dairy Calf Club Special in helping secure some of the pure-bred bulls, in assisting with the organization and supervision of the Calf Clubs and in the demonstration work during the running of the train. PURCHASING DAIRY STOCK There is scarcely a day passes but what we are called upon to either help dispose of surplus breeding stock for some of our breeders or help purchase dairy cattle for others. During the year we have assisted 33 Nebraska breeders of dairy cattle in disposing of their surplus stock. We have purchased dairy cattle for 289 individuals in the State. In ad - dition we have given information that has led to the buying and selling of a good many more. We have adhered strictly to the policy of always trying to fill all demands for dairy cattle from the herds within the State. We are sure that the breeders appreciate that we have made every effort to assist them in disposing of their stock when it was in salable condition and of good enough quality. Out of the 28 pure - bred Holstein bulls purchased for breeders in the state we only brought </seg>
            <seg id="p412">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 412 in two from outside the state and they were for established breeders requiring the particular breeding and type that these animals repre - sented. DISCOURAGING THE IMPORTATION OF INFERIOR DAIRY CATTLE The policy of the Dairy Development Society is to discourage the bringing into the state of inferior cattle. We need more good cows to replace the large percent of boarders that we are now keeping. These can be obtained either by breeding them through the use of better sires or by purchasing them directly from breeders. In a great many cases the demands can be supplied in our own state. The Dairy Development Society has been acting as a clearing house for a great many breeders having cattle to sell and for farmers and breeders wanting to buy dairy cattle. We are glad to extend this service. It makes it possible for us to serve both the breeders of pure-bred dairy cattle and the men in the market for additional stock. Where the demands cannot be satisfied with Nebraska cattle; caution, should be exercised in getting cattle shipped into the state. It is difficult and impractical for farmers only needing a few dairy cows to make a trip to a dairy section to purchase foundation stock but they can combine with their neighbors and get a representative who knows good cattle and how to buy them go to the best dairy districts and make their purchases direct from the men who raise the cattle. MORE GOOD DAIRY SIRES We have emphasized the value of purebred sires at practically all our meetings and demonstrations and have given considerable time in helping breeders select herd sires. During the past year we have pur - chased 38 purebred dairy sires for farmers and breeders in the state. In addition to this number we have reports from many of the purebred breeders in the state that the demand for the good dairy bulls has been greater during the past year than ever before. EXHIBITING DAIRY CATTLE AT FAIRS One of the most accurate indications of the progress of our dairy industry is shown by the fine exhibits of dairy cattle at practically all our County Fairs during the past season. At many of the Fairs where dairy cattle exhibits were practically unknown 5 or 10 years ago they predominated this year. The two outstanding exhibits of dairy cattle at County Fairs during the past year were at Hastings where 144 dairy - cattle were shown and a month latter at Clay Center where 104 head were exhibited. Unusual interest on the part of the farmers was dis - played in the judging and exhibits. The Dairy Development Society has </seg>
            <seg id="p413">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 413 encouraged the exhibiting of dairy cattle at all the Fairs as we believe it stimulates interest in dairying and gives the best opportunity to study the correct type of dairy cattle. The society through its President, Mr. Carl R. Gray, has taken up the matter with the State Board of Agriculture of creating classes at our State Fair for boys and girls owning high grade calves. In the past there have been classes for only the boys and girls with purebred calves which has resulted in small exhibits of from 10 to 15 head whereas with the classes for high grades we should have at least 150 dairy calves exhibited. Instead of attracting a small group of purebred breed - ers as in the past these classes would attract hundreds of farmers who perhaps never expect to be breeders of purebreds but are interested in getting the best in high grades. We are advised that the suggestion made to the State Board by our President is receiving favorable at - tention. GENERAL SERVICES During the year we had 782 definite requests for service and have visited 548 farms where we had been asked for help in relation to dairy - ing. The general requests for service are mostly on the subjects of feeding, breeding, arrangement and equipping of barns, pastures and feed crops, the purchasing of dairy stock and assistance in disposing of the surplus stock for breeders. We had 450 office visitors on business, 874 telephone calls, received 4,443 letters, letters written, 8,048 and circular letters sent, 5,000. The plans for 1926 are to follow our regular 5 year program which emphasizes the following work: 1. Cow Testing work to eliminate the unprofitable cows. 2. Better methods of feeding and caring for the cows we have. 3. The use of more purebred sires. 4. The organiza - tion of dairy calf clubs. 5. Assist those wishing to purchase dairy cattle and help those who have surplus stock for sale to dispose of them to the best advantage. 6. Encouraging Dairy cattle exhibits at County and State Fairs. 7. A campaign for more silos. Nebraska needs more silos to make use of the large percent of the corn stalks that are now going to waste. 8. Production of a higher quality product. A better quality will increase consumption and an increased consumption will bring the producers better prices. 9. Marketing. We recognize the fact that marketing problems are very important factors in the Dairy Industry and are taking advantage of every opportunity to help solve them. Encourage a greater consumption of dairy products. In conclusion we kindly request suggestions from the members of the Society that will make our program stronger as we go along. A number of members have kindly assisted our management in offering constructive suggestions from time to time but we would appreciate having a greater number of the members help us by their suggestions. </seg>
            <seg id="p414">414 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture BY MR. MAGEE: We have now heard this annual report made by Mr. Liebers and Mr. Lawritson together, showing the activities this year of the Ne - braska Dairy Development Society. I notice that this is a court of record and we have the annual report for last year for the Nebraska Dairy Development Society printed and bound. I presume that the President's report will be published with this and this report just given will be likewise incorporated. (Motion made then to accept, place on file and publish the report of the managers as given by Mr. Liebers). (Motion Seconded). Question. Vote taken. Carried. BY CHAIRMAN MAGEE I will now appoint some committees COMMITTEE ON RESOLUTIONS: Val Kuska, George Jackson, John T. Mcgreer. AUDITING COMMITTEE: A. L. Haecker, Elliott Davis, H. J. McLaughlin. BY CHAIRMAN MAGEE: The Auditing Committee will please retire and prepare their report. We have before the Society at this time no resolutions to be acted upon. The Resolutions Committee will withdraw and convene and if there is anything in the form of resolutions that any member desires, will he please submit it to that Committee. This policy of sandwiching in the business meeting with the program will save time. Now we will turn our attention to the program. We are fortunate in having a very valu - able number not on our printed program, a man whose message will be of interest to Dairy breeders, who comes to us in charge of the Extension Work of the American Jersey Cattle Club. He will take the subject of "ESSENTIALS IN SUCCESSFUL DAIRY MANAGEMENT." I take pleasure in introducing MR. W. L. MORLEY. BY MR. MORLEY: Ladies and Gentlemen, I will at least try to be honest and help, 1 will confine my address to just a few things. They did put me on the program because they had some other people who were placed on the program and the other people didn't come. I will give you this warning right now, don't stay if you have got something more important to do in the next fifteen or twenty minutes, just go ahead — I am not going to say anything new. What I do say will be perhaps interesting but I do want to say I will promise that within twenty or maybe ten minutes I will have you all asleep. I am going to talk a little while about some of the principles of dairying. </seg>
            <seg id="p415">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 415 Henry Ford is a man who talks about cows and then everybody listens. Now if Henry Ford could do just one thing, in talking- about this cow that he has in mind, he would do the greatest thing that was ever done for dairying. If we could just get the idea across that the dairy cow we now have on the farm, that is applying to the man who owns it and 909c of you don't have any dairy cows, if you would just get the idea of looking at those cows as a machine a little bit more than we do Henry Ford would have done a great thing; for with his ability Henry Ford has never yet invented an automobile that will run without gas. They will of course run down hill, but they will not what you would call run without gas. So if we would just get it into our heads that the old Dairy Cow is a machine, an efficient machine. We know just a little of how efficient she is, but no matter how efficient a machine is they have to have raw products so that they can do best work. It will not go without supplying raw products to it. That is what the Dairy Cow won't do. You have got to give it alfalfa or some good feed and give it quite often. It is true you can give her corn stalks or you can just turn her into a feed lot but if you want good production you have got to feed her the same as you would any other animal. Unless you are going into dairying for the purpose of getting good profitable production there is no use of trying to treat this machine any other way. She simply has to have the raw material so she can produce to the best of her ability. Now that brings me up to my next proposition. If we do have the proper material to feed into that machine is it an economical machine? Do we have upon the farms of the United States, and particularly upon the farms of this big state an economical machine? Do we have econ - omical care such as will enable this machine to really produce butter fat ? I am just convinced as much as that I am standing here that if a whole lot of our cows could be better cared for than they are; simply because we have never given them a real chance to do what they can do. It is true that we have a lot more cows, especially in these States than we used to have. But they really don't have the ability to produce economically because they don't have the right hereditary background. One of your farmers told me about the sire that has been upon his farm for the last few years but how about the cows on that ground that have not received a lot of attention and yet he expects to have a good dairy cow. You desrre to go ahead and have a very good increase in the number of dairy cows or an increase in the number of dairy animals and simply answer this dairy problem that you have in this State as well as in other .States. So with that problem the solution rests in the sire. That is one of the greatest problems that you have. You have got to give more attention to the sire that has the ability to sire good daughters. The point was brought up very nicely yesterday that the United States Department of Agriculture at the present time is making a complete study in trying to find out where good sires are and to look out after quality rather than numbers. You know a very usual </seg>
            <seg id="p416">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 416 custom of keeping a sire on a farm until after he is two years old and then after he gets two years old discontinuing the policy of keeping him because everybody on the farm is getting afraid of- that bull. That has got to become a thing of the past. We don't have many laws now. It might be a rather good proposition to pass some more and if I was doing that I would suggest a law or two. I would prepare to put in a law that would require that every farm must have a place to keep the bull. If the farmer doesn't have a good stall put in a good stall as well as a yard and then everybody wouldn't be afraid to have a mature bull around the place and you could keep him for awhile. By reason of that law I would feel very much justified and puffed up because I suggested it There ought to be more barns, more stalls and more exercise yards particularly built for the mature bulls so they could be kept. Now the problem to my mind that is a very important one is the develop - ment of the youngsters. No one here knows of a farmer anywhere in Nebraska who starves his calves and young stock who has a right good profitable herd. I want to see him at the end of this meeting so I can spot him or I would like to have him stand up so I can spot him and talk to him after the meeting. In my experience I have observed that the farmer who starves his young stuff and mistreats his heifers and calves and other young stock before they become cows does not have good profitable stock in his herd. I have said a number of times that if you have good men you begin when they are very young and continue to train them and if you are going to have good dairy cows you will have to begin back there in infancy too. You can't wait until the animal is a cow to treat it right and then have a good cow. The calf must be given feed and be given good stanchions as it grows. I have been very interested in the different things that you find in a high production animal. When you do find a high, production animal in practically every case you find they are a real individual and a credit to the breed they represent. I believe that that is universally true. The high production animals are the highest type individuals of the breed that they represent. That is one of the problems in the de - velopment of young stock. It is only one of such problems. They must have the care as calves, and they have got to be a number of years of weeding out in the bulls and animals. The animal has to have a good sire, before you are going to have a really good high production animal. Now, there is another problem, if you are going to get a good pro - duction, (but the next speaker is going to dwell upon that). Then mar - keting. What are your marketing problems here in Nebraska or do you have marketing problems in Nebraska ,yet. I don't suppose you have one of those places where there are no marketing problems. I do have it in mind that you are going to have very serious marketing problems and the biggest thing that you have got to do now is to make up your minds to have high quality in your production so you can market what you produce. I believe that you are right now at the place where </seg>
            <seg id="p417">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 417 a good deal of attention must be given where you are going to market your dairy products. Right along that line you must give quite a lot of your attention to the quality stock. I don't believe that with any one of the four major breeds that you have any difficulty right now in your sale of a large number of bulls and good animals at the right prices. What we are up against with the Jersey, with the Holstein, with Guernsey or the Ayrshire is to secure a lot of good male animals. Let's try to handle the situation here so that you can take care of this breed - ing problem. There is no antipathy period toward any of these breeds. Whatever breeds you select get the very best so that you begin right. No matter what angle of dairy production you are interested in, whether it is in milk, ice cream, cheese or what line your start is important. I am interested in the shipping done here, very much interested in matters of this sort. Quite a number of those people who are going out of the Dairy business ask what is wrong that they haven't accomplished as much as they should. They want to know what it is that they failed to do so that they did not get across. I believe that we are going to have to do some heart to heart talking with these men. We are going to have to get right out on the farms and talk to them in person and work hard if we are really going to accomplish anything with them. As I said in the beginning that if you were expecting anything new you would be foolish to listen to me. All of these things that I have talked are interesting things. Now some of these other men may say the same thing, like Professor Haecker who would say that the same things would be true. Now a lot of us sometimes get kind of discouraged with all of these things yet we get the feeling that we are not making a permanent advancement in Dairy work. Now just reflect for a moment, we have had preachers going around this country in regular pulpits for some - thing like the last two thousand years. They haven't accomplished all that they would like to accomplish. We have had free schools estab - lished and operated and yet not all of our people are educated. That is the thing that I want to impress upon you if you are engaging in this kind of work. We must actually get our viewpoint over to the farmers whom we are working with and not get discouraged. When I first went into the Extension work seven years ago I used to get dis - couraged now I find that sometimes things are being accomplished. So people engaged in this kind of work, and I know every one of the rest of you don't think it is perfectly easy, for they don't find that it is so perfectly easy to go out and work right with the farmers but yet they can be satisfied that they are helping here and there. We do find this tremendously interesting in its problems. Let us first consider that those who are milking cows have a different feeding proposition to con - sider. I think I will remember what somebody told me quite early in my extension service, and that is to remember that no souls are con - verted after the first twenty minutes. I will try to follow those wise words and not talk any longer. </seg>

BY CHAIRMAN MAGEE: Mr. H. P. Davis, our Secretary, will now give the annual report of the Secretary and Treasurer of the Society. BY MR. DAVIS: Rather than burden the Society with details of the meetings of the Executive Committee and to shorten the report on the affairs of the Society, I have just made an effort to outline a little bit of what seems to be some of the important steps in the progress of the work, not only of the Dairy Development Society but of all of those who are interested in Dairy work. Now as to the special work of the Nebraska Dairy Development Society, you of course got that from hearing the report of Mr. Liebers and Mr. Lawritson, given by Mr. Liebers. But concerning the problems of increased interest in Dairying and increased production I have brought up certain phases. It seems to me that we must face those problems. I am sure we are willing to face them, I feel we are entitled to have Nebraska not only be a secondary Dairy State as it now is, but I believe that in the future we will become a primary Dairy state. Of course the main problem is the increased efficiency of the Dairy Cow. This is being </seg>
            <seg id="p420">420 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture furthered by the cow testing associations. I believe there are other problems to meet and to take more time to other questions, first is the question of quality of our production. While we never had a large amount of any Dairy Product there have been times when the quality of some of our products could be improved if we are going to compete in a World market, we have got to increase that quality. If we are going to develope in our Dairy line it seems to me that we must have a little outgo, and a little larger opportunity to show the products than we have had in the past, especially along certain lines. We are going to have greater opportunities in the future. Those things seem to confront us and we must be prepared to meet them. The Nebraska Dairy Development Society has enjoyed a year of progress. Its program has been carried out by the manager and assist - ant manager in a way to be commended. During the year it has spon - sored several projects that have met with marked success. Details of the work accomplished will be presented by the manager in his annual report. There has come about a material development in interest in dairy - ing in Nebraska during the last year or two as will be seen from a study of statistics. Perhaps the most reliable that we have concerning creamery butter, and from 1920 to 1924 the output of that commodity has increased from fifty-six million pounds to eighty-one million pounds. Nebraska is leaving the pioneer class and beginning to develop a real interest in dairying as an industry and not merely as a sideline. This development is bringing problems upon the solution of which will de - pend the future prosperity of the industry. If the society is to serve its real function, it must furnish leadership in solving the problems. 1. One problem that is of the utmost importance is that of in - creasing the efficiency of our dairy cow. Today Nebraska cows produce from a fourth to a third less than cows in neighboring and competing states. This tax is a heavy one and must be eliminated. The answer is a three-way one, namely — better feeding, better breeding, and more careful selection. If for example, Nebraska cows were as efficient as those in Wisconsin it would mean at least ten million increased income annually. To provide for the future, the boys and girls calf clubs should be sponsored and assisted in every way. The better methods that they learn will make for better dairying. 2. Better quality of dairy products is a vital question now that the United States is the world's largest dairy nation. It is axiomatic that a better quality is more salable and usually more profitable in the long run to all branches of the industry. When sold on a word market, dairy products must be sold on quality. Since Creamery butter is the chief dairy product manufactured in Nebraska, and since almost three - fourths of that product is sold outside the state, it is essential that it be of the best quality possible. Our creamery centralizer system has done a great service to the state in furnishing a market readily available </seg>
            <seg id="p421">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 421 for even small quantities of cream. It has made possible the develop - ment of the last few years. With a greater number of dairy cows per square mile, a condition that is coming rapidly, there will likely come modifications of the cream station buying. Certainly, at least in cer - tain sections of the state, there must be provisions made for the mer - chandizing of cream from consumer to producer on the basis of its quality. The proper working out of such a system is vital to continued growth and development of dairying. Better cream must bring better prices. 3. As dairying develops there will develop other dairy manufactur - ing industries. When these are sound in principle they should be en - couraged. Nebraska is an almost untapped reservoir for milk produc - tion and should shortly take an important place among the states in that regard. Summarazing, there had been development which will certainly con - tinue-. It should be guided by the light of experience along the right channels. Efficiency and quality are the two watchwords for the future. BY CHAIRMAN MAGEE: You have the report of the Secretary and Treasurer before you. BY MEMBER: I move that the report of the Secretary and Treasurer be placed upon file. Motion Seconded Question put. Motion carried. BY CHAIRMAN MAGEE: I think that the Nebraska Dairy Development Society is to be con - gratulated when its officers arranged this program which now includes the discussion by an eminent authority on the question of Dairying Marketing Problems." It has become a natural habit for us to look to Washington for real authority or to get our inspiration and it now gives me great particular pleasure to introduce at this time Mr. Delos L. James, who in his official capacity as a marketing expert of the United States Department of Agriculture will address us upon this subject. MARKETING NEBRASKA'S DAIRY PRODUCTS by DELOS L. JAMES Marketing Specialist, U. S. Department of Agriculture There are many phases to the problem of marketing Nebraska's dairy products. Due to the lack of any very well developed dairy sec - tions except those producing fluid milk and cream for market purposes </seg>
            <seg id="p422">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 422 it possesses certain phases which differ considerably from those of other states, consequently economical marketing of the products is made much more difficult. With the exception of the market milk sections practically the entire product from the other areas is marketed in the form of cream for butter making purposes. In this respect the state ranks fourth in the total amount of butter made which for the year 1924 was over 81 million pounds. The three states which exceed this amount are Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin. The state next in line to Nebraska is Ohio. In each of the first three states the business of dairying has de - veloped under considerably different conditions than those prevailing in Nebraska. Although these conditions differ to a marked degree, es - pecially those governing the production of the raw product, there are however certain phases which are deserving of comparison and from which we may obtain some valuable suggestions. In Ohio the conditions are more like those in this state and much progress has been made to - ward securing a better quality product. Marketing Milk and Cream in Cities A large portion of the total supply of dairy products produced in this state is marketed in the form of milk and sweet cream for fluid purposes the production and marketing of which is governed by well denned rules and regulations drawn up and enforced by the city Health Department of the cities in which the products are sold. These rules and regulations insure to the consumers in the various cities in which they are in effect a high quality product. Without these regulations governing the production and marketing of milk and sweet cream for fluid purposes it is doubtful whether a product of as high quality would be available and whether conditions in that part of the industry would be as satisfactory to those concerned. Sour Cream Marketing in Nebraska If we compare the quality of cream being marketed in all parts of the state for butter making purposes which is not subject to any strict sanitary regulations pertaining to quality, we do not find the same gen - erally satisfactory conditions. Cream in all sorts of conditions such as sweet, partly sour, very sour and in almost every other imaginable con - dition may be found at times as it goes to be manufactured into butter. Regulations governing production, care and transportation of this highly perishable product are left almost entirely to the judgment of the cream buyer and due to the highly competitive nature of the business prac - tically no standard of quality is recognized. As a consequence cream from high to low quality offered for sale finds a ready outlet on prac - tically an equal basis. Is this as it should be? Has such a system advantage or does it possess several serious faults? How does it affect the producer? What is the effect on the final product? Is the buyers' problem made more difficult? Should an attempt be made to improve </seg>
            <seg id="p423">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 423 the method of buying cream? Does the present system necessitate higher costs in handling and manufacturing? Is there any incentive to the producer to deliver a better product? Will changes in the system insure better prices to both producer and buyer? These and many other questions might be asked and a practical answer given to each of them. Quality of Cream Often Inferior The present system of buying cream in this state as well as that in several others is the outgrowth of many years of development of the dairy business. It is primarily a method that has grown up with the keeping of cows whose product was sold in the form of sour cream. Little if any improvement has taken place in this method of marketing in comparison with many advancements of other phases of the industry such as better feeding and ventilation or methods of converting the raw product into a finished article of desirable quality. When compared with methods now in use in sections where cream of the highest quality is purchased and made into butter of a quality unsurpassed in any respect we find that the method used here falls far short of being at all suitable for the purpose. Long ago it was replaced by one that makes possible the recognition of quality in the raw product, effects greater economies in the buying and handling of the product and insures a finished product made therefrom that will be equal in every respect to the best that is made in any other part of the country. Farmer Not Offered Incentive for Quality You all know that the cream when first produced by the farmer is sweet and suitable for conversion into butter of the highest quality. Under the prevailing system of handling cream for butter making pur - poses in this state most of the cream is allowed to deteriorate in quality before it is offered for sale and certainly before it can reach its final destination it is in a condition that makes absolutely impossible its use in producing the highest grade of butter. Here then is a serious defect in the system since it permits actual deterioration of the product be - fore delivery is made and yet is accepted as a merchantable product with good, bad and indifferent all on an equal basis. Up to this point the farmer is responsible since he has permitted the cream to decrease in quality due of course, to various causes, the principal one being lack of interest because he knows he will get the same price whether the cream is good or bad. Consequently the cream is permitted to sour, delivery to the buyer is made when it suits best the convenience of the producer, maybe once, twice or three times a week and the entire treatment of it is not usually conducive to the de - livery of a high quality product. When finally offered for sale, must it meet any certain requirements by the purchaser or comply with any local, state, or federal regulations pertaining to its quality or its suitability as food for human use such </seg>
            <seg id="p424">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 424 as pertain to the sale of most other food products like milk or cream for fluid purposes or meats or fish? Very few, if any that are made effective. It can be so bad and in such a state of putrefaction that the odor is almost unbearable and its physical condition almost uncontrol - able as is evidenced by its running out over the tops of the cans and in some casea actually exerting enough pressure to remove the tops of the containers in which it has been confined, and yet it is accepted as a merchantable product and with the expectation of making from it a product that must compete in the markets of the country with a similar kind of product only of a much higher quality. What chance has butter made from cream received in such condition and with which you are familiar to sell for as good a price as that made from real sweet, mild flavored cream of the highest quality? Absolutely none. The penalty for this condition is severe and means from four to five cents a pound less for the grade of butter coming from this state except where spe - cial distributing systems have been built up. Creameries Create Demand for Poor Cream Who, then is responsible and at fault in this latter respect? Cer - tainly no one but the buyer. He, it is who creates a demand for a poor quality product which he must pay for at a reduced price, handle and manufacture at a high cost and sell for a price that is less than could have been received if it had been properly handled from the very be - ginning. Under the present system in this state the producer with his poor quality cream is too much sought after by the half dozen or more anxious and willing cream buyers in nearly every town. Cream, regard - less of quality, is desired and the result is constantly becoming more and more unsatisfactory to all concerned. A system of marketing that actually permits or encourages carelessness and indifference in connec - tion with the handling of the product whether in its raw state or in finished form, cannot be too severely condemned, and really that is what we have in this and a few other states under the prevailing system of handling cream from producer to manufacturer. The surprising part of the whole matter is that butter of a quality as acceptable as is now produced can be obtained from cream handled under such a system. The serious part of the matter, though, is that higher handling and manufacturing costs are incurred and that a lower price must be paid for the raw product which affects the producer who in turn thinks an undue advantage is being taken of him. It is unfortunate that manufacturers are compelled to resort to the present day methods of handling cream which are found in many cream - eries. Too high a percentage of the cream received has to undergo artificial treatment in order to make a quality of butter that can be marketed. Why, you may ask does such a condition exist? The reason it exists is because it is permitted to exist. How much longer can it exist? This depends upon various developments. </seg>
            <seg id="p425">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 425 However, the following may be accepted as a condition which should in part answer such a question. Quality requirements generally are in - creasing. New and more important outlets are demanding higher qual - ity butter. As this condition grows, it is obvious that creameries which produce a low quality product are going to have more difficulty in dis - posing of it. And it is also becoming recognized more each succeeding year that high quality products stimulate increased consumption. Poor quality butter is spread thin — and just as true fine quality butter is spread thick. Costly Methods Reduce Producers' Profits According to the tariff commission's report on the butter tariff hear - ings the total cost of buying butter fat in Nebraska for 1923 was 4.73 cents per pound. In the state of Michigan the same item was 1.49 cents, in Ohio it was 1.9 cents. These figures all being on the same basis. In Minnesota and Wisconsin the cooperative creameries have de - veloped a finer quality product which it is possible to make from the high grade cream and a premium price is received in addition to the saving effected through having no buying costs such as station ex - penses, cream collection expenses, etc. Consequently, a higher price is paid the producer. Does the latter system which insures a high quality raw product necessitate greater expense on the part of the producer. Invariably it does not. If properly equipped at the start very little additional effort is required to properly cool and keep the cream sweet until it is de - livered which is twice a week in cool weather and three or four times a week in warm weather. The fact must not be lost sight of however, that the cream is sweet and practically perfect in all respects when first obtained from the milk by the farmer and with proper yet rather inex - pensive equipment, it can easily be kept in that condition until delivered. Of course, along with the improvement in the quality of the product delivered by the farmer in Minnesota has come an increase in price, so that there has been a real genuine incentive to take better care of the product and deliver cream of the highest quality. In this respect it is interesting to note the effect of a system which recognizes quality and pays in accordance therewith. Under the plan of operation- of the Min - nesota Cooperative Creameries' Association, Inc., the price returned to the creamery is based on the quality of butter it delivers to the Associa - tion. When it began to operate about four years ago, not over one third of the butter would score 92. Now of approximately one hundred million pounds handled annually which it receives from its four hundred and fifty member creameries over two thirds score 93 or better all of which is paid for on a premium basis and in the end means a higher price to the farmer. </seg>
            <seg id="p426">426 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Pay for Cream on Quality Basis In order to make possible the manufacture of butter of high quality the producer must deliver cream of high quality and as an inducement to the producer to deliver high quality cream he must be paid a better price than is paid for cream of low quality. This should be a voluntary matter on the part of the cream buyer and butter manufacturer. And right here I want to say that I believe it would be beneficial to all con - cerned if the matter was made compulsory to the extent of making it unlawful to accept a product for food uses that had deteriorated greatly from its natural state. The idea of a compulsory system may first suggest to you the taking away of certain liberties which in your opinion would be un-American. But it must be recognized that in the production, of milk for city con - sumption there are certain compulsory requirements which are now generally and universally accepted as a matter of course. Probably the greatest effect of this feature has been the winning of public confidence and a willingness to accept, without question as to quality and safety, a product which naturally lends itself to easy con - tamination and deterioration. So the establishment of compulsory grad - ing would not be setting a new precedent. Should this not be possible under existing conditions it may be desirable to consider other ways of effecting an improvement. Buying cream on a graded basis is already being done by creamery men in several states, namely Minnesota, Wis - consin, Iowa, Mississippi. Tennessee, Virginia and a few others. In each case a considerable difference is made in the price paid for cream of different qualities. So far the results are very satisfactory as farmers are striving to furnish a quality of cream that will merit the payment of the highest price. Cream Grading Must Come One of the first steps and one that rests entirely with the producer must be a desire and willingness on his part to deliver a high quality product such as sweet cream and then to insist on his cream being purchased on a quality or graded basis. This in order to be successful must be universal on the part of at least a majority of the producers in order to insure the buyer a large volume of high quality cream. A second suggestion is one that pertains to the cream buyers or in other words the butter manufacturer since it is usually he who maintains the cream buying stations. Fewer cream buyers would greatly benefit the system by reducing receiving costs and lessen the competition for a poor quality product. Over three thousand cream buyers operate in this state. What an army to do what a force of only hundreds do in other places. Who pays for this superfluous service? The farmer. The purchase of cream on a graded basis, paying therefor a differ - ent price for each grade should be the universal practice and is a factor </seg>
            <seg id="p427">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 427 that exerts the greatest influence in the change from a low to a high quality product. The combination of these two interests that of the producer and the cream receiver on a basis that is mutually beneficial to both is the most ideal and practical solution of the whole problem. If the producers are unwilling to take any action indicating their de - sires, then there is little hope for improvement since it would indicate that the present system was satisfactory to them. On the other hand, if the cream buyers or manufacturers are aware of their precarious situation due to keener competition from a higher quality butter, they will soon make use of a grading system with attractive price differentials for the various grades that will make it extremely unprofitable for the farmer who insists on delivering cream of poor quality. Refusal on the part of all cream buyers to accept any cream of poor quality would have an immediate effect and buying on a basis of uniform grades would be equitable to all. This latter idea is possible and could be developed in the following way. It would be known as a Federal-State Cream In - spection Service and all cream would be bought and paid for on a quality basis. It is this latter plan that I offer for your most serious considera - tion and in detail is as follows, but before, I describe it, let me say that the plan of Federal-State cream grading is not fundamentally different than the present plan of handling our butter and egg grading or inspec - tion service which is now in operation in Minnesota and California and will undoubtedly be adopted in other states. A Plan of Federal-State Cream Grading The United States Department of Agriculture under Act of Congress has authority to establish a grading or inspection service on farm products when received at important central markets. Practically every creamery in the United States is an important central market for cream. In quite a number of states, legislation has been enacted which gives some agencies within the state similar authority. By the federal gov - ernment and the agency within the state cooperating, it would be a simple matter to establish in any state a federal-state cream grading or inspection services. To inaugurate such a service in Nebraska it would be necessary in the first place that some agency within the state have authority to cooperate with the federal government in the work and for the federal government and that agency to enter into a cooperative agreement for the conduct of a cream grading service. This service the agency within the state would be in position to offer to the creameries located in the State of Nebraska. It could be offered to the creameries on such a basis as the following: The state and federal government would establish practical grades for cream which grades the cream grad - ers in the various creameries would use in grading cream received at the creameries. In order that the cream graders would be thoroughly familiar with the grades, their application and use, it would be desir - able periodically for a school for the training of cream graders to be conducted for a period of a week or more at some logical point in the </seg>
            <seg id="p428">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 428 state. Those who successfully completed the cream grading course at the school and passed the examination satisfactorily, would be eligible for licensing by the federal government as cream graders. These per - sons also could be employed by the state as cream graders and by the state entering into an agreement with the creameries that wanted the services of a cream grader and the creamery paying for the service, the amount of the salary and the expenses paid the grader by the State Department. The full costs of the service would be borne by the cream - ery using the service of the grader. By the state maintaining a revolv - ing fund into which the moneys received from the creameries to cover the salaries of the cream graders were deposited, and the salaries of the graders paid from this fund, the federal-state cream grading and inspection service ■would be maintained without material cost either to the state or the federal government. It would be desirable, however, that there be a fund provided for the proper supervision of the federal - state cream grading or inspection service within the state. This fund might be obtained direct from state appropriation or by the state col - lecting an additional 5% or 10% from each creamery above the amount paid the cream grader as salary. This additional 5 or 10 percent should be sufficient to cover the cost of the supervision of the service. You may ask the question, is such a plan feasible and practicable? My answer is that it would be entirely practical and feasible if the creameries in the state desired to make it so and would cooperate with the federal and state government in giving the plan proper support and in putting it into practical operation. For the greatest success of such a plan in the state, it would be desirable that practically every creamery or at least a large group of the creameries in the state adopt it. I honestly believe that the cream producers in Nebraska would welcome an opportunity to market their cream to a creamery where a federal state cream grader, graded the cream on its arrival at the creamery and where the creamery rewarded the producer of cream of a higher grade with a higher grade price. Neither the state nor the federal government would be concerned with the price paid. That would be determined as at present by the indi - vidual creamery. It would probably be desirable, however, that second grade cream be taken by the creamery as the basic grade when estab - lishing card prices, but each creamery should be left to establish its own premium on first grade cream. Obviously, some creameries with better market outlets for high quality butter than other creameries have, would be in position to pay a higher premium for higher grade cream. This would result in a very desirable and helpful competition for it would result in competition not for cream but in the premium paid for high quality cream. In fact it would be competition for quality which I am sure the cream producers of the State of Nebraska would most heartily welcome. In such a plan of federal state cream grading or inspection as I have outlined, there should necessarily be a uniform interpretation and </seg>
            <seg id="p429">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 429 application of the various grades employed. This would be desirable and necessary not only from the standpoint of insuring to the producer the correct grading of his cream no matter to what creamery it was shipped, but also to eliminate improper, unethical and unwarranted trade practices in their competition for cream. Under the federal-state cream grading or inspection service the licensed or state employed cream grader at the creamery would be responsible for not only the grading of the quality of the cream but he also should be responsible for the correct testing of the cream for its butter fat content and the correct net weight of the can of cream as received at the creamery. With these two very important factors in cream marketing properly taken care of under a federal-state cream grading or inspection service, the other im - portant factor to the producer, namely, price, would be left to the creameries to be regulated solely by competition. To put into effect such a system of cream grading in the state of Nebraska it would be necessary to eliminate many hundreds of useless cream stations and at each local market where cream is delivered by the producers in that community to establish an up-to-date modern sani - tary cream station with adequate cooling facilities for the proper hand - ling of cream, washing and sterilizing of cans and otherwise handling the farmers' cream so that the least deterioriation of its quality would take place between the cream station and the creamery. This might be handled locally as a farmers cooperative enterprise if no better means of providing such facilities existed. Otherwise, it would be necessary that the farmer's can of cream be shipped through direct from the cream station or that the farmer's cream be so handled at the cream station that it could be delivered through to the central creamery where it would be kept and sample taken for butter fat test. The plan which I have outlined here may sound like an impractical proposition, but I am firmly convinced that the method involved is funda - mentally sound and that it is by some such method that cream marketing here in Nebraska must be improved if a better price is to be obtained by Nebraska farmers for the cream they market for manufacture into creamery butter. I would be very much interested in hearing you dis - cuss this subject and if there are any phases of it which I have not made perfectly clear I shall be very glad to answer any questions which you may ask. BY CHAIRMAN MAGEE: I know that on behalf of Nebraska Dairy Development Society words will not express our appreciation of Mr. James's address and our appre - ciation of the fact that he has come here to give us the information and inspiration. BY CHAIRMAN MAGEE We will now hear the report of the Resolutions Committee </seg>
            <seg id="p430">430 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture BY E. N. POLLARD: I perhaps ought not to say what I have in mind until the Committee on Resolutions report. But there is one matter presented by Mr. James which ought to be incorporated in our Resolutions or perhaps we better wait and see what the Committee may have to offer upon this matter. BY MR. VALKUSKA: As Chairman of the Resolutions Committee I beg leave to submit the following report: 1. Whereas, the Dairy Industry of Nebraska is in its infancy and its development is of such great importance to the welfare of our state. And whereas, realizing that all big things have been accomplished by strict cooperative efforts. Be it resolved that we commend and endorse the efforts put forth and the work done during the past two years by the officers and particu - larly the Manager Mr. O. H. Leibers and the Assistant Manager, Mr. M. N. Lawritson, as well as the Dairy Department in the University of Nebraska, for their untiring efforts to further the increase of dairying in every way in the State of Nebraska, and we earnestly hope that they will continue in the future to carry on this good work, and especially through the boys and girls club; Resolved again that it be the sense of the members of the associa - tion that we cooperate with them to the fullest extent. BY MR. KUSKA: I move the adoption of that part of the report BY MR. MAGEE: You have heard the motion which has been duly seconded BY MR. POLLARD: I think we had better have the whole report. BY MR. KUSKA (CONTINUING): Whereas, the reaper of time has seen fit in his wisdom to remove from this earth, Mr. Everett Buckingham. And, Whereas Mr. Buckingham was a very valued member of this Association and in his death the Agricultural interests suffered a great loss and he will be missed by all citizens who believe in a greater and better Nebrsaka. Therefore, Be it Resolved that this Association realize the loss of a very valued member whose sound counsel and advice will be missed. Be It Further Resolved that a copy of this resolution be given to the State Press same to be spread on our minutes and a copy thereof be sent to his family. Signed, Val. Kuska Geo. Jackson John T. McGreer </seg>
            <seg id="p431">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 431 BY MR. KUSKA: I now move the adoption of the report of the Committee upon the second resolution. BY CHAIRMAN MAGEE: You have heard the motion made and seconded that this second por - tion of the resolution the Buckingham memorial recognition be adopted. Question. Votes for "Aye" no "Nayes." Motion is carried. BY MR. KUSKA: I now move the adoption of the first portion of the resolutions Motion seconded. BY MR. POLLARD: I move that the following resolution be added to the report of the Resolutions Committee, to-wit: That the Nebraska Dairy Development Association favor the enact - ment of a law by the State that will place Nebraska in cooperation with the Federal Government in the grading of cream. BY MR. HAECKER: That may be all right. I have been working for years to get Ne - braska to pass a law to get all cream put on a graded basis or sold on grades. That sort of a law has generally been defeated by the farm - ers in the Legislature. For what causes I do not know unless they really don't understand the matter, but Gentlemen, this grading of cream and the sale of cream by the rates in this United States is not accomplished yet. We are far from it. The best brains in this country are working upon it and lots of money has been spent in an effort of years to do this. In some sections of some States they are grading cream but be - lieve me they are having a lot of trouble because it is a difficult matter. My heart is in this. I believe we do not have before us enough data upon which to act on this matter of grading cream or selling on grade and I think we better leave this matter to the officers or the Executive Committee of the Dairy Development Society and first have a thorough analysis of the true situation and investigation as to just what the real situation is in Nebraska. I think after we have done that we have enough men in this organization, we certainly ought to have, and if we haven't it would be fortunate, to make a proper petition to the Legislature next Winter and to the Federal Government or Department of Agricul - ture if it is necessary, to take the action we then desire but I don't believe that we are in position now to pass a resolution, because we haven't given the matter the proper study. It is a very difficult matter. I tell you that I have been studying this for years. I know that Pro - fessor Davis has and Professor Fransden before us. There are a lot of </seg>
            <seg id="p432">432 Report of Nebraska State Board op Agriculture men who really want to solve this problem but we feel that it is a very important matter and we also feel that we are not going to solve it by just passing the buck. BY MR. POLLARD: Mr. Haecker and I look at the situation from different angles. He is looking at the situation from the standpoint of the creamery manu - facture of butter and I am looking at the same situation from the stand - point of a man who is milking the cows. That is my trouble. There is just one source in the state that is responsible for that situation and that is the Creamery manufacturers. They accept any kind of cream that comes to them. They place it all on an equal footing. I know from my own experience. I am shipping sweet cream and I get just the same price for it. I don't ship any sour and putrid cream but some of my neighbors do and they get the same price as those of us who ship the other kind of cream. Why should a man ship sweet cream when it only brings the same price as their sour and putrid cream does. There is no object for a farmer to go on shipping sweet cream when he finds that others get the same price for putrid cream as he does for the sweet cream. I am going to modify my motion to this extent or make this motion instead. I move that it be the recommendation of the Society assembled to work out a plan and that they present such a plan to the Legislature. Motion made and seconded. BY MR. POLLARD: It is the sense of this recommendation that the Board of Directors work out a plan and submit it to the legislature. BY MR. MAGEE: You have heard the motion is there any discussion. We would like to hear from our Secretary of Agriculture. BY MR. H. J. McLAUGLIN: I might say this, that I realize, I think more than does anyone here some of the obstacles that are in the way. Our present system, just as Mr. James has brought out, of cream buying stations is all wrong. We cannot get good cream in that way. It is very expensive. He says that it costs us 4%c. Perhaps we have figured a little more closely for I figure that it costs us 5c. We have no incentive to ship sweet cream. I brought this matter up at a Director's Meeting sometime ago. I would have had a resolution here today but I had not heard a word about the matter since that meeting and I just got an idea that the matter had been lost or dropped. Now my ideas ran along the same line that Mr. James has presented here. We have in our State System over three hundred licensed cream buyers. Many of them are men who know abso- </seg>
            <seg id="p433">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 433 lutely nothing about it. Just last week we had an application from one of the big creameries in the State asking us to license a man under a temporary license in which it was stated right up the first of the applica - tion that he knew nothing about it. He wanted to get them down there and then they would go and train him to buy cream. Well I didn't give that permit and I told them, "You cannot open that station until you have somebody ready to take charge who knows about the work." Now that is simply for testing the cream. They just passed the buck. I think we have a very bad system and I think that cream should not only be graded but it should be tested by men in the employ of the State De - partment and not by men in the employ of the creameries. I think this is bad business as it is now handled. Sometimes we almost feel like giving up when we face the universal troubles that the creamery men get into fighting among themselves for the business in these little towns. They ought not to be in these little towns at all with their stations. BY CHAIRMAN MAGEE: The question is up to us as to the adoption of the resolution as amended which provides for referring the whole matter to the Executive Committee. BY MR. POLLARD: I don't think we ought to simply pass the buck. BY CHAIRMAN MAGEE: All in favor of this report of the resolutions be amended to that effect say "Aye." All contrary minded say "Nay." Motion is carried. The Resolutions were so amended BY CHAIRMAN MAGEE: We will now act upon a motion to adopt the report as amended, which motion is duly seconded. Question put. Vote taken. Carried unanimously. The report of the Committee as amended is adopted BY MEMBER: I move that we adjourn. Question put. Carried. Meeting adjourned. </seg>

            <seg id="p435">Nebraska Home Economics Association 435 Nebraska Home Economics Association MINUTES OF THE HOME ECONOMICS SECTION OF ORGANIZED AGRICULTURE January 5, 6, 7, 1926 The twenty-first annual meeting of the Home Economics Section of Organized Agriculture opened Tuesday morning, January 5. The musical numbers on the program for each section were furnished by Lincoln mu - sicians under the direction of Mrs. Carrie B. Raymond. Mrs. C. B. Noyes, President, in her greetings expressed appreciation of so many busy women leaving their homes to learn how to make better homemakers. She gave as her message for the new year the wish that all might endeavor to develop as never before the beauty of their farm homes. Miss Margaret Fedde, Chairman of Home Economics Department, spoke on "Thoughts from Abroad." She opened her remarks by extend - ing wishes to all who were there and hoped they would experience all the joys and more than they had anticipated. In her talk "Thoughts from Abroad," Miss Fedde began with England. She was particularly impressed with its beauty. Even tho the land is ex - pensive, every home, every house had its little garden of beautiful flowers. This seems to have a direct influence on the people of England because of their love for beauty. The hedges also aroused her admiration. These were built with the idea of protection. England is a beautiful country with its many trees and productive farms. Potatoes, vegetables and grains seem to be the principal crops. The country as a whole is very quiet and peaceable. In the northern part of England the houses are built of stone, in the southern part of brick. Many of the houses are duplex and are built with many chimneys because the rooms are heated by fireplace — very few furnaces being built in the houses. Many cattle are found in rural England, hence much milk and butter is produced. However, the English people use very little milk and cream. They do eat a great deal of meat, a variety of vegetables but little fruits. As a whole the people are uniformly courteous. They are proud of their country and all the inhabitants know about the many interesting things and places of their own country. </seg>
            <seg id="p436">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 436 One could not help but notice the absence of prohibition because of the great number of men, women and children going in and out of saloons. In Switzerland, Miss Fedde was impressed with the beauty, the quiet, interesting and industrious people. Such surroundings seemed only fitt - ing for the League of Natione to be located in this country. The Alps are so different from other mountains because of being cul - tivated up to the timber line. Paris is no doubt the most beautiful city in the world. Of course, it has much tragedy asociated with its beauty. In visiting the American cemetery with its 10,000 burial places, one is impressed with the thought that this must not happen again, that we as homemakers must do what we can to prevent history from repeating itself. "The Home, The Child, The School" was the subject of Miss Frances Piekarski, Visiting Teacher, Lincoln Public Schools. Miss Piekarski says that the greatest institutions in the world are the home and the school, Other factors which influence a child's life aside from the home and school are heredity, prenatal period, birth, child's physical make up, adult associates of child, and the food the child eats. After devoting a few minutes to community singing led by Miss Grace Henderson, a demonstration, on first aid in emergencies was given by Mrs. E. T. Overton and Mrs. Fred Heesch both of Nebraska City. This demonstration brought out value of the training which many groups have received in "Home Care of the Sick" project. Tuesday Afternoon A talk on the Home in the Garden, by Professor F. A. Waugh of Am - herst, Mass., seemed to be greatly appreciated by the audience. He said that the home and garden should be in complete unity, that the garden should really be a part of the home. In planning the garden Professor Waugh advocates classifying the space according to use. He suggests not to have too much space for the front yard, to have the garden on the sunny side and if possible the service drive to the north. The private garden should, of course, border the private rooms. Professor Waugh says privacy is to be sought in a garden as well as in a house. For this he suggests the use of hedges. A tennis court, fruit trees, playground and garage belong to the family and should be planned for along with the garden. Our gardens should be of the service type instead of the ornamental. A service garden is not expensive but lends itself for plenty of work. When tnis work is done with joy it becomes a part of the home. The American ideal should be for every family to have a home with a garden around it. </seg>
            <seg id="p437">Nebraska Home Economics Association 437 Following community singing led by Miss Henderson, a talk on "Pos - ture for the Homemaker was given by Miss Mabel Lee, Head of the Physical Education Department of the University. Before introducing her subject, Miss Lee asked the women to use their influence against interschool competitive contests. She said all girls needed physical ed - ucation and any plan which tended to limit the exercises and fun of par - ticipation to a few favored young women is a mistake. In speaking of posture, Miss Lee says there is both mental and phys - ical attributes. She gave a mental picture of the down and out of the bluffer and then the happy medium. The happy medium with chest out, abdomen flat, straight back, eyes looking squarely at one and weight carried on balls of feet, shows efficiency and success. She says that we tell to the world if we are successful by our posture, and that deter - mination for good posture is one of the first essentials. Miss Lee in closing urged homemakers to arrange their household equipment so as to reach for things instead of stooping and to avoid low working surfaces. The last speaker for the afternoon was Dr. Olga Stastny of Omaha, Nebr., who spoke on "Keeping Fit at Forty." She urged each to look fit for their age whether it be 20, 30, or 40 years. By keeping fit she meant keeping every muscle and joint in good working order. Health at any age is beautiful. She urged mothers to register well the responsibility of being a mother to girls — to prepare them for physical changes that will come and to encourage schools to take care of their physical well being. Dr. Stastny urges one to engage in work that they are interested in and really enjoy because this avoids drudgery and one can do so many more hours of work. Adjusting work so as to do it sanely also helps to keep one happy. Dr. Stastny says that 40 is a beautiful time of life if one understands it — avoid too sudden let up in work and interest. She emphasized exer - cise to bring into play muscles not otherwise used. Following the program a tea was given in the Home Economics parlors by the Home Economics resident and Extension staff. Mrs. Samuel Avery, Mrs. E. A. Burnett, Miss Fedde and Miss Mary-Ellen Brown were in the receiving line. Wednesday Forenoon One hour of the morning program was devoted to reports of Home Demonstration projects carried on in various counties. Miss Mary-Ellen Brown had charge of the hour. The following outline was used in report - ing work done: 1. What Home Demonstration project was in the county the past year. 2. Number of groups enrolled. </seg>

She said the Federation is 35 years old, that its 125 activities are all created for the home and its betterment. The outstanding measures for the clubs for the coming two years are: 1. Better homes. 2. Law observance and law enforcement. 3. International peace. Community singing led by Miss Muriel Smith of the Agricultural Extension Service, was next on the program. After this Mrs. C. W. </seg>
            <seg id="p439">Nebraska Home Economics Association 439 Sewell, second vice-president of the Indiana Farm Bureau Federation, Otterbein, Indiana, spoke on "Woman's Part in Rural Progress." Mrs. Sewell says it is doing the little things of life that makes houses become homes. She says Webster defines homes as a place of one's abode; that some children define it as the place where Ma is; others define it as a place for the family to quarrel. She says we may find many of these types of homes but to make a real home worth while is a big responsibility and yet a great privilege. To be a successful homemaker one takes many long hard lessons of ex - perience. Mrs. Sewell urges one to distinguish between the essentials and the non-essentials, not only to give more time to her family in a social way but for self improvement. She also says that women have a par - ticular fitting for school administrative offices. She says that there is no place outside of the home that a farm woman has more chance for rural progress than in the schools. Rural churches also lend them - selves for contributing to rural progress and community clubs. Through these we learn to know and understand each other. She said that the aim of the Farm Bureau is to advance, promote and protect business economics, legislative and educational social in - terest of farm families. "The Newer Understanding of Child Behavior" was the subject for discussion by Mrs. May Pardee Youtz, from the Child Welfare Research Bureau in Iowa . She began her discussion by saying that more people underestimate a child's intelligence and that the golden years for learning* are in the plastic years which are the very early years. She says that a child is not responsible for his actions until he has had some experience. Up to this time a child's nervous system acts as a machine. His behavior is a reaction to his environment. Because of this she urged low hooks so that the tiny tots may hang their own clothes, low basin for washing, small table and chairs to be occasionally used to serve his own meals, his own play corner and his own sand table. In discussing behavior problems three things are essential: 1. Father and mother function in a coordinate way. 2. Child must be well. 3. Child must have activity. Since conduct is motivated by satisfaction, a parent should see that the child gets satisfaction doing the desired thing instead of being dissatisfied. In summarizing her remarks, Mrs. Youtz left the follow - ing thought with her audience. </seg>
            <seg id="p440">440 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 1. Make the most of a child's intelligent golden age (before 6 years old). 2. Child is most plastic when young. 3. In the field of behavior, child must be well. 4. 'Environment influences the child. 5. Dwell in the positive. 6. Regard good impulses. Praise child when doing good Wednesday Afternoon Margaret Trobaugh and Irene Hart, both of Clay Center, gave a demonstration of whole wheat bread. Mrs. Youtz's next contribution was "The Little Child and Fear.'' She said that in our modern life there is no particular need of fear. Psychologists find that infants have two fears — falling and loud noise. Mrs. Youtz says that some of the deviations in adults can be traced to fear in childhood. That is, often awakened through early fright. If one were to find a child afraid, we must sympathetically try to correct this. Such a re-education will take time, understanding and patience. Associating these fears with something the child likes will help to tircome this. Bringing things out into the open has a good effect, closing, she analyzed the difference between caution and fear. After the discussion of "fear" led by Mrs. Youtz, Miss Muriel Smith again led the audience in community singing. L. I. Frisbie, head of Boys and Girls Clubs, spoke briefly on club work. He said he con - sidered club activities the greatest achievement in any class of agri - culture. Club work is developing real citizenship. He said club boys and girls learn the value of ownership, partnership, sportsmanship and leadership. "Our Feet in Relation to Health" was the subject discussed by Dr. Robert Schrock of Omaha. He pointed out that the first requisites of happiness is health and that the essentials for this are food, work, rest, and play. He said that two things which destroy health and happiness are disease and injury. After explaining the mechanism of the foot, Dr. Schrock showed how the wearing of too small shoes caused foot discomfort. The heel of the foot is for support while the mid and front parts are for equili - brium. To perform these duties the foot needs freedom which can come only by wearing shoes which will permit the toes to have plenty of "play." The efficiency of a machine depends on the smoothness it can work. The human machine can not work smoothly with, painful feet. Dr. Schrock discouraged the habit of wearing old dress shoes with crooked heels about the house when working as well as the habit of a </seg>
            <seg id="p441">Nebraska Home Economics Association 441 shoe needing to be "broken in." Such a shoe is too small for the foot. He encouraged the habit of sitting down when performing many of the household duties. The Wednesday's program closed with the Farmers' Fun Feed. Thursday Forenoon The first hour of the program was again in charge of Miss Mary- Ellen Brown who called on the rest of the Project Leaders who had not given a report of the Home Demonstration project work in their respective counties. "Management of Time" was the subject discussed by Miss Greta Gray, Research Specialist in Home Management, University of Ne - braska. Miss Gray said that every homemaker had an income of 24 hours a day and that this time is more precious than gold. If it is not used it is lost forever. Too often it is regarded too carelessly, even people remark about "killing time." One may have money to burn but no one can afford to kill time. If time is not spent carefully, it loses its worth. Miss Gray says if country people spent time on useless things it is because of one of three reasons: 1. Lack of incentive — if one has interest in doing a thing they find time to do it. 2. Lack of appreciation of value of time. One who exceeds best is one who makes every minute count. Not all work, but rest working or enjoying life. 3. Lack of knowledge to do work Following community singing led by Miss Henderson, Miss Bess Steele of the Home Economics Department, spoke on "Flower Arrange - ments." In. introducing this subject, Miss Steele said that a flower garden is one of the most delightful ways to occupy time. In arranging bouquets Miss Steele pointed out the following principles: 1. Harmony. 2. Balance. 3. Rhythm. 4. Achievement of subordination. 5. Proportion. 6. Order. She said to also avoid highly glazed or highly decorated receptables. Bowls with outward flare and of glass are more interesting. Flowers are like jewels beautiful themselves, but can be made more beauti - fol by the setting. </seg>
            <seg id="p442">442 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Mrs. Youtz's next contribution was "Why Children Lie." This habit often, has its beginning in handling imagination. A child needs to have explained the difference between a plan and what has actually happened. When a lie is told a parent should see to it that the child understands that they know this is a story. If old enough it may be well to have a child write it down. Help a child to see real things in relation to imaginary things. Older children often lie to escape punishment. Sacred right of truth must be trained by the parents. More affection often helps to prevent lies. A short business meeting was held at this time. The courtesy committee submitted the following: "As the twenty-first annual meeting of the Nebraska Home Econ - omics Association is drawing to a close, we wish to extend our thanks and hearty appreciation to our efficient and faithful officers, the visiting women who have left their work at home and helped to make these meetings such a success; to the registration committee, who report a signed membership of 367; to the decoration committee; to those of the faculty and students who so graciously acted as hostesses at the tea; to Mrs. Raymond and the musicians who have taken time to come and add to our enjoyment; to each and every one of the speakers, whose excellent addresses have been so well worth while. Especially do we congratulate our president, Mrs. Noyes, and those of the College of Agriculture who have been responsible for these excellent programs." Mrs. Ernest Overton Miss Jessie Greene Mrs. E. A. Burnett, Chairman COURTESY COMMITTEE. The chairman of the nominating committee made the following rec - ommendation for officers for the ensuing year: Mrs. Ida Wilkens Berger, Nehawka, President. Mrs. A. R. Leavitt, North Platte, Vice-president. Miss Florence Atwood, Lincoln, Secretary. Motion was made and seconded that the recommendations of the nominating committee be accepted. Motion carried. Thursday Afternoon "Are you Equipped for Your Job" was the subject discussed by Miss Eloise Davison, assistant professor, Home Economics, Ames, la. Miss Davison said that each homemaker's home is a branch office of the world's biggest job which is homekeeping. She said that too often the mere mechanics of living crowded out the real fundamentals of home - making. If one never gets beyond the mechanics of the home she is unjust to herself and to those she serves. Miss Davison urged that the women organize and use equipment </seg>
            <seg id="p443">Nebraska Home Economics Association 443 which will save time and mean less drudgery of hand labor. This should release time for homemaking as opposed to housekeeping. Mrs. Youtz's last contribution was "Learning to Live with the Group." She says learning means having experience. Since the family is the first group a child lives with, these standards should be observed in every home: 1. Mutual love and mutual desire for children 2. Sound heredity and congenial health 3. Sufficiency of economic resources. The family has the golden opportunity to aid in developing the child's personality. Discipline helps to adjust a child to the social group. Mrs. Dietrick substituted for Mrs. Lulu Kortz Hudson. Mrs. Dietrick talked on "How Far the Home May Reach." For this she based her remarks on her trip abroad. In closing, Mrs. Noyes gave a touching illustration of some of her observations in life. Her thought was, Are we living in such a way that the minor things are shutting out God's way to our light and living. She urged each not to slight the essentials of a house in order to make a home but to find time to do things and then do them. The total registration was announced as 450 Fig. 1 — Lectures by good speakers were on every program. </seg>
            <seg id="p444">444 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Mothers' Vacation Camps Project leaders of Nebraska will not forget the rest, recreation and inspiration received in six district Mothers' Vacation Camps, which were held this year as a part of the Home Demonstration work in Nebraska. Adjoining counties co-operated in each of these camps which were held at Deweese, Tecumseh, Aldington, New Helena, Curtis and Oakwood Lodge. A total of 27 counties were represented in these camps. These district camps gave the leaders in different counties an op - portunity to visit with old friends, make new friendships and to plan for work which they would like to accomplish in the Home Demonstra - tion field. Each camp lasted three days. A total of 232 leaders were enrolled and attended the full time at one of these camps. Miss Margaret Cleland was employed for the recreation periods. Her experience in teaching school and in chautauqua, gave her a good background for this work. At times Miss Cleland had these women, who in their homes are at work from early morning until late at night, playing games, singing or enjoying stories. Each of these were such that the leaders could use them at home with their families, or at a community meeting. Vacation Camps did not mean all play for the leaders. Miss Cleland held round table discussions on discipline and recreational problems in Fig. 2 — Answering the breakfast whistle was all there was to getting breakfast. </seg>
            <seg id="p445">Nebraska Home Economics Association 445 the home. These discussions were centered around the topics, "Recrea - tion for Mothers," and "Helping Little Tots to Amuse Themselves." Every homemaker meets such problems and these 232 mothers were grateful to Miss Cleland for the help she was able to give them. A number of these came to Miss Cleland for individual conferences on their own per - sonal home problems for they had so much confidence in her. The women left the camp feeling that this work had been an inspiration to them and they could go home and be better companions to the various mem - bers of their families. Miss Elva Norris of the Department of Agriculture also assisted, with the three August camp programs. Miss Norris told the women which weeds were the most obnoxious, those which are new and which are getting a greater foothold in Nebraska and how to best fight their advancement. At each camp collections of weeds were made, their names learned, and their habits studied. After this a weed contest was held. In one camp 26 varieties were entered in the contest and many of the leaders were able to correctly name nearly all of them. Such a study as this helps the women to feel more familiar with the great outdoors which is all around a rural home. Another part of the program was a discussion on "What Farm Women Desire." The results of the round tables held in connection with this topic are as follows: Fie. 3 — The mothers will long remember the rows of cots in the sleeping quarters. </seg>

            <seg id="p453">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 453 FIRST SESSION Tuesday Afternoon, January 5, 1926 The 1926 convention of the Nebraska State Horticultural Society met in Boom 106, Plant Industry Building, Agricultural College Campus, Lincoln, on Tuesday, January 5, and was called to order by the Presi - dent, W. B. Banning, of Union, at 2:30 p. m. THE PRESIDENT: I am glad to see so goodly a number present. I hope tomorrow we will have the room full. PRESIDENTS ADDRESS MR. W. B. BANNING, Union, Nebraska As a Society, we are interested in agriculture. The old Society formed some years ago pursued a course of membership. It seems as though the order of things has changed in the last few years, and we have not maintained a regular paid Secretary. As far as our member - ship is concerned, it is practically a thing of the past. Nevertheless, the old members of the Society are still interested in this work. When we talk along the line of Horticulture, I think we ought to look not alone at the fruit industry, but we ought to look after the planting of trees and shrubs in general. At the present time, I think it takes considerable nerve to operate and undertake to grow an orchard. I know it takes considerable work and some expense, because I have had the experience and I think I know, as Experience is a good teacher. But as far as I have progressed, I have been well repaid, and am well satisfied with the venture. At the present time I contemplate increasing these plantings if possible. I have lived in the eastern part of Nebraska all my life. I know the early settlers always located where there were trees. I have sometimes wondered why they would settle in the roughest part of the country along these rivers, when they could have stepped back two miles and found valuable farm land; but they came from a country where there had been trees. Some of the rest of you remember when Nebraska did not have so very many trees. I can remember when the homesteads in the eastern part were practically barren of trees. Owing to the thoughtfulness of the pioneers, we are privileged to enjoy the trees and plants of our fore - fathers. It is for us to increase these plants. I was forcefully impressed last spring in driving through parts of Colorado by the absence of trees. What a pleasant view it was to come to a farm home with some trees and shrubs planted around it!. They gave a better appearance to the country. We have been worrying about planting too many orchards in Ne - braska. However, that is improbable. In the eastern part we are doing </seg>
            <seg id="p454">454 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture more planting than in the central and western parts. When I started planting in 1917, I did not suppose there would be very many more or - chards around there. They have increased from time to time, and are still increasing. We have a great tract of land in the southeastern part of this state better adapted for planting of orchards than land anywhere else in the state, and as favorable as anywhere in the world for this type of crop. We can grow as nice fruit there as anywhere. We think we can grow the nicest fruit and there is very little danger of over - planting. The farm orchard is all right and fills a need but the average farmer will not plant a small orchard and take care of it in the manner he should. He will make the argument he can. buy his apples cheaper than he can raise them. He prefers to put his energy on some other line; therefore I think the commercial orchard is the thing we should have, especially in eastern Nebraska. There is no danger of over-production along the fruit line. There is always a market for it. We can raise and market these apples at a profit in eastern Nebraska far better than the growers in the western states with high freight rates. We are not afraid of competition. In my estimation, we should encourage more orchard plantings in Nebraska. We should not neglect the plantings of home orchards and beauti - fying the homes, however. You can not pass a beautiful home that is landscaped without having your attention called to it, because it is a place of beauty. Another thing we should do is to learn something about those plant - ings and the best location for them, and how to put them out. This applies both to trees and ornamental shrubbery. If you do not do this, you may find you have planted them in the wrong place, either from the viewpoint of ornamentation, or for their best development. It takes al - most a lifetime to raise a beautiful shade tree. We are going to plant something that will be there for others after we are gone. I think we should pay more attention to the plantings of our home grounds and surroundings; be careful in our selection; buy from a reputable firm; get them planted, and take pride in seeing them grow. I always take pride in seeing plants develop and how much better I can make them by giving them attention when they need it. You can not neglect an orchard and expect satisfactory results. It must have as much attention and thought - ful care as a field of corn, yes, much more, because it must necessarily remain in one place for 30 years or more. There is nothing that will raise the value of the land any faster than a good orchard. I know that from experience. I have kept an account of my expenses and the cost of my land, of which this orchard comprises forty-two acres, and I know I could not put on the land anything that would make the return that the orchard would, if I wanted to sell it at the present time. Another thing: We can gain a great deal by co-operating with the Extension Department. This organization stands ready at any and all </seg>
            <seg id="p455">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 455 times to give a grower any aid he wants in growing his orchard. I have received valuable information, which has been appreciated, from this Department in the matter of growing an orchard. I think you people who have seen my orchard will agree it looks fairly successful. I notice the Secretary did not want me to talk too long. He gave me fifteen minutes. I will not overstep it. Next on the program was to have been an address by W. J. Court - right of Fremont, but he was unable to be present. Mr. Jackson, an at - torney from Nebraska City who has a mighty nice flower garden, was to have taken his place but he does not seem to have arrived as yet We will be glad to hear from him when he arrives. We will now hear from Mr. Sass, of Bennington, on "Growing the Iris." I am sure you will be interested in listening to him. GROWING THE IRIS MR. JACOB SASS, Bennington, Nebr. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: Last year when I attended your meeting I told you a few things about growing and breeding the Iris. Evidently I did not exhaust the subject then for the Secretary invited me to again appear before the State Horticultural Society on a similar subject. Naturally it would be difficult to tell all about my ex - periences in growing the Iris in one hour for this has been my hobby for eighteen years. During that time we have grown about 45,000 seed - lings of every imaginary color. At present we have about 300 named sorts. We grow many sorts which do well here in Nebraska and try to grow many others that will not grow well. The Iris is divided into many groups. I will devote my talk chiefly to the Bearded Iris, sometimes called the German Iris. The Bearded Iris are divided into three main groups, namely the Pumilas, the In - termediata and the Late. The Pumilas are the first to bloom and are only about 4 inches tall, the color ranging from white to blackish purple. They grow easily and rapidly and bloom luxuriantly every spring. We have counted 200 flowers on a two year old plant. Theyare very hardy too. We have had them in bloom many a time when there is snow on the ground. The buds seem very resistant to cold. .We have never had them freeze. All the flowers of this group are above the leaves. The Pumilas may be planted in corners to cover or hide unsightly places or along walks or fences or borders. They do best in places where it gets real hot during the summer. Varieties — White, Schusappi, Purple Cyana, Yellow Excelsior, Red Purple Lureda, Red Purple Yellow Socrates. There are many more good varieties belonging to the group but the above mentioned are among the best. The Intermediates are second on the list. They are derived from crossing the Tall Bearded Iris and the Pumilas. They vary in height </seg>
            <seg id="p456">456 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture from fifteen to twenty-two inches. Last year they started blooming April 20th and bloomed until the middle of May. There is also the Tall Bearded group or the Late group. These are every imaginable color. At present we do not have a purple sort but some day by crossing them we expect to attain this prize too. The Late Iris bloom from May 5th until June 20th. Their height varies from twenty to fifty-two inches. Some of the flowers are seven inches from top to bottom. I will give you the names of some of the varieties of Iris, the first group at present selling at two dollars a dozen; the second group at five dollars a dozen, and the third group from ten to thirty-five dollars a dozen, the first fourteen varieties in this last group selling at twenty In crossing the Irish, my brother, H. B. Sass, has originated one that blooms in the fall. He calls it "Autumn King." It is a dark purple, and it blooms in the spring, as well. It grows thirty inches high. Crossing it again, we had one hundred seedlings. In September we had thirty seedlings in bloom. There is nothing like it in the United States, and I do not believe England or France produces anything like it. They had one in France, but it was not a true fall bloomer. We had all shades, from a dark purple to pu« white. Growing Iris from seed is a game in itself. The first thing one should have in mind is the vigor of the plants and a careful record of the crosses. Only the best should be used. We find many Iris that are weak growing, like the Lady Foster. On the other hand, there is the Rhein Nixe and the Perfection of which you can grow one hundred plants to twelve of the former. Again, we find many Iris that are ster - ile and we can not go any further with them. Sometimes we have to go back to the Pumilas for crossing, but we have found that this is a step in the wrong direction. You may grow a weak sort for five years and then have only four or five plants. If you plant the vigorous one you dollars a dozen.

            <seg id="p457">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 457 will have so many in that length of time you won't know what to do with them. For this reason we eliminated a lot of these weak growers and now work only with the vigorous ones. The crossing is done in the flower stage before the flowers are open. Pollen is taken from one sort that we think will transmit desired char - acteristics and placed on the pistils of another sort that also has desired characteristics. The seeds from these cross pollinated flowers should be gathered when ripe — that is, when the pods begin to turn yellow. The seeds are picked out of the pods and placed in an envelope which is laid flat in a dry place to prevent mold. In October the seeds are sown and the following spring these germinate and produce plants. The following year the young plants bloom and we can then tell whether any of the new seedlings are worth saving. So many people are doing just this sort of thing with flowers that one must have something outstanding to be worthy of propagation. For this reason many hundreds of seedlings must be grown before we find one that is suitable for pushing on the trade channels. Crossing the Irish to secure certain desired colors is a thing we have been working on for years but we have not been entirely successful as yet. One of our aims has been to produce a true red Iris. We have taken the two that are nearest our ideal and crossed them, planted the seeds and cultivated the young plants until they bloomed only to find that not a single one will fill the bill entirely. We have gotten several shades closer and now we must repeat the operation again. Perhaps in ten or twenty years more we will have attained just what we started out to do. The same thing can be said about the ideal white Iris. At present there is no satisfactory white Iris in existence. I bought two high priced to cross last year. The disappointments are many in this game. After the seeds are gathered and planted one has to grow the seedlings, transplant the most likely looking vigorous ones in May and then grow them another year before they bloom. Then the best one is picked out and propagated, perhaps only to find that someone else has beaten us to it and produced one even a little better than your best. Then you have to start over again in the hopes that next time you can beat the others to it. But that is the course of progress and we stick to it year after year. We are interested in this work and many new people are met each year who are becoming interested in our work and our place. You can understand why a new Iris is high in cost. Years ago there were not many Iris growers in the United States who grew on a big scale. Mr. Farr was the first one; then Mr. Fry or and some more. After the war, the price of Iris jumped high. To my surprise, the American introduction were the highest priced. Every - body who raised a seedling Iris thought it was good; he named it and put it out only to find out something else was better. </seg>
            <seg id="p458">458 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture That is why the American Iris Society was started. They started a test garden in New York. You are supposed to send your nicest crea - tions there. They are grown two years, and are judged by five or seven competent judges in blooming time. Each judge scores them what he thinks they deserve. The next day another judge does the same thing and so on. Then they compare notes and give a silver certificate to the best one. In that way they think they will eliminate all the worthless ones. That is about the only way they can do it, although of course you have the right to introduce your things and sell as much as you can. However, with this method it is much easier to get the recognition an outstanding new variety deserves. I should advise everybody who is interested to join the Society. The dues are only three dollars a year. Discussion Q. What kind of soil is best for the Iris ? A. They will grow in almost any soil. Do not, however, select a location where the water stands. They dislike wet feet. If you have flat soil I would advise you to make a raised bed. In planting them, do not plant too deep. Q. How often should they be replanted? I mean if we have a bed just for ornamental purposes. A. For commercial use, they should be replanted every three or four years. For landscaping, that is not necessary. You do not need to replant; but you can divide and take off what you like. You can leave them eight or ten years in the same bed. There is one thing you can do with Iris: You can plant for landscape work when the plants are in bloom. That is rare with flowering plants of a perennial nature. You can take the whole plant with its flower stems and set it among your shrubs. If you do not like it there permanently remove it when it is through blooming. Q. Are any of the varieties especially resistant to rot ? A. A year ago the Iris was full of rot. Nobody knew what to do with it or what it was. It works like any other root rot. By pulling out one of the Iris leaves that have turned yellow, one can see the rotted roots. The bulb does not rot. It stays hard. There are two kinds of rot. One kind starts in the leaves and works downward. After a rain and then dry weather, you will find on the leaves little red specks like mustard seed. There is also a fungus dis - ease from the roots. It may be a bacterial trouble. ' As a remedy we used a lot of things and thought we had killed it, but we found no rot on those we did not treat. A good many thought they killed something, but I do not think they did. It was not there. In the springtime you can pick them up and they will have no roots or leaves. I cut off every bit of root and dipped them in a solution of formaldehyde, about one pint to thirty gallons of water, and planted them in a row. It seemed to me those treated came up quicker than those not treated. Today you can not tell the difference. </seg>
            <seg id="p459">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 459 Frost will do the same thing. Suppose we have this hot weather for two weeks. Then we have 20" below zero. Your Iris will freeze and you will have plenty of rot the next spring. The root rot comes on while the Iris is in bloom. You will find some morning it has started to develop. That is the time to cut everything away — roots and bulbs — and throw them in the hot sun for at least three days. If 100°, so much the better. Put them in the ground and in three weeks they will begin to grow again. Q. What kind of manure would you recommend to use on Iris? A. None whatever. Q. Can you get the soil too rich for Iris? A. I do not know exactly, but if you do, you are more liable to get rot, because they will grow so fast and increase so much that the water will get in and stay there. In this case the plants are liable to get more rot I presume. I can not say definitely that this is the case because it does not always work that way. I would advise not too rich a soil. A little covering of straw will prevent freezing and thawing and reduce the danger from root rot. Q. Suppose you grow them in. the same place six or seven years How should I enrich the soil? A, If you think your ground is becoming poor, top dress with well rotted manure and gradually work it into the ground. Do not put manure in the hole and then plant the Iris on it. I plant my Iris and top dress with manure. Q. How long will the old bed stand before being renewed? A. You do not have to transplant. I know beds that have stood for twenty years in the same place without thinning or transplanting. Q. That is where the rot comes in. A. In all my experience, we only had rot one year, except as a result of freezing and thawing. The old Iris does not freeze easily. If it does, transplant it and you will be surprised how much better it looks and how much larger the flowers will be. Q. Wouldn't you advise anyone to leave the Iris four or five years ? A. That all depends. I do not transplant all of them every four or five years. When propagating for commercial purposes you must, however, because you want an increase in roots as quickly as possible. If you want large flowers, you must transplant every three or four years. Q. In your opinion, would the fall blooming Iris be a successful home Iris to plant generally over the state? Is it one that will stand hard knocks? A. I think it will. It is too high-priced yet for general planting. Later on when it gets cheaper, yes; because it is just as hardy an Iris </seg>
            <seg id="p460">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 460 as we have. It is a fast increasing variety. It makes two plants where the present Iris makes one, because it discards. Ordinarily there is just one time in the spring when the Iris blooms. This one is both spring and fall blooming, so it must increase twice as fast as the other varieties or it could not exist. It is hardy, and a sure bloomer in this locality. Why not have one in the fall as well as in the spring? It is more of a curiosity at that time. It is dark purple in color. Q. How expensive is it? A. Five dollars a root. Q. Is it the same species ? A. It is grown from the others. Q. I saw a species this summer in bloom in August. A. This species is absolutely the Tall Bearded or German Iris, grown from a seedling Iris my brother had grown years before, which he called "Seedling No. 1." It was forty to fifty-two inches high. He crossed it. Out of three hundred seedlings, this one bloomed in the fall and the next spring and the second fall. It was transplanted, and to oar surprise it has kept on. It is becoming more full of flowers every year. Q. These flowers open only at night. A. This one is five and one-half inches from top to bottom. Q. What time in the fall does it bloom? A. As early as August 20. My brother had one plant and put it in a pot, and it bloomed until the sixth of December. It blooms in the spring the same time as the ordinary varieties. This year it started to bloom about September first. In the fall the stems do not grow so high as in the spring, but we counted seventeen buds on one stem, with six flowers open at the same time. Q. After it starts blooming in the fall, does it hang until cold weather? A. Yes. The frost kills it down. A year ago we did not have much frost early. It stands a little frost. This one he put in a pot to ripen the seeds and it shot another flower stem. That is why it bloomed so long. Q. Is there any advantage in cutting away the blooming stalk soon as the blossoms fade? A. Not that we can find. If you do not care for the seed, I would advise you to cut the blooming stalk away for the reason the seed will take the strength out of your plant. If there is no seed on the stalk, I do not think there is any advantage in cutting away the stalk, because it will die down, but of course it makes your plant look a little ragged with the old dead stem left on the plant. </seg>
            <seg id="p461">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 461 THE PRESIDENT: The Horticultural Society last summer put on a two day's tour of the orchards in eastern Nebraska and northern Kansas. This tour was well attended and I think it was of benefit to all of those who went along. That was not the first tour nor the last. Each year we will try to put on a tour of these orchards and vineyards in order that we may come in touch with them and see them growing. We can tell you about an orchard and some one can explain it, but if you can see that orchard and see how the other fellow handles it, you will learn something. I have always said when a fellow got too old to learn, I think it is time to get out of the way. We can always learn something from the other person who follows the same line of business as we. They have had some experiences we have not, while we may have had some experiences they have not. We can look these fruit plantings over and discuss their problems and find out how the various men meet them. If we should put on one of those tours next summer, I hope all of you can participate. I am sure you will enjoy it and it will be a couple of days of instruction, as well. Next on our program is a paper on "Peonies," by H. P. Sass, of Bennington. He is not present in person but he has prepared a paper and his brother will deliver the paper. PEONIES MR. H. P. SASS, Bennington, Nebraska Ladies and Gentlemen: Much of the present-day popularity of the peony must be credited to a Nebraska man, the late Rev. Harrison, of York, Nebraska. He was a most able writer and lecturer on the beauti - ful, and in this the peony received his fullest attention. It was in 1904 that he issued his Peony Manual in which he brought together a lot of instructive material about this flower. Another man from this state, Mr. Rosenfield, did much for the peony, especially in producing seedlings of merit. His "Karl Rosen - field" is one of the highest rated peonies in commerce. Last year he introduced two new varieties, which undoubtedly will be worthy. At present he lives in Indianapolis, Ind. But I am going to tell of Growing Peonies in Nebraska. There are many species, but I will confine myself to the Chinese varieties, derived from Peonia Albiflora. This is a native of Siberia where the climatic conditions are similar to ours, and the Dakotas, and even colder. As our soil is a most fertile black loam, this peony is admirably adapted to our conditions. I use no manure when setting out a new bed, only a new location where peonies have not been grown previously. After a year or two, manure may be broadcasted in the fall, and incorporated with the soil in spring. On heavy soil, lime should be added, and it is of benefit to </seg>
            <seg id="p462">462 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture spread lime on old clumps. Sometimes it is a case of hard and sour soil when plants refuse to bloom, but often it is in the variety. There are shy bloomers as well as floriferous varieties. Old root-bound clumps should be dug and divided. Cut away the knotty roots, and if nema - todes are present, strip them off. Reset in new soil with the buds not more than three inches below the surface. I would advise to plant on raised beds, rather than in a depression, as the peonies will not endure water standing on them. For best results the bed should be mulched the first winter to prevent heaving of the roots. If healthy roots of fair size are planted, most all will bloom next spring. Of course some flowers will be inferior, especially of the large flowered varieties. If kept free from weeds, the clumps will in - crease and bloom for a dozen years, or longer. I have counted as many as fifty flowers on one clump. For propagating, I divide every second or third year, according to the size of root set out. I think nothing is gained in dividing every year, as you will have nothing but small roots in the end, hardly fit for sale. For cut-flower purposes, peonies should have a sheltered location, and be kept as long as they produce profitably. Peonies planted in the open have shorter stems, and are injured by weeds. Some varieties are far more vigorous than others, and for that reason multiply more rapidly. These same varieties are more reliable bloomers, too. Unfortunately, some of the most rare in color seem to be lacking in vigor. Many growers claim that over-propagation is the cause of this. I hardly believe so. Over-breeding may be more correct. I think they are the progeny of weak parents. This brings me to the problem of raising seedlings. In raising seed - ling peonies, one must keep records, as it is far more interesting than raising from a mixture. Right in the start, about sixteen years ago, I thought if one wants to breed for size, he must select robust growers with strong stems; so I selected Mons. Jules Elie as a seed parent, and Mile Rosseau as the pollen parent. At first I did not pay attention to the foliage, but later noted that Mile. Rosseau has large, bright green foliage, and many of the seedlings partook of this. Another surprise was that more than 50 per cent came double and semi-double. Most of the plants were strong growers, some even stronger than their par - ents. There were some very large flowers, but too bulky, and many of these proved to be hard buds later on. By breeding two weak-growing varieties together, I had the same experience. You could tell the seed - lings apart from the others in the row, nearly to a plant, all being smaller and with less bloom. In breeding for color, pink varieties will appear from any cross, but you can breed for color to a certain extent. By breeding two white var - ieties together, you will have many whites; some whites with bluish cen - ters, and only a few reds. The «ame thing happens if you breed two reds together — the majority will be *-ed and dark pink. As to the yellow </seg>
            <seg id="p463">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 463 peony, I think this is a secret which nobody knows. Still it may be possible, as there are some full rose, light pink varieties with a yellow tinted center — Gold Nugget Phelomell — but these are generally sterile. There is also a difference in the shape of the flower with different varieties. Among the semi-rose varieties you will find the flat, bowl - shaped form, and also the globe-shaped, with incurved petals; but the petals should be regularly arranged and the flowers well formed. Next I would select varieties with tall, straight, and wiry stems. The foliage should be large, of a bright green color, and low down on the stem. Many varieties are top-heavy on account of the foliage being too high. In cut - ting the flower of these sorts too much of the foliage is removed and the plants suffer. Earliness is another and very desirable character. In this I would suggest hybridizing with the European species and varieties. In my experiment, seed set readily, but the seedlings have not proven very vigorous, with none of blooming age at present. All the characteristics mentioned can be found in the different vari - eties, and it should be our aim to combine as many as possible of the good characteristics in one. The peony is not yet perfect. Peony seed must be planted as soon as it turns brown in color. This is when the seed pods split. Planted in moist soil and mulched right after planting, most of the seed will germinate the next spring. In selecting a list of dependable varieties, I will first call your at - tention to the American Peony Society. This was organized in 1903 with the aim of fostering public interest in the peony, and to straighten out the nomenclature. Many varieties ran under several names, and by planting test gardens, the many synonyms could be detected and elim - inated. The next step was the rating of the peony. In this the members voed on the different varieties, and the average gave the rating, 100 per cent being considered perfect. At present most of the growers use these ratings in their catalogues, which is a good guide for the buyer, as the varieties rated about 80 per cent are considered choice ones. Some of these high-rated peonies are rather new and their rating will come down; while among the older varieties there are quite a few choice ones rated below 80 per cent. Among these are two of the first peonies to bloom, which are seldom missing for Decoration Day. They are Edulis Superba, and Grandiflora Nivea Plena, both very fine and sure to bloom. In white varieties, the next to bloom are Mad. de Verneville and Festiva Maxima, both first class cut-flower varieties. The next to flower is Jubilee, originated by Mrs. Pleas in Indiana. This, in my opinion, is the grandest white peony. It is a vigorous grower with very large flowers, on tall stems. With the white varieties I will class Primvere, the yellow peony. In the sun it fades to a creamy white, but taken into the house it will hold its color, which is surely fine. The seedlings of Primvere I find to be pale with a yellow center, extra fine, but mostly with weak stems. </seg>
            <seg id="p464">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 464 Of the late whites, one of the very finest is Grace Loomis, originated by Professor Saunders of Clinton, N. Y. But the late varieties will some - times be caught by a hot wave, and then the buds may not open per - fectly, which is really not a fault of the peony. In pink peonies we have perhaps more choice varieties than in any other colors. Edulis Superba is the first to flower. Mons. Jules Elie soon follows. This is the largest variety of the bomb type. Next in order of blooming time comes Therese, one of the grandest peonies in existence. Its rating is 98 perfection. Rhine Hortense has many good points, and among the late pink varieties, Martha Bulloch, Albert Crousse, Maud L. Richardson, and Milton ill are first-class varieties. Red peonies are very popular, and among the newer varieties are some brilliant colors. The Brand varieties — Longfellow and Mary Brand — are first-class. As a dark red, Adolphe Rosseau is one of the best. It is a tall-stemmed vigorous variety. Felix Crousse is a light red, and a good grower and multiplier. For midseason, Karl Rosenfield holds first place. The darkest red peony, Cahuzac, is only a moderate grower, but should be added to any collection. Almost all of the late red vari - eties have a purplish cast. Discussion (Answers by Jacob Sass) Q. How many plants can you divide a peony into at the end of three years? A. I should judge from four to six plants. Q. Do you have trouble with the insects eating the buds? A. No; there is not insect eating the buds. Q. They have trouble with them in western Nebraska. A. There are lots of ants and flies, and a good many people think they do harm; but they are only after the sweet juices which come out of the bud. There might be some insects injurious to the peony in west - ern Nebraska. I do not know. Q. The bud never opens. Is there anything to be done when the buds do not open? A. No. I do not know what you could do with these hard buds. They are found sometimes on the very best peonies — the later varieties. Q. We often have people ask us why peonies that have been out over five years won't bloom in a certain place. A. That is a very difficult question to answer. We have been asked that many times also. A good many times you can attribute it to dis - eased roots. I believe nine times out of ten, the planter is to blame. I can show instance after instance where he is at fault. My neighbor got some peonies ana planter them. Next year he said, "I saw you plant </seg>
            <seg id="p465">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 465 these last year, and two-thirds have bloomed. Mine only grew a foot high." I found he dug a hole with a butcher knife in blue grass sod, and in this he planted the roots. The eye was on top of the ground. It is a wonder the plant grew as high as it did. Q. To get good bloomers, peonies should be reset every few years ? A. For commercial use, my choice would be every three years; for cut flowers, every eight or ten years. Take the very highest priced peony which is rated 99 per cent, and supposed to be the finest white peony in existence. I have seen it several times in shows and it is nothing to get excited about. They told me it was small because it had been so much divided. It was advertised for $100 a plant, and it had been cut up so much that it could not develop a vigorous plant. Q. How often should peonies be divided in the garden in order to get the best results ? How long will they stand without dividing ? A. I would not take them up more than once in six years. If you transplant the first year you can not depend on any flowers. They should be carefully divided, and as much of the old root as possible taken away. ( Q. In the nursery they are divided every two or three years. I notice the third year divisions are better than the second. I wondered whether they continued to increase, or whether later on they came to a standstill. A. They continue. The third bloom on a transplanted peony should be the most perfect. The fourth year it will have more flowers, but the flowers will be smaller. Q. When you get an old one with forty or fifty stalks, is it a good plan to pull out the stalks. A. No; you encourage ground rot. If you break the stalk away, that root must die and it will rot and as a result the whole plant may become rotted. Q. Every shoot has three or four or five buds. A. Leave two or three leaves on the stem. Cut the stem off above the leaves, and the root will not die. Do not break them off at the ground. Q. My idea was to get rid of the bud, A. We do not advise it. Nothing was ever said in the meetings of the Peony Society to the effect that the practice was advisable. If you have done it and have had success, all right. I would not advise it however. For show purposes, we leave one bud on each stem and a larger flower results. </seg>
            <seg id="p466">466 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Q. Very often in moving peonies people want to plant the whole thing. Do you advise dividing it? A. The worst practice is to set out the whole plant unless it is a plant which can only be divided into two or three parts. Q. In moving a clump, how many stems would you advise to leave ? A. That depends. I would advise to cut a medium sized root into four or five parts, each one big enough to supply the eyes. The standard division is from two to four eyes. Q. How mony species do you grow? A. We have three or four other species beside the Peonia Albiflora. Q. What about the cut-leaf peony ? A. It is just a peony with a fern leaf — a different species. It is hardy. There is hardly a nursery that has them for sale, however. Q. I have had a theory that the old hen gets out, picks the buds and kills them. A. Plant one hundred, and you will have lots of flowers. You have not peonies enough. Q. How about their fragrance? A. Peonies are more fragrant than any rose you ever smelled — some of them. Q. How do you control this nematode. A. We are working on it now. By transplanting on new ground we have avoided the damage from this pest. It is too early to say for an absolute fact that this method is a cure for it. Eight years ago we did not know there were any such things. Now we find they are a real problem. If you have a diseased root, the first thing you know your peony has gone backward. If we find anything too badly diseased, we throw it away. It does not pay to grow anything that takes a long time to revive. Q. What are these varieties worth? A. From 75c to $5. I thank you. THE PRESIDENT: The next subject is "What Makes a Garden?" I presume there is more or less argument generally upon that question. My wife contends it takes muscle and a hoe. I can not dispute it. We have with us this afternoon a gentleman who will discuss this question, and I am sure he can give us some light on it. He spent his boyhood on the plains of Nebraska. It gives me pleasure at this time to introduce to you Professor F. A. Waugh, from the Landscape Division of the Massachusetts Horticultural College, who will talk to you on this subject. </seg>
            <seg id="p467">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 467 WHAT MAKES A GARDEN? An Illustrated Talk by FRANK A. WAUGH, of Massachusetts It is very kind of the Chairman to give me a start this morning by saying what I am proud to say — that I spent my boyhood on the plains. It seems like home to come back. My recent experience has been more in the east, but I have had many opportunities to come west. I have been all over the United States these last few years. I have tried to keep in touch with what is going on. This set of pictures is made up of photographs taken in my own garden and neighborhood, but I hope you will understand I am not show - ing them as models, but to illustrate the points, which apply in Ne - braska as anywhere else. The first thing that makes a garden is the land. It makes a lot of difference what the land is like — whether it can be cultivated; how it lies. Here is a garden on an old sand pile, with rolling land. The lawn was given a moulded shape, and the graceful curves go a long way toward making the garden. The shadows show the shape of the land. I am a photographer — in a mild way. The portrait artist, when he chucks us under the chin and tells us to "Look pleasant," tries to have us turn around so that the nose will throw a shadow across one cheek to tell what the shape of the face is; so if you have a lawn with no shadows, you have lost the form of the land. Here is a steep, rocky hill, set with native shrubs. Because the man was a landscape gardener, he selected native things; and he made a good sort of garden out of it instead of trying' to make something unnatural and artificial. In this picture, these trees grew native. Here the gardener used them in connection with rocks. This garden could have been dressed over and made into an entirely different type. However, the gardener elected to keep the land in its natural character and to adapt his garden to the land, which is not only good, practical sense, but landscape art. This picture shows swamp land with willows and swamp grass. It was taken in a Minneapolis park. Here is a California picture — not a man-made garden, but any man would be glad to make a garden like that. That is a sand dune. If you had that sort of land on your lot, you would think it was not fit for a hog pen! Many beautiful flowers and shrubs grow on this sand. By using the things native to the land, we can make a garden. If we take the materials we have at hand — the land as it is and the things that belong there — we will save a lot of trouble and make more progress in making a garden. Of course we have to have some lawn. It does not need to be very large. I am afraid most of us have been too enthusiastic and have laid off too much in the way of lawn. I think so every time I run the J^wn mower over mine. A small lawn well cared for will make the home grounds what they should be. </seg>
            <seg id="p468">468 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture This lawn shows a more formal arrangement. There was a little native birch tree which was pretty, and they left it. That goes a long way toward giving us a garden. Here is a lawn with sheep. They are good lawn mowers, and they are really practical. In many of the best parks, the superintendents use sheep for mowing the lawns. This is in Ontario. It is perhaps more a meadow than a lawn. To call sheep "lawn mowers" is not altogether a joke. Next we want some trees — a few good, big, substantial ones. One or two good trees are better than a lot of scrubs. This is a sugar maple, a local tree. The native trees are best. Here we have a native elm. Notice the vines on the house which add to the pleasing effect. Here are trees on a farm in South Carolina — native pines and dog - woods — in an avenue leading up to an old plantation house. The result has been accomplished with no expenditure of money, because these people had the good sense to take the things growing there and put them out. It is a lane people drive miles to see. I have a prejudice in my own mind for apple trees. There is no tree more beautiful. Some are larger and give more shade, but nothing can be more domestic and home-like than a good, old-fashioned apple tree. You could spend thousands of dollars for foreign trees and shrubs and have expensive pergolas, but you could not have anything more home-like and comfortable and dignified than an apple tree. If I show other pictures that seem more elaborate and expensive, please remember I am not recommending the expensive thing. I am trying to have you understand that these simple things within our reach are the things which serve most to make a garden what it ought to be. Of course we want some good, hardy shrubs. There are a good many Japanese and European species that are satisfactory, such as the Japanese barberry and the European lilac. The native shrubs are good also. This picture shows a native prairie rose. Here is a snow scene to indicate that shrubs are not all flowers, but that they can serve as beautifiers during more than one season of the year. If shrubbery plantings are well made, they are beautiful all the year around. This scene is snug and tidy and home-like. You feel as if you would like to spend an afternoon there, or sit down by the fire, in the evening. Here are grape vines on a stucco house Here are vines over a kitchen arbor. We want flowers, and plenty of them. Nine people out of ten think that is all a garden is for. I think it is a place to grow a lot of other things. These flowers are not expensive, because most of them are annuals or perennials which can be grown from seed. Even if you buy good perennials, and pay a dollar for peonies and fifty cents for iris, </seg>
            <seg id="p469">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 469 if you know how to take care of them, you will find your garden — being just as extravagant as you can — won't cost one-half as much as the gasoline for your flivver. The talk about its being expensive won't K stand examination. Here is a California garden. You can grow as many kinds of flowers here in Nebraska as in California or in Massachusetts. In Ne - braska and Kansas there are more flowers native than in all New Eng - land put together. This country is a natural flower garden. There are literally thousands of native flowers. When people tell me, "You can only do that in Florida, or Massachusetts, or California," it is humbug! They are looking at eastern catalogues and not for native things. You have no excuse for not growing plenty of flowers. This photograph of the Japanese iris in its own native country. I believe it will grow anywhere corn will grow. It needs a reasonable amount of moisture — about as much as a potato crop — and protection from the wind. Here is another Japanese picture with azaleas. This man made a Japanese garden, not an imitation of an Italian or an English garden. I do not recommend you to try it. This is an English garden. There is no doubt the English people love flowers and cultivate them more successfully than any other people in the world. They have a favorable climate, as well. Here are some ferns. There are only a few you can grow in Ne - braska. In Massachusetts we grow a great many successfully. J. SASS: We grow a native variety under evergreens. They grow fine on the north side of the house, too. MR. WAUGH, (continuing): A garden should have some fruit trees. Here are dwarf apple trees against a division fence. Where there is not room to grow the standard apple trees, there is still room to grow these dwarfs. There used to be a saying, "Every garden should have some water in it." There are places where it is impractical, however. Of course a fountain is pleasing. The music and the moisture are fine. Here is an elaborate garden. If you are beginning to worry about mosquitoes, a little oil on the top of the water will stop the mosquitoes, and some black minnows will eat up the larvae. I think the least that can be done, is to have water in a basin for the birds. A basin is not an extravagant piece of furniture. You can make it out of the top of an old crock, or you can buy a very nice bird fountain like the one in this picture for twenty dollars. If you have a garden where you enjoy life, you are pretty certain to want the birds to come in. Nothing is such a certain attraction for them as plenty of water. It adds materially, not only in being attractive in itself, but in </seg>
            <seg id="p470">470 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture bringing in bird life and having things of delight in the garden. We feed them all winter long and consider them an essential part of the garden. Every garden must have a sky, for it is one of the essential parts of the garden. The sky with its clouds at night is extremely beautiful. The clouds are magnificent in themselves, and we can have them in the garden at very little expense. You can not buy them by the dozen from the nurseryman, but if you will occasionally look up, you will see just such beautiful pictures as this. They are as much a part of our garden as if we had paid for them. God put them here for our delight, and we should look at them. This is a tiny garden near my house. This is put in because of the beautiful sky. All these things won't make a garden by themselves. They can not be loaded onto a truck and dumped, and made into a garden. We are inclined to insist that one of the most essential things in a garden is design — that it must be laid out on some definite plan. Here is a formal garden, which is shown not especially to recom - mend this type, but simply because we can see more clearly the thought of the designer. Do not think a natural garden is less a matter of de - sign than a formal garden. It takes as much thought and study — perhaps more. It is just as much subject to its own rules and regulations. Another thing which we must have in our gardens if they are going to be a success is privacy. It must be a part of the home so that we can live in it. We can not do that unless it has privacy. You can not scold your wife or spank the small boy right in public. We need a place to sit down and talk with our friends, or read the paper, or play a game of cards, or have supper. A simple table and a few chairs are as essential in the garden as in the house. You can add a swing to complete the picture. One of the things which helps out the garden is any kind of living animals. The garden calls for friends — members of our own family and the neighbors. It is the crowning glory of the garden to have human beings in it. It has no meaning if it exists merely for shrubs and flowers. It must be a place for human beings, and contribute to their happiness. I think some vegetables are proper in a garden. A garden, like a home, is a place to live; and it means work, as well as play. There should be children in a garden. When you have children who can work and play in it, then the trees and flowers mean something. Then we want to invite in our neighbors. How could you think of having a home if you never invited your friends in? So the garden means hospitality. A garden is a very human thing. It is part of our home. Unless we can make it a part of our home life, we have not a true garden, after all. I thank you. </seg>
            <seg id="p471">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 471 Discussion (Answers by Professor Waugh) Q. I should like to ask about dwarf apples. A. They are all right to play with. Q. I should like to know if Prof. Waugh has a recipe for building a good blue grass lawn? A. I suppose your neighbors can tell you more about that than I can. Where you have irrigation you can get a good blue grass lawn. I know in Kansas they can, especially if the soil is not too sandy. Q. You can have success by sowing white clover and blue grass to - gether, and gradually white clover disappears and you have blue grass. Q. Have you any substitute for blue grass ? A. We do not use blue grass. It is a little coarse and our soil is too acid for it. We use Rhode Island bent grass and fescue, with some red top. In a country with no acid, we must treat the soil with acid for bent grass, and with alkali for blue grass. Q. I think deep rooting grass is what we need here. There are some objections to white clover, but if you keep sowing it, it will over - come the obstacles better than the blue grass. You must keep sowing it, however. A. I am sure you can grow some sort of grass here. I am reminded of the story told me by J. H. Hale, who had peach orchards in Connecti - cut and Georgia. He said one Sunday they sat on a Georgia lawn be - cause it was cooler than in the house, and the man apologized for having grass on it, saying he had not had time to clean it off. (Laughter). THE PRESIDENT: I am sure we have all enjoyed Professor Waugh's talk and the pic - tures. We ask you to come back this evening at eight o'clock and we will have another talk by Professor Waugh on "A Better Place to Live." After the showing of some slides by Mr. Jacob Sass, taken from seedling iris, adjournment was declared until 9:30 Wednesday morning. SECOND SESSION Wednesday Morning, January 6, 1926 The second session of the convention was called to order by President Banning, at 9:50 a. m., Wednesday, January 6.

            <seg id="p472">472 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Nebraska has within the last few years made a step toward acquir - ing state parks. Mr. Marshall, of Arlington, whom you all know, will now address us on "Some Advantages of State Parks." SOME ADVANTAGES OF STATE PARKS G. W. MARSHALL, Arlington, Nebraska Mr. President: Parks owned by the state and for the people of the state, are new in a sense. Parks are needed in the cities. Some of you might differ with me in that, but those city children must have some place to go. We have come to the conclusion that people in the country should also have some place to go. Just because you have more room to walk around than do the people in the cities does not mean you do not require a change of scenery. After you have walked over the same place to slop the pigs 365 days in the year, and to attend to this and that, it becomes drudgery. Therefore you need a change. Every one of us needs a change. That calls for parks and places of recreation. It demands them; therefore it is up to us to look for those places near home. Parks and playgrounds have been established all over the larger cities. You do not have to go clear across the city to find them. You have one near you. Where the park idea is properly carried out, one of the rules is that the parks must be distributed to serve the popula - tion best. We of Nebraska seem to assume that all we have come to Nebraska for is to work; that there is nothing else to do; that there is nothing beautiful about the state — no natural beauty spots; that to get a real outing we must go to some other state to find some place that is beautiful. It is the biggest mistake in the world. It is a mistake from every angle and standpoint. We spend money on our roads to go out of the state to spend more money! That amounts to large sums in the aggre - gate. Go to one of these states where tourists congregate, you will find that one of their best "crops" is the tourist — the money we earn at home and go there to spend. These states look at it from another angle. Look at the beautiful boulevards they build. As quickly as they start to de - velop the suburb, they give them the appearance of the city right from the start, and make them attractive and inviting. What is it for? It is to induce the people from Nebraska and other states to spend their money there. They capitalize and develop these natural resources to attract the traveler and vacationist. This idea that we have no beauty spots here, but must fix our roads and make money so that we can go out of the state to find beauty spots is absolutely wrong. From a business standpoint we are the losers. A great many of us really can not afford to spend the time, and especially the money, to go to a far distant place, therefore we do not get the recreation. We can not afford to go there, and there is no place here. That is another reason why we should have these places near home. </seg>
            <seg id="p473">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 473 When we give up and sit down and say, "We have nothing of his - toric interest or natural beauty, and we must accept the consequences," we turn it over to the other fellow in some other state to do this work for us. But not all of our people are able to go there and these do not have a fair chance. Some say, "They can not afford it. They should not have recreation." Why shouldn't they? They are usually hard workers and usually need it more than those who can afford it. I claim a person of my age is worth more if he only works eleven months of the year than if he labors all twelve months — worth more financially, physically, and in every way. We need some recreation — some diversity. We can not stick to one routine all the time. We will wear out at it. We should look over our state with the idea of finding actually what we have in the way of beautiful and historic spots. Dr. Condra told us what we have, and told us many things we do not know anything about. We have not given our country a going over. We do not give it credit for what it has. We have some of the most picturesque places in the United States, and some historical spots. We have in Nebraska the greatest number of native plants and flowers of any state in the Union. We have the greatest variety of birds. We have our share in number. Travel around and you will see. We have our share of songsters, and of beautiful birds and animals — the little wild ones. We have our share all the way through. We are in a productive country that will feed the world, and our own animals and birds. Another advantage is this: We have nothing but farming here. The result is that our little streams are not polluted with the worn products of mineral mills and factories. Man has not spoiled them very much. Compare them with the streams of Colorado and you will see the latter are largely spoiled. If they had not taken it up and regulated it by law, the streams of Colorado would have been spoiled by this time. They had to hurry to save part of them. Nebraska has many historical places like Valentine and Kearney and Calhoun and DeSota and various other landmarks. There is enough history to these places to make them worthy of land marks. Take the Lewis and Clark expedition through Washington County. The govern - ment followed them up and placed a fort there. You would not know it unless a land mark were put up. Senator Stevens in an address in Fremont, in talking about history of Washington County, asked if we were aware there were eight thou - sand bushels of corn raised in Washington County by the soldiers one hundred years ago? He did not give us the details, but he no doubt could. It was raised by these soldiers with the hoe and spade, and with - out horses. They wanted the corn to feed their cattle for meat to feed the soldiers. Some of the great councils were held there, and various places in this state are quite historic in the making of the United States. As to the natural beauty spots, they are everywhere. I have run </seg>
            <seg id="p474">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 474 around a good deal in automobiles, and there are some drives in Ne - braska as pretty as you will find any where. We are not apt to look at these things at home. We are apt to see the beauty spots of other places. We do not know what we have ridden through. We are thinking of business. When it comes to plants, we have some that are among the most beautiful in the world. The late Dr. Bessey used to tell us that over and over. He was absolutely right. Dr. Bessey also worked on the mat - ter of reforestation of this country, through this Association. This As - sociation I think deserves more credit for the planting of the Dismal River reservation than any other association. It was arranged to have Dr. Bessey read a strong paper on "Reforesting the Sand Hills." You will find that paper in the Agricultural Report of 1897 or 1898. Follow - ing that came a forestry survey under the supervision of the Forestry Department of the government. Then the members of the Agricultural Society interested Dr. Hall, and the result was the establishing of this timber reserve. We have more of a natural tree country, as Dr. Bessey told us, than we think we have. Trees grow readily here. The reason they are not here now is because they did not have a chance. This was a rich soil and was burned off nearly every year, and the reason it was not grown up with forests was because of the prairie fires. That was proven by the fellows who made the survey. Dr. Hall used to speak of it fre - quently. I was with him two or three days. He said if you could keep the fires off the prairie for twenty-five years, it would be grown up with timber. Now it could not be reforested because it is nearly all farmed. He said it was a natural timber country as much so as Illinois. The timber might not grow so tall, but it would make as many timber feet to the acre in the same period of time. We want to pick out the natural beauty places, the historic places, and the other beauty spots of the state and spend a few dollars on them in the right way. Professor Wiggins is Secretary of our Park Board and knows something about them. I want to talk about the need of state parks. I believe we need a law to help the Park Board and give them a right to buy these places and take care of them in the proper way. Every one of them should be saved. Go up and down the Elkhorn River and you will find it is like the Platte in its make-up. It will cut through the soil and make a big bend and keep growing until the bend becomes a horseshoe, and here is a lake from half a mile to a mile long. It is a splendid place to fish and boat and swim for a while, but with the soil washing down from the hills, it gets filled up until the water is no longer clear. I notice where the government takes hold of such a problem there is no trouble bring - ing it back to its former clear state if dredges are used. There is a condition in the Platte and Elkhorn and Republican and </seg>
            <seg id="p475">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 475 Niobrara Valleys which makes it impossible to run. them dry after a certain depth. The water is clear like well water. We have the average country beaten a thousand miles for water, because we take it through the ground. All you have to do is to clean this dirt out so the water can come in in its natural way. They can dyke the outside, and drain away the run off water and in this way keep the lakes clear and clean. We have not done one thing. These parks were given to us. The State would hardly take them. That is as far as we have gone. This Park Board is doing its work in fine shape, but we are doing nothing to help. If we will take a small per cent of what we are going to spend for roads and spend it for these public parks, I would estimate we could keep 60 per cent of our people at home. They can not spare the time or money to go to Minnesota or California. When it comes to Nebraska as a place to live, there are a lot of us older people who live here because we like it. We have better than the average country to live in. We have extremes, but in a way we like extremes. We like this better than a climate that is too uniform. We are just gamblers enough to like the chance — not to know one day what the weather will be the next. When we have a stormy day, the next balmy one is appreciated by everybody. They say, "You have so many bad ones, you should." We do not sleep half of them away be - cause they are just like yesterday. When you come to consider, you will see, that is the case. Look at the people, and you will see our people are awake. There is something to them. I have heard people say, "I would rather live on two meals a day in Oklahoma than to go up there to Nebraska and live." Most of them look like they didn't get more than two meals a day! In California, I saw people by hundreds taking sun baths. They did not have enough money to take any other kind. I left because I did not like the sun bath. When you come to consider it, you must have some money to live on. We are in a country that can produce wealth. I never was in a country where the money was more evenly distributed. The average person can have some money. He can live decently and raise his children and give them a good education. The schools and markets are near; and the soil and climate can not be beaten. You can not have everything. We come the nearest having a happy combina - tion of any country I know of. It is better than the east. We have more sunshine and dry weather than the east. We get our rains in the season we need them. When we look outside the state for this recreation we are making a mistake. You will be surprised at the number of beauty spots in Ne - braska if you will look for them. We have trout streams, and some of the best bass fishing there is, and some of the finest streams for fishing for the channel cat. We have a good hunting country. The big question is to save these natural places before they are destroyed. </seg>
            <seg id="p476">476 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture THE PRESIDENT: This park question is young in Nebraska. It seems to be late in getting appropriations from the legislature. When this question of es - tablishing state parks first came up, nobody seemed to be very much interested in appropriations for them. We managed to squeeze out $5,000 to start with for Arbor Lodge, and last year I think it was in - creased a little, but it is not yet what it ought to be. We will now have a talk by Professor C. C. Wiggins, who is Secre - tary of the State Park Board. I think I am safe in saying he is well posted on this subject. WHAT HAS BEEN DONE TO DEVELOP OUR STATE PARKS? C. C. WIGGINS, Secretary State Park Board Mr. President and Friends: As has been intimated, the activities incident to Nebraska State Parks are recent. It seems to me there ara several reasons for this. One of them is the fact our state is compara - tively new, and traditions come, as you know, only with age. It is a question of the country developing to a certain extent — aging up — in order to get to the point where the needs for these things are so evident they can not be longer neglected. It has not been more than seventy-five years since most of the state was a wild country. Another thing which has kept back the park movement in this state is, as Mr. Banning has said, a lack of funds. No funds have been avail - able for the purchase of historical or scenic places or of recreational areas for state parks. Also the general public has lacked the vision to see the possibilities which might come from a system of state parks. Some of the other states to the north and west are wide-awake to this sort of thing. The people of those states realize perfectly that their park system is a state asset, and that the visitors from other states pay into park funds prac - tically enough to support their state parks; thus, in many instances their own people are paying nothing, and yet enjoy all the advantages of these recreation places. Another thing that has kept back the park development is our prox - imity to other states that have parks. With an automobile, in three days or less, one can be in Minnesota or Colorado. These states have outdistanced Nebraska entirely with respect to the establishment and maintenance of parks. This is just another case of "Let George do it." We say, "If we can't go to a Nebraska state park, let's go visiting. We will spend our money there instead of at home." I believe Mr. Marshall hit the nail on the head when he said few people realize just what we do have in this state in the way of places of park value. Our knowledge is entirely too limited, not only about the places, but about the state park movement as a whole. Very few people know how it originated on what is its purpose. I want to give you this morning just a little about that. </seg>
            <seg id="p477">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 477 Before the State Park Board was established, we had a State Park with nobody to take care of it. Those familiar with it know it was called the "Jimmie Good Park." It was set aside before there was any organized state agency to handle the situation. It is a beautiful place eight miles south of Chadron and consists of a school section in the Pine Ridge country. Senator J. W. Good got an act through the legislature in 1919 setting it aside as a State Paik, and a few hundred dollars were appropriated to pay for some improvements which a tenant had put up in the way of fencing. It had been used for pasture. After we got the State Park, it was necessary to get some organiza - tion to handle it. In 1921 the legislature, through the adoption of Senate File No. 189, introduced by Senator Robbins, of Omaha, established the State Park Board, with the Governor as Chairman, the Secretary of the Department of Public Works as Secretary, and six members ap - pointed by the Governor — two to serve two years, two fours years and two six years. Thus the Board presumably has two-thirds of the mem - bers with some experience all the time. This act gave to this Board charge and supervision of all state parks. At that time we had only one. Under it also was included, charge and supervision of all lands which might be acquired by the state and used for parks, park boulevards, forest reserves, etc., such as areas of natural beauty, scientific interest, or historic association. The powers were broad enough to cover almost any situation. The Board was given power to acquire by gift or purchase; to hold in trust; to make a state survey; to lay down rules and regulations governing the parks, including such things as concessions, etc. No authority is given for a project of any kind in the way of agreement extending beyond three years. No Board members receive compensation. Two members of the Board were already on the state payroll. There was no provision even for travel expenses. Thus members were asked to donate not only their own time but their money as well in attending Board meetings. The personnel of the Board in addition to the Governor and Secretary of Public Works in 1921 was as follows: Dr. Gifford, of Omaha; Mr. Butterfield, of Norfolk; Mr. Cook, of Agate; Mr. Harrison, of York; Mr. Weaver, of Falls City; Mr. Cordeal, of McCook. The work of the Board consisted mainly of making a survey. This trip was made late that summer, to the Park near Chadron. A later trip was made to Nebraska City and Omaha. Each member making these trips spent somewhere around $100 of his own money looking after the park interests of the State of Nebraska. This board recommended to the next legislature the acceptance of the offer of a 70 acre Victoria Springs tract in Custer County as well as the acceptance of Arbor Lodge at Nebraska City. It also recom - mended that one-eighth of the money collected for fishing and hunting licenses be used to develop the State Park system. The legislature of 1923 approved some of these recommendations. </seg>
            <seg id="p478">478 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Fig. 1— A view in the Sunken Garden, Arbor Lodge State Park. It accepted Arbor Lodge and Victoria Springs, but no provision was made for funds by which other property could be acquired. The statute pertaining to Board membership was changed somewhat by eliminating the Secretary of the Department of Public Works from the Board, and placing in his position the Chairman of the Department of Horticulture of the State University. Victoria Springs was accepted by the adoption of a bill introduced by Senator Purcell. The Arbor Lodge offer was accepted by the adop - tion of a bill introduced by Senator Yochum. The appropriation for the support of State Parks was $10,000 which by law was limited to the use and maintenance of Arbor Lodge. This amount must serve for two years. The 1925 legislature was a little bit more liberal. The $10,000 for Arbor Lodge was continued for the biennium; also $12,000 for use at the Chadron Park; $2,000 for use at Victoria Springs, and $2,000 for Board expenses — organization and office and travel expenses, so ths* when the Board members made a trip, they could be reimbursed for actual expenses. This makes a total appropriation of $26,000. If we can keep up at that rate for ten years, we will have a nice park fund. If we can double our appropriation each two years, that will be fine; but I do not think that this will be necessary in order to get a park system of which we may all be proud. So much for the history of the enterprise. I want to talk now for a little while about these regions we have. Taking them up in the order of their creation, we have first the one in Dawes county — the school section which I have mentioned. This is a 640 acre piece of land about nine miles from Chadron on the Chadron-Alliance Highway in the Pine </seg>
            <seg id="p479">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 479 Fig. 2 — A general view of Chadron State Park from the Aliance-Chadron State Highway. Ridge region, typical of a considerable area of northwestern Nebraska, and the Black Hills region in South Dakota. It is only about one hun - dred miles from Sylvan Lake. There is a considerable quantity of pine and spruce scattered on this section. Further interest is added by many queer rock formations and quite a great variety of blooming flowers in the spring. Roads have been built through the park largely by do - nated labor of people in that section. The completion of the highway system of the state, is going to mean that a large number of people will pass that park every touring day of the year, and that is almost every day. Since the fund became available, we have build in that park a shel - ter house and auditorium, and meetings are frequently held there. This shelter house seats probably four hundred. It also furnishes protection when storms come up. There is also a cook house in which a big army stove has been put up. This is to take care of the cooking question whenever conventions or meetings requiring a considerable amount of cooking are held there. Last summer the Epworth League of north - western Nebraska held its convention there, with several hundred young people in attendance. They served their meals cafeteria style. Swings have been put up. There is a baseball diamond. We se - cured through the Department of Public Works for one dollar apiece, some army tents. These are available for campers. We generally try to get one dollar a night for them. Six or eight people can sleep in one. A good many tired tourists will say, "I will give you a dollar rather than put up my tent.'" By building a dam a fish pond probably three-fourths acre in extent has been made. At the deepest place it is ten feet in depth. It has been stocked with fish and will also serve </seg>
            <seg id="p480">480 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture as a swimming and skating place, and as a source for ice. We are planning a supply of ice to take care of the needs through next summer, since it is impractical to haul the ice 8 or 9 miles from Chadron. We expect this park to be used primarily for recreatoin. It is a convenient stop-over on the way to the Yellowstone. We hope some people will not need to go further than Chadron. We think it is as good as the famous Black Hills section of South Dakota. Fig. 3 — A. scene in Chadron State Park showing the rugged nature of the Pine Ridge Region. Mr. Good, the Father of the Park, has been made superintendent and caretaker, and if you get in touch with him you will certainly realize he is very enthusiastic about the State Park movement, and especially about Chadron Park. We hope eventually to have a house for the caretaker, and a museum where we can preserve not only specimens of the natural flora of that region, but which will likewise serve as a museum for mineral and fossil specimens in which that country is especially rich. It is only a few miles to Agate and its famous "bone pile". We want to improve the camping accommodations and make it generally a more satisfactory place to go. We are just getting started with this. We will not have for some time all the advantages which you might find in other places; but at least we hope you will be com - fortable in case you desire to go. We are having large numbers of visitors and picnics and convention of all sorts, and Mr. Good is already taking dates for next summer. One day last summer there were some - thing like seven thousand people present at a Farmers' Union picnic. There is lots of room on 640 acres, so do not feel there is not room for you, too. The Arbor Lodge Park is one with which you are more familiar. It is located in the other corner of the state, at Nebraska City. Here </seg>
            <seg id="p481">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 481 we have a portion of the old homestead of J. Sterling Morton, settled in about 1855 — a 65-acre tract of woodland landscape and grass, just outside of Nebraska City. The principal things there are the mansion of fifty-two rooms and an arboretum in which we have nearly 150 species of plants — probably the best collections of plants, both native and imported, in the state. There is a pine grove something like forty years old — one of the few white pine plantings in the state ; a sunken garden, and the J. Sterling Morton monument, built by the pennies and nickels of school children. Mr. Frank Williams is superintendent. Fig. 4— The J. Sterling Morton Statue in Monument Park. Arbor Lodge State Park. The park was acquired by gift from Joy Morton, the oldest son of Mr. and Mrs. J. Sterling Morton. It did not cost the state a cent. The state would hardly take it, at that. It has historical associations which could not be replaced. It is already developed. We have made some improvements on it. We put more fence around it, and some roads have been built. Equipment has been added to help take care of the work there. We are beginning to develop the museum idea. There are a number of vacant rooms which can be filled with historic material. Anything which goes in must have real value, so far as we can control the situation. We have some material which is going in, and other material has been offered. We have not been advertising for material. People will see a room maintained by a certain organization. They will say, "I have something which is just as good or better than that. 1 will give or loan it to you." We want it to fill up slowly. We have room for expansion and want to take our time about filling the rooms. </seg>
            <seg id="p482">482 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Fig. 5 — A general view of Arbor Lodge Mansion, Arbor Lodge State Park. The mansion is open to the public until the weather gets so cold that the rooms are not comfortable. The grounds are open to the public daily. During this past summer we had thirty thousand people register in the mansion itself. The preceding summer we had about the same number. This year the Sundays during September and October were not comfortable for auto travel. Some Sundays we have had as high as 1500 register. It is a problem to take care of them. When you attempt to make a personally conducted tour, it is hard to handle a group of from 75 to 150 people at one time. We have several guides. Even under those handicaps, we figure they are being taken care of at an expense not to exceed two cents each. That is cheap entertain - ment. The other park is Victoria Springs. This is a tract nineteen miles northwest of Broken Bow, consisting of sixty acres of grove and pasture land. It has on it some mineral springs. One spring has con - siderable mineral value to its water. For years it has been a play - ground for people in that section. There are two log cabins built fifty years ago. One of these served as the first post office in Custer County. This area will be developed as a camping and recreation center. Camping accommodations will be provided, and we hope also we can manage to reforest the pasture land. I want to show by a state map how much of the state these parks can serve easily, and to indicate, I hope, the need for other parks, as well. Take a 50-mile radius from Nebraska City, and the same from the other two parks. How many people do you suppose are included in this 50-mile radius? What number of counties does it include? </seg>
            <seg id="p483">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 483 From Arbor Lodge, it includes five counties, and part of six others, with a total population of 365, 000. It includes Omaha and Lincoln. Fig. 6 — The Log Cabins in Victoria Springs State Park. Erected over 50 years ago by Judge Matthew?. In the case of Victoria Springs, two counties and parts of eight others, are included with a population of 45,000. A radius of fifty miles from the Chadron Park includes one whole county and a part of three others, with a population of 25,000. If we make the distance 75 .miles — a good driving distance — ■ Arbor Lodge has 11 counties in that radius, and three partly included, with a population of 450,000. Victoria Springs has 8 counties, and a portion of 11 others, with a population of 120,000. Chadron Park has four whole counties, and a part of four others, with a population of 45,000. With our 50-mile radius, we cover, from the three parks, 8 counties and a part of 18 others, with a population of 435,000. With the 75-mile radius, we include 23 entire counties and part of 18 others, with a total population of 615,000. That leaves 53 counties, and a portion of 18 others, with a population of around 600,000, not included at all; so only a trifle more than one-half the population of this state is within 75 miles of any of our parks. Is it fair to the rest of the state to allow that situation to continue ? Don't you think we should have other parks scattered around so that everybody is within reasonable driving distance of one of those parks? If we can live up to the motto of the National Conference on State Parks — "A State Park Every One Hundred Miles" — then we will be approaching that idea. </seg>
            <seg id="p484">484 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture What then are the needs? We need more parks. We need these playgrounds closer together. Mr. Marshall suggested scattering them. Ours are scattered. We need these not only for the benefit of the people, but also to preserve certain scenic spots which we do have in this state. We have historic spots, also. Unless we get hold of those now, it will be hard to do so later. In order to do this, we must have an income which comes thru general appropriation. In some ways these biennial appropriations can not be spent as intelligently as they could if we had something we knew was coming each year, because the tendency of the individual possessing something desired for state use, is to hold up the state. If we have to spend our funds too quickly, we can not at all times exercise the judgment which might otherwise be used. We could have a mill tax or take a part of the hunting and fishing license fees or follow some other plan, just so there is a definite income. The Park Board will use this money to purchase these tracts which are so desirable from the standpoint of park value. Fig. 7 — The Auditorium in Chadron State Park finds much favor with gatherings of this sort. There is another way in which we can raise this money, and that is by charging admission. If we charged ten cents admission to every - body who goes through the gates we would make money. We get immense crowds. But if it is for the benefit of the public why not make it free ? I think we should charge where we are furnishing camp - ing privileges. That is a little proposition, and we expect to get back from those activities enough to pay for their cost. So far as I am concerned, I am opposed to the admission idea, however, as a means of raising funds for maintenance. </seg>
            <seg id="p485">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 485 With increased income, there will be more parks. The management then will become a little different proposition. This eventually will mean the employment of a trained park man. No member of the present Park Board is so trained. These men are in the work primarily because they are interested in State Park movement. They are not posted on the state park problems. Problems which of necessity will develop will call for an experienced person so far as the management is con - cerned. This, however, is a development which will come with time and increased park acreage and patronage. THE PRESIDENT: The next speaker on the program has a very important subject. I am sure we will all be interested in it. It is, "Nebraska Needs More Trees," by Mr. McCullough, of the Omaha Bee. NEBRASKA NEEDS MORE TREES T. W. McCULLOUGH, Omaha Bee, Omaha, Nebraska Ladies and Gentlemen: Before I start in on the little bit of matter I have prepared for you, I should like to say just a word to emphasize what Professor Wiggins has said in regard to the state parks and state park work. It is one of the most important things before the people of Nebraska now, and not so well understood as it might be. I am confident when the matter is put before the people in such a way they will better understand what is actually meant by the state park movement, there will be little or no difficulty in securing the support necessary. The parks which are now being developed are real assets to the state. Chadron Park is especially a wonderfully beautiful place. It con - tains within that section as much rugged grandeur and picturesque scenery and as beautiful a pastoral outlook as you will find included anywhere in the same space of ground. Arbor Lodge Park has been well developed, but by a small expendi - ture of money it might be a much more beautiful place than it is, and be brought nearer to the ideal Mr. Morton had in mind when he started it. The same is true of Victoria Springs Park. Just the expenditure of a little bit of money will make it a splendid recreation center. Mr. Wiggins spoke about the Park Board being inclined to spend its money fast. As a member of the Board, I think the state may depend upon us to exhaust the appropriation. (Laughter.) Nebraska was not, originally a treeless state. We have ample proof to the contrary. When the first white men came to Nebraska, they found considerable areas of forest growth along the water courses. The great water shed known as the Pine Ridge took its name from the fine growth of timber that crowned its slopes. These were the remaining vestiges of magnificent forests that once covered the western half of </seg>
            <seg id="p486">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 486 the state. It is the widespread and earnest belief that this country has always been a desert. As a matter of fact, at a not very remote period in history it was a highly timbered country. Examination dis - closes enough proof to justify the belief that these great forests succumbed to the enemy that is now so potent, and against which so much of resistance is exercised. Fire was the principal agent in the destruction of the heavy timber growth in what is now known as the sand hills. I was asked at lunch by a gentleman who is very much interested in that, why we think the sand hills were once covered by pine timber? It is because of the fact that not here and there, but almost everywhere, excavations disclose charcoal beds and beds of ashes. Occasionally a stump is found which indicates there must have been a great body of timber there at one time to have produced all that is disclosed when you get under the sand a little. Two years ago, up in Cherry county, just across the line from Hooker, there was a huge log found — a very well preserved log fifty feet long and three feet in diameter at the but — still' in good state of preservation. You could scrape the decayed portion off and find good timber. That log was not brought there by human agency. There is no stream known in that region in recent times that would have floated a log of that kind where it was found. It must have been left by the fire which destroyed the original timber. The early settlers needed the timber for their uses. They took what was left of the original stock, and it served them well. Imme - diate problems of existence were weighty, and pressed upon them to the exclusion of much provision for the future. Little or no thought was given to the replenishing of the forest growth, and denuded hills were left to mark the visits made in quest of material for the erection of stockades, stage barns, military posts, fuel and other needs of the men who were beginning to conquer the wilderness. Prairie fires ,set by Indians to drive game into the open, or starting from natural causes, swept across the plains, and destroyed the shoots by which nature sought to replenish the woods that man had used up. I may say it was not only the Indians' prairie fires, but the grazing herds of buffalo and deer, and later herds of cattle, which destroyed them. There is no more destructive agency than grazing herds. That is the real basis of the conflict between the Forestry Service and the stockmen. The Forestry Service is the proper agency to control the use of forest lands for grazing purposes, but it objects to the over - crowding by which not only the grass, but young shoots of trees are also destroyed by the grazing herds. Wherever the owners of stock have been permitted to run cattle or sheep or horses at their pleasure, a destruction of forest growth follows. It is because of the interest of the forestry people in restoring some of the magnificent stands of timber that they are opposed to the plan of the stockmen to remove all </seg>
            <seg id="p487">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 487 restrictions and permit the use of the forest range at the will of the stock growers. Men of vision saw the need of restoring in part at least the timber that had been used up, and began both by example and by precept to urge upon their neighbors to plant trees. Robert W. Furnas and J. Sterling Morton were among these. Mr. Morton gave his views the concrete expression of a resolution adopted by the State Board of Agriculture, and later by the legislature of Nebraska, setting apart a day to be known as Arbor Day, to be dedicated to the planting of trees. This day was finally set on the birthday of Mr. Morton, and Nebraskans came to gain among the other states of the nation the honorable sobriquet of "Tree Planters". Thus it was that Organized Agriculture in Nebraska became identified with the movement to plant trees. How well that admoni - tion has been followed is attested by the many fine groves that beautify and adorn the landscape that was bleak and cheerless half a century ago. Today Nebraska is more in need of trees than it was in 1872. Then there was an ample supply of forest, all that was needed, appar - ently, to meet the wants of man for many generations. Nebraska was not faced with the need of supplying timber for domestic uses from its own forest plantations. In the last fifty years an enormous and a dangerous change has taken place. Millions of acres of forest growth has been devastated. For many years we have used our forests as a mine. Not merely using them, but devastating them, exhausting them. Timber has been used in the United States since the beginning of the century at a rate of five times faster than it has been re - produced. This despite the efforts that have been made to renew the forests. Why should Nebraskans at this time turn attention to planting trees that in the future a timber crop may be added to the other crops of the state? Nebraskans import practically all the timber they use. All their fuel. Every farmer in the state must buy and pay continually in - creasing prices for what timber or fuel he uses. That is a point I think escapes the attention of even many of the close observers. I went before a committee of the legislature in the session of 1921. One of the members of the committee produced that day a clipping from one of the newspapers just out in which complaint was made about the aggressiveness of the cedar post trust — the farm - er's complaint being the trust was extorting continually higher prices for their fence posts. He asked me what it was. I told him what I am going to repeat — that the trust he was complaining of was not an organization of men, but it was Nature herself asserting her control because man had used up the supply of red cedar available for fence posts, telephone posts, and similar uses, much faster than Nature could </seg>
            <seg id="p488">488 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture produce them. As a result of the increasing scarcity, the price was going up, and would continue to go up. That affects not only the farmer, but everybody, because a portion of the cost of maintaining and carrying on the telephone, telegraph, railroad, and similar businesses is the cost of their poles and their cross ties. As fast as the cost of the poles increase because of the increasing scarcity of the material that must be used, just so the cost of the service must be increased in order to meet it. The Nebraska Bell Telephone Company, in harmony with other divisions of the great concern, amortizes the cost of its poles on the basis that is deemed to be correct by the authorities, but which does not pay for that pole. That is, the telephone company is today replac - ing poles against which it has been carrying a depreciation charge based on the cost of the pole when it went into the ground. That will only pay for one-half the cost of putting a pole into the ground now. Yet the depreciation of the pole being set today will be reckoned against the cost of the pole in the ground today. When the time comes to replace it, the price will have doubled again, so that the depreciation charge actually carries about one-half the cost of replacing the pole. That is one of the reasons why your telephone rates are being continually advanced in order to meet this cost. The railroads have the same experience with their timber needs, and all other agencies are confronted by the same situation. Yet it is possible for any farm in the state to produce much if not most of what is required to meet these needs. A woodlot of only a few acres will be the source of supply for fence posts, material for farm buildings, and for fuel. Let me tell you what actually took place. Not a great many years ago — some time before the war — a settler went into Cherry county and bought a tract of land that had a considerable grove of timber along the little creek that ran through it. I talked with him last winter and he told me he had then been on that land a Kttle over twelve years. During that time he had not bought a fence post. He had not paid a penny for fuel. He had found material in that grove to meet a great many other farm needs, and actually had more trees growing at that time than when he bought the place. That is a concrete illustration of the value of a wood lot. The use of trees for windbreaks and shelterbelts is already well understood. But the mercantile value of a woodlot is ignored. Until the Nebraska farmer sets about to provide in part at least for his own needs in the way of timber, he must continue to pay tribute to Nature, however much he grumbles at the steadily mounting toll she exacts for her diminish - ing supply of wood. Nebraska has a wonderful resource, one whose value is almost beyond computation in the Sand Hills. On those barren ridges can be </seg>
            <seg id="p489">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 489 grown the most useful of timber. The work done by the Federal government thru its Forestry Bureau is proof of this. Eleven thou - sand acres of pine trees are growing at Bessey Nursery today, where in 1902 the sand was as bare of tree growth as the paved street of a city. White pine, Scotch pine, yellow pine, jack pine, fir, spruce, cedar, all the conifers growing there are a challenge to Nebraskans to plant trees and make that region once more the dense forest it waa at one time. The state owns 697,000 acres of land in the sand hill region. The report from the Land Commissioner's office shows the revenue from that 697,000 acres amounts to a little less than eleven cents per acre per year. Careful experiments made over a period of years at planta - tions the Forestry Bureau has established at Long Pine and other places show the average annual increment per acre is equivalent to 1,600 board feet of pine. With stumpage selling as high as eleven dollars in the pine forests on the Pacific coast, I ask you how many acres in Nebraska are producing more than an equivalent of 1600 board feet of pine? Every acre of the 697,000 acres of state land will pro - duce that pine timber. In the eastern half of Nebraska all the hardwood trees known to the temperate zone will grow. The oaks, the hickories, walnuts, elms, maples, catalpas, the poplars, all are useful. Elms and catalpa are listed with red cedar for durability in the ground, and make the finest of fence posts. The other trees have their various uses. All are needed. All should be planted, propagated, and brought into service. A catalpa tree will grow two good fence posts, if you split it, in ten years. Trees are not a crop for today, but for tomorrow. This fact must be kept in mind. Starting now, benefits of the planting will not be reaped until another generation, and the full value will not even be realized by them. But it is a high and responsible duty that is laid on the Nebraskan of 1926. He should not hesitate to assume it, to so arrange that his grandsons will call him blessed because he did foresee and provide for them the trees they will need. Other states are engaged in this work. The congress of the United States has done what it can to encourage the work. Under the Clarke-McNary law provision is made for carrying on the forestry work on the same plan as road building was supported. The Federal Government will pay to the state one-half the cost of propagating and distributing forest tree stock to the people of that state. This stock may be delivered on such terms as the state provides, except that it can not be made a source of revenue to the state. Only the actual cost of the stock furnished can be recovered by the state. Governor McMullen is already in touch with Arthur C. Peck, superin - tendent of the Federal Forestry district of which Nebraska is a part, and hopes to bring the state under the benefits of the Clarke-NcNary law. </seg>
            <seg id="p490">490 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Details have been carefully avoided in this paper, for the reason that a full discussion cannot be had in the time limit. In a general way the effort has been to set a picture before the mind in outline, to be filled in as to detail by each who studies the question. Never did Nebraska need trees more than now. Each passing day sees this need increasing. Only by starting now will it be possible to avert what will in the not far distant future become a dire timber famine. The world has seen many examples of what happens in treeless regions. None more notable than China. China, with all the political turmoil, with all the economic and social distress that have disturbed and hindered progress, has done more in ten years in the way of foresta - tion than the United States has done in a century. Our effort has been to diminish, rather than replenish, the timber supply. Now we are at last turning the other direction. Nebraska has a share in this, and should not hesitate to assume that share. Education of the public is needed. Farmers must be shown how valuable a woodlot may be made, legislators must be enlightened, that the necessary laws can be put into operation. This is a campaign for the Organized Agriculture of the state. Trees are needed, forest trees, just as much if not more than new varieties of grain or fruits. Do not postpone this important job any longer. I most heartily congratulate the horticulturists of the state on the great things they have accomplished in the last few years. It has been through organized effort, patient and persistent, by educational processes not only for the public, but for themselves. One who travelB through the southeastern part of this state can not but be impressed by the great extension that has been made in the way of orcharding. There are other evidences of improvement as you go thru the state, and the time will come — and if the effort is put forth as it has been within the last fifteen years, it won't be postponed a great while — when the farmer of Nebraska will be so busy doing other things that he will have very little time to complain about the price of wheat and corn, or study the over-production of those cereals, because he will be engaged in producing other things that will produce a revenue as dependable and in a more satisfactory manner than he is getting out of grain today. THE PRESIDENT: I am sure we have enjoyed this talk. Mr. McCullough has given us some very good ideas and things to think about. I hope we will all profit by them. Personally, I feel I have learned several things from his address. We have all to learn from the other fellow. That is why I like to encourage discussion on these subjects, to find out what the other fellow knows, and profit by it. Yesterday afternoon, and again last evening, we were enjoyably entertained by Professor Waugh with his illustrated lectures. At this time he will again appear on the program to discuss the subject, "What Other States Are Doing". Professor Waugh. </seg>
            <seg id="p491">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 491 WHAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING PROFESSOR F. A. WAUGH, of Massachusetts Ladies and Gentlemen: I am very glad to see you again and to know you have survived the two lectures I gave yesterday. The Secretary wrote me recently and said you were to have discussion on the question of State Parks, and asked me to add a little information with reference to what other states are doing in this matter; so I collected some notes on that and will add some observations and opinions of my own, perhaps gratuitously, but I hope not altogether unprofitably. These notes are necessarily frag - mentary and not entirely up to date, so must not be too closely scrutinized. In further introduction, I will say this: That in considering state parks, we must be a little bit careful with regard to our nomen - clature, because a great many areas which are useful for state parks are called by other names — "state reserves," "historic reservations," "monuments," and especially, "state forests." In state administra - tions, "forests" and "parks" are almost interchangeable. I think a wise administration tends to make them more so. A good many states have established extensive forests, and having them estab - lished and in good working order, and finding them useful for purposes of recreation, have practically neglected to establish state parks as such.

Washington has made a beginning; has national forests and Mt. Ranier National Park. Wisconsin — good system of parks and forests. Peninsular State Park, 4,000 acres woods and lake shore, It is enough to show practically all the states are alive to the issue. This affair is a matter for the state, for many reasons. It is a matter of generations. Individual interest is not sufficiently foresighted to carry us all where we ought to go. The state should step in. It is of real social and economic interest to the state. The development of timber for the use of future generations is a real substantial business interest of first importance. The protection of its citizens, the educa - tion of its children, the protection of health, the provision of public recreation in the interest of morals are permanent, paramount interests of the state which can not be overlooked without the greatest possible danger. The question is, What is the proper thing to do about it? The first thing to be said is this: we can not move blindly or very hastily. We must move slowly and study the ground or we shall make a great </seg>
            <seg id="p494">494 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture many mistakes. This means the state must have some body — either an individual or a group of individuals — which can and will study this question continuously and broadly in a disinterested and honest way. The natural way is to have a State Conservation Commission. I prefer that term. Such a commission, which has the brains and the public interest at heart, will do that work, which means a long series of years of study. It does not mean somebody with a fad can make a speech and get something adopted. That does not count. It must have more study and continuous study. There must be some person of brains, Usually it sifts to two or three brains — some person with technical training and balanced judgment who understands the question. Then it must have someone with business judgment and sagacity to make it fit into the political program and to consider the question of financing it. It requires a good commission, made up of a few men and women who have knowledge of social and political conditions, and some per - sons with definite, practical, technical knowledge who will go to the bottom and get at the facts so that we shall not make our decisions on the basis of sentiment or the enthusiasm of some governor who has a forestry or park bug, or is crazy about something else. It takes a better balanced program to win. This commission must take a broad view of the situation. I am skeptical of the State Park Board, as such. Let me say I am speaking in ignorance of your own arrangements, so it is not a criticism of what has been done in Nebraska. I am also skeptical of a State Forestry Commission, or a State Fish and Game Commission. I think any one commission by itself is apt to make mistakes. The three things should be brought together. Forests and parks should be interchangeable, and fish and game should be a part of the enterprise. So these three things under some name or other would make a balanced sort of an enter - prise. The first thing that faces us is the study of the physical properties. We find we have a large number of those things coming in — forests first, even in Nebraska. Perhaps parks are next. Areas for the preser - vation of fish and game are important. Historical memorials — areas set apart for the preservation of points of historic value — are impor - tant. Then we have areas to be set apart primarily for the preservation of scenic beauties. Every state has beautiful pieces of scenery. I believe it was Mr. Wiggins who said a lot of people think Nebraska is all prairie. I had not said so, but I understand a good part of it is. As far as I am personally concerned, I am glad of it. I think the prairie is one of the most beautiful things God ever made. When you are making the State Park system of Nebraska, let us have a good, big area of prairie so that we can see how it was when we pioneers came out here. I am one of the few people who can remember when buffalo ran over these prairies. I have lived on buffalo meat. I want to see the prairies — as beautiful a sight as Niagara Falls — preserved. We want types and examples ox me finest scenery. We want camping </seg>
            <seg id="p495">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 495 grounds for our tourists. Some temporary and inadequate provision has been made for them. There is a permanent need, and a perfectly legiti - mate social, economic need which we should meet. We want playgrounds and picnic grounds nearer than once in seventy-five miles. If we want to go out after church and take luncheon in the woods, it ought not to be necessary to drive one hundred and fifty miles. It does not take a thousand square acres for a picnic ground. Here and there are pleasant picnic grounds of much less area. Then we come to the question of finance. A lot of people worry about that. It is one of the easiest things. We have money enough to provide for this adequately, even if we had to spend it without getting a cent back. Mr. Wiggins said one park here was taking care of thousands of people in a day at a cost of less than a cent apiece, and he very justly asks, "Where can you buy good entertainment for that amount anywhere else?" You can not do it. You can pay fifty cents to go to the movies, but it is not worth as much as the other. If this matter is handled on a fair business basis, it is more than self-supporting. The forests, if properly managed, will be eventually highly profitable. I am includ - ing a state forestry program in this enterprise. The parks can be made self-supporting from the date of admission. It is perhaps a technical problem in park management. My old friend, Mr. Parker, has been Chairman of the Park Commission and has had a great deal to do with the State Park system of Connecticut, and it has had a good, thorough test. They act on the principle that the State Park should not charge admission, but must provide for certain specific services, and may charge the ordinary commission rate for these services. Thousands of people go to swim, and the state must provide bath houses. A great many people want to rent bathing suits. The state can properly charge for that service what it is worth. If it does, it can make a profit on it. It can manage this business and make a profit, and Connecticut does it. Without taxing the patrons a cent, the state makes a good many of these parks self-supporting. I think in the acquisition of the original properties the state can well afford to put in considerable money. There should be direct appro - priations. Perhaps the Missouri method of using the fish and game license money is legitimate. Some method of financing must be found. It is much easier to do than is generally supposed. We come to the question of maintenance and management. The suggestions already made this morning are to the point. As soon as you have a system of properties of that kind under way, it becomes necessary to have brains to direct it — some one really trained for the game, and willing to devote a lifetime to it, and be paid enough so that a first-class man can be hired and kept. It must be removed from political interference so that a man can feel happy and comfortable. There are plenty of trained men to be found when Nebraska is ready to pay a reasonable price. The management of superintendents and </seg>

Summing it up, we have recognized a group of great, important, economic and social needs. We have a means of working out a system to meet them. The different points in building up the system are demonstrated in the experience of the different sets of men and women ready to take up the work. The financial difficulties are not serious. Why should any state lag? There is no excuse except social degenera - tion for any state which does not come forward with a constructive program in this field, and follow it up in the next few years. I thank you. THE PRESIDENT: We have had an interesting session this morning, and are going to have another this afternoon. Adjournment was then declared until 1:30 p.m. THIRD SESSION Wednesday Afternoon, January 6, 1926 The third session of the meeting was called to order at 1:50 p.m. on Wednesday, January 6, by President Banning. THE PRESIDENT: We have discussed flowers and trees and different things, and now we are coming this afternoon to the very important question of the Apple. That is something in which we are greatly interested, especially in the southeastern part of Nebraska. We will have the question of "Developing the Apple Industry in Southeastern Nebraska" presented by Frank Shubert, of Shubert, who is well qualified to talk on this sub - ject from actual experience. DEVELOPING THE APPLE INDUSTRY IN SOUTHEASTERN NEBRASKA FRANK SHUBERT, Shubert .Nebraska Mr. President, Members of the State Horticultural Society, and Ladies: I was in hopes we would have a larger crowd this afternoon than we have had before, but whatever it lacks in quantity no doubt is made up in quality. I notice most of the principal speakers took the other side of the speaker's table, with the exception of George Marshall; so I will line up with him and stay closer to the crowd. The speakers might be considered like the teacher who was teaching a class in zoology, and they were discussing the subject of the hippopotamus. She said, "If you want to know what it looks like, pay close attention and look at me." (Laughter.) So if you want to know what I have to say about orchards and apples, you vill have to pay close attention to get much out of it. </seg>
            <seg id="p497">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 497 I thought almost every speaker had at least one or two good points. While some of the subjects we have had at the meeting were not the ones in which I was most interested, still I found there was not a single subject on which I did not make a note or two to think over later on. I want to call your attention to one thing that came up in the talk by Mr. McCullough about the raising of forest trees in the sand - hills of Nebraska. It was a revelation to me. He said you could grow 1600 board feet of lumber on an acre of that sandhill land in a year. If that is true, how much is it worth? It is worth while to go home and think about it: If that is possible, think of the undeveloped re - sources of this country! I find as I try to talk to a crowd, after I am through I think of more things I did not say than I could think of to say while talking. I thought this subject was of enough importance that I could give it best by reducing a few thoughts to typewritten pages. As I was unable to attend the last session of the Horticultural Society, the members thereof decided to impose a penalty upon me, and perhaps you as well, by assigning me the topic "Developing the Apple Industry in Southeastern Nebraska." I remember well when I was a small boy, when there were no apples to speak of in Southeastern Nebraska, and how my father used to make a trip each fall down into Buchanan County, Missouri, and bring back a wagon load of apples; with great anticipation we awaited the return of father, driving proudly home with his wagon loaded with the most luscious apples that I have ever known. Old fashioned Rusty Coats, Sheep Nose, Romanites and Belle Flower, the aristocrats of the apple family in those days. My! how large, how well colored, finely flavored and juicy they were, not a worm in them that we kids ever found. I wonder if most of you have not had the same experience in your younger days, and if we do not all wonder at times if the apples are quite as good as they used to be. Meanwhile, my father, Mr. Henry Shubert, had planted an orchard of perhaps ten acres on the old home place in Nemaha County. This orchard I think was planted in 1872 or 73, and was the first orchard of that size in our section of the country. The varieties were Ben Davis, Winesap, Rusty Coats, Belle Flower, Northern Spy and perhaps some other varieties. About that time several other far sighted pioneers began to plant apple trees. Governor Robert W. Furnas, J. Sterling Morton, Isaac Pollard and others, which was the beginning of the development of the apple industry in Southeastern Nebraska. At this time there were no orchard pests to contend with, the codling moth and apple scab were unknown. The blister canker, blotch and kindred diseases of the present day were not present to worry those pioneer developers of the apple industry; out of the marked success </seg>
            <seg id="p498">498 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture of these early orchards came the inspiration that guided these same men into larger fields of endeavor. From 1885 to 1890 witnessed the planting of several small com - mercial orchards in Southeastern Nebraska, in a narrow strip some six to twelve miles wide along the Missouri River, from the Kansas line north thru the counties of Richardson, Nemaha, Otoe and Cass. These plantings were made at Falls City by the Weavers and Towles, and at Shubert by Henry W. Shubert, A. M. and J. F. Shubert; at Nebraska City by the Mortons; by Governor Furnas at Brownville and Isaac Pol - lard at Nehawka. There are others who are deserving of mention, but I have named only those outstanding figures in the development of the apple industry in this section. Today owing to the industry faith and vision of these horticulturists there is an apple district in Southeastern Nebraska that is attracting the attention of apple buyers from many of the principal cities of the country, because of the exceptional quality and high flavor of the apples grown. I have compared apples from the famed apple districts of the Pacific slopes and those of New York State, and from the hills of Vir - ginia, and I have yet to find an apple that is equal to ours in texture and flavor; in fact we claim and rightfully so, that we grow the finest flavored apples in the world. This is the natural home of the Jonathan, Winesap, Grimes Golden, Delicious, Ben Davis and Gano. The possibilities of commercial orcharding in Southeastern Nebraska are almost unlimited for those who go about it in an intelligent way. Apple growing is a science these days and the novice will meet with many disappointments, if not disaster and financial ruin. It takes long years of hard work and constant study, keeping in close touch with the State Horticultural Department in order to keep up to date and fully informed of the improved methods in planting, cultivating, prunfng, spraying, picking, packing and selling. Each operation is a problem within itself, but things you must know if you make a success of apple growing. I believe that the Loess Land &amp; Orchard Company that was organ - ized here in Lincoln in 1914, and operating in the Southeastern Nebraska fruit belt has more fully demonstrated what can be done in commercial orcharding than any other undertaking. This company is composed of quite a number of the leading nursery men, apple growers, and business men of this section. They started planting trees in 1£15 and now have four hundred and fifty acres at Shubert Nebraska and forty acres at Nebraska City; about one hundred twenty acres bore their first crop in 1924 at nine years old. Making a gross return of about $75.00 per acre. In 1925, the results were about the same on the eighty acre tract while one forty acre tract made a gross of about $150.00 at ten years old. Considering that we do not expect these orchards to come into full bearing until about fifteen years old, may give you some idea of the possibilities and proceeds of well kept orchards in Southeastern Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p499">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 499 In 1908 Mr. A. M. Shubert and myself acquired an eighty acre tract of land near Shubert upon which was forty acres of bearing orchard. The first year we had a good crop. In four years it had paid for itself, then we decided to find out what an orchard would do in the way of building up a property. Out of the proceeds of other crops of apples grown on this orchard, we bought another eighty acres of land and a little later on we purchased another forty acres of young orchard and today from the beginning of the first forty acres in 1908, as a working capital we own two hundred acres of good land, one hundred twenty acres of it is in bearing trees, forty acres of them just coming in, besides property in town worth half as much as the original invest - ment. This we handled as a side line to our other orchard business. Another concrete example of the possibilities of a commercial orch - ard where one gets off on the right foot. I could tell you of other in - stances of profit that were as great, but I fear that I might create the impression that all you have to do is to plant apple trees and sit down in the shade and wait for the dollars to roll into your hands. You will not find it so, if you are to be successful you must have knowledge of the business, sufficient capital to carry on and most of all you have the courage to work and to wait and overcome disappointments and difficulties for ten to fifteen years, before you reap your profit. Let me tell you something of the cost of planting and bringing an orchard into bearing. We should take as our first cost the value of the land, which I think, in Southeastern Nebraska, at the present time, would be not less than $150.00 per acre, for land of only average location and fertility. Well located lands near markets and in a good state of fertility would cost $200.00 per acre or more. Add to the basic price of $150.00 per acre the cost of forty to fifty good thrifty trees to the acre and the cost of preparing the ground and planting which would be not less than $25.00 per acre and we have $175.00 per acre. Then we estimate that the cost per acre per year for a period of ten years before the trees came into profitable bearing would be $10.00 to cover the cost of cultivating, pruning, and spraying. This cost of $10.00 per acre would be over and above what might reasonably be expected to be derived from any crops grown between the tree rows. This annual cost running for a period of ten years would add another total cost of $100.00 per acre. Bringing it up to $275.00. Then we have an interest and tax charge of not less than $10.00 per acre per year for a period of ten years which would add another $100.00 per acre, bringing the total cost per acre at the end of ten year period up to $375.00 per acre. Just in proportion as the grower started with lower or higher priced land than the basic price would the total cost be at the end of the ten year period. Now, the question arises, "Has the orchard cost too much or is it still worth the cost plus a reasonable amount for profit? We estimate the value in this way: If we have forty good thrifty trees per acre, </seg>
            <seg id="p500">500 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture which is the minimum number, we should have, we figure they are worth $10.00 per tree or a total of $400.00 per acre for the trees alone; add to this the basic price of the land which we will assume to be $150.00 per acre and we have a total value of $550.00 per acre. Whether this value of a good bearing orchard is correct or not, might be a matter of individual opinion. Unless we accept the figures as given here as the probable cost, and basing the returns on our past experience when it would seem that the value is as nearly correct as could be estimated. THE PRESIDENT We depend on the railroads, and the railroads depend on us to a certain extent; so there should be a sort of co-operation. They are interested in our troubles and we are interested in theirs, although sometimes we may express ourselves a little forcibly. Mr. Val Kuska, the Colonization Agent of the Burlington Road, will discuss "Services that the Railroads Render in the Agricultural Development of a Region." SERVICES THAT THE RAILROADS RENDER IN THE AGRICUL - TURAL DEVELOPMENT OF A REGION Friends and Neighbors: I was very much interested to hear what Mr. Shubert had to say. There were some things he brought out I was mighty glad to have you know about. One was selling from cars. I had occasion this fall to be in the west, and I saw a fellow hauling some apples to an empty store building. I said, "What are you doing? Where did you get these apples?" "On the western slope in Colorado." "Can't you sell them out of the car?" "No, sir." I do not know why we should put in such a rule, because as long as you do not use the cars for storage, we do not care. I think the reason was to keep away the professional peddler, or the man who uses the refrigerator cars for storage. I told Mr. Shubert what we had found in Chicago. We went before the Inter-State Commerce Commission. We found one car held for five weeks and used for storage. When the Northwestern terminal was congested, they billed their apples to the Northwestern Terminal. When it was cleared up, they rebilled them to the Burlington. We can not stop the car and charge demurrage. We would have been tickled to death to compel him to unload the car. I had a peculiar experience in Nebraska City last fall. We stopped at the Nebraska City Hotel. When the waitress came to take our orders for dessert, she said they had pineapple and banana pie. "We want apple pie." "We haven't it." VAL KUSKA, Omaha, Nebraska </seg>
            <seg id="p501">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 501 "Right here in the heart of the apple section, and no apple pie! There is something wrong. Why don't you go out and buy these apples and save freight rates, and feed them to us?" I think a little educational campaign would be a mighty good thing. I think Professor Wiggins had to eat banana cream pie. A little pub - licity along that line will do a great deal of good. Our headquarters is Omaha. Come to the Omaha office. I like to eat apples. I want to tell you of a little incident that occurred on this south - eastern trip. We had Bill Maupin and Will Owen Jones with us. Bill Maupin came in the morning with a great big grip. We said, "What have you in that grip?" "A necktie and a night shirt." "You don't need to carry a big grip like that, "I came prepared." When we reached the apple country, I saw him filling up his grip. We tried to give him some bricks, but he would not stand for it. Jones would like to have taken some apples but did not have room, and Bill Maupin said, "It is funny a man would go into an apple section and not know enough to carry a big grip," and he said, "It is a wonder Bill didn't take a trunk!" I was surprised, and I think Mr. Jones was surprised, to find the apple being unknown in Nebraska. I can not buy a Nebraska apple in a fruit store in Omaha. I can get them'there if I buy a barrel; but if I bought a barrel they would not last me long. You can not buy Nebraska apples at fruit stands in Omaha or Lincoln; at least, I have never found the place where they could be bought. That is the reason we are interested. We want to help you to put over a program to let the world know about the quality of the Nebraska apples. I, too, have reduced my speech to a manuscript, because if I get wound up I may go too far and wander on the subject. Possibly this paper will not be of interest to you, but I will try to bring out some of the things a railroad does to help develop a territory. We have probably neglected an opportunity from Council Bluffs to Kansas City, taking in Iowa, and Kansas and Missouri, because it is the only real apple section we have. In the past few years the need of a sound policy for agriculture and industry has come to the front. This possibly due to the fact that there is only one crop of land and many of the land policies and practices of the earlier days are a thing of the past, such as the homesteading of productive land at practically no outlay for reclama - tion and, also, the expectation of large increases in land values prac - tically gone. The agricultural classes are demanding conditions for profitable farming without the dependance on land speculation. Ever since the first railroad was built man has realized its usefulness and taken advantage of the opportunities that it affords to further development and to create prosperity and contentment. </seg>
            <seg id="p502">502 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture A railroad company is not a philanthropic institution. However, possibly due to its character of public service, the railroads are con - stantly being called upon to put their capital and service at the com - mand of the respective communities, or the proposed investor. In the early history of the development of the west and during the time when some of the railroads had the land grants to sell to the settlers, many of the railroads organized regular immigration or colonization departments to handle the settlers. Later many of the railroads organized regular agricultural development departments, of which coloni - zation became a part. To give you an idea of the part played by the railroads in the development of the west, I am quoting from Nebraska History published by the Nebraska Historical Society, edited by Dr. A. E. Sheldon, March, 1924: "It was the early policy of the Nebraska railroads, and especially of the Burlington, to find competent settlers to whom they could sell their lands at low prices and on long time. The land departments of the Nebraska railroads became the biggest boosters for the new region. Their immigration agencies and literature reached out around the world in search of the rugged type of farmer who would settle upon their lands, stick through all the pioneer hardships and discouragements and make a civilized region out of the wilderness. No agency was more efficient in settling Nebraska with a strong race of pioneers than the railroads." Mr. C. J. Ernst, Assistant Treasurer of the Burlington, in a recent address telling about the development of the west stated that: "In 1871 the Burlington General Land Office was opened in Lincoln, Nebraska, and the first sale of land was made April 1, 1871, and I sold the 'last acre' of our Nebraska grant on October 30, 1903. The railroad lands were at first very unpopular with people living close to the Mis - souri River, who adhered to the opinion that nothing would grow 10 miles west of the river. Land sales by the railroad company were slow until 1874 and just as sales were getting better the first grasshopper invasion arrived from the Rocky Mountains in midsummer of 1874. Scarcely anybody had paid any 'real money' on their land purchases. The terms of sale were easy, 10 years credit, nothing but interest at 6% payable annually the first four years. People who at once, or within two years, moved onto their railroad land, were refunded freight charges paid on emigrant movables and passenger fares paid for their families. Another and very important advantage given to the purchase of rail - road land, by the Burlington, which to the best of my recollection was not done by any other land-grant railroad, consisted of a discount of 20% applied on the very first payments of principal due on such con - tracts (so that it would pay all of the first installment of principal due in four years from purchase and a part of the second installment due in five years from date of purchase),, said discount called 'Premium for Improvements' being allowed purchasers who within two years </seg>
            <seg id="p503">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 503 from date of purchase would break up a certain portion of the land and continue its cultivation until said premium had been applied. No one I think, ever stopped cultivating the land thus entitled to that premium. The vast majority of those who had purchased land and not improved it prior to the grasshopper invasion of 1874, having in most cases only paid one year's interest of 6% forfeited their contracts, scared out by the hoppers." Hale Holden, President, Burlington Railroad, in an address at the annual banquet of the Veteran's Association of the Burlington at Lin - coln, Nebraska, October, 1924, stated that "* * * • during the years 1850 to 1870, when the Burlington road began, and during which many of its lines were constructed. "Governor Grimes of Iowa said that in those early days no one supposed that Iowa, west of the Des Moines River, would ever be inhabited by white men. "As late as 1871 it was the general belief that much of the land west of Lincoln was not worth ten cents per acre. "The influence of the reaper and other labor-saving devices have done much for the farmer, but all other agencies combined have not done as much as the building of railroads, for without railroads there would have been no markets, and without markets, products of the soil have little value." The Committee on Public Relations of the Western Railways, in their report state that: "In eastern territory about 7%% and in southern territory about 9%% of the tonnage of the railways consists of farm products, while in western territory 21% of the tonnage consists of farm products."' In a recent address, L. A. Downs, President, Central of Georgia Railway Company, Savannah, stated that: "Much of the tonnage of the railways is composed of products of the farms and freight hauled to the farms. Without this tonnage the railways would never have attained importance in the country's scheme of transportation. On the other hand, without the railways, agricul - ture would never have reached its present scope, but would have been limited to the area reached by the ox cart, the mule team and now the automobile. "Railway facilities have opened the markets of the world to the farmer." A railroad company has no primary interest in buying or selling property which is not planned to produce either freight or passenger traffic for the railroad. Nor can a railroad change geographical loca - tions or overcome natural disabilities by establishing rates which un - duly discriminate in favor of any location. Nor can they change natural laws, or by any scheme of rate adjustments make profitable an agricultural or business enterprise which has not natural justification. Nor can they by any legal adjustment of rates correct poor business methods, or mistakes that come from poor or inexperienced farming. </seg>
            <seg id="p504">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 504 I was glad to hear Mr. Shubert say what he did about the Panama Canal. I think that is where the secret lies. If they can place the Canal under some regulatory body so that you can compete with these coastal sections, you will get some place. A railroad can and does become a partner, or a co-partner, in help - ing to solve many of these problems: 1. By helping in colonize the territory. 2. By building a railroad. 3. By giving efficient and reasonable service. 4. By advising and furnishing expert and prompt information. The slogan of the Agricultural Development Department of the Burlington is "Prosperous communities mean prosperous railroads. A well satisfied settler is a good asset. A misplaced man is a liability." We in colonization now devote most of our time in co-operating with the respective localities in our territory, not only in inducing further settlement but, also, put forth effort to help those already settled to hold and help them become happy and prosperous. This we hope to accomplish in getting each community to realize their own worth and importance by interesting them in the taking of a moral inventory to see whether or not, in their own minds, opportunities exist. If they find such to be true, then we try and get them to co - ordinate all their single efforts into one and start telling the world about their locality. This is done: 1. By the issuance of an illustrated folder describing their par- ticular locality. 2. By letter writing to friends in the settler's old home. 3. By the spoken word and newspaper or other advertising. Relative to a settler's value to a railroad in dollars and cents there is a great variance in opinion, as there is no set rule that one can follow in estimating the amount of revenue derived directly from a settler's effort. This in a measure is due to the fact that the revenue depends upon the energy and determination of the particular settler and, also, upon the kind of crops or products that he has to sell. Some railroads use as a basis an estimate of the freight and passenger revenues derived and compute the average on the number of settlers in a farm locality. The estimates vary from about $170.00 to as high as $900.00 revenue. This, however, does not mean that a farm produces that much but all the revenue in a territory, when averaged, amounts to that much for the number of fanners in the locality. Our work does not cease when we have located the settler but our efforts are co-ordinated with activities of the Agricultural Agents who work directly with the settlers. For the purpose of best illustrating, I wish to mention some of the activities that have been carried on, among which are: </seg>
            <seg id="p505">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 505 The Pure Bred Sires Special operated in Colorado in the fall of 1923. Twenty-nine purebred bulls and boars were traded in even ex - change for scrubs. Testimonials from prominent stockmen and from men well qualified to know the situation, have stated that this was the biggest contribution toward the improvement of Colorado's livestock that has even been made. In several instances, farmers who were the recipients of these purebred boars topped the Denver market with their first crop of pigs. From questionnaires received from these men who received the purebred bulls, 95% stated that this was the first purebred bull they had ever owned and that they would never go back to a scrub sire. One particular example was brought home at the Boulder County Fair this fall. At Longmont we traded a purebred boar to a man by the name of Richart, for a measely looking scrub. This man had never before used a purebred boar. At the Boulder County Fair this year there was a splendid display of modern type Duroc hogs and above this pen was the sign: "D. R. Richart, Breeder of Purebred Durocs." In the fall of 1924, co-operating with the University of Nebraska and the Nebraska Dairy Breeders interests, a similar train was operated in Nebraska. This time 31 purebred dairy bulls were used in the trades. Although it is a little early yet to have very definite results, we do know of at least five cars of high grade dairy cows being introduced into communities where one of these purebred bulls was left. Our station agent at Burwell advised us that 1100 ten-gallon cans of cream had been shipped from that point during the month of June, which was the largest shipment of any previous year. These cans net approximately $12.50, which means that in the neighborhood of $14,000 was received from cream by farmers tributary to Burwell during the month of June, following the operation of the Dairy Train. The agent at Grant, Nebraska, states that cream shipments for the six months from November, 1924, to April, 1925, increased 500 cans over the six months a year ago. He states that this is due to the operation of our Purebred Special. The "Another Ton Per Acre" campaign was put on by the Burling - ton and the Union Pacific, each co-operating with the Great Western Sugar Company, in the spring of 1925. To give you an idea of the value of this campaign to the farmers and the railroads, I am quoting from a report by H. L. Ford, Agricultural Agent, C. B. &amp; Q., Denver: "In this exhibit car were actual demonstrations with beets growing to show the value of more efficient methods. Three points were empha - sized: First, to leave a proper stand — that is the beets 12 to 14 inches in the rows instead of 21 inches as was the spacing in 1924. Second, to leave the big beet in the blocked bunch, and third, timely thinning. "Meetings were held at practically every beet dump and every factory site in the territory. Meetings were conducted in English for the growers and in Spanish and German for the beet workers. Splen- </seg>
            <seg id="p506">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 506 did interest was shown by the attendance at these meetings, in spite of the fact that the campaign was conducted in a very busy season for the farmers. "As a result of this campaign, the average yield of beets in the entire Great Western territory, which embraces about 185,000 acres, was increased more than a ton per acre over last year's yield. Figures are still incomplete but I am informed by the Great Western Sugar Company that present indications are that this increased yield is going to be nearer two tons per acre than one ton. The most outstanding yield was in the North Platte Valley where on over 50,000 acres an average yield of 16.4 tons were obtained, over an average of a little less than 12 tons per acre last year. . Even in a drought stricken terri - tory of northern Colorado, the highest yield per acre was obtained that has ever been recorded and is nearly two tons per acre more than last year's yield. According to the Great Western Sugar Company and from testimonials of beet growers themselves, no single factor has ever been presented that showed more efficiency of agricultural practices than was demonstrated with this beet exhibit train. "To put the results of this campaign on a dollar and a cents basis, it means that the beet growers in the Great Western territory received an additional 185,000 tons of beets with practically no increase in cost of production. Each ton of these beets will bring to the grower about $7.00 — or this campaign put into the hands of the beet growers of the three states better than V,i million dollars in addition to what they would have received if they had not made this additional ton per acre. From the railroad's standpoint, our traffic department fig - ures that each acre of beets is worth about $30.00 a year in revenue. This takes into consideration revenue accruing from beets, lime-rock, coal, sugar, passenger traffic and all incidental traffic affected by the beet industry. Of this 185,000 acres, about 85,000 acres were directly tributary to our line. This means that we handled 85,000 tons more beets, which is equivalent to about 2,200 carloads. This additional 85,000 tons is enough beets to support a small sized factory, and is also equivalent to the production from about 7,500 acres of new beet land. Therefore, figuring $30.00 per acre, this campaign meant to the Bur - lington Railroad an increased revenue of close to a quarter million dollars. It meant also about the same amount to the Sugar Company. You can readily see that this was a mutual campaign, affecting the grower, affecting the laborer, affecting the Sugar Company and the railroad. Four years ago, there were less than 1500 acres of corn grown in the Big Horn Basin of Wyoming. The Agricultural Department offered to furnish any one who would try to grow corn in the Basin enough seed for two acres. We furnished at that time seed for over 700 people. Last year there was better than 9,000 acres of corn grown in the Basin. At the Third Wyoming Corn Show there were 124 entry - men; 311 class entries and 4,500 individual ears on display. This </seg>
            <seg id="p507">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 507 country has developed most rapidly because of the development of corn growing in that section. We were prompted to put on this Corn Campaign by the need for something to fatten some of the high quality livestock that is produced up there, and which in the past had always been shipped out in the fall to supply feeders in the East. Such a movement taxed our capacity for handling as the shipments were to be made within short periods every fall, then the balance of the year practically little or no live - stock movement. Now the feeding of livestock has taken a firm foot - hold up there and an increasing number of both sheep and cattle is being fed annually, thus using up much of the high quality alfalfa hay raised there, as well as other roughage. The livestock shipments are better balanced and the manure goes back on the land, thus helping to keep up the fertility of the soil. An interesting side line developed in this connection. The Basin territory had long been bothered by ravages from grasshoppers. So we encouraged the people up there to raise more poultry and especially turkeys. It was necesary to have corn to finish the turkey so many got started in corn for that purpose. We immediately realized that if turkeys were raised they must be marketed, so we encouraged and helped the farmers to organize a Marketing Association through which the turkeys could be marketed. After the organization it was up to us to locate buyers, which we did by asking all the large handlers of poultry to make bids. To our surprise we found that from a very limited number of pounds of turkeys shipped five years ago, the shipment had increased up to 21 solid carloads of dressed turkeys in 1924, and indica - tions are that approximately the same amount has been shipped in 1925. These mostly in Chicago, New York City and other eastern mar - kets. In quality these birds surpassed all other localities in the United States, and the farmer, on account of the organization, was able to receive from 6 to 13 cents per pound more than if he had not been so organized. It is estimated that approximately $175,000.00 will be paid for turkeys up there, and this is a territory inhabited by less than 25,000 people. A year ago I was at the Sherman Hotel and a bunch of apricot buyers got word it was storming in Wyoming. They said, "You have a warm room. You do not need to go out. We have to go and buy apricots." "Why don't you go to Texas — the apricot center of the world? It is warm there." They said, "How little you know about this business. The finest apricots in the world are produced in Wyoming." "I am from the Burlington railroad, and I wondered why you are coming to our territory to buy apricots." They get them to ship to Chicago and New York, because they have quality. </seg>
            <seg id="p508">508 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture We have tributary to our lines in Northwest Nebraska an area that is well adapted to the production of high grade seed potatoes. In the development of this industry the railroad is taking great interest, as can be gathered from the following report by Fred L. Taylor, Assist - ant Agricultural Agent in charge of the potato work on our lines: "In 1919, the Horticultural Department of the University of Ne - braska instituted the seed potato certification work in western Nebraska. This was a service offered to the potato growers of western Nebraska for the purpose of helping them, individually and collectively, to grow better seed potatoes, and to standardize their seed on a quality basis — thereby improving the market for seed by assuring the buyer of a higher standard product. One of the first big problems that presented itself in this work was to sell the idea to the growers. "In 1919, the Horticultural Department of the University of Ne - braska instituted the seed potato certification work in western Ne - braska. This was a service offered to the potato growers of western Nebraska for the purpose of helping them, individually and collectively, to grow better seed potatoes, and to standardize their seed on a quality basis — thereby improving the market for seed by assuring the buyer of a higher standard product. One of the first big problems that presented itself in this work was to sell the idea to the growers. "It was imperative that if western Nebraska seed potatoes were to compete with seed from other states they would need to be improved. In this first work, the Burlington assisted by operating a potato demon - stration car in which graphic illustrations, together with pictures and charts, showed the growers conclusively ways to overcome some of their potato problems and improve their seed. During the operation of this car, the Burlington distributed to growers throughout its terri - tory in the western part of Nebraska 10-pound sacks of what was then considered by specialists of the Horticultural Department, of the Uni - versity of Nebraska, the best Triumph seed in the state. In many cases, this 10-pound sample of seed was the foundation stock upon which the growers have since developed a large and profitable seed business. "As a result of this beginning, Western Nebraska in a very short time was producing a large volume of certified seed potatoes. The next big problem was to convince the southern growers, who were already demanding northern grown seed, of the superiority of certified seed over common stock. This was done very efficiently through the co - operation of Boys and Girls Potato Clubs of Louisiana. At different times, the western Nebraska certified growers have furnished free to these club members several cars of certified seed for demonstration purpose. Here again the Burlington assisted by transporting this stock free of cost. As a result of this work with the Boys and Girls Clubs, in 1921 Louisiana secured 10 cars of western Nebraska seed. In 1922, they secured 40 cars and in 1923 this was increased to 200 cars. In all this work, the Agricultural Department of the Burlington Railroad has been working hand in hand, with the Agricultural College and the grow- </seg>
            <seg id="p509">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 509 ers in improving the seed stock and especially in helping to develop new and expanding old markets. A number of trips have been made to the potato sections of Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Ala - bama and Mississippi for the purpose of interesting growers in those districts in securing their certified seed potatoes from our western territory. "Working with the Agricultural Agents of the L. &amp; N. Railroad, who were endeavoring to develop the Irish potato industry along their lines in southern Alabama, we interested them in western Nebraska seed. Three years ago, one car of Nebraska seed was placed in this section. The following year eight cars of Nebraska seed were shipped in and last year this was increased to 29 cars. In October, 1925, a trip was made to this section where, in cooperation with the Agri - cultural Department of the L. &amp; N. meetings were held with the growers telling them of the methods used in growing certified seed and of the importance of securing the best seed available. As a result of these meetings, already this season more than 50 cars of seed have been purchased by growers in this section from western Nebraska. "In addition to the foregoing, we have supplied certified seed to county agents, Smith-Hughes teachers, extension specialists and grow - ers for demonstrational purposes in South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri. "Just now arrangements are being made to operate a special train of Nebraska seed potatoes from Alliance to the south. The primary purpose in handling this train special is for the publicity and advertis - ing it will give western Nebraska seed, thereby enlarging the demand and market for products tributary to our lines." I have mentioned these items to give you an idea of some of the work that is being done by the railroads in developing the territory. Now permit me to give you an idea of some of the burdens that are placed on the railroads, and the speedy and efficient service which they try to render in handling the tonnage, the success of which is very real in the development of any locality. I want to quote from the U. S. D. A. Crops and Markets Report for December 5, 1925, which shows that there were handled approximately 15,000 cars more grapes up to November 28 last year than any previous year. "Due to the extraordinary loadings of California grapes during the last half of September and all of October, refrigerator equipment was withdrawn from all other territory in the United States where possible except for use of iced loadings. Weather during this period permitted the use of box and ventilator equipment for many products usually shipped in refrigerators without ice. Even with this arrange - ment it was impossible to supply fully the grape shippers with refrig - erator cars. This was due not only to the unprecedented grape load - ings but also because shipments needing refrigerators in other sections of the country exceeded the previous year's requirements. The high </seg>
            <seg id="p510">510 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture price of potatoes, for example, made calls for this class of equipment heavier than normal, the refrigerator cars being desired for their greater flexibility of movement. "It is impossible to state definitely the curtailment of grape ship - ments which resulted from the car shortage. Many shippers claimed that they would have forwarded more cars if the equipment had been available. Some ventured the estimate that shipments would have risen to 2,000 or 2,500 cars per day if the shortage had not developed. From a marketing standpoint, it is perhaps fortunate that such a development did occur. Even though shippers might have desired to roll 2,000 or more cars daily, it is not likely that shook supplies and labor, particularly box makers, could have kept up with this pace very long. The movement of 900 to 1,500 cars per day, in spite of car shortage, indicated that there was in the aggregate a fairly liberal supply of equipment. Some shippers expressed the situation con - versely, saying that the chief difficulty was an oversupply of grapes at that particular period." This morning at the breakfast table you may have had grape fruit or oranges from Florida, Texas or California. Sliced bananas from the tropics for lunch; mountain lettuce from Colorado; tomatoes from the South and Idaho baked potatoes, and you may even had one of the big baked red apples from the Wenatchee Valley, Washington. This would have been impossible without the development of the modern refrigerator car and its speedy transportation. Wenatchee now has become world famous as "The Land of the Big Red Apple." In the early nineties at the coming of the Great Northern Railway, the Wenatchee Valley was a sagebrush covered desert and to all appearances arid and worthless. The fruit industry is now on a business basis and strict business methods are being followed by the growers, and every means that science and experience have developed are being followed. The best evidence of the development of the Valley can be noted by the car loads of apples shipped. In 1902 they shipped two cars as compared to 17,000 cars in 1924. It is said that the Wenatchee District produced more apples in 1924 than all the state of New York, and more than Colorado, California, Oregon and Idaho combined. Now I am taking the liberty to quote from an editorial in the Omaha Bee of February 27, 1926, which was as follows: "Just fifty years ago the Burlington &amp; Missouri River Railroad Management announced that it would carry free all seed grain shipped to Nebraska farmers. The offer was made because just the year before Nebraska was visited by the grasshoppers. There are many alive today who went through that awful period of suffering and privation. Spring in Nebraska just fifty years ago opened upon a scene of desolation. No crops had been raised the year before. The homesteaders were desti - tute. They had no money to buy seed, no money to pay freight, no </seg>
            <seg id="p511">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 511 money to buy anything, and then the great heart of America was opened and the seed poured in. A corporation, commonly credited with not possessing a soul, agreed to carry it free to the homesteaders. Then it was that hope revived, courage was regained and Nebraska well started along the road to her present wonderful development. "Nebraska has come a long way during the fifty years since the Burlington announced that it would carry free the seed donated to Ne - braska farmers and homesteaders. The development of Nebraska dur - ing that half century has never been equaled in the history of the world." I have given you some of the high spots in what the railroads have done to help develop their territories. We of the railroads feel that the problems of the community are our problems, and that the railroad problems are their problems, as we are their neighbors, taxpayers and merchants in each of the communities we serve and are, therefore, very vitally interested in their future prosperity. DISCUSSION GROVE PORTER (Nebraska City) : There were one or two things brought out in Val's talk and Mr Shubert's talk with which I can not agree. One thing is this freight rate from the west. There is a high freight rate for everything shipped from the west, and I think it is absolutely the biggest talking point we have in our favor. I do not wish you hard luck, but it would not make any difference if the railroads would double it. Their stuff is coming in on this market. If we can make the difference on the freight rate on apples right along per box or basket, I think it would be a pretty good thing. Of course the Panama Canal will enable them to get the fruit on the eastern markets cheaper. That is all right, too. There is no need of anybody in Nebraska figuring on eastern markets to dispose of all the apples we can grow. It seems to me our market is right here. The states in this section will take care of everything we can grow, and I believe it is the best apple market, anyway. Take Minneapolis and Chicago. There are two good markets. People say they can not buy Nebraska apples in Nebraska. It is not the grower's fault. These other fellows come in and buy our apples and ship them into other states, and our people will buy apples shipped from the west. Take it at Nebraska City. A man will offer me a thousand dollars in August and say, "I will take your entire crop of apples — all the Number One's — for so much." So you sell on the basis of two dollars a bushel, and he will take all. The people from Nebraska City who want our apples think if we ask them two dollars a bushel, we are crooks. Absolutely the fellow coming from Lincoln and Omaha will pay more money for apples and not say a word, than the people in Nebraska City. They will look at your apples. Here are three qualities, say at 75c, $1.00 and $2.00. They will want the </seg>
            <seg id="p512">512 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture t Fig I. 8 — Th: pickers in the Morton orchard at Nebraska City posing for the camera man. (By courtesy of Dr. Condra, Uni. of Nebr.) $2.00 apples but they can not see why the price is not 75c. We are at the border of town. I would not care if never a soul from Nebraska City came out, because they think the stuff should be given to them. The same thing happened to Mr. Stivers at Brownville. He had sold bo many apples and the cars came so fast he had to get out of Brown - ville and close up. The people living there are not willing to pay as much as the people who drive in. Speaking of hotels and restaurants, if they come out they will take the third-grade stuff and holler about it. As far as the freight rate is concerned, the market for our apples is right here, and it is only a question of our growing the stuff and developing the market within a thousand miles each way; and if the high freight rates will keep these other fellows from coming in, that is what we want. </seg>
            <seg id="p513">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 513 Fig. 9 — Mr. A. J. Weaver of Falls City explaining the advantages of southeast Nebraska as a fruit section. (By courtesy of Dr. Condra, Uni. of Nebr. ) My idea is somebody is going out of the apple business some place — either the fellov/ in New York or Missouri or on the coast — or else they will develop their markets. The New Yorkers can not raise apples and ship them here in competition with our home-grown fruit, when we get our orchards going in Nebraska. Three carloads of New York apples came to Nebraska and went into Auburn. If you have seen the New York apples when they get here, you will know they are mighty sick looking apples. These were New York Baldwins. They have a pale green color. That is a condition we are going to have to straighten up. If that high freight rate stays, these western growers will have to go to the Pacific markets. If freight rate is down to where they can put apples in here and sell them for what we sell ours, you can talk all you want to about the quality of the Nebraska apples, but those western packed apples will make them forget about the quality. Another thing is this marketing from cars. I am a member of the Central Regional Advisory Board. There are eight or ten of these boards in the United States. I talked to Mr. Shubert some time last summer about marketing from cars, and took it up at the last meeting of this Board. They said there is not anything that can be done about that matter. They explained it in this way. Take Grand Island, for instance. Those wholesale dealers have quite an investment in their </seg>
            <seg id="p514">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 514 storage houses and businesses. They are the fellows who had this ruling passed. When I took this matter up with the Board, they felt it would be impossible to get any legislation enacted that would permit peddling from cars, for the simple reason that the business men in these towns along the line needed that much protection. MR. KUSKA: The one trouble is, that it discriminates against you to go to small towns where there is no such investment and where the wholesalers get very little business. I think Mr. Porter has brought out what the rule is and why it must be applied to all. It is to protect the investment these people in the big terminals have, who are the people you must depend upon to market your stuff eventually. You can not take care of the small-town situation. When the Market Association was organ - ized in the Basin Country they had to depend upon the large sellers of produce who could pay bigger money than any individual. They would not have fooled with them if they had not been organized. MR. SHUBERT: I do not quite agree with you. The idea about selling from cars occurs to me this way: There might be some excuse in the larger towns where the apple jobbers have an actual investment. Suppose you go to the small towns, which are the places to distribute these apples. You have the same condition you have in Grand Island. You can not sell them from the car. There are plenty of places where they can unload a carload in one day. We sold three carloads to a lady in the state Flo. 10 — The culls from the apple orchards are turned into vinegar. This plant at Nebraska City takes care of the local culls. In addition many gallons of cider are shipped in from other orchard sections. (By courtesy of Dr. Condra, Uni. of Nebr.) </seg>
            <seg id="p515">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 515 who unloaded one car in less than a day. These fellows in the larger towns want to discourage that practice in the smaller towns, because they supply these little towns at an enormous price. That is one thing that holds down the distribution of these apples. If we could put these apples into the hands of the consumers and cut out some of these middle men, that is what we want. If we are going to make a market like Mr. Porter speaks about, we need distribution from the grower to the consumer. The middle man has always been in the way, so far as I can see it. It is barely possible there might be some larger places where it could be fixed according to stipulation. Our salesmen go to the little towns and you must give some merchant twenty cents a bushel to take the orders and get them. It is only a graft that these cars of apples can only be unloaded through some dealer. A VOICE: Correct! You are right! That's the way they treated me. MR. PORTER: I do not want to give the impression I do not want this. I went out with the idea of getting this fixed up. We want to get started on something to remedy that. One way to do it would be for the Society to pass a resolution to that effect, and appoint a committee to get after that. I told them there was one thing we were going after, and that was their reply. MR. CHRISTY: That was taken up before our State Commission through the Horticultural Society. They took it before the Interstate Commerce Commission. The decision was we could not hold the car for a sales room — that we could not hold it as a distributing point; Fig. II — One of Mr. A. J. Weaver's profitable orchards near Falls City, Nebr. (By courtesy of Dr. Condra, Uni. of Nebr.) </seg>
            <seg id="p516">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 516 but that we could not be prevented from delivering from the car. At the present time when I run into a town of that kind, I have my order blank with me. They can not prevent that. It is a ruling of the Interstate Commerce Commission. PROFESSOR WIGGINS: There is argument on both sides. It would be a great benefit to the grower if he could unload direct from the car, but there is the other side of the situation which has been mentioned. MR. CHRISTY: It would be a benefit to the consumer, too. A MEMBER: How do you get the orders? MR. CHRISTY: They come out to the car. SECRETARY HOPPERT: I think here at Lincoln the shipper had a little office and took the orders, and the people went to the car to get them. After you have the order, you can go to the car and get your potatoes or apples. MR. KUSKA: That's the way they are getting around it. WHAT WE THINK OF GRADING MACHINES GROVE PORTER, Nebraska City, Nebraska Now, about grading machines: We have a large Cutler grader which the Horticultural Department loaned to us with a view of testing it out under field conditions in Nebraska. It has a capacity of 350 to 400 barrels a day — probably 600 baskets a day. The machine could handle it if the men could take care of it. I believe the Cutler, or any good, reliable grader will pay for itself in a very short time in any orchard of over ten acres. The fruit can be handled in much better shape. You have a smaller percentage on the old-fashioned table, and the work can be done with cheap labor. Lots of places they use women as sorters, and they are faster than men. They are more reliable, and in that way, from a help standpoint, it is cheaper and more efficient as far as getting the work done. From the standpoint of keeping the men going, if you have seven or eight men picking apples at a grading machine they will move a lot of apples, for they must keep up with the machines. We packed Jonathans, Wine Saps, and Delicious, and we found this machine would size the fruit by weight fairly accurately. The way our apples ran this year, we thought it was probably best to pack only one size of the fruit. In that way, all apples above two and one - fourth inches were packed together. The time is coming when we will have to change from a barrel to the smaller package in order to supply the market here at home. </seg>
            <seg id="p517">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 517 I know there are eighteen cars of Nebraska apples in Omaha in storage right now. There are some in Lincoln. They are sold as a rule in little grocery stores by the peck. You will find a lot of them won't be sold for a while yet. Some Nebraska Wine Saps will be held two months longer. The Jonathans are practically all gone. If we are going to cultivate this trade close at hand, I think we are going to have to come to the smaller package for a certain class of trade. A grading machine is absolutely necessary. It will mean perhaps that the smaller apples will be barreled, and the larger ones placed in baskets or boxes. Right now practically all the old-bearing orchards are about gone. On the older trees the apples are usually smaller. You can not make as fancy a grade from these as you can of the fruit from young trees. In Nebraska I believe there are 1500 acres of young trees coming into bearing, and there will be more coming in all the time, which will have some bearing on the pack. I believe any sort of a grading machine of standard make is a mighty good investment to any man in the commercial apple business. I think it will save him money and bring out the faults in his growing more than anything else you can imagine. You might think you have a fine crop of apples; but when they commence rolling over one of those big graders where you can see all sides, they do not look nearly so well. (Laughter.) They are turning over all the time and you can see every defect. I believe a Cutler grader or some other kind is just as important as your spraying machine. I know we will never be without one, and everyone I have talked to who has used one feels it usually pays for itself the first year. The size of the machine needed depends upon th amount of apples to be handled. WHAT WE THINK OF GRADING MACHINES GUY SHUBERT, Shubert, Nebraska I think the field has been covered by Mr. Porter. The machine we have been using is not a grader or sizer. It is called a mechanical sorter. The apples are picked and either placed in barrels or boxes. Then they are brought to the packing shed and put onto the hopper and passed over a sorter. The small apples are eliminated mechanic - ally. The others pass over six rollers that automatically turn them over. Then they are conveyed to the sorting bins. During this opera - tion, the defective apples are taken out. We have been able to increase our capacity. We feel we have saved the labor of from two to three men each day we have operated the machines. We think this mechan - ical sorter has more than paid for itself with our 1925 crop the first year we used it. We have not had experience with the grader or sizer. </seg>
            <seg id="p518">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 518 The sorting table cost a little over $200 installed. It is driven by electric motor. A gasoline engine would cost more money than a motor and would not be as convenient to operate. DISCUSSION SECRETARY HOPPERT: You prefer that system to grading and sorting in the orchard with movable tables? MR. SHUBERT: We find it much more satisfactory. We have been doing our packing in a central packing station. We used to handle it the other way, and are able to get more work out of our men this way. We work ten hours a day. We can start at seven and work until six. Everything is in the dry. If we have a cold snap, we have a supply of apples ahead, and we can go ahead and pack apples half a day until they are ready to come out of the orchards again. SECRETARY HOPPERT: The advantage you see in the revolving rollers is that a man doea not have to pick the apples up to look at the other side? MR. SHUBERT: Not only that, but the small apples are imme - diately eliminated. The 2%-inch apples are eliminated at the start, and the apples are automatically turned over in being conveyed to the sorting bins. It turns the apple over, and you can see the defective apples, all right. When you start the motor in the morning and have plenty of apples, your men must work, because there is a steady stream of apples going all the time. We use what we call field barrels — an ordinary apple barrel. Some growers use a heavier constructed barrel. We nail it well. We think we find we get more business from the apple boxes than from the apple barrels. We have a picking sack we designed ourselves. My father and J. F. Shubert, perhaps ten years ago, got together and designed a special sack. I do not believe I have ever seen one like it on the market. There are some similar. It would be hard to describe that sack. It holds a bushel. There is a snap bottom on it and the straps go over the shoulders and cross in the back like suspenders. We have two snap fasteners on the shoulder and one in the bottom. QUESTION: Do you find the pickers in climbing around the tre« will unfasten the catch and drop their apples? ANSWER: We use a small snap instead of a patent fastener. Q. Do you pay your pickers by the bushel? A. Yes. Q. Then you have a foreman to keep track of the amount they picked? </seg>
            <seg id="p519">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 519 A. In one of those orchards we use a ticket system and give the pickers tickets numbered from one to thirty, each morning. When a barrel of apples is picked, he places his ticket on top of the apples. When the foreman takes them to the packing house, he gathers up the tickets. We have used the picking tag and the tally punch, and have a foreman with the men to punch the bushels rather than the barrels. Q. How can you check on the quality of the picking? A. The only way to take care of that is to have our foreman keep a pretty close tab on the men. We have not been getting a great deal of bruises. Such varieties as the Grimes Golden we do not pick by the bushel; neither do we pick the Duchess by the bushel. We pick our Wine Sap and B€n Davis and similar varieties by the bushel, and get very few bruises. We have to get after the pickers once in a while. Q. Have you any special type of ladders? A. We use the ordinary straight ladders. Some of the pickers would rather have the square-top ladder, and some the pointed-top. We use both kinds. I think they can get into tighter places with pointed ladders and do not knock off as many apples as with the square ladder. Q. What do you pay a bushel for picking? A. The price varies according to the age of the trees and the kind of a crop we have. The past year our average price was hardly five cents a bushel. A man averages 80 to 90 bushels of apples a day. That included picking on young trees. Q. You have different prices for picking on young and old trees? A. Yes. We must govern the price by the variety, the age of trees, etc. A good many times we pay four cents for Ben Davis, and in the same orchard, we have to pay five cents for Wine Saps. We make them clean the trees as they go. Q. Where you handle boxes in the orchard, do you think you can handle better than with the truck? A. That is a matter of opinion? It takes two men to handle the barrels, and it really takes two to handle the boxes. While you are moving one barrel, you are moving the equivalent to three boxes. I do not believe you get as much bruise in the apple barrel as in the box, if the first sack is let down in the barrel carefully. Q. Do you put anything over the top to keep them from shaking out? A. We do not fill the barrels full. Probably they lack four inches of being level full. We pay on the basis of three bushels in a barrel. By the time it has left the orchard, the apples are within probably six inches of the top. We get about two bushels and three pecks for three bushels as picked. </seg>
            <seg id="p520">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 520 We are using two or three different kinds of trucks. We are using some Ford trucks with a special body that holds fifteen barrels. It has a flat bottom. We do some hauling with teams and wagons. We have trucks that hold from sixteen to eighteen barrels. THE PRESIDENT: At this time we will take up our business meeting BUSINESS MEETING The minutes of the 1925 annual meeting of the Society were read by Secretary Hoppert. Mrs. H. W. Marshall moved the minutes be accepted as read, and the motion prevailed. ELECTION OF OFFICERS President MR. H. W. MARSHALL: I nominate Mr. Banning. THE PRESIDENT: I have had my term, and it would be well to select some one else. MR. C. J. MARSHALL: I move the rules be suspended and the Secretary cast the unanimous ballot of the Society for W. B. Banning for President for the ensuing year. The motion prevailed and the ballot was so cast. THE PRESIDENT: I will not take up your time delivering a long speech. First Vice-president THE SECRETARY: Mr. Green says young Mr. Henderson is in line for that job. He is a florist. C. J. MARSHALL: Mr. Davidson is the Second Vice-President. I should like to see him made First Vice-President and make Mr. Hender - son, Second Vice-President. I place in nomination J. R. Davidson for First Vice-President. THE SECRETARY: It has been the custom for the First Vice- President to be Superintendent of the Fruit Display. He has not taken an active interest for the last five years. It has been the Secretary who has had to do all the work. MR.

The motion prevailed, and the ballot was so cast. </seg>
            <seg id="p521">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 521 Second Vice-President C. J. MARSHALL: The florists probably know better what they expect than some of the rest of us. If we want to carry on the same plan we have had heretofore, it might be well to have a florist on somewhere. While they have separate meetings and do not meet with us as a Society, we must cooperate with them at the State Fair. That is the matter I want to bring up. I have nothing special in mind, but for a number of years the fruit-growing and florists' branch of the Society have both been interested in the State Fair exhibit. As men - tioned, the First Vice-President was supposed to be the Superintendent of Fruit, and the Second Vice-President to be the Superintendent of the Flower Show. I do not know whether or not there are any florists here to speak for the Florists's Society as to how they want to co - operate with the Horticultural Society in this work. MR. HILTNER: There has not been a meeting for two years. They met in Omaha a year ago. THE SECRETARY: They have a hard time agreeing where they want to hold the show, and as a result, they did not have any show. I regret that Mr. Green wishes to have his name dropped, because he has given us good co-operation. Perhaps Mr. Henderson will do the same. I will say for Mr. Green he looked after the exhibits at the Fair, I mean in the arranging of the entire Show. He can not give the time to it, being an active business man. Because Mr. Green desires to have his name dropped, I think we had better take Mr. Henderson. C. J. MARSHALL: I nominate Mr. H. R. Henderson, of Omaha, as Second Vice-President. MR. COE: I move the rules be suspended and the Secretary cast the unanimous ballot of the Society for Mr. Henderson. The motion prevailed and the ballot was so cast. Director for Three Years MR. PORTER: I should like to nominate a fruit grower from Peru who is getting into the apple business stronger every year — Dr. N. S. Haradjian. It was moved the rules be suspended, and the Secretary cast the unanimous ballot for Dr. Haradjian as director. The motion prevailed and the ballot was so cast. MR. PORTER: I have heard some of the commercial growers want to fire the Secretary because he is talking about home orchards. (Laughter.) Treasurer MR. CHRISTY: I place in nomination J. F. Shubert for another year. He has not stolen the money for this year. </seg>
            <seg id="p522">522 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture It was moved the nominations be closed, and the Secretary instructed t» cast the unanimous ballot of the Society for Mr. Shubert. The motion prevailed and the motion was so cast. Secretary The Secretary is appointed by the Board of Directors. Result of Election MR. PORTER: While I was in Kansas City, a member of the Missouri State Horticultural Society asked me to take his money for membership in the Nebraska Society, and a member of the Kansas State Society did the same. I think as long as we have such a popular Society the members from other states are applying for membership, it might be a good idea to remind everyone here the mem - bership is one dollar a year. I think there are some people who are going into the business who are not members of this Society. Five dollars will pay for a life membership. If we can bolster up our mem - bership, it might be possible to get a little better action on this propo - sition of unloading from cars. MR. COE: I happen to notice a little publication in the Minnesota Horticultural Society, which has two thousand members and is making a drive for three thousand. While I do not know what the total mem - bership of this Society is, I should like to see it increased quite a good deal. They can not raise as good fruit in Minnesota as we can. G. J. MARSHALL: How many life members have we? THE SECRETARY: About 180 life members, and thirty annual members. We have not made much of a drive along that line. One reason was because we did not have anything to give except the winter meetings, and they can get in without being members. We did not have an annual report. It is not ready for distribution right now. It has been in the hands of the people at the State Board of Agriculture since May first. SECRETARY'S REPORT E. H. HOPPERT, Agricultural College During the year 1925 the efforts of the Society were directed along four principal lines, namely program for the winter meetings January 3 to 5, summer tour, State Fair exhibit and fruit display at the Horti - cultural Exposition at Kansas City.

            <seg id="p523">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 523 Annual Meeting — Those of you who were present at the meetings last year will agree that an interesting and well attended program was carried out. Two sessions were devoted to Landscape Gardening and Parks, the other three sessions were devoted to fruit growing. Outside speakers secured for these meetings were Prof. Diggs of Ames, who is the Extension Specialist in Landscape Gardening and supervises the State Parks of Iowa. Prof. Pickett, who is the Chair - man of the Dept. of Horticulture at Ames gave a very interesting talk on use of fertilizers in commercial orchards. Mrs. Fred Merrill of the Central States Orchard Co. discussed packing and pruning. The report covering these meetings was gotten ready by May but has as yet not appeared from the printer. The printing of annual re - ports at present is being supervised by the Board of Agriculture and since our report is being included in the annual report of the Board of Agriculture it was held up until after State Fair. Many of you have probably wondered why the reports of the two years preceding 1935 have never appeared. The former secretary, Mr. Keyser, failed to publish these reports and they will be included in one report with the 1925 report; these ought* to be ready for distribution by the middle of January.

            <seg id="p524">524 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Summer Tour — August 6 and 7. A summer tour had been planned in cooperation with the Iowa Horticultural Society and the Kansas Society for some time in August. It was found, however, that I could not be included because of con - flicting dates. It was possible, however, to arrange with Kansas to cooperate in a tour. Starting at Nebraska City we visited a number of commercial orchards in that vicinity. Late in the afternoon a short program was held at the east side of Arbor Lodge mansion. The next morning the Lord Orchard at Peru was visited, the Parks vineyard at Brownville, then the Furnas small fruit plantation and the old vineyard set out by Governor Furnas 53 years ago. From there the tour led to the old Titus orchard and thence to Shubert where a num - ber of the young and old orchards were visited. It was planned to visit a number of the Kansas orchards on the following day but a drizzling rain set in about midnight which continued until noon the following day so that it was deemed advisable not to continue. The attendance at this tour was very good, ranging from 60 to 80. The Exhibit of the State Horticultural Society at the State Fair this year was outstanding. It consisted of a revolving fruit basket 7 feet in diameter, back of which was a bank of trade apples edged with pine boughs. The competitive displays were put up largely in trays this year for the first time making a more massive display than has ever been the case in previous years. The Nebraska State Exhibit at Kansas City Fruit Show— The Ne - braska display at the Kansas City fruit show December 8 to 10 was very similar to the one at the State Fair, the revolving basket being FIG. 13 — Nebraska's exhibit at the Kansas City Horticultural Congress in December, 1925. Eight other states were represented, Nebraska being awarded second and Kansas first </seg>
            <seg id="p525">• Nebraska State Horticultural Society 525 transported there and arranged in a similar way. There were 7 states represented at this show, including Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, Idaho and Minnesota.. Nebraska was fortunate in securing second place, Kansas being awarded first place. The advertising secured by this display was well worth the effort on the part of the Society. Movie reels showing the various exhibits were made by one of the prominent film com - panies, no doubt to be distributed as news of the day features. SOME PUMPKINS Fig. 14 — The harvest was plentiful in Otoe county as the picture of the Otoe Canning Co. shows. (By courtesy of Dr. Condra, Uni. of Nebr.) In addition to the above activities the Secretary cooperated with Mr. Kuska of the Burlington in arranging for an inspection tour from southeastern Nebraska. On this trip were a number of the high of - ficials of the Burlington railroad, Mr. Will Owen Jones of the Journal and Will Maupin of the Omaha Bee. Those of you who read either of these papers will no doubt have noticed news items referring to this trip in the Sunday editions during early November. Another phase that was taken up at this time was the completion of Dr. Condra's apple file. Dr. Condra has had an apple reel for sometime but there were a number of features that had not been treated in the previous film which were deemed advisable to include. This afternoon at 4 o'clock this film will be shown. </seg>
            <seg id="p526">526 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Fig. 15 — Pumpkins and corn proved a wonderful crop along the C, B. &amp; Q. right-of-way between Nebraska City and Peru. (By courtesy of Dr. Condra, Uni. of Nebr. ) THE PRESIDENT: The Secretary is the Work Horse of the bunch. He gets all the work and all the grief. He is a willing worker and the rest of us are willing to let him. MR. PORTER: Mr. Sitlington, of Kansas City, was favorably im - pressed with Nebraska's exhibit at Kansas City. I should hike to hear a few words from him about that exhibit. F. G. SITLINGTON (Kansas City, Mo.): I was saying for the benefit of some of those interested in horticulture who did not enjoy the privilege of seeing that Show, some such mention as Mr. Hoppert made of the Nebraska Show should be brought to your attention. While many from neighboring states coming to the Show never imagined Ne - braska was an apple-growing state, after that Show and that big, artistic exhibit Nebraska put &lt;ki, they went away with a different thought in mind. </seg>
            <seg id="p527">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 527 While Nebraska only took second place in that exhibit, I think it was because of the size of the Kansas display more than the quality. I have heard a great many people express themselves in favor of the careful work and artistic display Nebraska had, and you certainly got some wonderful publicity out of it. A lot of people went from the convention hall with the thought in mind there were other states besides Missouri that raised good apples. I am in hopes Nebraska carries on some such plan of publicity a little farther, because you have an apple section in Nebraska to be proud of, and a crop of fruit that is in a class by itself. JACOB SASS, (Benson) : Along the line of what Nebraska would do in comparison with other states, I happen to be a member of the Minnesota Horticultural Society for over ten years, and I am also a member of the Massachusetts Society. Each society gets out a pamphlet in fruits and vegetables, etc., which is very instructive. From Massa - chusetts it is a semi-monthly. It has included the care of flowers and shrubs. If we could in this state have a little pamphlet every month and a little publicity that way, I think it would help to a great extent. What I have been working on as a hobby has grown into a commercial business. We are known through these organizations we have gone into. Once in a while they print something about us in their pamphlets. We have never otherwise spent one cent for advertising. I know those things go over through advertising. If it will advertise a person, it will surely advertise a state. Probably in that way we can do a good work. I suggest this as I see it. THE PRESIDENT: You understand our Secretary does not draw a salary. He does the work gratis. They do not think we should have a paid Secretary at all times who would put out circulars or informa - tion. What work devolves on him he does free. If we had sufficient funds to take care of this, I am sure he would be perfectly willing to help out in any way he could. We would be glad to have any who want to join this Society do so, if they feel they are getting any benefit from it. MR. COE: I should like to ask the growers in regard to the relative value of various slopes for apple growing. On our demon - stration orchard at Union, we planted two rows of trees upon the east slop. These trees made a rather poor to fair growth. It would not average more than two to six inches. On the west slope, in what appeared to be rather stiff clay which yielded poor corn the year before, the trees averaged six to twelve inches. As you go to the bottom, the trees always made a good growth. I have been trying to dope out what it is about conditions on the east slope which causes the trees to do so poorly ? </seg>
            <seg id="p528">528 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture J. F. SHUBERT: I was wondering if that slope had as much to do with it as the soil? MR. COE: The difference in soil may be due to some extent to the slope. MR. SHUBERT: I can not say we have noticed any difference in different slopes. Most of our orchards are on fairly good ground. On some slopes the trees are not making a good growth, but we have attributed the difference to difference in fertility. THE PRESIDENT: I am inclined to think that there is variation in the soil. MR. SHUBERT: Unless you had an extreme slope, I do not see where it would make a great deal of difference in the growth of the trees. MR. ART. SHUBERT: By a little treatment, the trees on the slope have shown as good a growth as the ones on the lower ground. A little nitrogen seems to be necessary to put it in good condition. We have found clover has not shown up so soon as with nitrate of soda. MR. CHRISTY: I think a northeast orchard will produce the most apples. •* MR. COE: That is where these trees grow the slowest, THE PRESIDENT: I think from knowing the lay of that ground, that it is the leaching of the soil; that it has lost considerable and has not the proper nourishment to feed the trees. On the east slope in my orchard, mostly covered with Wine Saps, I think the growth is as strong as any place else and the soil about equal. On the south point the soil is poorer and the trees have not had the growth. I lay it to the soil. In yours, that is where I would lay it. It has lost some of its good qualities. Adjournment was then declared until 9:30 a.m., Thursday, Janu - ary 7. FOURTH SESSION Thursday Morning, January 7, 1926 The fourth session of the convention met on Thursday morning, and was called to order by President Banning at 9:50 o'clock. THE PRESIDENT: First on the program is a discusion of In - sects and Disease Problems. This was supposed to have been led by Grove Porter. He is not present this morning, so we will discuss this thing ourselves. I will ask Professor Hoppert to start the ball rolling. </seg>
            <seg id="p529">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 529 INSECTS AND DISEASE PROBLEMS A Discussion SECRETARY HOPPERT: I want to see some of the growers start this discussion, because our orchards in Richardson County do not seem to give much trouble yet. I should like to hear the Shuberts talk about their problems. I know they have them. I think Guy Shubert, who is in active charge of the orchards there, ought to lead in this discussion. GUY SHUBERT, (Shubert): I do not know as I want to lead in the discussion, but I should like to hear from Mr. Coe, and Mr. Martin of Kansas, and Secretary Hoppert and Professor Wiggins and other men here. There are several questions we should like to ask. We have a lot of codling moth and apple scab and fungi of different kinds. We have had considerable trouble with curculio. We would like to know something of curculio control. We know something of the life cycle of the codling moth, but if they would briefly review the moth cycle, I think it would be interesting. I know it would be to me. I think all of us know something of the fight we have had with codling moth in the last few years. We have had to throw away our spraying calen - dars, and it looks as if we might have to spray every week or two. MR. COE: Why wouldn't it be a good idea to advance Mr. Martin's talk which deals largely with codling moth control, and then we can discuss the subject? THE PRESIDENT: We might switch this program around in order to get this question before us. We will now hear from Mr. Martin of the Kansas Agricultural College on " Codling Moth Troubles in Kansas.'" He can probably give us a good start. (Applause.) CODLING MOTH TROUBLES IN KANSAS W. R. MARTIN, Kansas Agricultural College Mr. President and Members of the Nebraska State Horticultural So - ciety: The Kansas State Horticultural Society and the Kansas Agricultural College, and also the orchard men of Kansas, send you their sincerest greetings and hope you will have a prosperous year in 1926. I am glad to have the opportunity to come up here and tell you some of our troubles in Kansas. We have plenty of them. I think the last season we have had more troubles than you do up here. I should like to talk about a few of these; what success we are having, and why we are not having total success. It will be a lesson to you, at least. </seg>
            <seg id="p530">530 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture CODLING MOTH IN KANSAS W. R. MARTIN, Jr., Specialist in Horticulture, Division of College Extension, Kansas State Agricultural College A study of any insect pest continued over a period of years reveals the fact that its most serious damage appears in cycles of from one to several years. This condition can be explained on the basis that when - ever any insect becomes very numerous its enemies also increase to point where the insect is at least partially controlled. In 1918 the author had the opportunity to study the codling moth in the Arkansas Valley, one of the important fruit sections of Kansas. For several years prior to that year this insect had been on the increase until in 1917 the fruit in that section of the state was quite seriously damaged in spite of consistent spraying on the part of the orchardists. With proper timing of the sprays and with a favorable winter in 1917 - 1918, the results in 1918 were much better. In 1919 the codling moth was practically under control and continued to cause little trouble for two or three years. The crops in 1919-1920 being quite free from codling moth injury. Beginning with 1922 and continuing until the present time, the codling moth have increased very rapidly until the crops of both 1923 and 1924, as well as 1925 were about 75% damaged. This does not mean that 75% of the fruit was " wormy " but that 75% of the fruit showed codling moth injury. This injury consisted chiefly of " stings " which were caused by the young codling moth larvae eating through the skin of the fruit before they were killed by the spray material. The presence of these " stings " renders the fruit very unsightly and greatly diminishes its market value. In 1924 the average number of stings per apple varied from two to six with some apples showing as many as twenty-four stings, yet they contained no live larvae. It has been estimated by investigators that only one larvae in four or five that are poisoned with arsenate of lead live long enough to cause a " sting ". If this is true it would indicate that the particular apple showing twenty-four stings had approximately one hundred larvae at - tempting to enter the fruit. This instance is cited as an indication of the great population of codling moth now present in the Valley. In 1925 the crop in this valley was almost a failure due to late frosts and unfavorable weather during the blooming season. The work was prac - tically dropped and little additional data was secured. It is hoped that the light crop will diminish the population of codling moth so that they can be controlled next year. It was the opinion of Kansas Orchardists as well as that of the specialists at the College that a satisfactory control of codling moth could be obtained by the proper timing of the sprays. However, recent results prove conclusively that other factors are as important or per - haps more important than this one alone. The important factors that may greatly affect a control are: </seg>
            <seg id="p531">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 531 1. Time of sprays 2. Materials used While the time of application of the sprays may not be all important, it is, nevertheless, one of the most important factors in the control of the codling. In most parts of the state it is the one consideration, bat when conditions exist as in the Arkansas Valley at present, other meth - ods of control are necessary. The following chart which indicates the emergence of the moths in 1924 and the time of application of the sprays will indicate the fact that spraying alone will not positively insure a successful control. Orchards in that section were sprayed from ten to twelve times. In fact they were sprayed almost continuously at approximately two week intervals from Petal Fall until September 1st, yet a very unsatisfactory control resulted. (See chart next page.) The moths began emerging the last of April and continued to increase until May 25. The week of May 25 was quite cool and emergence practically ceased. With the return of warm weather about the first of June, emergence continued until the remainder of the first brood was out. However, before May 16 the weather was not suitable for the deposition of eggs. Hence, there was no egg laying previous to that date and in all probability many moths perished without laying their eggs. a. Insecticides b. Spreaders 3. Population of moths a. Winter mortality b.

            <seg id="p533">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 533 Codling Moth in Kansas (Continued) The spray that was to have met the peak of the egg hatching period was applied the week of May 18. However, this spray did not prove very successful due to the fact that its efficiency was lost during the following week of cold weather. Because the orchardists had already applied two sprays for the first brood of worms, it was difficult to convince them that another spray was necessary the first week of June. During the three week period beginning June 15, there was an almost complete cessation of emergence. This period represents the time intervening between the first and second broods. The fact that the second brood did not start to emerge until the first week in July and did not reach its height until July 27, also indicates that practically all of the second brood was the progeny of the last part of the first brood. From July 13 until the second week in September the emergence was continuous, the second and the partial third broods overlapping entirely. During this period spraying was continuous at practically two week intervals. The second important factor in the control of the codling moth is the materials used in spraying. Of course, arsenate of lead is the most important as well as the standard material used and as yet no better material has been found. During the last two or three years a number of our leading Kansas orchardists were dissatisfied with the insect control we were getting with Arsenate of lead. Some of them tried using Paris Green in combination with the Lead, thinking it would increase the killing qualities of the spray. In order to get a check on the relative merits of the various insecticides that could be used the following test was made in Doniphan County last summer: Variety — BEN DAVIS 1925 Cooperator — F. O. KINCAID Total Apples Clean Codling Moth Slight Curculio Bad Tot"»l In- Curculio sect Injury [lack Insecticide I. Arsenate of Lead (l%-50) II. Arsenate of Lead (4-200) Paris Green (1-200) III.

            <seg id="p534">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 534 We included two insecticides, Kalenex and Electrified Calcium Ar - senate which were new insecticides and which will probably appear on the market this year. The results obtained indicate the Arsenate of Lead and Arsenate of Lead plus Paris Green were of equal value in the control of Codling Moth and Apple Curculio. Kalenex, a new product being introduced by the General Chemical Co., also gave equal control but as this material is as yet practically unknown, I would hesitate to recommend it until it has been tested more thoroughly. The Calcium Arsenate and the Electrified Calcium Arsenate both gave un - satisfactory results. Another class of materials is on the market which are sometimes recommended to aid in insect control. These materials are usually termed as " spreaders " and are supposed to cause the spray to spread over the fruit and leaves so as to form a continuous covering. These materials are usually classified into two groups, i.e. those containing calcium caseinate a material derived from milk) and those containing an emulsified oil. In 1924 a test was made in Cowley County to determine the ef - ficiency of these materials. A block of Missouri Pippins was chosen in order to test its efficiency in regard to apple blotch as well as to Codling Moth. The following table gives the results of this test: Test of the Efficiency of Commercial Spreaders in the Control of Codling Moth and Apple Blotch. Variety — Missouri Pippin. This test would indicate that the oil spreaders were slightly more efficient yet neither the oil or the casein shows enough improvement over the check to encourage its general use. According to the results obtained in 1924 the chief difficulty in con - trolling the codling moth in the Arkansas Valley seems to be the heavy population of moths. Dr. A. L. Quaintance of the Bureau of Ento - mology, claims it to be almost impossible to control the codling moth where the population is three hundred or more moths per tree. This condition now exists in that part of the state. One forty acre orchard was banded in the fall of 1924 with burlap bands. These bands caught an average of about three hundred moths per band with individual No. of Apples Counted Per Cent Free from Insects and Fungus Injury Per Cent Showing Blotch Per Cent Showing Live Worms Material Casein Spreader.

            <seg id="p535">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 535 bands containing as high as live hundred. The purpose of these bands was to provide a place for the larvae to accumulate so that they could be destroyed. In checking up the results of the bands this year, it is doubtful if the practice would be profitable as the results were not outstanding. The population of codling moth depends on four factors, i.e., (1) Winter mortality; (2) Packing sheds; (3) Natural enemies; and (4) Crop failures. The winter mortality due to weather conditions is extremely low in Southern Kansas because of the dry climate and an absence of ex - tremely low temperatures. Packing sheds provide an exceptionally favorable place for the moths to survive the winter since they are almost entirely protected from their natural enemies. The larvae are carried to the packing sheds with the fruit during harvest time. Leaving the fruit they spin their cocoons in the cracks and crevices of the shed and boxes where they remain until the following spring. The time of the emergence of these moths varies considerably from the emergence of those moths in the orchards; hence, this condition complicates the spraying even more. Without a single exception the part of the orchards showing the greatest infestation in 1924 was that part adjacent to the packing sheds. Natural enemies are usually adequate to reduce the over-wintering broods sufficiently during the winter that spraying is effective. During the last three seasons, however, the natural enemies were not adequate in Southern Kansas. The most important of these natural enemies is the downy wood pecker, a migratory bird which will spend its winter with us if the food supply is sufficient. These birds have a keen appe tite for codling moth larvae, which connected with an uncanny ability to locate the insect, makes the bird very valuable. Another factor that is of great importance in controlling the popu - lation of the codling moth, is crop failures. Partial crop failures are not very important but periodic total failures are quite an asset in this respect. The Arkansas Valley section has not had a complete apple failure since 1907 so that the insect has not been checked by this means for eighteen years. This fact combined with a series of heavy crops has permitted the moths to increase very rapidly. The fourth factor that affects codling moth control is the set of fruit on the tree. It is well known among orchardists that a half crop of apples is harder to keep clean than a full crop because the insects concentrate their attack on a smaller number of fruits. However, spraying a thin set of fruit is more effective because the material covers the fruit more thoroughly. The set of fruit may be light naturally as is the case in some seasons or it may be reduced artificially either by thinning by hand </seg>
            <seg id="p536">536 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture or by winter pruning 1 or both. The following table shows the effect of light and heavy crops of apples on different trees in the same orchard in regard to codling moth control. All of those trees were sprayed exactly the same. Effect of Light and Heavy Crops on Codling Moth Control Variety — Black Twig 1924 ,^^ Per Cent Free Per Cent Live Codling Average No. Cnv No. frees from Cod]lng .. staDg •• by Moth per 100 stings per Counted Moth Codling Moth Apples Apple From this table the fact that the moths concentrate on the fruit when the set is light can be proven by the average number of stings per apple. The most apples on the tree resulting in the fewest stings per apple and vice versa. Yet when we consider the number of live codling moth per hundred apples we find that the heavy crops lead. This condition is due to the fact that while there are fewer codling moth attacking each apple on the trees with a heavy set of fruit, the spraying is not as thorough and more larvae escape. On the trees with a light set, the spray material can be applied more efficiently and fewer larvae survive although more larvae attack each apple. The fifth and last factor that may affect the control of the codling moth is injuries to the fruit itself. Many orchardists have noticed that it is almost impossible to control codling moth in an orchard that haa been seriously damaged by hail. The worms seek these hail marks as means of entering the fruit and spraying seems to be very inefficient at that time. Daring the last two seasons the same condition existed to some extent in Doniphan County, not because of hail injury but due to a late attack of the apple curculio. The last brood of codling moth found an exceptionally favorable place to enter the apples through the feeding punctures made by the curculio. DISCUSSION i Q. In northeastern Kansas, what spray schedule do you use? A. About eight. Instead of doubling up on breeds in northeastern Kansas, they came over such a long period it would take two sprays Heavy Medium Light 7 3 2 15.4 10.6 84.6 89.4 91.5 7.5 5.0 6.5 2.54 3.26 8.5 4.26 </seg>
            <seg id="p537">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 537 to cover one brood. That makes it about eight double sprays — four codling moth sprays. We have a dusted bud spray. The dormant spray is not universally used. The petal fall, a spray in two weeks which would be a blotch spray. Then in four weeks the first brood of codling moth. Then a spray for the second group of codling moth; and another the latter part of August for blotch and the third of codling moth. Q. Is there any use in spraying before the blossoms open? A. Not for codling moth, but for other things such as scab and curculio and canker worms. Q. What do you recommend for your petal fall spray — how much lead to one hundred gallons? A. Most growers use one pound to fifty gallons. Many growers use one and one-half pounds to fifty gallons. Q. I notice an article in the "Packer" which recommends four pounds to one hundred gallons of water. We have always used one or one and one-half pounds for that quantity. A. As far as codling moth control is concerned in Kansas, I do not believe the petal fall spray is of much importance any more. We are getting very few codling moth of the first brood, in the calyx end. They are mostly side worms — 99 per cent of them. They are not particular where they enter the apple. Q. Do you think there is any advantage in increasing the lead in the second spray? A. What little work we have done, has not shown better results from increasing the amount of lead so far. We have not worked on that very much. Q. We find a number of cases where a codling moth has started into an apple, and evidently the poison did not get it quickly enough. It has damaged the apple. What can we do about that sort of trouble? A. That's our trouble. Q. Do you suppose some contact spray would do any good? A. Some experimenters are getting results from using an oil spray as an ovacide after the eggs are laid. The eggs hatch in four days and come out over a period of eight weeks. It would keep a fellow busy. Probably where they have two broods and all come out at one time, they would have a chance of using some such spray. Q. Do you think increasing the lead would help? A. I do not think you would get a quicker killing. I think it stays on better if it is not too heavy. Q. I want to ask your idea about having bulletins issued by the State Agricultural Department warning the growers when these different </seg>
            <seg id="p538">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 538 broods are coming out. You say it differs according 1 to temperature. It is hard to tell when these broods are coming. Maybe the Department could tell us. I think we did at one time have some bulletins on that. The last year we have not had any. I talked it over with Professor Hoppert. I think it would be a good thing. Do you do that in Kansas, and do you think it would be a good thing here? A. We have been sending out circular letters on each spray for eight or ten years in Kansas. We have a mailing list of 3500 to whom we send a letter for each spray. We have divided the state into sections and mail these letters accordingly. In this way we can get them pretty close. Otherwise, if we mail to the entire list, some in the southern part will get it too late, and it will reach them too early in the northern part. We also announce on the radio. We had the letters before we had the radio, and the people seem to like them better. Q. How do you determine the time for the different sections ? A. That is my job. I do my work during the sting season with commercial men. I arrange my schedule to cover the entire state every two weeks and keep in close touch with them and come within a few days of it. I may keep curculio cages at some places and have a number of growers at each place keeping temperature records which I can look over when I go there. It is from those observations we post our letters. Q. Can you combine any of those insect sprays with the fungus ? A. Yes. We have another condition you probably do not have in blotch control. The blotch and codling moth sprays combine well. We can combine all but the first sprays, which is too early for the codling moth. It is especially for blotch. After that we combine them. Q. Do you think we waste our lead when we put it in the blotch spray ? A. No. You have other insects besides codling moth, and some of it stays on. I should not think of omitting it. Most of the expense of spraying comes in the labor of putting it on. Take out the few pounds of lead and you would not save very much. Q. Do any of the growers use a method of banding? A. We had that on one eighty-acre block in the Arkansas valley. The owner started in the fall of 1924 and continued through this past season. It is hard to get a check on anything like that, in the same orchard, because the moth flies. You have to compare with other orchards, and are not sure of the comparison because the initial infesta - tion may vary. I did not see that he got a great advantage from it. He was running fifty to one hundred codling moth in each band. He was getting rid of lots of codling moths, but many were still on his apples. * </seg>
            <seg id="p539">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 539 Q. He scraped his trees? A. Yes; last fall, and banded this spring. Some of them were banded last fall. I do not think they were run so constantly during the summer. Q. How often did he go over the bands ? A. Every ten days to two weeks. Q. Do you think it a good idea to scrape the old trees ? A. You kill lots of codling moth, but I do not think you can kill enough to pay you. When this man was scraping his trees last fall, he started in November. He had a flock of 150 meadow larks picking up the codling moth after he scraped them off. He was planning to burn them, but he did not worry about that any more. The meadow larks stayed with him for a three weeks' period. Q. Is there a parasite taking the codling moth? A. A number of them. Q. There is a subject that came up a while ago. In that section of Kansas where you are bothered with curculio, wouldn't you advise starting the poison spray with the cluster bud? A. On the apple curculio I do not think the spring spraying has been effective. We get our control from the middle of July to the first of August. Q. What measures are you using for curculio? A. We think your spring sprays will prove the secret of controlling them, before they lay their eggs. There is one apple orchard with twelve pear trees planted in it. Last spring the apple curculio centered on those pears because they were farther advanced than the apples. The man gave them a real dose of almost everything he had — Paris green, arsenate of lead, and nicotine. He sprayed the pear trees alone to kill the apple curculio. I did not think, looking them over three days later, he had killed a curculio. When this brood comes out in July, they are hungry and eat more, and I think we have had good success controlling them with sprays. I think curculio has but one brood per season. They hatch out in July or August, feed till winter, then hibernate, and lay the eggs next spring. There are two of us in the horticultural work. I do my work in the commercial sections of Kansas during the spraying season. We have three commercial sections. I cover the territory every two weeks. I make the observations and recommend spray dates. for the entire state, both commercial and home orchards. The growers cooperate by keep - ing temperature and emergence records. If they have an emergence cage, they will count the moths for you if you are not there. Q. Does the curculio winter in the ground ? A. In rubbish. </seg>
            <seg id="p540">Report of Nebraska State Board op Agriculture 540 Q. Isn't clean cultivation one of the best preventives? A. It would be a help. It is hard to practice it on some of those hillsides. The curculio starts feeding on the leaves before the fruit is formed. Q. I should like to ask the comparative value of liquid and dry lime and sulphur; and also what strength you recommend for blotch? A. I do not happen to have any figures with me on that. The liquid and dry lime sulphur have been running fairly close in so far as scab control is concerned the last 2 or 3 years. I think in an average of all the tests, we have probably had a little bit better results from the liquid than from the dry. With the Bordeau we use 3-4-50. Q. Have you tried out the dry form as compared with the powder? A. No; with the exception of one test in Wyandotte County, where the County Agent got fresh Bordeau for every spray, and got the same control with the dry as with the home-made. Where we ship it, there is about 10 per cent better control with home-made than with the com - mercial. Q. I heard some one from your Station advising the use of two and one-half pounds to one gallon of liquid. Was it you? A. No. I do not know who that was. Practically all my spray announcements have been announcing in terms of liquid lime sulphur. Q. A great many want to use the dry sulphur. A. It is being used more every year. I think it has been improved. There is a lot of difference between dry lime sulphur today and several years ago. Q. They used to say two pounds. MR. STILLINGTON: In some sprays we use three pounds to fifty, or two pounds dry as compared to one gallon liquid sulphur. Q. What about the use of London purple instead of lead arsenate? A. It is not used in Kansas to my knowledge. It may be used in Arkansas. Q. I suppose that was rather a humane idea to kill them quick, A. Yes, and the growers do not like those stings. THE PRESIDENT: I am sure we have enjoyed having Professor Martin with us and listening to his talk. It was very interesting. I think we have all gained valuable information from it. I believe we have covered Mr. Porter's subject pretty well. MR. PORTER: I think Mr. Martin covered everything I was worry - ing about as to codling moth trouble. </seg>
            <seg id="p541">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 541 THE PRESIDENT: We will be glad to hear from Professor Swenk this morning on what he may have to say on codling moth. PROFESSOE SWENK: I do not believe I can add anything of material benefit to the very excellent discussion Mr. Martin has given us here this morning. He has covered the various phases, it seems to me, with clearness and a considerable amount of detail. He comes to us as one speaking with authority who has given specific and par - ticular attention to these problems of insect control, especially the codling moth. The Department of Entomology at the College of Agri - culture here has not been able to give as detailed and specific study of the codling moth in Nebraska as has been given it in Kansas. In fact, in recent years we have not been able to apply a considerable amount of time to the codling moth, although realizing, as we do, its continually growing importance. I hope circumstances will adjust themselves to make it possible to make a very careful study of the life history of the codling moth, covering a period of years, and work out some plan whereby recom - mended dates of spraying varying with different seasons can be an - nounced in time to be made available that particular year. I think that is something we can look forward to as being well worth while. We have no fundamental information on the life history of the codling moth in this state. We know in a general way it has two main broods, and usually more or less of a partial third brood, and in a general way the conditions that bring about brood factors; but what we need is an amount of data covering a series of years, showing variations from season to season, and enabling us to work out a more effective system of spraying, if, as with our neighbors on the south and in other parts, this codling moth begins to fail to respond to the methods of control we have been using in the past. MB. PORTER: A few years ago Professor Cooper did quite a bit of extension work on this problem of how the codling moths started their life cycle; when the worms emerged; how many days it took to reach the peak, and that sort of thing, and they had a bulletin to that effect. The conditions have either changed or the codling moth has changed. This last season it seems as though we had a fresh brood practically all summer long. We sprayed according to what we thought was the proper time, and two days later we would find we needed to spray again. It seemed, as Mr. Martin said, there were moths emerging all the time. The growers who practically had control of the codling moth in former years had fruit that was badly affected this last year. It was suggested once the fruit growers organize to a certain extent and hire a man to keep us informed the same way Mr. Martin does in Kansas- or else try to get lined up so that we can have a man in this state doing the same work Mr. Martin does in Kansas. There are only four counties in Nebraska that are producing apples. We need the help now, because the codling moth is increasing </seg>
            <seg id="p542">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 542 every year. We do not have very much 20° below zero weather here. I think the Horticultural Society and the growers should look into that matter and see if we can not start next spring and get co-operation. I know the Department of Entomology and Horticulture will do any - thing within their power we ask them to do. The trouble has been we have never asked for anything. There are a lot of things it is possible to get if you ask for them. We should get together — and now would be a good time, because there are more together now than you will get at any other time of the year — to find out what we want, and let Professor Wiggins and Professor Swenk know, and see if it can not be worked out. Individuals will ask for help and get it. County agents will come down. We want to get together and see the four counties, especially, get extra service this coming year. I should like to hear what Frank Shubert thinks about that. FRANK SHUBERT: I want to ask, What is it we need to do? I notice Professor 'Swenk in his talk said he hoped the circumstances would adjust themselves so that they could give us this service. I have talked with Professor Hoppert and he talks that way. They have not told me yet just what they needed. I am afraid they need an appropriation or another man or something of that sort. If that is true, let's get it. It seems to me the horticultural industry in this state, and especially the apple industry in southeastern Nebraska, is of sufficient importance that we ought to have this. If it is necessary for us to go to the legislature next winter, if we can not get it before, let us do it and demand our rights. If this is what you need- — more money or more help — to get this information, we should get behind a movement of that kind. It is one of the most important things they could do for us just now. We have a new brood of codling moth every night in our county. We have sprayed. The first thing we know, we find a lot of little side stings. I do not know why they can not fix up an incubator and be able to tell us when to apply these sprays. We get our principal damage from scab and the codling moth. We can handle the scab first rate if the weather is right. We have our worst trouble with the codling moth. I should like to see this Association get together on something and have these boys tell us what they need, and let's get it. MR. AZENDORF: I believe Mr. Shubert hit the nail on the head. While they have been able to tell where the trouble lay, it has been impossible with their arrangements to do what they would like. We all know whenever a University man will go to the legislature and propose a thing of that kind, he gets sat down on. MR. CHRISTY: That is one of the things I have been wishing we had for a number of years — to have some definite time set and have our fellows investigate that. The average grower is not prepared to look these things up. </seg>
            <seg id="p543">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 543 I move you the directors of the Horticultural Society investigate this so we can have a committee of some kind to look out for our codling moth and give us the dates when our sprays should be made. THE PRESIDENT: Please hold this in abeyance until we hear from Mr. Goss on "What Other States Are Doing." We will hear from him at this time. SPRAY SERVICE RENDERED BY OTHER STATES PROFESSOR R. W. GOSS, Lincoln, Nebraska Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: The subject, "Spray Service Rendered by Other States," is not one of my own choosing. Evidently it is a pertinent subject. The points brought up a number of times regarding this extra service in the way of spray information are not in the way of criticism, but simply a consideration of the fact there are certain points regarding spraying not covered by the present system of handling the thing in the Station here. One point we are not able to handle is the factor of timeliness. As far as this factor in our codling moth trouble is concerned, the de - partments usually know when to start spraying by starting as soon as they finish. (Laughter.) Maybe it is beginning to be that way in Nebraska. Mr. Martin covered the insect end of it. I am not an entomologist. I should like to take up a few points concerning the disease end of it. We must consider the same general program in handling special spray service of this type. That factor of timeliness depends on a number of things. It is just as important as using the proper spray material or spraying thoroughly. If you do not spray at the right time, you might as well keep it out of the orchard. The same thing holds true with insects. The proper time to spray depends upon the development of the parasite — whether spores are being disseminated through the orchard — and on the development of the host. Both of these things depend upon weather conditions; and again, different weather conditions are necessary to obtain infection. In case of apple scab, rainy weather will be found favorable for dissemination of spores. You can have it followed by high winds and you would not necessarily get infection; so that you have weather con - ditions after the spores are disseminated as well as during the dis - semination. It is a combination of those three things that determines the timeliness of the spray. Several other states have attempted to solve that problem. Possibly before we take up the method used, it might be well to discuss one or two of the diseases. Nebraska is really rather fortunate in regard to fungus diseases of apples, inasmuch as we are not troubled </seg>
            <seg id="p544">544 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture by some of the most severe ones. A few of our most serious diseases are not controlled by sprays. The worst disease is blister canker, and because it attacks the main trunk and large branches, it is not amenable to spraying. The same is true of apple rust which is common in the state, and causes damage particularly in the home orchard. It is im - possible to control it by spraying. If you wanted to spray continuously, you probably could control it. Blotch develops from twig cankers, most of it during a seven weeks' period after petal fall. It is controlled by the first spray for blotch two weeks after the petal fall, and two more sprays at intervals of two weeks after that. Blotch is not controlled satisfactorily with lime sulphur. It is controlled better with a Bordeau spray, and this material is substituted for lime sulphur. The weaker Bordeau is as capable of control as the stronger Bordeau. Scab is probably the best example of disease in Nebraska where we must consider the time element. Let us take up the life history of scab to point out the connection between its life cycle and the method and time of control. Scab is caused by a fungus organism which over - winters within the leaves. It continues growth during the winter, and in early spring a special spore-bearing structure is formed. (Illustrates this on blackboard.) The spores are disseminated in the spring. During periods of very wet weather this structure swells up and the spores are discharged for a short distance and disseminated through the orchard. Some one with a mathematical turn of mind figures that eight billion spores may be produced under a single apple tree. You can have 500 of those bodies on a square inch of leaf surface. In order to have those spores disseminated, you must have the spores mature and have this rainy period and the spores all liberated at one time. They may be liberated well, but if the host is not in condition for infection, it will not get it. Infection is also dependent upon weather conditions. (Illustrates on board.) It produces a sec - ondary crop of spores. These are the cause of the secondary infection occurring during the summer. Naturally the time to control scab would be between the time the spores were being liberated and when infection first occurs on the leaf. If you put a spray on after the spores reach the leaf surface, you might as well not spray. The principle of these fungicidal sprays is the pro - tective covering which covers the leaf surface and prevents infection. It must be put on previous to the times the spores are disseminated. It would be a simple matter to determine the time for spraying if all were liberated at the same time. As a matter of fact, those fruiting bodies mature over a period of a month or so during the early spring. On any rainy day during that time some of them will be liberated. In counts in Wisconsin in May, during forty-five minutes they got 300 spores per cubic foot of air in the orchard. If you have a susceptible host, you will get a larger amount of infection. It is neces- </seg>
            <seg id="p545">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 545 sary to have moisture on the leaf surface for these spores to penetrate the plant. So much for the life cycle of this disease. You must determine the maturity of the fruiting bodies; whether your host was in the proper stage for infection to occur, and what the weather will be for the next three or four days. That is really the hardest part. That is something we can not determine at Lincoln. In order to meet that problem, several other states have devised detailed spray service to get information to the grower as to the exact time of spraying. The same would apply to codling moths and the same meth - ods would be used in determining the time of spraying. I might cite the methods used in a large number of states, but I will take two extreme cases: New York, where a detailed service is used; and West Virginia, where there is a service which is not as detailed but which is working efficiently. In New York, this service started during the war. It is rather expensive. Since then it has proven efficient enough so that the number of counties employing the service is double what it was six or seven years ago. The main point is to have special field assistants who are located in the various fruit-growing counties. They are to go into the field for six months during the growing season. This takes in not only fruit, but other crops as well. They spend the other six months at the College working upon the problems brought out in the field. They are mostly graduate students in plant pathology, entomology, and horti - culture. The work is done in New York co-operatively with the Exten - sion Service and Departments of Pathology and Entomology. The men are graduate students who have had special training along these lines. Previous to the time they go into the field, they spend a week at the Station and a special school of instruction is given. They take up in detail the problems to be confronted in the field during the summer, the diseases to be controlled, and the fungicides and insecticides to be used. The general program is considered and intensive instruction is given. When he goes into the field, he makes contact through the county agent and the Farm Bureau with the commercial growers and becomes acquainted with the varieties and the susceptibility of the varieties. He sets up a field laboratory in which he studies emergence dates of insects, and also spore dissemination of fungus diseases. He can determine with scab when the spores are matured by taking leaves from under the trees and bringing them into the laboratory at intervals and putting them under ideal conditions for emergence, and determining under the microscope whether the spores are mature. It is not like studying the insects. For that reason they have field laboratories. I have taken this up with two or three eastern men: "What is one of the most important duties of the field assistant?" "To decide upon the most suitable time for making the application." It is necesary to have information as accurate as possible from </seg>
            <seg id="p546">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 546 day to day in regard to the buds and fruit trees. He must have in - formation regarding the development of the parasites, going through field studies by caging and bringing the diseased material into the labo - ratory. He must have some indication of probable weather conditions during the next few days. He obtains his information in regard to the trees and parasites from his own observation, and is supposed to know the best means of controlling them. The information in regard to the weather is supplied by the College Weather Bureau. A special Weather Forecaster is appointed during May and June. He prepares a special forecast which he wires every night to these field assistants. Basing his judgment upon the information received from all these sources, he decides the most opportune time for making the application. Determining the time for the delayed dormant spray is not dif - ficult; but in determining the time for the pre-blossoming spray they must be more exacting. After making the decision, it must be communicated to the growers. This is done in New York through a system of telephone relays to the individual grower. That is the detailed system which is carried on in co-operation between the growers and the College of Agriculture. The College pro - vides the man; pays him $50 a month salary; provides laboratory facil - ities; pays part of his traveling expenses, and entirely supervises his work. The growers, through the Farm Bureau, pay his traveling expenses in the county by supplying him with an automobile and paying the expense of its maintenance within the county. They pay his expenses to and from the Station a certain number of times each year; provide him with office space and space for news items in the papers; mailing; telegram service, and a salary of $100 per month. The total service under the New York system amounts to $1200 to $1509 a year for the six months' period, of which the College pays $300 actual money. That, in substance, is the system used in New York. The other example is West Virginia, where a different system is in use. They consider their acreage, running 400 acres to the individual grower, it is useless to attempt to tell the exact day they should spray. They figure it will take two days to a week to finish it, and it will be useless to tell the exact date to start. The entire proposition is handled by the Extension Pathologist and Entomologist combined. After he has been on a problem for a year or two, he is of more value to the growers. He becomes acquainted with the occurrence of disease, the amount of scab present this year, and determines how much there is apt to be next year. This one man locates during the growing season in a field station in the growing section. He sends out seasonal spray notices. (Shows copy of such notice.) Each notice is printed separately and sent directly through the mail to reach the grower within a period of two or three </seg>
            <seg id="p547">547 Nebraska State Horticultural Society days. They not only take up the time of application, but also the materials to be used and a few points regarding the disease or insects. During the early part of the season they give the grower, by means of illustrations and descriptions, the exact stage of spore development and such information as will enable him to determine correctly the time to make the application. As the season progresses, details of the various methods to be used are given. That method is different from the New York method inasmuch as it does not take it up in as much detail. That one man apparently gives efficient service in West Virginia. He makes the laboratory studies himself at the field' station and is acquainted with the variety of apples being grown and their susceptibility to the various troubles, and knows the condition of the orchard the previous year. One point I want to bring out is this: Regardless of what method would be advisable to use here in Nebraska, you must determine for each locality just what these insects and diseases are doing under those particular conditions. We can not take the results of Wisconsin's work or New York's and apply them directly to Nebraska conditions. We must do a certain amount of study on both diseases and insects in order to determine these points; or put a man out to get these points. You would not get as good service from such a man the first year as after he had made a study of the conditions under which infection takes place, and time of maturing spores in the case of fungus diseases. In Wisconsin they had a set program in the spring. In working with apple scab in the field sections they found they were getting apple scab earlier than they had figured. As a result of that purely experi - mental work, they found it necessary to apply a pre-bloom spray for the control of apple scab. It will be hard to determine what is needed until actual observations are made. I think personally while an exten - sion man can handle it all right, if he could put in his full time on it, it would be much better. I think it is necessary to have a man who knows both insects and diseases; and he must make a detailed exami - nation and investigation of the entire problem in order to give this advice efficiently to the growers so that it will be of more use than at the present time. MR. CHRISTY: (Repeats his motion.) (Seconded.) MR. PORTER: I should like to see the matter brought before the directors and have them invite in Frank and Art Shubert and any other commercial grower vitally interested in that subject. I think they might have suggestions to offer, and I should like to see them present. Mr. Christy's motion then carried. THE PRESIDENT: We will have a director's meeting immedi - ately after adjournment of this session. Yesterday we were to have a discusion on "Efficient Management," by Mr. Stivers. He was not present. I understand he is here this morning, and we would be glad to hear from him at this time. </seg>
            <seg id="p548">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 548 THE EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF COMMERCIAL ORCHARDS J. S. STIVERS, Auburn, Nebraska My topic is "Efficient Management of Commercial Orchards." I do not know why they picked on me for this topic, because I think it covers more ground than anything else. I suppose they did it because they thought I might get something out of that much ground. I might tell you how I manage my orchard. Let us take the ques - tion of pruning. In the first place, I think the hardest part of the entire deal is getting a man who can prune right. In picking men for pruning, I pick a fellow who is accurate, and in about two days you can tell whether or not he will be profitable to you. If he can not go around and see what should be cut and what should not, you had better put a man there who can do it. By the proper pruning, I find we cut' down the cost of spraying. When you have your trees opened up, you can get the spray material exactly where you want it. You can cover the outside and inside. In picking men for spraying, I put the fastest man on the tower. If you have a slow man there, it does not make any difference whether the ground man is fast or not. With efficient spraying, I find we are able to cut down the packing cost. By growing these apples so that you get a big per cent of No. l's, the packing cost is cut down consider - ably. In the fall of the year in packing, instead of getting green help to pack apples, I pick experienced help. You can use a certain amount of inexperienced help, but I find an inexperienced crew is much more expensive than an experienced crew. In handling my orchards, I usually figure in the fall after apple picking is over what my orchard will need in the line of pruning. I make a sketch of what I figure on doing all through the season. Of course sometimes you can not make a definite plan to follow, because when you get into the spraying season sometimes it may be necessary to put on two or three extra sprayers. In handling the orchard, I figure what the orchard needs and go ahead and do it. About the first of September I figure up what the cost has been then, because I find if you go to figuring the cost in taking care of these orchards and try to cut it down, you leave out this and that, and you are going to neglect your fruit crop; and that is more expensive than spending your money. I do not believe a man who tries to grow a crop of fruit for the least money, makes the most money out of it. If you are not willing to put your money into this — if you are afraid to spend a little money for fear you won't get returns — I do not believe you will make a success of the fruit business. You must give the orchards what they need in order for them to be profitable. I thank you. </seg>
            <seg id="p549">549 Nebraska State Horticultural Society THE PRESIDENT: This completes our program. We are grateful to the ones who took part in these meetings and came here and gave us the addresses. We want to try to improve next year because we may call some of you on the carpet on some subject on which you have been working. Experience is what helps us all. The experiences told us by the ones engaged in this business have been a help to us. I am sure we have had a very nice meeting throughout the three days, and the attendance has been very good. We hope you will avail yourselves of any help the Society can give you. Remember Mr. Hoppert is Secretary, and he is always ready to work. We hope you will all come back next year and bring some friends. The Society then adjourned. APPENDIX The following radio talks were given over KFAB during the winter of 1925-26. At the meeting of the Board of Directors of the State Horticultural Society it was decided to incorporate these talks in the annual report of the Society since it was felt that they would very likely be of interest to the members of the Society: STORING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES FOR WINTER USE C. C. WIGGANS The idea of storing the surplus of one season for use when that commodity is scarce or. unavailable is as old as history itself. Without such a possibility, starvation would face the human race yearly over a considerable portion of the earth's surface — would in fact limit the habitable areas to the torrid regions. With knowledge acquired through experience or by the use of reasoning powers, man is now able to so preserve or transport food stuffs that they are available at consuming centers practically every day during the entire year. This is especially true of fresh fruits and vegetables. The advantages of having fresh fruits and vegetables is obvious from the dietetical standpoint. Not only do they furnish the much desired vitamine content but by their very bulk greatly assist in the proper use of the more concentrated protein foods such as meats, etc. Too often the American family, especially on the farm, is forced by necessity or inclination to a very narrow diet of canned goods, meat, bread and potatoes during the winter. Such a condition is remedied, of course, during the summer when fresh foodstuffs are available. With a little care and foresight, sufficient variety can also be provided throughout the winter months. To be sure certain fresh vegetables are more readily available to the city cook than to the farmer's wife because of the distance from the farm to the market but there seems to be </seg>
            <seg id="p550">550 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture as little excuse for the farmer not storing the things that he produces as there is for a dairyman to use canned milk in his coffee. From the economical standpoint storage is also well worth con - sideration. Living costs can be materially lessened by having for winter use bins of such fruits and vegetables as can be stored — bins filled from your own garden or with products purchased at a low price. If the other fellow must store your foods for you then you must pay the bill — or do without. All fruits and vegetables cannot be stored under the same condi - tions — indeed certain ones such as the berries, cherries, etc., among the fruits — and lettuce, beans, etc., among the fresh vegetables, cannot really be stored at all although under ideal conditions they may hold up for a few days. The apple is really the only temperate zone fruit which is stored to any great extent. The pear is sometimes held for a few weeks but seldom are these fruits to be found later than Christmas. Both apples and pears require low temperatures and an atmosphere sufficiently humid to prevent shrivelling. Among the most common vegetables found in storage cellars are potatoes, cabbage, root crops such as beets, carrots, turnips, and par - snips, onions, sweet potatoes and squash and pumpkins. In certain cases as with the Irish potato, beets, carrots, etc., a cool humid con - dition is required. In other cases as with the onion a cool dry environ - ment is necessary or rotting takes place; while with sweet potatoes and pumpkins the temperature need not be so low but the air must be dry. Most people will want to store products belonging in each class. The storage place then, depends upon the vegetable or fruit to be stored and also to some extent upon what is available for use as storage chambers. Nearly every farm has either a cave or a cellar. The cave, if properly managed so far as ventilation is concerned, makes a splendid place to keep those things requiring cool humid conditions. Usually it cools off early in the fall but remains above freezing all winter. A dirt floor will maintain the humidity better than a concrete one although of course, the latter can be sprinkled occasionally. A cellar generally will be somewhat drier than a cave and espe - cially so if it contains a furnace. This drier place, however, is quite desirable for certain vegetables. If cooler, more humid conditions are wanted they can be secured by partitioning off a small fruit and vege - table room. This should be provided with a window. If one pane is removed and a flue properly arranged, cold air can be carried to the floor while the warm air goes out through another opening. A pan of water on the floor helps to maintain the humidity. The outdoor storage pit is available for everyone and serves ad - mirably for potatoes, apples, cabbage, and root crops. It is useless for sweet potatoes, onions and squash, however. A well drained place should be selected and the soil covered with a layer of straw. The produce to be stored should be placed in long narrow piles with slotted ventilators close enough to allow good air circulation. The making </seg>
            <seg id="p551">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 551 of it should be delayed as long as possible so as to avoid high tem - peratures. The fruits and vegetables are covered immediately with a thick layer of straw to protect them from the sun and rain. As cold weather comes on, more straw and a layer of soil is added and then later another layer of straw and soil. An opening through a barrel or box can be arranged through the covering. The covering must be thick enough to prevent freezing or certain of the vegetables at least will be ruined. The double layer of straw serves not only for insulation but also to help keep the contents from becoming too wet. A ditch around the whole pile will protect it from surface water. The proper preparation of fruits and vegetables for storage is of almost as much importance as the proper storage chamber. Poor fruit under good conditions is as worthless as good fruit under poor con - ditions. The material for storage, therefore, should be harvested and packed at the proper time and in the proper way. Maturity is probably of more importance in the case of fruits than with vegetables since in the latter case the frost date practically coincides with the harvest date. Apples and pears must be harvested before they are ripe if they are to be kept for any length of time. A tree-ripe apple must be used very soon while a tree-ripe pear is almost valueless because of the great development of grit cells toward the close of the ripening period. They should therefore be picked while they are still hard and before the green undercolor has changed to a creamy one. Only the sound, unblemished fruits should be stored. Bruises, cuts, etc., soon cause rots. Wrappers of tissue paper or even newspaper are very effective in prolonging the storage season. Oiled wrappers can be used to prevent storage scald on certain tender skinned varieties. At best pears will keep only a few weeks but by choosing proper varieties, fresh apples should be available throughout almost the entire year. If the fruit is allowed to cool off by remaining outside for a few nights after picking and before storage, it may be kept somewhat longer. Picked fruit must also be kept out of the direct rays of the sun and hence this cooling should take place under an open shed. Small pack - ages are preferable. With the vegetables, cuts and bruises should also be avoided and only the good sized sound specimens stored. Small cull specimens should be used first. In the case of certain vegetables it is advisable to cure them somewhat before placing in storage. This takes off surplus moisture and dries and toughens the skin of both Irish and sweet potatoes and also makes the removal of onion tops somewhat easier. Hence potatoes should not be picked up until they have dried somewhat, al - though left exposed too long, sunburn will result. Irish potatoes may be sacked and left a few days longer while the curing of the sweet potato can continue in a dry open place under a roof. Sweet potatoes should be wrapped in paper after curing and then stored in a dry place such as the furnace room or even an attic. In the latter case they </seg>
            <seg id="p552">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 552 must be removed before freezing weather. The onion may be pulled and left for several days before being picked up. The other type of vegetable such as the root crops, requires no curing, in fact are better if they are stored immediately after digging. Carrots, beets, etc., should be packed in sand or soil which is not too dry and then placed in a cool place. Too dry packing results in shriv - elling while too much moisture causes molding and rotting. Cabbage should be pulled up roots and all and stored just that way. It is more usually put in an outside pit. It is laid roots uppermost and arranged in long ricks, the ricks being several layers deep. Parsnips may be left outside all winter but it is very inconvenient to dig them when the soil is frozen. Handling the storage cellar after the fruits and vegetables are inside consists simply in regulating the temperature and humidity as well as possible. By opening the ventilators at night and closing them during warm days, the air is kept cooler. A pan of water near the intake will aid in keeping the humidity somewhat higher. Relatively small packages are preferable to extremely large ones and slotted con - tainers give better ventilation than tight ones. In commercial work, cold storage plants are maintained to keep fruits, etc., at a desired low temperature. These are available in only a few places but where they can be gotten, space may be rented at a reasonable cost for the season. Apples kept under such conditions, retain their full flavor and crispness. Just a word now about ornamentals. Canna rootstocks and dahlia roots will now soon be coming out of the ground. They can easily be kept until next year by storing where they do not freeze nor dry out. Dig them up with as large a mass of dirt as will cling to the roots. Place them on shelves in the storage room and leave until spring. Too much moisture causes growth but if they get too dry they should be sprinkled. Gladiolus corms should also be cared for very soon. They should be handled in a fashion very similar to onions. FALL PRUNING AND WINTER PROTECTION OF THE GRAPE E. H. HOPPERT Grape growing has increased in popularity by leaps and bounds in the past three or four years. The acreage devoted to the cultivation of grapes has more than doubled in Nebraska during that period. Much of this increase in grape acreage is to be found in the Missouri River section from Brownville to Blair, and rightly so, for this is a section where grapes do exceptionally well without winter protection or other precautionary measures. Just one example to back up this statement. Fifty-two years ago Governor Furnas planted a small vine - yard on his farm at Brownville. The vines are still bearing good crops </seg>
            <seg id="p553">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 553 annually. Mr. Dave Jones, who owns the place now, says there is very little difference in production between this part of the vineyard and the part that was planted six years ago. Fig. 16 — One of J. S. Furnas' vineyards at BrownviUe. The grape acreage in this territory has been more than doubled in the last five years. Must be profitable. (By courtesy of Dr. Condra, Uni of Nebr. ) There are other sections where grapes are grown commercially with success and where increased planting has taken place. Around Lincoln there are a few vineyards which have made money for their owners, but as one goes west beyond Gage, Lancaster and Saunders and north beyond Dodge and Washington counties, production becomes more uncertain. The danger from winter injury is so common that most people say it can't be done and quit trying to grow the standard varieties such as Concord, Worden and Moore's Early. They either do without or grow hardier varieties of poor quality such as Beta or Elvira or depend on an occasional crop of wild grapes along the creeks for grape 'juice or jelly. It need not be so. With proper protection and pruning the better varieties may be grown as far west at least as Keith county and as far north as Holt county, for I have seen some profitable vineyards in both these counties. Winter injury, as mentioned above, is the bugaboo to grape grow - ing. The grapevine produces its fruit on the new wood. The new canes that grow this year must be kept alive or there will be no grapes next. year. Low temperatures with drying winds are responsible for the killing of the fruit buds and even the wood. In the vicinity of Lincoln about all the protection needed is a south or southeast slope or a good windbreak on the north. But in the central, western and northern portion it is safer to take the vines off the trellis and cover with dirt: To make this job easy, the vines should be pruned first. The pruning should be done just after the leaves drop and before the ground freezes. </seg>
            <seg id="p554">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 554 In order that the pruning may be taken up in its logical order let us start with plants that were set out last spring. If a plant has made 3 or 4 shoots 18 to 24 inches long, cut off all but the largest one and cut this back to 3 or 4 buds. In case the shoots are 4 to 7 feet long more of the top may be left. In this case cut out all but the strongest canes and leave this 3 to 5 feet long depending on the vigor of the plant. A two year plant of medium vigor is treated like the extremely vigorous one year plant namely the strongest cane is left long enough to tie to the upper trellis wire and the others cut out entirely. The next year this single cane throws out shoots and becomes the trunk, the shoots becoming the fruiting canes for the following year. Four of these canes are left, two for the upper wire and two for the lower wire. These canes are shortened to from 6 to 8 buds, depending on the vigor of the plant. The greater the vigor the greater the number of buds that may be left. In addition to the 4 canes mentioned, two spurs are left, one in the vicinity of the upper trellis wire and the other near the lower one. A spur is a cane that is cut back to 2 or 3 buds. The purpose of these spurs is to supply fruiting canes for the following year close to the trunk. By the end of the third growing season all the vines should have come into full bearing. Now the pruning becomes fairly uniform. Each vine has but one trunk. If the trellis has 2 wires, 4 canes are left per vine, each having 10 to 12 buds. If a 3 wire trellis is used leave 6 canes with 7 to 8 buds each. In addition a spur should be left for each wire to supply fruiting wood for the following year. All other canes are removed entirely. In order that grape vines may be pruned intelligently, one must be acquainted with some of the habits of the plant. For example: the grape bears its fruit from the buds along the one year wood or canes that grew this year. Wood older than 1 year does not produce fruit. In other words, if all the new wood is removed the vine will produce no fruit. Canes differ in fruitfulness. Thick canes with 10-12 inches be - tween buds are poor producers. These are called bull canes. The very thin, weak looking canes are likewise poor producers and should not be left. The best fruiting buds are found on canes the thickness of a lead pencil, about l A inch in diameter and buds 4 to 6 inches apart. It is a good policy to choose such canes for next year's crop. Grape vines need to be pruned every year. If the mature vine is left tin - pruned even for one year, considerable damage is done. In this event every well-developed fruit bud on the canes will try to mature a bunch or two of grapes. The bunches will be small and poorly filled out. The new growth will be weak and a poor crop results the following year. Moreover, it is difficult to get the vine back into shape again. Weak plants are pruned more heavily than strong ones. By prun - ing a weak plant severely, most of the fruit buds are removed and the energy of the plant goes into the growing of leaves and shoots. On </seg>
            <seg id="p555">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 555 the other hand if a strong plant is pruned too severely it will produce very little fruit and a rank growth. Often, the canes are 20 to 30 ft. long. The happy medium is the thing to strive for, namely, a vine that produces 12 to 15 pounds of grapes and at the same time enough good fruiting wood for a good crop the following year. Ordinarily 40 to 50 buds are sufficient for these results. Where the top is laid down and covered, it is necessary to renew the trunk about every 5th or 6th year. The older the trunk the more easily it is broken in bending. To renew the top allow a sprout to grow from the crown at the ground. In the fall cut this off at the top wire. The next year it will produce side canes for fruiting the following year. The old trunk may then be removed without the loss of a crop. Protecting the Vines It has been found that the best protective material is dirt. Straw and other litter is not as suitable. After the vines are pruned and the prunings removed, a shallow furrow is dug or plowed close to the row, the dirt being thrown into the space between the rows. Then the vines are taken from the trellis and staked down into the furrow and the dirt thrown over them. A three inch covering is sufficient. It is not neces - sary to cover the entire trunk because the trunk is seldom injured. The important thing is to get the new canes covered. In the spring about the time the cherries are coming into bloom the vines are uncovered or merely pulled out of the dirt and then tied to the trellis. Covering the vines has still another advantage, namely, that budding out is retarded and danger from spring frosts avoided. This same method may be used in the case of raspberries and blackberries with success. Tender roses and other ornamentals may also be treated in this way. PROTECTING FRUIT TREES FROM RODENTS F. M. COE, Horticulture Department, U. of N. Winter is coming and with it snow, cold and lack of food for small animals. Under such conditions rodents turn to the bark of trees for their food, causing injury and loss of thousands of valuable fruit, shade and forest trees, each year. These losses may be almost entirely pre - vented by timely destruction of these pests and protection of the trees from their attacks. A rodent, according to Mr. Noah Webster, is an animal having two large sharp incisor teeth on each jaw; in short, an animal which gnaws. This includes rats, mice, squirrels, rabbits, marmots, gohpers, beavers, etc. Of these, field mice and rabbits are the animals that feed upon fruit trees in the winter time. The inner bark of the tree is its most vital, as well as least pro- </seg>
            <seg id="p556">556 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture tected, part. It is the food transportation system of the tree, corre - sponding with the arteries of the animal body in importance. Thru this connecting link, the plant foods manufactured in the leaves pass downward to nourish the roots. When a tree is girdled by peeling off the bark, the roots are starved and the tree dies, unless the connection is restored by prompt bridge-grafting. It is at this vital and vulnerable spot that Mr. Mouse and Br'er Rabbit gnaw with telling effect. In 1903 in Marion County, Kansas, mice girdled 5,000 apple trees in a single large orchard, causing a loss of $30,000. In Connecticut 2,000 out of 3,000 pear trees from one orchard were lost. While mice prefer the succulent bark of younger trees, older trees are not immune. In West Virginia 1,000 18-year-old trees in a large orchard were killed. Trees 50 years old have been girdled by mice. The very presence of field mice constitutes a menace which no owner of fruit trees can afford to overlook. While damage of fruit trees is sporadic in occurrence, rabbits like the poor, we have with us always, as potential tree eaters. Jack rabbits are especially troublesome and take a heavy toll of unprotected trees. Cottontail rabbits do less damage, except where they become numerous and the food supply short. There are many kinds of field mice, the meadow mice, or "Voles" as they are called in Europe, alone having 165 species. Our meadow mice are close relatives of the lemmings of Europe, of whom history relates how they gathered in vast hordes on the highlands of Norway and Sweden and marched to the coast, destroying all crops in their line of march, until their decimated ranks finally reached the shore and plunged into the sea after a two years journey. The Prairie Meadow Mouse is the principal representative of the short- tailed or meadow mouse group in Nebraska. This mouse has sur - face runways on top of the ground, while his cousin, the Pine mouse constructs underground burrows where he may gnaw on the roots and crown of our fruit trees unmolested, and until too late, unobserved. Fortunately the latter mouse is not numerous, although found along the Missouri River in eastern Nebraska. Other mice common in Nebraska are the Prairie Deer mouse and the Prairie Harvest mouse. The former is a large mouse about 3 or 4 inches long, without his tail and has white feet. The Harvest mouse is much smaller, about 2% inches and has a long tail. These field mice make nests of grass for themselves and their young which are warm and dry. They breed all year except in the coldest season of severe climates. Most species have four to six litters each year, and average 6 young at a birth. To illustrate their enormous reproductive power, a single pair could increase to 2,000,000 mice in five seasons if unchecked by enemies or unfavorable environment. Their summer food consists of green vegetation, seeds and grain, while in winter they eat grain, bulbous and root crops and bark of trees. Each adult mouse requires 24 to 36 lbs. of green vegetation </seg>
            <seg id="p557">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 557 per year. Damage to trees occurs usually but not always where other food is scarce and under cover of snow. The animals burrow along under the snow and gnaw the trees well protected from their enemies. Trees are especially liable to injury where grass, weeds, straw or other litter lies close to the trunk. Such material offers excellent protection and seems to represent a formal invitation to the mouse to partake freely of tender, juicy apple bark. Clean cultivated and well bred orchards suffer less than trees mulched with straw, or standing in a cover of sod, cover crop or weeds. Many growers take especial pains to rake the litter away from the base of the tree each fall as a pre - ventative method. Mulches and cover crops, however, have their place in the mainten - ance of soil fertility and protection of tree roots from winter's cold. It is good practice to cover the soil about young trees with a mulch of straw, strawy manure or cornstalks, in early winter, or provide a cover crop to prevent injury to the roots, especially in northern and western Nebraska. Quince roots of dwarf pear trees especially, should be covered. When using mulch, sod or cover crop, the mice must be extermi - nated. The most effective way to do this is by the use of " poison stations " baited with permanent bait, that is, bait which need be renewed but two or three times a year. Many types of receptacles have been successfully used. The main requirements are that they keep the bait from spilling, keep it dry and readily accessible to mice. Inch and a half drain tiles, specially made stations of glass, and even tin cans and fruit jars are used, but the latter two are not entered as freely as they should be unless food is scarce. The most satisfactory poison station yet devised is of wood, cheaply and simply made. pieces of 1x8 inch boards are used for the top and 1x6 inch pieces with a grove to hold the bait, for the bottom. Sides are 1*6 inches high by 6 inches long, and the whole is nailed together. Such stations set close to the trees and covered with brush or prunings for protection, are very attractive shelters for mice and by the same token, efficient in their destruction. Poison sta - tions properly placed and kept supplied with bait in good condition, give a maximum of protection at a minimum of labor and expense. Poisoned rolled oat bait prepared as follows is highly recom - mended by the United States Department of Agriculture: Mix dry V&amp; oz. powdered strychnine and % oz. baking soda; sift over 1 quart rolled oats, stirring constantly. Warm the oats in an oven and sprinkle with 6 tablespoonfuls of 3 parts melted beef fat and 1 part melted paraffin, mixing until well and evenly coated. When cool the bait is ready for use. If larger amounts are wanted use in the pro - portion of 1 oz. strychnine, 1 oz. soda, 8 qts. rolled oats and 1^4 pints beef fat-paraffin mixture. The fat must be hot and the poisoned oats thoroughly warm, so as to get an even coating. A tablespoonful of bait to a station is enough; in addition it may be scattered along </seg>
            <seg id="p558">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 558 runways and in burrow entrances. Where mice are abundant, a poison station should be put under each tree. Other means of preventing mouse injury are trapping and the use of mechanical protectors, washes, etc. Trapping may be used in small orchards where poison is objectionable, but is too slow and laborious for commercial orchards. Protectors and washes are of use against rabbits as well as mice; in fact protectors are the best method of preventing rabbit injury. Protectors are made of woven wire, hardware cloth, screen wire, wood veneer, tar-paper, newspaper and cornstalks, with the woven wire being most practical because of cheapness and permanence. Hardware cloth and screen wire have the advantage of keeping out mice because of the finer mesh, but cost from ten to fifteen cents each, as compared with four to five cents for the one inch mesh woven wire. Wood veneer protectors are cheap, costing only about 2c each, but they are less durable and require moving each spring. Cornstalks and paper materials are open to the same objection, while the latter are not completely effective. Protectors will not keep the pine mice since they work underground. Rabbit-tight fencing is effective in keeping these pests from small orchards. Wire protectors should be cut 18 inches high and 12 or 18 inches long, giving a protector about 4 inches or 6 inches in diameter. The larger protector is preferable since they may be left on longer without injury to the trees. A 150 foot roll of 18-inch netting will make 100 protectors. The stiff selvages are best fastened together with wire, giving a stiff and serviceable protector which holds its shape better than it would if made with the selvages at top and bottom. Rabbits, especially the long eared, fleet footed jacks, have been known to reach over the protectors following deep snows, and gnaw the bark from the branches. Where deep snows are a factor, repellant washes may be applied to the branches, or poison bait used. Coal-tar creosote preparations have been recommended, but are dangerous to bark of young trees, and may do more damage than the rabbits. Un - diluted lime-sulfur solution with a little glue added is used but its effect is short lived and it requires frequent renewal. A poison wash for trees successfully used in Idaho is made as follows: Dissolve 1 oz. strychnine sulphate in 3 quarts of boiling water. Dissolve % lb. of laundry starch in 1 pint of cold water, stirring thoroughly. Pour the starch into the vessel containing the strychnine and boil the mix - ture a short time until the starch is clear. Add 6 oz. of glycerine and stir. When the paste is cool enough, apply to tree trunks and lower branches with a paint brush. Do not use the wash if live stock, especially young calves, have access to the orchard. In many states rabbits are protected by law. In Nebraska, how - ever, these rodents are not so protected and may be destroyed whenever necessary to protect the crops and fruit trees. Since rabbits are hunted extensively and used for liuman food, growers had best rely upon wire </seg>
            <seg id="p559">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 559 protectors to prevent their attacks upon trees and use poison baits only where made necessary by deep snowfall or for the protection of other crops. For poisoning rabbits the following formula is recommended by the U. S. Department of Agriculture: 12 quarts good oats, 1 oz. powd - ered strychnine, 1 tablespoon laundry starch, 1 oz. baking soda, % oz. saccharine, 1 quart water. Mix the starch with % pint of cold water. Pour this into 1% pints of boiling water and boil until clear. Mix the strychnine and soda dry and sift it into the hot starch while stirring to a smooth paste. Add the saccharine and stir again. Pour this mixture over the oats in a tub and mix until all the grain is wet. Allow the oats to dry before distributing. Scatter the grain in small quantities. A little alfalfa hay is useful to attract rabbits to the poisoned grain. This bait is especially effective when snow covers the ground. Succulent baits, such as pieces of apple poisoned with strychnine and apple twigs or prunings dipped in the starch-strychnine solution described in the preceding paragraph, may be used. Extreme care in the use of such poison is necessary to prevent poisoning stock and beneficial birds and animals. Rabbit traps of tile or wood are especially useful for controlling cottontail rabbits, where such devices are not prohibited by law. Some arrangement which allows the animals free access to a shelter which may be closed by the operator and the rabbit removed is preferred. Traps which injure, or confine the animals for days at a time are in - humane. In nature the numbers of mice and rabbits are kept down by their being constantly preyed upon by natural enemies. Wolves, lynxes, foxes, badgers, raccoons, opossums, skunks, minks, weasels, shrews and snakes prey upon these rodents, mice being the principal food of some species. Among the birds hawks, owls, crows, shrikes, cranes, herons, and bitterns do their share. Owls are especially beneficial. Unfortunately man has wantonly allowed or encouraged the destruction of many of his feathered and furred friends. As a result the farmer now has the work of these vigilantes to do himself. It is well to remember, then, that prevention is far easier, cheaper and better than attempts at repair work with damaged trees. Badly girdled trees may be bridge grafted, slightly damaged trees mounded up to heal over; but these methods are costly, the healing takes time, and growth and bearing are delayed. Now is the time to protect trees by exterminating field mice and using wire guards to prevent rabbit injury.

            <seg id="p560">560 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture PLANNING FOR SUMMER AND FALL BLOOMS C. C. WIGGANS " Flowers add to the liveableness of the home," stated one speaker during Organized Agriculture last January at Lincoln. The Nebraska home then certainly can be made a very liveable place, at least so far as flowers are concerned. So many flowers can be so easily grown in this state that there seems to be slight excuse for not having them available during a considerable share of the summer and fall. Bou - quets for friends who appreciate them always bring their rewards while the place of flowers for the dining and living rooms can be filled with nothing else. If one is to have appropriate blossoms available whenever they are desired then some advance planning is necessary, in other words, brains as w,ell as elbow grease are required. Sometimes we may get the idea that flowers do as Topsy did — that is " just grow," but if we are to develop them to their full beauty, attention must be. given to species and variety selections as well as to planting and cultural care. February and March are, of course, the open season so far as seed and nursery catalogues are concerned. These silent salesmen are found in nearly every home and several pleasant as well as profitable evenings may be spent in looking them over and selecting out the kinds you want to use. At this point it may be well to throw in just a word of caution about catalogue descriptions and even more especially about catalogue enthusiasm. If one only remembers that such descriptions and recom - mendations are made for ideal conditions and then considers these according to the environment in which the flowers are to be planted, little difficulty will be experienced. Specific information as to which sorts may be expected to be satisfactory under your conditions may be secured by writing to the Agricultural College at Lincoln. The first thing to be decided is naturally what is to be grown. One week ago last night the subject centered around the general scheme of treatment of the entire lawn. To make this topic a little more spe - cific, the main emphasis tonight will be placed upon those species which will produce flowers suitable for cutting. It is not the intention to tell you just what you should grow or how much but rather to make a few suggestions which may be useful to you in your own flower garden. Generally speaking the ornamental species which gives flowers suitable for indoor decoration are either (1) annuals which are killed by frost and must be reseeded each year, (2) herbaceous perennials — with a hardy root system living over from year to year or (3) peren - nial shrubs in which case both root and top survive for years. Of these three groups the last is least important since only a few of our shrubs furnish blossoms for bouquets. Shrubbery generally must be considered as furnishing out-of-doors enjoyment. However, there are a few which can be used with profit for interior effects. Of these the most common is probably the lilac. Various forms hI this are available, the more </seg>
            <seg id="p561">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 561 usual being the common lilac with its large broad leaves and vigorous growth but with relatively small flower clusters. On the other hand, the Persian lilac gives large conspicuous clusters and not such large plants. Another species worth consideration is the Mock Orange with its large conspicuous white flowers with yellowish centers. The Deutzias furnish considerable variety both in type of flowers and times of bloom - ing and hence should be included. The Hydrangea is about the only shrub furnishing flowers suitable for cutting in the fall. Roses of course, furnish very desirable cut flowers. Shrubs from which cut flowers are taken will generally be simply a part of the general planting — being placed at appropriate points with respect to size and form, of plant. With roses, however, a rose bed or garden is generally advisable since during a portion of the year the bushes do not present a very attractive appearance. If your plant - ing does not include the species mentioned above you should by all means plan to plant some this spring. The second class to which reference was made was the herbaceous perennials. Several of these will be included in every flower lovers' garden. Endless variety of shape and color make the Iris and Peony very interesting and these species can be grown with little trouble. Phlox also furnishes beautiful flowers, but at the same time has some insect troubles. That old favorite, the Hollyhock, is nearly always found growing against the backyard fence or in some other out of the way place. Its blossoms are sometimes very effectively used for cer - tain purposes. It generally will grow from year to year without at - tention but like all other blooming plants will respond to good care. These perennials may appropriately be interplanted in the shrubbery borders or groups. Many of them establish themselves much better in the fall than if they are spring planted. And now we come to the most important group, the annuals, so far as furnishing cut flowers is concerned. These must be grown from seed each season. They are myriad in number and variety furnishing great variation in form, color, size and season of flowering and it is with this group that the average gardner will generally have the best success. They are often planted as a part of the vegetable garden since they require much the same sort of care. Good cultivation, moderate fer - tility and plenty of water are the main essentials for good flower production. Too rich a soil often means few flowers while too poor a soil does not provide for sufficient plant growth. Without atempting to name the sorts you shall plant, I want to mention a few sorts which are quite useful for cut flowers. The list could be greatly extended but the ones named will give a great variety and in the main are quite easily grown. Certainly you should grow some of them if not all. These are, Sweet Peas, Zinnias, Larkspur, Asters, Baby Breath, Calliopsis, Centaurea, Marigolds, Snap Dragons, Cosmos, Celosia or Cockscomb, and various everlasting flowers, to say nothing of the spring planted bulbs. Each of these sorts has its own </seg>
            <seg id="p562">562 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture peculiarities in regard to soil likes and dislikes, shade tolerance and insect and disease enemies. The group however, will furnish bloom ri early until late and, if the so-called Everlasting sorts are given proper care, on into the winter, too. Generally considerable varie - ties of color is found but pure colors are available if they are desired. Just a word now about what is required in order to have these plants in bloom. The first stop is, of course, to secure the seed. These should be ordered early while seed stocks are still full. By all means, insist on having good seed, for nothing is more disappointing than a poor stand in the flower bed. Generally, flower seed are quite small and so small packets are ample. If these are bought before they are needed, they should be protected against mice in storage. If real early blooms are desired the seeds may be sown early, the exact time depending upon the species, and the seedlings protected from frost. This early sowing may be in a greenhouse or hotbed, if these are available, or in a cold frame. Even a box in a sunny window will do. Fine rich soil mixed with plenty of sand is used for the seed bed and the flat or box is often covered with glass until seed germination takes place. Attention must be given to proper watering since too much moisture causes disease troubles. When the seedlings are large enough to handle they are then transplanted into either separate containers or flats giving each plant four to six square inches of space. They may be grown here until time for outdoor planting. For out-of-door plantings, one must wait until danger of frost is over. The seed bed must be exceptionally fine or poor germination is sure to result. Shading, watering, etc., may be necessary. When the plants reach transplanting size they are then moved to the original planting thinned out. Crowding results in long legged plants which are usually poor bloomers. Summer care, consists simply of keeping down the weeds, con - trolling plant lice, etc., and preventing diseases — and then of course, most interesting of all, cutting the flowers. PRUNING THE YOUNG FRUIT TREE E. H. HOPPERT Pruning is the one phase of fruit growing which is least understood and most often neglected, especially in the early years of a tree's exist - ence, yet it is one of the important orchard operations. The old saying "as the twig is bent so is the tree inclined," is just as true today as it was when first uttered many decades ago. Upon the kind of training the tree received when it is young will depend in a large measure the mechanical strength of its main branches, the age at which it comes into bearing and its productivity. Before the orchard owner goes out among his trees to prune them he ought to create in his mind's eye an image of the ideal tree. And </seg>
            <seg id="p563">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 563 while he is creating ideals he ought to adopt modern ideas for the ideal of today is entirely different from that of 30 years ago, in fact just as different as is the ideal brood sow of 1926 unlike the ideal of 1900. Today we prefer trees with main branches arising close to the ground instead of 10 or 12 feet up on the trunk. Moreover a tree with a leader up through the center is preferred to one which has its trunk dividing into 4 or 5 main branches. Experience has shown that the old style tree splits badly when loaded with fruit and a wind storm happens along. The central leader type of tree is much stronger me - chanically. Another difference is that instead of a tree with only 4 or 5 main branches we prefer one with 7 to 9 branches. These branches are distributed along the trunk from a point about 20 inches from the ground to a point about 6 feet from the ground. It has been found from experience that this type of training produces a low spreading tree, the branches grow uniformly and develop a better fruiting system than the type in common use years ago. Naturally such a tree cannot be trained in a year or two. It takes about 4 years to lay the proper foundation for it. But this is not asking too much from the orchard owner since this trouble will be rewarded many times during the life of the tree. In order to explain the various steps in their logical order let us begin with an apple tree that was set out last year. If the tree made fair growth it will likely have 5 or 6 branches arising from the trunk. Of these only 3 or 4 side branches need be left, one on the south or southwest side 18 or 20 inches from the ground, another 4 to 6 inches above this one on either the west or east side. It matters little on which side it happens to be but let's say it happens to be on the west; above this one we will leave a third branch on the east or north. To make a concrete example let's say it is on the east. Now if there is a branch on the north 4 or 5 inches above the one on the east we will leave that one. If it is impossible to get the one on the north the first year there is no harm done. Next year will be plenty of time. In addition to these 3 or 4 branches we will leave the central leader. All the other branches are removed close up to the trunk. The branches that are left will very likely be of different lengths. In order to get them to develop equally it will be necessary to clip off the ends. One of the important principles in pruning is that branches grow directly in proportion to their length. For example a branch 18 inches long will grow almost twice as fast as one 9 inches long, so we will cut them all back to about 18 to 20 inches. In cutting the various branches pay attention to the location of the buds. Usually the bud nearest the cut will grow into the longest shoot, so if we cut just above a bud on the outside of the branch the tendency will be to spread the growth of the tree and this is highly desirable. The central leader is left 2 or 3 inches longer than the side branches and is cut just above a bud on the south side to throw the new shoot to the south. The object of this is to counteract the tendency of the tree to lean to the north. </seg>
            <seg id="p564">564 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture The following year several branches will be produced from each lateral and also from the leader. On the leader 3 or 4 laterals are left beginning above the branches left the previous year and with 6 to 8 inches between each two succeeding branches. When this leader has reached a height of about 6 feet it is diverted to the side as a lateral branch preferably to the south. The laterals on the leader that were produced the past year are treated like the main branches were during the first year, namely balanced up and cut off just above an outside bud. The laterals from the older main branches are thinned out where too thick and balanced up; interfering and crossing branches are also removed. In this respect it is well to look ahead 5 or 6 years. Branches may cross but yet be separated by a space of 5 or 6 inches this year whereas in 6 or 7 years they will likely rub. After this the pruning consists largely of thinning out crossing and crowding branches. Heading back is seldom resorted to except where a branch is outgrowing its neighbors. Keep in mind that heavy pruning has a tendency to retard growth. If for example the north side of a tree is outgrowing the south side, prune heavily on that side and very little on the south. Prevent the development of crotches both on the body of the tree and on the lateral branches. Crotches are formed when two branches arise at a common point and develop with equal rapidity. There are two ways of overcoming the difficulty. Either remove one of the branches entirely or leave one of them unpruned and prune the other severely. Be careful to save the fruiting wood on the main branches. The spurs and short shoots along the main limbs should be left, for here is where the early fruit is produced. If they are removed, bearing is retarded. The shoots may grow too long and if they do cut them back to 4 or 5 inches. The critical period in the life of a young fruit tree is reached when it becomes 5 or 6 years old. This is the time when it should begin to change from a vigorous growing type to one producing fruit buds. Vigorous growth does not seem to go hand in hand with fruit pro - duction. (By vigorous we mean a growth of 18 to 24 inches for the season from most of the terminal buds.) Anything which is done to the tree at this time that induces heavy growth such as fertilization with manure or commercial fertilizers, intense cultivation, or heavy pruning, will tend to delay the production of fruit buds. In this connection it might be well to say that letters are frequently received in our Depart - ment that read like this: "Why don't my trees bear? I have given them the best of care for the last 9 years, pruned them, thoroughly, manured them every other year and never left the weeds and grass grow around them. Yet I haven't had over a dozen apples on my 20 trees to show for my work, and they are on some of my best ground, too. Do you think the nursery man sent me poor trees?" In such </seg>
            <seg id="p565">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 565 cases, at least some of the blame rests right at home ? Pruning should be omitted for a year or two and the growth checked by seeding down to red clover or possibly sweet clover. Sometimes even this treatment does not work out satisfactorily. The tops of the trees may have become so dense that the spurs in the center on the older branches do not secure sufficient light to produce fruit buds. This is true on some soils in eastern Nebraska and with the Delicious apple especially. This condition may be corrected by thinning out the top in early June after the trees have made consider - able terminal growth. The crowding branches are removed from the top to let the light down thru the center of the tree to the spurs on the older branches. These spurs will thereby be induced to make fruit buds. After the branches once load up with fruit they will spread out natur - ally and light will penetrate to the center of the tree without further treatment. Young pears are treated much like apples. It is advisable with some upright growers to weight down some of the branches on the south side to induce spreading. The wood of the pear is so easily bent that pruning alone does very little toward spreading the growth. After the trees are 4 years old, limit pruning to the removal of cross - ing branches. Heavy pruning, in addition to delaying bearing, makes it easy for fireblight to get started. Plums require comparatively little pruning since they shape them - selves quite well of their own accord. Crossing and crowding branches should be removed, however, where they do occur. Cherries are pruned very much like apples except that it is not necessary to head back the young branches to induce formatoin of side branches. Thinning out is quite essential with the cherry since this tree has a habit of growing very dense centers if left alone. An old saying that has been disproved in the last decade or two is that " Pruning tools should be kept away from plum and cherry trees." Today both kinds of trees are pruned whenever they need it. In this way much stronger trees are developed and better fruit can be produced. Moreover spray - ing and picking are made much easier. DRESSING UP THE FRONT YARD C. C. WIGGANS Although everyone is much concerned about the condition and general appearance of the interior of the house all too often little or no attention is paid to its surroundings. When we consider that rela - tively few people enter our homes as compared with the number that view them from the highway or street then we begin to realize the advisability of dressing up the yard. And at this point I want to ex - plain that these remarks are meant to apply to the backyard as well as to the front lawn. First impressions are generally lasting ones and </seg>
            <seg id="p566">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 566 hence we need a good appearance from the front but at the same time the backyard often becomes the outdoor living room for the family and it needs attention, too. Concentrating all efforts on the front lawn is simply an imitation of the boy who has a clean face but never washes behind his ears. Let's include both the front and rear in our plans, utilizing the portion toward the street or highway possibly more largely for lawn and locating our flower and vegetable gardens more towards the rear. But you say, will it pay to spend good money for some trees, shrubs, etc.? Most emphatically, yes, and from two standpoints. Well planted grounds add materially to the financial value of a property — as evidence note the landscaping of new homes, often before the property is even offered for sale. That beautiful surroundings add to the pleasure and contentment of the family will be universally admitted. These two values are present whether the property be great or small, in the city or on the farm. Mistakes can, of course, be easily made in landscape work and once made are often difficult and expensive to correct. To avoid such errors then should be the aim of each planter. It is my purpose in the few minutes I have to point out a few of the more important things which should be considered in ornamental work. We will assume at the beginning that the house, a new one, has been constructed and at a point judiciously chosen with reference to the lot lines, neighboring property, lay of the ground, vistas ,etc. The question of proper grading is of course, the first one to be settled. Certainly this should be arranged so as to carry surface water away from the buildings, well, etc. In some situations terraces are necessary or desirable but these should be avoided as much as possible because of difficulties in maintenance. Wherever possible the surface layer of soil on the completed grade should be the original surface soil instead of, as is not infrequently the case, the clay from the excavation. This black dirt gives much more satisfactory results with all kinds of plant - ings. Attention should next be given to the location of walks and drives. These are to be permanent features of the property and hence should be in the right place. Generally speaking these conveniences should lead directly from one objective to the other either in a straight line or with an easy graceful curve. Avoid all sharp curves and keep both walks and drives from making unnecessary turns. The drive on a city lot should always be arranged to permit direct unloading of coal as well as to serve as a driveway to the garage. With farm property the drives should permit easy access to both the house and farm buildings and hence a divided driveway is frequently necessary — one branch leading toward the barn lot and the other to the house and garage. Possibly the next most permanent feature of a landscape plan is its trees and their location should be carefully considered. In many cases a permanent windbreak will be needed — in others trees will be used </seg>
            <seg id="p567">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 567 to frame in the buildings or as a screen to hide objectionable features and in a few instances they may be used simply as specimen shade trees. In placing the trees avoid shutting off the views from either the house or the highway. Thus in your planting you will try to emphasize the good points of your property and screen out the objec - tionable ones. On the small city lot the trees ordinarily found in the parking may be sufficient unless one desires to have some shade for the kiddie's sand pile. If such is the case the trees generally will be used behind or at the side of the house and in many cases may as well be fruit trees. Evergreens are useful to give winter effects and usually should be planted in groups and at the borders of the property. Next in line then comes the woody shrubs of various heights, density and color of foliage, blossoming powers, etc. These should be grouped and generally will be found in one of the four locations: (1) along the borders of the lot, (2) planted at the intersections of walks and drives, (3) as foundation plantings about the buildings and (4) as a screen to separate the lawn from the garden. Leave the center of the lawn open and so group the shrubs and trees as to make the planting a frame or setting for the house. Do not plant solid or in regular rows. Leave open vistas between the clumps and let the clumps vary in height. Higher growing species should always be placed at the back. Perennials and even annuals will be mixed in throughout the planting so as to add color and variety and give a longer blossoming period. The amount of foundation planting needed will depend upon the type of house under consideration. Usually only low growing sorts are used and more often in angles and at corners than any other place. Avoid high plant - ings in front of windows because they obscure the view as well as exclude the light. Vines of various sorts may appropriately cover portions of the building especially if it is of brick. The third group of plants consists of those planted primarily for flowers and these may be either annuals — needing reseeding every year — or perennials whose roots live from year to year. Their proper position has already been indicated — or if it is so desired they may be planted in the rear in a separate flower garden. Do not scatter the flower beds over the open lawn. Too often we see a flower bed of round, square, star-shaped or some other peculiar form out in the middle of an otherwise beautiful lawn. Such things look like an ugly patch on the green grass and certainly do not add to the beauty of the place. Then, too, sometimes one finds cobblestone masonry, etc., surrounding such beds. To say the least, such features do not add to the general attractiveness. There is of course, a place for symmetrical plantings but this is in the formal garden and should seldom be found in the home grounds unless it be in a distinct flower garden section. Formal beds especially if they are in the midst of informal plantings on a small lawn make the lawn appear even smaller and they certainly require more work than would be necessary in caring for the same number of plants set in the shrubbery border. </seg>
            <seg id="p568">568 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture And now we come to the lawn portion — actually the foundation for all landscape work. Perhaps you already have a good lawn. If so you are fortunate and can easily add any or all the features men - tioned above. If you are starting with a new place two courses are open to you. First you may sod your lawn and have an immediate effect, or, second, you may sow grass seed and wait for results. The first is by far the more expensive and will be used in a minority of cases. Sodding a strip along the walks and drives and around the foundation of the house is good practice however, since this tends to keep the loose dirt from washing onto these parts. If you do sod insist on having good sod as free from weed and obnoxious grasses as possible and then see that it is properly fitted and tamped and given plenty of water. Sod laid on a dry or poorly prepared surface is under a handi - cap right from the start. If the lawn is to be seeded then the story is different. Consider - able work and some of it hard labor, is necessary in bringing a new grade into proper condition for seeding. If the soil is too clayey the addition of sand will improve drainage while a sandy soil needs manure to bring up its humus content. Nearly any soil is improved for lawn purposes by a barnyard manure. This should be well worked into the soil before seeding. One of the secrets of getting good stands of lawn grass is to have a very finely pulverized seed bed. The seed are so small and must be so lightly covered that germination simply does not take place in cloddy ground. Seed as early as possible, using at least one pound of seed to each 250 sq. ft. of surface — more seed will give a quicker lawn. Usually a mixture of seeds containing not only Ken - tucky blue grass and white clover but also some of the coarser grasses such as red top, meadow fescue, and English rye, should be used. Such mixtures are available from seed houses or you may buy the pure seeds and do your own mixing. Now just a word or two about the things you buy for planting. Insist on having good thrifty nursery stock and high grade seed. Small or so-called parcel post sized stock either take too long to make a showing or a larger number must be used. Low grade seed mean a spotted lawn. SPRING CARE OF SMALL FRUITS E. H. HOPPERT This is the time of the year when many of the odd jobs about the farm must be performed if they are to be done at all. Later on when the frost is out of the ground and listing and plowing time comes, the odd jobs are entirely forgotten. A few days, intelligently spent among the berries will certainly pay big returns when the time comes for berry pies and strawberries and cream. And by the way, cur - rant jelly, strawberry jam and canned raspberries are appreciated at </seg>
            <seg id="p569">569 Nebraska State Horticultural Society all seasons of the year. So why not plan to give the various small fruit patches the attention they deserve. Pruning the raspberries and blackberries is always the most de - tested job. Better tackle this first while the enthusiasm is high and the spirit is willing. Sharpen the pruning shears. Wear heavy leather gloves to protect the hands. Try to confine the plants to definite rows. It makes the picking so much easier. If the plants have sprung up all over the patch it might be advisable first to stake out rows. Place two stakes 2 feet apart at each end of the patch starting in at the edge. Stretch binder twine between each two across the patch. The plants that fall between the two strings will be left. Now place two more strands in a similar manner 6 feet from the center of this first row. Everything between the two sets of strands will be removed right at the ground. The plants in the row are treated differently. The old canes that produced fruit last year are removed at the ground. They have outlived their usefulness. Only the canes that grew last year will produce fruit this year. Of the new canes only 5 or 6 of the most vigorous are left for each plant and if the plant seems weak better leave only 3 or 4. This is in the case of black raspberries or purple cane raspberries. Blackberries and red raspberries are handled dif - ferently because they sprout out from the roots, or as it is usually termed, they sucker. In this case leave only one vigorous cane every 5 or 6 inches in the row. If the black raspberries have produced later - als, leave 4 or 5 of the most vigorous of these for each cane and remove the weaker ones. Now cut the laterals that are left back to 5 or 6 inches. This looks like a very heavy pruning but it is just what is needed to produce large berries. It has been found by experiment that canes pruned in the above manner produce just about as many quarts with this type of severe pruning as where more canes are left and the laterals left longer. The reason is that where more fruiting wood is left more berries are produced, but they are smaller and the proportion of seed to pulp is greater. Usually the larger berries are preferred and moreover the energy of the plant is conserved because fewer seeds are matured. The red raspberries seldom produce laterals. Here the canes are merely tipped back to about 3 feet. Blackberries are pruned much like the black raspberries in that the laterals are cut back but here they are left 8 to 10 inches long. After the pruning is done a good plan is to rake up the old canes and burn them. Then haul in some well rotted manure. Later on a straw mulch may be applied. Spread clean wheat straw, if it is avail - able, 6 inches deep, between the rows. This keeps down the weeds and conserves moisture. Where there has been trouble with the canes breaking off in the wind a good plan is to erect a trellis for the protection of the new canes. For blackberries and black raspberries this trellis consists of short posts, 2 feet high every 20 feet. Two feet cross pieces are nailed at the top of the posts and smooth wire run along the outer edges (use </seg>
            <seg id="p570">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 570 No. 12 galvanized wire.) For the red raspberry a trellis such as is used for grapes will serve better. Black raspberries are often injured quite seriously by a fungous trouble called anthracnose. This disease can be readily recognized on the canes as grayish spots varying in size from round patches -h of an inch in diameter to oval spots an inch or more long. This trouble weakens the canes so they are easily injured by winter winds, the canes produce small, inferior berries. Spraying controls it. Use lime-sulphur solution 1 gal. to 9 of water as soon as the first 2 or 3 leaves have un - folded. Just before the blossoms open spray again, using 1 part lime sulfur solution to 40 of water. If dry lime-sulfur is used take for the first application 2 lbs. to 9 gals, of water and for the second 2 lbs. to 40 gals, of water. These sprays do not help the canes that are affected now but they kill the spores that infect the new canes that are produced this season. Currants and gooseberries also need some attention. These plants like a rich soil and will reward an annual application of manure with bountiful yields. Apply it early before cultivation begins or before the straw mulch is applied. Currants and gooseberries are compara - tively shallow rooted, therefore soil moisture must be conserved if they are to do well. The straw mulch is recommended for farm conditions because straw is usually abundant and can be applied in the next month or so whereas cultivation is apt to be neglected when spring work opens up in earnest. Pruning these two fruit plants is simple. They bear their best fruit on spurs on 2 or 3 year old wood and at the base of one year old ones. Canes that are over 4 years old (thick dark canes) are removed each year and new light colored ones allowed to replace them. Also thin out the weaker new shoots, leaving only 8 or 10 vigorous ones. A serious disadvantage encountered in growing raspberries, black - berries, currants and gooseberries, is that they ripen their fruit during our hot summer weather. A good plan to overcome this difficulty or at least a great share of it, is to locate the plants north of a windbreak or if the patch is permanently located and does not have protection on the south it is well to plant a low windbreak. In eastern Nebraska Russian mulberry will serve the purpose admirably. Where this hedge does not grow well use Russian olive or better still the Siberian Pea tree. Another plan that works well in the eastern third of the state is to plant peach pits in a furrow 8 or 10 feet to the south of the patch. The seedlings are kept cut back like a high hedge fence. These seed - lings will provide protection and in some years an abundance of peaches. The most serious pest attacking the currants and gooseberries is the imported currant worm. These worms will strip the leaves off the bushes in a few days unless they are killed. Spray the plants with arsenate of lead, 2 tablespoons full to a gallon of water. If you spray your fruit trees use the regular apple spray mixture on your currant and gooseberries at the time you are spraying your apple trees. </seg>
            <seg id="p571">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 571 If lice have bothered your currant bushes last year spray with tobacco solution (Nicotine Sulfate) at the rate of 1 teaspoonful to a gallon of water in which has been dissolved an ounce of laundry soap. This spray is applied just as the buds begin to swell and again just as the leaves open up. The strawberry patch will require comparatively little attention in the spring except the removal of the straw mulch. When the buds on cherries and other trees begin to swell begin to examine the plants under the mulch. When the new leaves begin to show up is the time to rake off the straw into the space between the rows. Leaving the cover - ing on the plants too long may smother them. Leave a little straw about the plants so that the berries may rest on the straw instead of the dirt. GROWING YOUR OWN FRUIT TREES AND SHRUBS F. M. COE I am sure we will all agree with this motto of the American Nurserymen's Association: "It's not a home till it's planted," and yet how many Nebraska farm homes do we see standing bare and wind - swept on the prairie, without a tree to break the chill winds of winter, without a shrub to make it homelike, without a tree or vine to bear lus - cious fruit for its owners? How much more liveable a home I know that nestles down between protecting elms, sheltered from the north wind by a windbreak of fine pines and spruces. How graceful are the spireas bent with snow, how beautiful the coralberries against its white mantle. When spring comes and the lilacs bloom, how lovely will the garden be! The well kept orch - ard and fruit garden bespeaks a cellar well stocked with juicy winter apples, canned cherries — pears, plums and berries, jellies, and other goodies. Nor is it only the farm family who can enjoy the beauties and fruits of a garden. Nearly every townsman has room for a few fruit trees and vines and for shrubbery about the house. Yet how many town and city homes do we see with bare foundations and rear yards orna - mented only by ash heaps. What a transformation can be made in a few years by a judicious planting of shrubs, trees and fruit plants! A large outlay of money is not required to plant a farm or sub - urban home. Most of our hardy shrubs and fruit plants are easily propagated and may be obtained at very reasonable prices from nursery - men, or grown at home. The price of nursery stock depends primarily upon age and size and if you are content to plant the smaller sizes and wait a year or two more for the desired effect, the cost may be kept very low. Whether you buy your plants or propagate them yourselves, they will bring you vast dividends on your investment of money and labor in delicious and wholesome fruit, in shade and shelter. </seg>
            <seg id="p572">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 572 in beauty, in satisfaction; in short they will make your home a better place to live. The propagation of some of our fruit and ornamental plants is simple and requires little skill. In this class we include the straw - berry, the black and red raspberries, currant, gooseberry, grape and the blackberry. The strawberry propagates itself by means of runners, in this way setting more plants in an old bed than is desirable. Plants for a new bed can thus be obtained from the old bed on your place, or from a neighbor's. Only the new plants with light colored roots should be used. Spring transplanting is usually the most successful. Black raspberries form new plants by striking root from the tips of the canes which have been bent downward to the ground. These are called "tip layers" and may be taken up and transplanted in the spring to start a new patch. Large numbers may be taken from older plantings as they are of no value to the old plants. If you wish to increase your present patch, covering the ends of the canes with moist soil in late summer will help them root. Pinching the tips of the canes causes them to branch and form several plants from each shoot. The red raspberry is usually propagated by transplanting the suck - ers which shoot up from the roots of old plants. Mature suckers of last year's growth are usually used for early spring planting when the plants are to be shipped. If the plants are close at hand, the new suckers may be used in late spring and transplanted like vegetable plants. Such plants should be shaded and watered. Blackberries are also propagated by suckers, indeed, they sucker so freely as to choke out the old plants, which are benefited by their removal. Blackberries and red raspberries may also be propagated by root cuttings. Pieces of root as large as a pencil or larger and about three to five inches long are used. Root cutting are best made in the spring while the plants are dormant. Planted in rows an inch or so deep, they sprout readily and make strong plants in a year's time. Estab - lished plants may be induced to sucker freely by severing the surface roots from the clump with a sharp spade. Grapes, currants, gooseberries, and most of our hardy shrubs, such as dogwood, spirea, Japanese barberry, privet, honeysuckle, mock orange, hydrangea, tamarix, highbush cranberry, rose, and lilac may be propa - gated by the use of hardwood cuttings, some much more readily than others. Such cuttings, made of well matured new growth, about six to ten inches long, are best made in November or December and stored under cool, moist conditions until Spring. Damp sand, soil, or best of all, new sawdust from freshly cut logs, may be used. A cool cellar, kept below 40° is ideal, but lacking this, a callusing box of sand covered with soil may be used, or the cuttings buried in a well drained place in the garden. By spring, the cuttings should be callused over and ready to plant in a nursery row. Plant them as soon as the ground is warmed </seg>
            <seg id="p573">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 573 up, leaving but one bud exposed. Ordinarily they are allowed to grow two years in the nursery row before planting in the shrubbery border or berry patch. Layerage, or laying down branches and covering them with soil is a slower but surer method of propagating most shrubs and vines. Branches pegged down and covered with moist soil send up rooted sprouts which may later be removed and planted. The dogwood, currant, and gooseberry frequently forms natural layers, the low pendant branches rooting where they touch the ground. These may be removed and planted. Shrubs which root with difficulty or not at all from cuttings may be made to root by layering. Notching the lower surface of the branches, twisting, or bending may encourage root formation. Japanese barberry and the privets may also be propagated from seed. Fresh seed is collected and sown in the fall. Barberry seed germi - nates readily and reaches good size in two years, but the privet seed germinates slowly and uncertainly, and takes longer to size up than do plants from cuttings. Our native friends, the wild rose, coralberry, waxbercy or snow - berry, sumac, bittersweet, wild grape and others should not be over - looked as ornamental plant materials. One or more of these beautiful shrubs and vines grows wild in all parts of Nebraska and may be had for the taking. The wild rose, while a dwarfish plant, rivals in delicacy of form and color the best of the hothouse blooms. Yet it is but little used. Many native trees also may be secured by transplanting small specimens from the woods. Elm, ash, hackberry, soft maple, cotton - wood, and in some places oak, walnut and hickory may be found, espe - cially along the canyons and stream beds. Rather small specimens should be chosen for transplanting, since a large part of the ranging root system of the large tree will be lost in digging, making success less likely. Specimens should be picked out beforehand, and trenched, that is a narrow trench dug around to cut the long lateral roots. Trench - ing the year before would be even better, since the cutting away of the outside roots induces the formation of roots closer to the crown which can be moved with the tree. Moving a ball of earth about the crown is very helpful where it can be done. Trees are usually moved in the spring before growth begins, although moving in winter with a frozen block of soil about the roots is also good. Nurserymen propagate most shade trees by seed. The seed is usually stratified by placing out of doors in sand over winter and planting in the nursery row in spring. Besides the native trees named, the birches, English elm, Pin Oak, and the Volga poplars make good trees in Nebraska. The willows root readily from cutings, almost any branch or twig of this species growing when planted. Nurserymen go to considerable pains to grow nice straight-trunked shade trees. They often cut back the little trees to the ground to force up a straight, strong shoot for the future trunk of the tree, tying it carefully to a stake. </seg>
            <seg id="p574">574 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Everygreens, such as pines and spruces, are seeded in shaded beds, later the seedlings are shifted to the nursery row. They are again moved once or twice in the nursery to keep the roots compact for the final transplanting. When we consider the cost of seed, the amount of labor, land and years of time required to produce a fine specimen tree, the prices asked by nurserymen seem well justified. The home propagation of fruit trees, however, is more difficult than that of shade trees, berries and shrubs, since they do not, as a rule, root from cuttings, nor do they come true to type from seed. It is necessary, then, to bud or graft the variety desired, called the scion variety, on a seedling root, called the stock. Seedlings of apple, plum, pear and cherry may be purchased from nurserymen, or grown from seed stratified in sand over winter. For apple stocks seeds of hardy varieties such as Duchess, Wealthy, Malinda, etc., are best. For pears, Keiffer seed sprouts well. Wild plum pits are used by nurserymen for growing plum stocks. Sour cherries are usually worked on mahaleb, an imported rootstock. Sprouts from the roots of cherry and plum trees or chance seed - lings in the orchard may be shifted to a nursery row and budded, if only a few trees are wanted. They should be moved while dormant, cut back almost to the ground, and budded in late summer. In explanation of these terms, let me say that budding is a form of grafting in which only one bud, with the bark about it, is cut from the scion variety, inserted in a T-shaped incision under the bark of the stock, and tied with raffia or twine. This must be done while the stock is growing and the bark slipping well. Time of budding varies with different kinds of fruit, usually being done from mid - summer to early fall. The buds remain dormant until the following Spring, when they are forced into growth by cutting off the stock above them. Peaches, pears, plums, apricots, cherries, and some apple trees are propagated by this method. For Nebraska conditions, budded apple trees are generally con - sidered inferior to piece-root grafted trees. In the piece root tree, the French seedling root which is not reliably hardy here under all conditions, is placed several inches below the surface where it is pro - tected from the severe cold by a thick blanket of soil. The seedling root of the budded tree, on the contrary, lies closely to the soil surface where its chance of injury by cold is much greater. Piece root trees often form roots from the scion variety which are apt to be hardier than the French seedling root. Whole root grafted trees are open to the same objection as budded trees. Nurserymen in the North Central fruit district grow piece root grafted trees only, and are apt to use hardier stock than southern nurserymen. In addition, the varieties grown will more likely be adapted to our climatic conditions. In northern and western Nebraska, where semi-hardy varieties like Jonathan, Grimes, and Winesap are occasionally injured by our severe winters the plan of developing an orchard by topworking these </seg>
            <seg id="p575">Nebraska State Horticultural Society 575 sorts upon a hardy stock variety, such as Virginia Crab, Hibernal, or Duchess, is a good one. By budding the branches, a hardy trunk and crotches — the most vital part of a tree — are assured. While in general we find it quicker, more convenient, and often as cheap to buy our fruit trees from a reliable nurseryman, still we should know how trees are propagated, so that we may buy intelli - gently. In addition, a knowledge of budding and grafting enables us to topwork trees successfully so as to secure hardier trees, to grow sorts the nurseryman does not have, or to change from a poorer to a a better variety. Mature trees of inferior varieties may be topworked by a process known as cleft-grafting. In cleft-grafting, the operator cuts off branches from 1 to 3 inches in diameter, splitting the remaining stub with a cleft - ing tool and holding it open with the same tool. Scions, in this case pieces of last year's wood of the variety desired, about five inches long, are cut wedge shape with a long flat smooth cut, and inserted in the cleft in such a manner that the cambiums, just within the inner bark, of the stock and scions, correspond. The scions may be tilted outward ever so slightly to insure the cambiums crossing. The wedge is then removed, clamping the scion tightly in place, after which the exposed wood is well covered with grafting wax. A good wax may be made by melting together 4 parts of resin, 2 parts of beeswax and 1 part of tallow or linseed oil. </seg>

College "I realize it is getting rather late, and I shall not take very much time. I believe we have a few other speakers who you will enjoy hearing more than you will enjoy listening to anything I might have to say. I would, however, just like to point out the fact that the sheep business has been on the general pick-up, and is looking better. We have had more inquiries about sheep in the last three weeks than we have ever had. Nebraska is, of course, mainly a sheep feeding state. I believe it ranks second among the western states. As a breeding state we will not rank in so important a position. I do not think in the lowlands it is profitable to breed sheep, and where those conditions prevail I think Jt is probably more profitable to buy western ewes, breeding them to pure-bred rams. In some sections breeding of sheep is being too much neglected. Fie. 1 — Lamb feeding is practiced very extensively thru the valley sections of Ne - braska. This picture shows a very typical lamb feed lot. TUESDAY, JANUARY 5 Forenoon </seg>
            <seg id="p585">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association 585 Lambs Should Come Early "There are many advantages in having the lambs come early. Those lambs should be ready for market in May or not later than June. We must get them off before the extremely hot sultry weather prevalent in those districts during July and August gets here. Then too we escape trouble with the Stomach Worm that often bothers during hot weather. If it is at all possible, the lambs should come early. The sheep business right at the present time is very good and probably that's the main reason why so many people are going into it." WHY DOES MY NEIGHBOR BILL GET MORE FOR HIS WOOL THAN I GET FOR MINE? C. N. CADWALLADER, Cadwallader Hide &amp; Fur Company, Lincoln, Nebr. "There are a number of reasons, of course. The different breeds raised may have some effect on' the matter. My experience, however, in Nebraska has been that the greatest single factor that brings about this difference is the method used in handling the fleece after it has been grown to clipping time on the sheep. Improper treatment at clip - ping time and afterward have more effect, I believe, than either the growing or the breeding of the sheep. It is true that in Nebraska we have climatic conditions that are not prevalent in some other states. Our hot summer sun will sunburn the fleece on the back of the sheep. In this respect we are unable to help the situation very much. You may see how conditions in other states can make a different result there. The hot sun of our summer months dries out the oil from the fleece, causing it to break and frowse. Frowsy fleece does not have oil 'in it and it will not spin. When we attempt to spin it, it noils, and will not stretch out as it should. In spinning wool it is first made into a top, which is combed out and finally run into a yarn. Frowsy wool will not go into this top. I have with me a number of samples of wool that might be interesting to you, and which I will be glad to show you after I am through if you care to look at them. Dirty Wool Is Worth Lees "Good wool runs like one strand clear through. Now then, in comb - ing this the noil pulls out. This is one of the reasons why one lot will bring in a better price than another produced close. At the time of cutting all wools are never pure white in Nebraska. We get much dust in it here. Now this particular fleece (Mr. Cadwallader indicated one of his collection of samples) is a very fine wool, but it is badly dis - colored. Let us take a few figures for example. Fine staple wool is worth about $1.40 cleaned. A good Australian wool shrinks about 40%, or nets 60 pounds out of every hundred. This Australian wool will then </seg>
            <seg id="p586">586 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture be worth 84c in the grease. This domestic Ohio wool (indicating another sample) shrinks 58% or produces 42 pounds of cleaned wool, which amounts to 58.8c in the grease. This sample of our own wool, this is from Colorado, but our own is very similar shrinks 68% or nets 32 pounds of cleaned wool to every 100 pounds of wool in the grease, which if it were combing wool would be worth $1.40 per pound. On this ratie we find that this wool is worth 44.8% a pound. On this basis of these figures the Australian wool would be worth more than double what the samples of Colorado wool would be worth, and it is very much the same with our own Nebraska wools. Chaff and Straw Should Be Avoided "I just wanted to bring this to you. Ohio wool will be quoted about 50c while Nebraska will be quoted 35c for the same quality wool. Here is another reason why it will not bring as much. If your wool is full of chaff and dirt it may have to be carbonized, a process which costs about 6c per pound. If one keeps his sheep's fleece clean and another does not, it will mean 6c difference in the price of the wool afterwards. After being carbonized the wool will not comb so well so there will probably be about 8c difference — the difference of wool grown under ideal con - ditions and under adverse conditions. One wool goes through the comb perfectly and the other does not. (At this stage in his talk Mr. Cad - wallader showed several of his samples, explaining why different parts of the country often produce wools of different colorings and quality; he constantly stressed the fact that the care of the wool often has more to do with the price than the breed of sheep, or the manner in which they were fed). Tariff on Wool Is Necessary "We have heard a great deal about legislation to help the farmer. We have one bit of it that helps the sheep raiser and wool producer, but perhaps we need more of it. I do not know whether it will be necessary or not. That is our tariff on wool. Some might say it is unnecessary. It is necessary to have this tariff on wool if our sheep industry is to continue in the West. It means about 32c to 33c on the basis of the scoured pound. We believe, however, that farmers and stockmen can do a great deal to help the conditions of their business themselves. The big thing that will help, I believe is diversified farming. I do not want to take away any part of Mr. White's talk, or that of anyone else, but I might relate a little of my own experience. I bought a farm out southwest of here. It was in very bad condition, and I ran sheep on it. At the time I purchased it, the most corn it would pro - duce was twenty bushels per acre under normal conditions. At the pres - ent time it produces, easily, twenty bushels per acre more than it did at that time due to the fact that a great deal of sheep feeding and pastur - ing has rejuvenated the land and made it much more fertile. Sheep will make more money on the average farm than any other livestock, </seg>
            <seg id="p587">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association 587 and it does not take long to learn how to handle them. It just takes a little study to handle sheep, the same as it does hogs on the farm. The fact that sheep can be made to pay is proven by the fact that those who do handle them make them pay, and that those who handle sheep are among the most progressive farmers in the state. Every farm in western Nebraska ought to have from fifty to one hundred sheep on it. I do not know of anything that will -make as much money in proportion to the investment in money and time. Market Co-operatively I would advise co-operative marketing. Most men in my position will not advise that, for fear it will hurt their business. It was tried a few years ago in several different counties, and then in the state as a whole. I do not think a state pool will be successful, but I do think a county pool will be, and I am going to show you why pooling in counties is a good thing. The average wool grower does not have enough wool to pay a buyer to go to purchase it. Since wool is bought on a cent-a - pound basis, there is not a great deal allowed for expense in purchasing it. Another great advantage is that if you pool your wool you will get more buyers, and consequently a better opportunity for the best price. Handled by counties as I have pointed out, all bringing their wool to a central point conveniently located to all, leaving it in the original bags and line it up for a buyer on a certain appointed day, rotating counties so that it will be very easy for all the buyers to go from one point to another and see all of those wools. However, here is, I think, the greatest advantage that I can see to the arrangement. The men are there while the buyers are there, and each one sees the whole result. While the farmers are there we buyers will have a chance to explain why this wool is worth 40c, this one 42c, this one 50c, and so on. He could see for himself and realize what we as buyers are up against. The farmer does not, and under the present system cannot be made to realize the great differences in his wool as compared to that of his neighbor unless you can actually show it to him by comparing the actual samples of the wools. You may buy his wool one year and pay him less than his neighbor, but you can't go back there and do it the next. He is mad at you and he stays that way a long time. But when we get to going into these county pools we have an opportunity to prove to them that we are making no unfair discriminations against them and that we are merely protecting our - selves. Breeding Helps Breeding has a great deal to do with raising good wools, and feeding of the sheep has a great deal to do with it. A good sire in your flock will do wonders, but he cannot grow good wool on your lambs. They must be in a good thrifty condition. A good thrifty lamb will produce </seg>
            <seg id="p588">588 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture three pounds more wool than one in poor condition. If you can get three pounds more wool it will mean almost the keeping cost of your ewe, so that it certainly pays to keep the sheep in good condition so that the fleece will be kept clean and the wool will grow a long healthy staple that brings a very good price. Be Careful of Sheared Wool Another thing you should use care in is in shearing the sheep, and taking care of the fleece after it has been clipped. The fleece is often tossed into a bin, or perhaps tied with sisal twine. This should never be done. The strands of sisal will pull into the comb with the wool and probably go into the yarn, even until it is dried. Often they are not noticed until it has been woven into a piece of cloth, when the fibers of sisal will show up, and often spoil a whole yard of cloth. Sisal should never be used in tying up wools. Be careful to keep your sheep, and wool as well, away from burrs of all kinds. When burrs get into the fleece they are often retained until the sheep is sheared, and to remove them from the wool the carbonizing process is often necessary, which raises the cost of handling the wool, and lowers the price for you. An - other thing, try to keep each fleece whole as it is sheared. In shearing on the average farm we too often try to save expense and time by tearing it apart as the work is done, and in many cases the fleece is torn in from five to seven pieces. The large sheep raiser, of course, is more careful about these things. It is the average farmer who is careless in these matters, the fellow who does not have a great number. When sheared the wool should always be tied with a jute or paper twine made especially for the purpose and then placed in bags. Any kind of burlap bags can be used, but if you have large quantities of wool it will pay you to purchase special bags for the purpose as they will hold a much larger quantity of wool than a common burlap bag. Select the breed that will do the best in your vicinity and then take care of it. You can buy almost any kind of sheep. It does not make a great deal of difference what your start is. That depends on where you live. In Nebraska the black-faced sheep seem to do best. A shelter is necessary anywhere, particularly in western Nebraska and Colorado. Question: What is your own conviction about the future of the wool market? Answer: I do not think there is any question but what we shall have good prices. There is, however, a significant feature in connection with this question. The woolen mills in the East in 1924 operated at a loss, and most of them are finding that in 1925 they operated with comparatively heavy losses because they have paid too much for wool in proportion to what they can get for the finished product of their </seg>
            <seg id="p589">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association 589 mills. Accordingly they say they are not going to buy any more wool unless at a figure at which they can make a small profit. It is certain that either the price of wool must come down, or the price of cloth go up so that it is quite likely that they will not come up to the present market for wool. In fact wool has taken quite a drop in the last month. Nothing serious, but a significant fact nevertheless. Foreign markets are lower proportionately than ours. I think however, that we shall probably have fair prices for wool for some time. Prices now are on a par with what they were last June or July when wool was about 30 to 35c. We have never had such prices for wool save during the war period 1914-19, during last year, and so far during this year. The scarcity of territory on which sheep can be raised will always maintain a high price for a great many years to come. Question: Do you buy wool from the farmers on a graded basis? Answer: We can but make an estimate. Our prices are based on the bag and we can only make estimates on the value, shrinkage, etc. Of course there is a price quoted, but it is on the basis of the scoured pound. Wool is bought on the basis of one cent a pound profit. The most of it is bought this way. With this narrow margin it is necessary to be very accurate in making an estimate, and the experienced buyer does this to an astonishing degree. An error of 1 per cent in an esti - mation of the scoured weight would mean the loss of all profit and the possibility of a loss to the buyer, so he must be able to judge these wools very accurately. My own son has spent the last year in the woolen mills in New England spending practically all his time there so as to get familiar with the losses from shrinkage before going into the business with me. Without this knowledge it is impossible to buy wools intelligently, because an error of 2 per cent in underestimating the net scoured weight will mean a loss to us. LAMBING OUT WESTERN EWES ON NEBRASKA FARMS L. R. WHITE, Lexington, Nebr. The few remarks that I will make may be more or less of a per - sonal nature because the information which I will give is a result of experience, and I may refer to many of my own personal experiences to bring out some point that I want. I trust that you will pardon my doing so. I have been at the sheep business for quite a good many years. I have brought ewes from the West and from the South, and I have found that it does not make a great deal of difference where you buy them. Up to this year we have always bought these ewes and bred them ourselves, but with that system we cannot always have the lambs *• </seg>
            <seg id="p590">590 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture come as early as we might wish. When we breed the ewes here Feb - ruary is about the earliest date we can get lambs, which makes them a little late for the Easter market. Buy Quality Ewes It does not make much difference where you buy these ewes so long as you get good quality ewes. Find good ewes and buy them. Most people get a commission man to buy their ewes, and sometimes he tries to make them believe that a ewe is a ewe, regardless. The best success I have is when I buy them off the range, either bred or not bred. This year we are lambing out about 1700 ewes. We have about a thousand lambs at the present time. We plan on marketing these at Easter. They should average 60 pounds at that time. Our biggest trouble is to keep the ewe in good condition before they lamb. It is almost impossible to lamb out a ewe not in good condition. If you are not in a position to keep them fed up and in good condition you had much better stay out of the business of raising or feeding sheep. The ewe must be in a good thrifty condition before you can have a good thrifty lamb crop. You must also remember that you have two crops to sell — one of wool as well as one of mutton, and if you are going to be at all sure of both you must have your sheep in good condition at all times. Ewes Clean Up Fields in Fall When we get these ewes in we run them in our fields, generally let them into a cornfield. They pick around on the undergrowth for six weeks or so before they try to bother the corn very much. Any time when they start to bother the corn you want to watch them very closely. Never leave them in more than an hour at a time, or else move them to another field where there is no corn, or feed them plenty of good alfalfa hay. I believe in always having the ewes in good shape. You get better wool, and you get better lambs. Have your feeds on hand so that the lambs get plenty of good feed. The best feed we have found is ground corn, with an oil meal and bran mixture and plenty of good fresh water, and plenty of room so that they will not be crowded. Of course you must have them in the barn this time of the year. One night of below-zero weather will kill a whole crop of lambs for you this time of the year. I think keeping sheep is one thing that any farmer could afford to do. I have a neighbor, a young man who runs about a hundred head. Every year that bunch of sheep has paid off seven to eight hundred dollars of the indebtedness on his farm. He has had crops all the time, bat in addition he has had that little bunch of sheep, and they have al - ways shown a nice little profit. </seg>
            <seg id="p591">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association 591 - Q. Do you keep a man with your sheep while they are lambing? A. Yes, I have some one on the job all the time, just like a railroad. Q. What did your ewes cost you? A. The prices we pay runs from $6.50 up. If we buy them on the ranches we can get good ewes from seven to eight dollars, depending on their age. Q. Do you feed these ewes out? A. We feed them out for the early market. Q. Do you buy every year? A. Yes sir. I buy every year. I never carry any sheep over. I prefer to buy. I try to get all my sheep off by the first of June. Q. Do you always get them off by June 1st? A. Yes. It is pretty hard to do anything with them after the first of June. Q. At the prevailing prices do you not think it might be better to buy the lambs instead of buying eyes and raising the lambs yourself? A. I do not. The ewe is so much safer. There is too great a danger of buying too high priced lambs to begin on. I know of too many feeders who have gone "broke" because they tried to buy the lambs. In buying the ewes you have three possible sources of income, while in buying the lambs you have but one. The only possible gain you can make on your lambs is through a difference in price, and a difference in weight. This year that proposition might have been all right, but too often it has proven differently. Q. Do you use creeps in feeding your lambs? A. Yes. Q. What do you feed in them? A. I feed a mixture of bran, oil meal, and cracked corn, and the feeder is never empty. There is always feed before the lambs. Q. What per cent of loss have you had with your lambs. A. Very little. Out of the thousand lambs we have had, we have lost not more than fifteen or sixteen. Q. Does your loss run this low every year ? A. I think so on an average. We lose very little this way. Q. Have you ever tried feeding silage? A. I have fed just one bunch of lambs, and they did very well. Q. What do you feed your ewes, and when do you market them ? </seg>
            <seg id="p592">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 592 A. We feed them as I have stated, and get them off just as soon as we can get them ready. We market the lambs at about ninety days of age. The early market runs about three dollars a hundred better than the later, and you can not put on enough weight to make up the difference. Q. How soon after lambing do you get your ewes on full feed? A. My ewes are practically on full feed at the time they lamb. Q. Do you feed them the same as the lambs? A. I have never ground feed for my ewes, but I think it might be a good thing, and I am going to try it this year. Q. What sort of a barn does one need to have ? A. Nothing elaborate, but it must be warm. When it gets down to zero a lamb must be kept pretty warm. Keep your lambs good and warm. It pays. Do not put them in large bunches. Q. How long do you keep them in ? A. That depends on the weather. If it is warm there is nothing like sunshine for them. But this year we have had too much mud, snow, and slush to put them out yet. The convention then adjourned to the College meat laboratory and observed a meat cutting demonstration on lamb carcasses by Mr. W. J. Loeffel of the Agricultural College. In his demonstration Mr. Loeffel used three lamb carcasses. One of them quite small, and rather inclined to be thin; another of about average market weight; and, a third rather heavy, although not very fat from the standpoint of the show animal. Mr. Loeffel made various cuts through these animals to show the appearance of the fleshing. The smallest was of the type that most housewives would select for their meat, according to Mr. Loeffel, who says that they have to be very careful in butchering stock for the college shop as it is hard to sell meat that has a great deal of fat on it. He stated that the same con - dition is true of beef carcasses. He dwelt rather at length on the fact that this is directly opposite to the type of animal the showmen want for show purposes, and the type that students in the College are taught to select as champion animal types. A rather interesting vote was taken on the selection of the carcass that would produce the tastiest chops. The middle-weight carcass, or the one of about average market weight and fairly fat was chosen by a large majority of those present. The heavy animal showed entirely too great a proportion of fat in proportion to the lean in the cross section cut, while the lightest one did not show quite enough. Yet, according </seg>
            <seg id="p593">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association 593 to Mr. Loeffel the heaviest of the three animals you would call too thin in a stock judging competition in any show in the country. Mr. Loeffel also gave some rather interesting figures showing the dressing weight of the three animals, figures which would be of little interest unless one had the carcass with which to make comparisons at first hand. Afternoon MAKING REAL DRAFT HORSES OUT OF COLTS W. W. DERRICK, Agricultural College, Lincoln This is a rather hard proposition because there are so many things to take into consideration in getting your colt to the draft horse stage. The making of draft horses begins at the time you breed your mare, or even earlier than that because you must select the animal you are going to use as a sire. We find that you can go about the state many places and find farmers breeding their mare to scrub horses. There are thousands of horses that have no excuse for existing. There are buyers who go about the country buying up these poor horses of recent years, and we find that they have been shipping them to a town in Illinois where they are being butchered and made into tankage, and that is about all they are good for. They are serving their best purpose in this way. Select a Good Sire One of the first important things is the selection of a good draft sire. To begin with, never select an unsound sire, or a sire that has been known to produce rather uncertain results, or your results may be of the more unfavorable sort. In the beginning select a good draft horse to sire your colts. I am not saying that you should not be careful in selecting your mares, because a good mare is very valuable. We often get good results from rather mediocre mares, but seldom do unless the sire is a good drafty stallion. After breeding the mare she must have the proper kind of care. The mare must mave plenty of feed during the time she is suckling the colt. If she is working at the same time, she must have double care, because she must not only produce the strength to work, but she must also feed the colt, and this colt, if he is to develop properly, must have plenty of mare milk. It is much cheaper and more satisfactory to grow him while he is young than to wait and attempt to try it after he has been stunted. For that reason see that the mare produces a good flow of milk. If she is working she must be fed for both power and production, and unless you do so very carefully you are going to sacri - fice one or the other or both of these items. HORSES H. J. Gramlich, Chairman </seg>
            <seg id="p594">594 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Grain Those Colts Pretty soon the colt will fuddle around his mother's feed, and the first thing you know he will be nibbling at it, and eating a little of the grain and hay, but for a long time the bulk of his feeding must be done to the mare, and from the mare to the colt. As soon as he begins to eat, however, he should be supplied with extra feed. If you can supply him with a small amount of grain you are going to go a long ways toward giving him the right start. Feed him a little crushed oats or even whole oats. He will get a lot of good out of them. Oats is some - thing that most of us have on our farms and can be easily provided. Now if you want to do a little more for him still, give him a little bran and oil meal to help him grow. They help him to develop more muscle. If the mare and colt are running in a pasture a little grain may be supplied in a creep where the colts can go in and eat a little if they feel like it. What is more pitiful than to go out into a pasture and see there a mare that is thin, and with a thin looking colt. Keep your colts well taken care of, even though the mare may go down somewhat. At night it is best to turn them out together. Let them go to a pasture where the colt will get some exercise to make him grow into a bigger horse and a better animal than he would otherwise be. Proper Weaning Is Important At weaning time the colt should be eating like any horse should eat. He should know what oats and what hay are, or any other grains that you are going to feed. At weaning time you are going to set him back just a little. Now at the time the colt is a year old he should be one-half of his mature weight. After that as he goes into the yearling stage his gains are going to be much slower. He should be about one-half of his mature weight at the age of one year. If you get less weight on him than that you are running a chance of owning a small horse. You may make up some of the gain, but the chances are that he will be just a little small. The colt must have lots and lots of care the first winter if you are going to make a big draft horse out of him. Some turn their colts into the cornstalks, where there is little or nothing for them to eat. The result is that they grow a coat of long hair, and grow thin. That is about all. These colts cannot make good draft horses when you subject them to such treatment as that. The best way is to have the colt so he can be brought up at least once a day and supplied with a liberal amount of grain. If you keep his belly well filled he will make more growth you may be sure, than if you turn him out until next spring. In the spring turn him out in the pasture and supply him with plenty of oats. The next winter he will be in shape to take </seg>
            <seg id="p595">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association 595 care of himself. The first winter is the most critical time in his de - velopment, much more so than the second or third. Never sacrifice feed at the expense of growth during that first winter. It Pays to Grain Colts The Illinois Experiment Station has done more work in the way of feeding colts than any other station in the country, and they have found a number of different rations- that work out quite well with colts, but they have always found that it has paid them to supply their colts with a good liberal ration of grains. A mixture such as corn, oats, oil meal, and in addition plenty of good legume hay. They find that such a ration in liberal quantities and supplemented by good care has always produced colts of a size demanded by the buyers of their state. The feed that you put into a colt up to the time he is ready to be broke will pay the largest dividends. You will not have a good work animal if you do not put the feed in him. There is always a demand for good horses. The reason we attract the buyers is because we cannot get enough good horses to make it pay for buyers to come in. We do not have enough of the kind of places where a man could pick up a lot of good horses. You know that is true, and you know we have very few of the outstanding good horses in our state that we ought to have. Gentlemen, I know you want to hear Ellis McFarland. It will be good for you. A good many times we have been discouraged, and I know of no one better qualified to make us feel encouraged than Mr. McFarland. He is the secretary of the Percheron Association of Amer - ica. He has kept the records of that Association right and there are no red figures in their books. Some of us who have had a hard time with red figures in our business might well learn a great deal from him, and apply those same principles to our own business. THE OAT BIN AND THE GAS TANK ELLIS McFARLAND, Percheron Society of America, Chicago, 111. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen: May I begin by telling of a horse trade ? It would seem that this story would be very appropriate in such an assembly as this. A Scotchman and a Jew traded horses with each other and traded sight-unseen. When finally the trade was made it was discovered that the Jew had a horse that was dead, and the Scotch - man, well he had one that might just as well have been from the description we have of it. However, the trade had been made so that finished that part of the story. Some few days later the Scotchman chanced to meet the Jew and they stopped to talk a while. The Scotch- </seg>
            <seg id="p596">596 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture man waited patiently for the Jew to broach the subject of their recent trade, but Ikey seemed unlikely to do so, when finally Sandy's curiosity got the better of him. "Ikey, what did you do with that horse I traded you?" "Oi that vas easy, a raffled him off, sold ten chances on him for fifty dollars each." "Yes, but Ikey, what about the fellow that got the horse, what did you do with him?" "O, I gave him his money back." And the Scotchman went his way sorrowing that he had not done so, and bewailing the fact that he had the worst end of the trade. Now you have assigned me a subject something about the Oats Bin and the Gas Tank. Much has already been said about the oat bin by Professor Derrick. This is a theme that you are all undoubtedly very much interested in this afternoon. The oat bin is going to be the fort of the draft horse business. During the last year we have registered quite a few more horses than we registered in the year ending twelve months ago. There is no secret about running the Society on a money making basis. If the horse business is handled as it ought to be handled it will bring money. We are getting all kinds of letters from people who want to know about pedigrees, people who have never paid any attention to such things before. As a matter of fact we have had a very active increase ever since the first of April, but we find that there is usually a decrease from the first of November till about the first of April. Since the first of April we have had an increase of $1000 in receipts in the office over the year preceding. It goes to show that an increase may be expected over 1925. Gentlemen there is a scarcity of real good horses in this country. A firm of which I know had its stables full the first of February last year. The entire stable was sold out, and they bought it full again, and they do not have a single horse in those stables today, except one three-year old. I have received many inquiries such as this: "Where could I get some stallions? Can't you find us some stallions? We need some, and we need them badly." And they are willing to pay very good prices for them too. Good Horses Sell High At a fair recently we had a wire to purchase the first prize stal - lion. We had to pay $1200, but we shipped that man his horse. There is a demand, and a great demand for the best mares and geldings that can be produced, but you simply cannot find many of them in the country. That gives us an outlook on the horse business out over the country. We must have them in larger quantities to attract the buyers who want the best horses, because they want them in carload lots. There are quite a number of calls for good stallions at all times. There have been too many colts castrated, leaving a shortage of stallions in the last few years. You simply can't go anywhere in the United States and buy a carload of stallions in any area adjacent to a common ship- </seg>
            <seg id="p597">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association 597 ping point. A buyer came down from Canada recently and it took him three weeks of hard work to get sixteen horses together to take back to Canada, and he considered himself lucky to get that many. So you should be able to see the problem the man who goes out to buy is up against. Good Prices Stimulate the Horse Business Here is another peculiar thing we might mention in passing. Whenever a buyer goes into a community and buys some good horses and pays a good price for them you find an immediately increasing in - terest in the horse business. I know of such a community in Illinois. That community has leased the services of one of the best stallions in the state of Illinois. Just the minute you get some action in the horse market in a community you get some interest in horses. I have worked out a plan that I am going to submit to our directors for their approval. I have worked it out very carefully in the interests of the mare owners as well as the stallion owners. Now as I see the situation we must have an arrangement so that the farmer who owns a stallion can do so at a fair profit. Can we not have a definite understanding in writing that if someone of your neigh - borhood will purchase a good stallion that you will use him. Until such a time as this does happen you cannot expect a man to guarantee to buy a $6000 horse or even a $500 one and guarantee a colt to stand and suck. It is a fact that you can go out and buy a registered mare for no more than you would have to pay for good grades. The reason is that these registered mares are very ordinary mares even if they have a lengthy pedigree. Their pedigree does not mean anything. There is no reason why you should pay more for them if you cannot see any chance of increasing your business with them. We must produce good horses. I am fully aware that during the last few years a lot of our people have been pessimistic. Now of course, we raise horses on our farms, and the most of our horses we expect to go right out and sell themselves. You hear someone say: "I can't sell my stallions. I have a good horse three years old, and several 2000-pound stallions, but I can't sell them." How do you try to find a buyer. You have to spend a little for advertising the same as anyone else in business. I am a farmer, I was born on a farm, raised on a farm, and I have lived on one most of my life, and I know there is a vast difference between producing and selling and if you do not know that, and are not willing to find it out then you had better engage in some other business than raising horses to sell. Good Drafters Sell Best What kind of horses do we want to raise? Draft horses, and perhaps some few wagon horses of a good type, but mostly good draft horses. These horses by all means must be large and well-built animals. They must be quiet and well-trained, so that they will work with th« </seg>
            <seg id="p598">598 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture least amount of effort. There is a reason why the Percheron horse has grown in America. It is because of the low down, wide out, and deep build he has. He is ready for you when he is two years old. Now all you have to do is to produce good horses of that type and sell them. You can sell them if you have them, but you must have them, because that is the only kind of horses you can sell. We are having dozens of horses go through the Chicago markets at $600 to $800 a pair, they have been doing it for years, and each year the horses grow scarcer. The papers do not give the true state of affairs. I presume it is be - cause the oil companies and the automobile companies are their heaviest advertisers and they feel that they owe some allegiance to them by making the future of the horse look darker than it really is. But I want you to know that these reports in your papers are not true, and never have been. Q. Why is it that these papers will not publish the truth ? A. Unless it be for the reason stated above, I do not know. Good - ness knows we give them the facts of the situation often enough for them to know the truth, and know that we want it published as it is. I have repeatedly given out statements of the state of the horse busi - ness only to find that they have never been published in their complete form, or not until a time when they had no bearing on the immediate situation. Build Your Horse — Do Not Bloat Him Let me again stress the fact that it is the good horses for which there is a demand. Put plenty of feed into your horses, but remember it is not fat that the buyer wants to buy — it is muscle and bone he is looking for. Build your horses up, do not bloat them. The buyer is going to take your horses and put them to work, and he does not want them sweating off two hundred pounds the first week, nor does he want them to develop a long coat of hair so that they will sweat and develop pneumonia and die on his hands. Because he gets so many of this type he is willing to pay seven to eight hundred dollars for a good team when he gets the chance. Your horses must be well-broke to sell well. Remember it is not an old experienced horseman that is going to handle your horses in the city. It is more likely to be some greenhorn picked up around the streets that has handled a horse but very little before. Your horse must be quiet and not excitable or nervous. We will have to work around freight trains, street cars, and every other imaginable disturbing element. You can do this in the winter time when your other work is a little lighter. Hitch your horses up, give them plenty of training. Half the horses that go on the market do not know how to back a load. The buyer of horses for city use must have horses that can back a load without making a fuss about it. He must have exercise. The buyer, as I said before, does not want to buy a horse with all his weight </seg>
            <seg id="p599">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association 599 put on in a box stall, he wants a horse with his weight put on while he has been having ample exercise, so that he will be seasoned down. He wants big horses all right, but he wants big horses that have gotten big through exercise. Another thing I want to say to you about producing draft horses is with respect to feeding. I think this matter is a very serious one. So many foals die at birth. Nine cases out of ten is due to feeding the mare a lot of dry feed and that sort of thing, and under such con - ditions she will come to foal constipated and it isn't any wonder that we have so many foals die at birth. Feed your mares alfalfa or bran, something slightly laxative. Set your mares in the right kind of physical condition before the foals come. I remember on my father's farm. My father was always very proud of the teams I drove out, after I began to study and find out how to take care of horses properly. I always figured on feeding a horse on about the same basis as I did myself, that is; I gave him as much as he wanted to eat. I can re - member seeing my father and brothers take out two or three ears of com, saying that it was a waste to feed so much corn, and rank ex - travagance. After I came away, we have had foals die and horses sick in the fields because they have been overdone. And there has been on that farm a good many deaths among the livestock that did not occur before that time. Professor Derrick has emphasized a very important point when he mentioned half of the mature weight at twelve months old. That matter has been taken up enough that I need not mention it here, but I want to say that if you do not get half of his mature weight on him at a year of age you never will get all the weight on him that he should have when he is fully matured. Another thing you want to bear in mind is that if you are going to be in the pure-bred horse business you must produce good animals, and unless you can produce some that look better than a grade and are better than a grade you cannot sell them for better prices than a grade. You cannot sell a 1600-pound horse when the buyers want ton horses, they get too many light horses with 1600-pound stallions. You must have ton horses because your mares in most cases are likely to be so much lighter that you must have good sires to equalize this weight. Another thing, if you have not plenty of good grass pasture you might as well go out of the stallion business. You simply cannot produce stallions unless you have the grass. Another problem is pasturing the colts. We try to have three colts in a pasture together. They get along much better than two. They do not do so much running around in the pasture, which when done to excess tends to hinder a good healthy growth because they run too much of it off. And unless you are going to produce horses that </seg>
            <seg id="p600">600 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture weigh 1900 pounds or better you are not going to last long. You must produce the kind the other fellow wants to buy. Another thing to be considered is the time to sell horses. When do they bring the most money? I know a man who is going to quit farming. He told me he is going to sell his horses this fall. That is the wrong time of the year. Why? One thing a farmer will not do is buy his horses in advance. They will wait until they have to use them and pay one-third to one-half moTe for them. You have cheap feed in the fall, and your horses are cheap — the next spring the horses will be high — it is up to you to make the proper connections. A good team in Ohio or Illinois will bring a hundred dollars more in March than it will in January. That is a rule you can go by twelve months of the year. You can tell the state of the horse market by the weather reports. If the season opens early business opens up nicely. Watch your weather reports. Ordinarily we have the best openings in March. Last year it was not until April. Fig. 2 — Can a Nebraska farmer afford to spend his time driving less than six horses in a team ? Big teams are gaining grreat favor. More Horses Instead of Tractors Here is a little discussion as to why we ought to go to farming more with horses instead of tractors. Think of the life of a horse, around fifteen years, much longer than that of your tractor. When your horse is still going strong your tractor will long ago have rusted out and be in the junk pile. We must, however, make use of larger team units. We have got to get to use more than three or four horses, experience he had in Illinois on his around to the point where he was the point where we are willing to Mr. Mills was telling me of the farm. He finally got his manager willing to work five horses. The farm manager tried it. What happened. Nothing at all, he got up to six horses, now he would not do otherwise when he can use the larger team. They drive just as easy, and one man is able to do a great deal more work on the farm. There is no reason why he cannot drive a team that will turn three furrows instead of two. It has been done in </seg>
            <seg id="p601">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association 601 these days of high prices and high priced help. We have got to operate our farms in the terms of the business men of the city. These expenses must be cut in every way we can. Use larger team units per man. If one can do the work of two you are going to save the salary of the one. Q. Why won't they publish actual market reports in Lincoln? Surely they are not influenced by the great oil and motor companies. A. I will not attempt to say why, but you can not get it done in Lincoln or any other place where it would do any good. Q. Why can't I register my Percheron horses for one dollar? I used to pay you a dollar, now you charge me six. A. That should be easy. Our expenses have grown in proportion. Q. Do you not believe that more stress should be laid on exercise of the mare before the colt is born. A. Yes, I think so. Q. Should the grain ration be cut dowh and let the mare rough it a little before the birth of her colt? A. I believe it should, and experience seems to bear this out, GOOD MARKET FOR GOOD HORSES A. P. COON I think there is a good market for horses. Only recently I had an order for a carload of geldings to be shipped, and I had to turn it down because I did not know where I could get them. I think the market never has been better for good horses. The convention then adjourned to a room on the upper floo.- of the Judging Pavilion and was shown many interesting slides of horse types by Mr. McFarland who had spoken earlier in the afternoon. This was very interesting, instructive and was thoroughly enjoyed by all present. WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 6 Livestock Judging Pavilion Forenoon SWINE Samuel McKelvie, Chairman UPS AND DOWNS SAMUEL M'KELVIE Mr. Samuel McKelvie has been a familiar figure in the circles of hog raisers for many years, and is well known as a prominent figure among them. He presided during the swine meetings last year, and </seg>
            <seg id="p602">602 Report of Nebraska State Board op Agriculture was again able to be with us this year. In his opening remarks he stated that he had been in the hog business for a great many years, buying 1 his first brood sow in 1883. He mentioned that he had passed through various periods of depression and prosperity in the industry, and he further stated that in all his years experience he had found that the periods of depression were much the shorter. Mr. McKelvie stated frankly that he would not know how to operate a farm without livestock, particularly hogs and cattle. To him they are part of the farm. He noted that most of the old-timers who placed their supreme faith in the old cows and the hens and the pigs have been generally successful in their day. PIG PASTURE POINTERS PRINCIPALLY The work presented to you this morning shows the third year of a project comparing various pasture crops. Many of you have seen the pigs that we used in this experiment at the State Fair, and are familiar with the general plan followed. Hog men are realizing that pasture plays an important part in re - ducing production costs. The problem has been how to use these pas - ture crops to the best advantage, that is, to gain the best advantage from the grain fed to the hogs. Certain it is he can use pasture to a great advantage, and not only save gTain, but also maintain the fertility of the soil more easily. There are a number of questions on the subject of pastures that remain to be unanswered. One is: What is the comparative value of the different crops? Another: What grains can we use most advantageously? Another: How much feed should be fed to pigs on pasture. This year, as usual, we fed a number of different lots of ten pigs each. They were put on experiment as soon as we could get them weaned, castrated, and vaccinated. They were put on experiment June 13 and were fed for seventy days following during the summer period. They were divided into nine lots of ten pigs each, they weighed an average of fifty-four pounds at the time they were placed in the experimental lots. Mr. Loeffel used a chart to show the comparative results obtained from the different pastures and rations fed with them. This year there was one lot which was fed a mixed feed. Mr. Loeffel stated that this was done because of so many requests that had come asking if certain feeds might or might not be fed as economically as the whole grains in the usual way. They found that the mixed feed lot showed slightly greater gains, and more economical gains than the other pens. The results showed that alfalfa, Sudan grass, and sweet clover have some - what the same value as grain savers. He demonstrated that the ex- W. J. LOEFFEL, Agricultural College </seg>
            <seg id="p603">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association 603 periment showed that tankage was an absolute necessity from an econ - omical standpoint in feeding hogs for the market. The lots fed tankage used less grain, and made much better use of their pastures than those fed a straight grain ration . Mr. Loeffel went into detail regarding the methods of feeding each lot, and showed why such results had been obtained, and offered interesting comments as he went through his explanation. He showed very clearly how it costs about two dollars a hundred to produce hogs in a dry lot more than it does on a pasture ration, allowing a liberal charge for the use of the pasture. This year's experiments check rather closely with the experiments of the other two years. He stated that the principal advantage of pasture feeding is not so much in the saving of grain as it is in the saving of tankage. "We have many inquiries as to the comparative values of alfalfa and Sudan grass. We always consider alfalfa as a standard forage crop here in Nebraska. Pigs fed on Sudan made practically as good gains as those on alfalfa, and their corn ration was the same in both lots. It is interesting to note that those in the dry lots took over half again as much tankage as those on pasture feeding, which is quite what one might expect if he analyzed the situation. Year before last the results with the use of Sudan grass were more favorable than this year. This emphasizes the fact that we must not draw any sweeping conclusions from one year's work. Experiments must be repeated in order to get an average of results over a period of years. Many people have asked about sweet clover. Our results were surprisingly good. This year the sweet clover fed pigs made slightly better gains than the alfalfa fed lots. The cost of gains was about the same in either case, showing that first year sweet clover has some possibilities. Rape pasture produced almost the same gains as sweet clover. While it made a very satisfactory showing, there is one place where rape fell down. It showed the poorest carrying capacity of any of the other crops used. The pigs kept it down to the ground all season. Lot six of these pigs had no tankage and made two-thirds pound gain per day. They made less gain than did those in the dry lot. Tank - age and corn in the dry lot are better than corn and a forage crop. Compared with Lot three, it shows that a pound of tankage saves four pounds of corn, even on pasture. So I think even at present high prices it is a good feed. Even at $75.00 per ton, it is the best bet of its kind that we have today. Look at Lot seven with a light ration of corn and tankage on Sudan grass pasture. They produced fair gains. For those who follow the practice of roughing pigs through the summer like many farmers do, this is a good experiment to watch. We aimed to just keep them growing, and growing good. We found that their gains were very economical, showing a slight saving in corn, tankage, and other feed, but they used twice as much pasture as the others, that it quite </seg>
            <seg id="p604">604 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture logical conclusion inasmuch as the pig's appetite must be satisfied. Lot eight shows the economy in using tankage, showing that tankage at five times the price of corn is still a good buy, and that shorts at the same price of corn is a good buy. In this experiment a pound of shorts proved equal to a pound of corn. The pigs that were fed the mixed feed made the largest gains. They weighed 152 pounds on the 22d of August and were the fattest of any of the lots on experiment. The cost was a little higher than on the straight corn and tankage ration. What is the lesson? To mix feeds together is certainly worth while from the standpoint of increase of gains, and from the standpoint of feeding tankage it looks like a good proposition even to feed it free choice. It all leads to the admission that so far as the relative value of the various forage crops that we are still up in the air. Comparing the full feed and the light feed it looks like it is about a fifty-fifty proposi - tion. The man who has a limited amount of grain, and an unlimited pasture who wants to hog down corn in the fall, or follow cattle in the fall the limited feed in the summer seems to be the better. The full - fed pigs are too fat to turn in the corn or to follow cattle. Speaking of mixed feeds while we are still on the subject of feeds. Lot nine proves that we can mix up a good ration that will do just as well as any of the prepared feeds on the market. There is no mystery to mixing these feeds even though their names might indicate such circumstances. We can mix them quite as well ourselves if we wish to take the trouble. It seems to me that the coming year is likely to be a good year for the hog business. We will have a larger demand for hogs than we have ever had. It looks to me like the man that gets in early next year is the lucky one. That means the man who crowds his pigs right from the jump is going to be able to get on the eaTly market and reap the benefits of the higher prices. The light feeder is running more chances of competition. WILL 1926 BE A GOOD HOG YEAR? MASON YERKES, Agricultural College I am very sorry that some of you late-comers did not hear all of Mr. Loeffel's talk. What he told you is much more definite than any - thing I may say about what is going to happen in 1926. The greatest share of what we may say about 1926 will be based on what has happened in the past, and from conclusions that we may draw from that. I hope you will all notice the number of years that Mr. McKelvie has been in the hog business. That would tend to show that generally there has been a profit in the hog industry. </seg>
            <seg id="p605">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association 605 The cost of feed, as Mr. Loeffel has said, is one of the most im - portant items in producing hogs, and in the United States the cost of corn is the most important item in the bill, so as a result of this rela - tion, the ratio has been worked out between the price of corn and the price of hogs. The average ratio at Chicago for the past 65 years has been approximately 11.5 to 1; that is, a hundredweight of hog, live weight, has sold for as much as 11.5 gushels of corn. This Chicago corn hog ratio of 11.5 to 1 probably represents actual cost of production or a little more than cost of production during this period. The Nebraska farmer can doubtless produce hogs at a profit when the Chicago ration is a little narrower than 11.5 bushels of corn to 100 pounds of hog flesh. The reason is that the corn-hog ratio on a Nebraska farm is usually wider than it is at Chicago. This is because the cost of shipping a carload of hogs from Nebraska is less than the cost of shipping the corn required to produce the hogs. Sometime during every four or five-year period we find a time when hog prices are high and corn prices are low. At such times the corn-hog ratio is wide, and hog production is profitable. Over a period of years from 1867 to 1915 we find that to about 33 months of rising hog prices there have been approximately 31 months of lowering prices. This is one of the things we can take into consideration in arriving at the conclusion we are after this morning. It does not indicate the profit you will get; it does indicate the place from which you will get your profit — whether through selling your corn through your hogs, or selling it directly to the elevators. We very often think that when hogs are high it is a good thing to raise hogs. You will notice on the chart the purchasing power of hogs during the last few years. During the years of 1918-19-20 the purchasing power of hogs was very good, but it would have been more profitable in every one of those years to sell the corn. That goes to show that one or the other is the more profitable even though either may return a fair profit. As a result of this situation, many producers who were feeding high priced corn to hogs in 1919 and the early months of 1920 decreased production. The result was a period of good prices for hogs during the major part of 1921 and 1922. In 1920 we had a record corn crop and crops almost as large in 1921 and 1922. Cheap corn and a scarcity of hogs brought about a very profitable period In the hog industry. The hogs took care of the surplus corn. That stimu - lated the hog industry so that by 1923 we were again having a high production of hogs and by the middle of 1923 the surplus of corn had practically disappeared, and immediately corn commenced to go higher in comparison with hogs. Because of this increased production in hogs the hog men were losing money. Along toward the latter part of 1923 they were getting their hogs to the market just as rapidly as possible. In 1924 the same result followed. Naturally, with these heavy receipts </seg>
            <seg id="p606">606 Report of Nebraska State Board op Agriculture the prices went in the opposite direction. The prices, such as they were, were largely maintained by the demand from European countries. We find that they were watching our markets in the periods of low prices. They only buy when our prices are low. Now, I have simply shown you the conditions up to 1925. I want to go into the year of 1924 in more detail. During the remainder of his talk, Mr. Yerkes followed facts and figures shown on his charts very closely. His remarks would be in - teresting only in connection with the charts. Mr. Yerkes brought out the fact that there are other things than the mere prices of corn and hogs that affect the market. He showed how this operated in a dairy situation near New York City. There was an abundance of moisture late in the season one year, and the result was a continued period of high milk production, and a lowering of prices for the coming winter due to the surplus dairy products in cold storage. He showed that while a shortage in the number of sows bred might indicate a shortage of pigs, it did not necessarily mean a shortage of pork, which after all is the product upon which the demand centers. For instance, supposing the hogs fed were put on the market at a greater weight than ordinarily. The shortage in numbers would prevail, but not the shortage in weight. Mr. Yerkes' talk was very interesting, and his charts showed in graphic form the cycles in hog and corn prices. In conclusion he pointed out the indications to the effect that 1926 should be a fairly good hog year — with hog prices slightly over the balance as compared to corn prices. DIRECT SUNLIGHT BENEFITS YOUNG PIGS MR. F. C. OLSON, Palouse, Wash. The nature of light and its phenomena is of interest primarily to the man who studies physics; but also the animal husbandman, poultry - man, and medical profession have become very much concerned within recent years. The problem of light is beginning to solve some special industries which had been started and then abandoned because of the inability to produce their product by artificial means. Such, for instance, as the broiler industry in poultry. These facts led investigators to believe that light has a very beneficial effect on the normal growth and development of animals. Waves of sound, radio, etc., are similar and affect the organs of hearing (the ear), while those waves which affect the optic nerves of the eye are light waves. The two, light waves and sound waves are identical, except for variations in their wave length, the former being considerably shorter. They travel in the same medium, the ether, with the same velocity, obeying the same laws of reflection, refraction, etc. </seg>
            <seg id="p607">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association 607 Generally speaking, light waves refer to those waves which ara ■ensitive to the optic nerves of the eye and include only the colors of the rainbow, from the violet on one end to the red on the other. The colors being violet, blue, blue-green, green, yellow-green, yellow, orange, and red. Within the subject at hand, the primary interest is in the waves that are below or beyond the sensitiveness of the eye, the violet color. The wave idea is only a theory which assumes that the disturbances known as "light, consists of a wave motion in the medium known as ether." Ether is that great space, whatever it is composed of, between the earth and the sun, with a possible exception of the first two or three miles that surrounds the earth. Presumably this space is a vacuum, which has not matter nor material within it, and that this ether is the medium of propagation of these light waves. An example — the incandescent lamp bulb — it is exhausted of air and gases. The light waves from the filaments passes through the vacuum and on into the surrounding air. This is proof that light waves do not' require a ma - terial medium for their transmission. Light Requires Time to Travel That light does require a definite length of time for traveling a given distance has been proven by many physic experiments. The speed which light travels is approximately 186,000 miles per second. Sound travels, according to various atmospheric conditions approximately 1000 feet per second. The earth is 93,900,000 miles from the sun, therefore requiring, approximately eight minutes and twenty-five seconds for a beam of light to strike the earth from the time it leaves the sun. Light always travels in a straight line from its source, and is always made up of waves (for illustration, the waves of the surface of water, or the field of growing grain), except the various colors have a definite length from apex to apex of wave. The division of the spectrum is made between the visible and in - visible waves. The eye is sensitive to those waves btween 400 and 800 millimicrons and includes the colors of the rainbow. However, the upper scale has waves, between the red 800 and up to 20,000 millimicrons which are heat producing and invisible. These waves will be referred to later. Beyond the heat waves are the electric waves, which are used extensively in wireless and radio, a very "hot" subject at this time. Not many realize the connection between light, heat, and wireless. On the other hand, the ultra-violet waves, or the waves between 400 and 185 millimicrons are of value to animal production and man in gen - eral, and with a possible exception confines the balance of this discussion. However, beyond the lower limits of these waves are the X-rays and rays of radium. </seg>
            <seg id="p608">608 Report of Nebraska State Board op Agriculture Technical literature contains thousands of references to the effects of ultra-violet radiation, but in many of them valuable specific data are lacking. That is, this literature has little practical value, however, it is very vital in the construction of data and information for practical application and it is only through such constructive work that many of the things known and practiced today have ever been developed. We should not lose sight of the keen intellects of preceding cen - turies. The part played by daylight in the production of the green color - ing matter in plants was observed long before the Christain era. Aristotle, the man who said "Give me a place to stand, and a lever long enough, I will move the world." He noted this influence as early as the year 350 B. C. Scientists have found that by applying artificial ultra-violet rays to a combination of elements and gases such as the plant used, they can make a substance very similar if not exactly like the starch of plants produced by the chemical activity of the rays. Heat and Ultra-Violet Rays Destroy Germs Sunlight as a disinfectant or germicide has been used and advo - cated for many years. It is that combination of both the heat and ultra-violet rays of the sun that are destructive to disease germs. It is known that it takes heat, alone, a considerable time to destroy bac - teria, and ultra-violet rays can only penetrate substances but a fraction of a millimeter. It has been shown that the ultra-violet rays are very deadly to germs, and kills them in a few moments time. Now this is of interest in swine production; in explanation the practices used and advocated it is recommended that sunshine reach all corners of the hog house and lots, so as to destroy any disease germs, however, only those germs on the surface are destroyed. That is of value, because the pig is built close to the ground, and he breathes these organisms into his system. Another recommendation is to remove the young pigs out on new, clean ground, preferably pasture to prevent infestation with worms. The worm during part of its life lays the egg which is dropped in the old pens and are consumed by the pig. Due to the protective covering of this egg and the inability of the rays of the sun to penetrate these eggs deep enough to destroy them, there is no other way to prevent infestation due to worms than to move the young pig to clean ground. Direct Sunlight Should Be Admitted to Buildings The old recommendation in building hog and poultry houses was to have plenty of windows. The windows were hinged at the bottom, if openable at all and allowed to open inward. This method of con - struction had its advantage as far as ventilation was concerned, but it required the light that was admitted to pass through the glass. It was later found that by opening the windows outward and thereby ad - mitting direct light to the floor, less disease and other troubles were noticed and more pigs were saved. This explains how direct light is </seg>
            <seg id="p609">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association 609 beneficial. In the early A-type or individual hog houses, window glass was used to admit light. Later experience showed healthier and more thrifty pigs were produced if the windows were omitted and instead high doors on the end of the house with sides openable to permit direct sunlight gave more healthy and thrifty pigs. That windows did not help prevent disease is due to the fact that glass cuts out nearly all of the ultra-violet rays. Recommendations from the sanitary stand - point are: 1. That pigs reared from birth in the movable house constructed as mentioned above but placed out on clean ground, preferrably, con - taining green feed, well drained ground that has not had pigs on it for two years, or ground that has previously been plowed, so that any possibilities of worms and disease germs have been destroyed. HOG SANITATION LOT NO. 2 Fig. 3 — The Nebraska A type hop: house provides warm shelter in winter and is so constructed that their doors may be opened wide to provide ample venti - lation during hotest part of summer. 3. Direct sunlight is most valuable in the early months for this purpose due to its lack or ultra-violet rays, and therefore decreased kill - ing power at that time, which is only about half as powerful as in June. It is also during the early months when an abundance of moisture, cold winds, etc., are prevalent to effect the young pig, reducing its vitality and making it more susceptible to deseases. Light raises another problem, and many new problems can be formed from this one. The problem is, what part does light play in the mineral nutrition of farm animals? Studies of nutrition during the past few years indicate that, in many cases, light may be as important a factor in the normal development of animals as is some of our feed, and that one is dependent on the other; that certain diseases, such as rickets, beriberi, scurvey, xerophthalmia, and several other nutritional disturbances are the result of deficiency of certain factors in the diet of animals and man, has been proven without a doubt. It has been con- </seg>
            <seg id="p610">610 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture clusively shown that a certain feed will substitute for another and pro - duce a normal growth or provide something that the other feed lacks, for instance yellow corn substituted for white corn overcomes difficulties which have been encountered because of the fat-soluble vitamin in the white corn. It is also known that the use of green feeds or cod-liver oil and light has had a very beneficial effect on animals receiving a ricket-producing ration. RICKETS Rickets is defined as a derangement of which the chief manifesta - tion is to be seen in the growing bone, in which there is an excessive and irregular development in its earlier stages with arrest or delay in the formation of fully formed, firm and normally calcified bone, or is the result of insufficient assimilation of calcium and phosphorus. Leg weaknesses in poultry, so called "rheumatism" marked by varying de - grees of stiff ness in either the front or hind quarters of hogs, larger head than normal, whole skin loose like a glove, the joints not firm or rigid as is found in children, are symptons of rickets. The bones are so soft that they can readily be cut with a knife, and bend very easily. Ninety per cent of 386 children that died in a German city before age of four had rickets, indicating that the disease has a very wide spread, not only in swine and poultry, but also in the human family. As early as 1890, Palon, became convinced that topographical regions caused variations in the prevalence of rickets. He observed that the disease was rare or entirely absent from regions receiving much sunlight and abundant where sunlight was less available. He therefore recom - mended that the use of sun baths be made, and that children suffering from rickets be removed as early as possible to localities where sunshine abounds. Also the intensity of ultra-violet solar radiation varies de - cidedly with the season of the year. Just how does sunlight prevent this disorder ? The germicidal prop - erties of light has been mentioned. It is also known that these ultra - violet ray perform chemically in a manner similar to many of the cataly - zers in the production of decomposition. The visible light rays are not, as a general rule, selectively absorbed by protoplasm, hence their action is superficial, however, ultra-violet rays are absorbed. Radiation of ultra-violet rays can penetrate a blood-filled tissue like the skin which is full of little blood vessels to a depth of only a fraction of a millimeter. Extensive penetration of these rays is not necessary, for an extremely small chemical change near the surface will have far - reaching influence upon the entire system. The blood capillaries ab - sorb these rays and distribute them to the entire body. This chem - ical change causes the body to become synthetic, or to have the power of making or "building up" of a compound by the union of simpler com- </seg>
            <seg id="p611">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association 611 pounds or its elements. This is just what takes place when rickets are prevented, or cured. These rays put the body in such a position that it takes the calcium and phosporous of the ration, provided they are supplied in feed, and from them makes normal bones. At Wisconsin two groups of 6 pigs each were fed a ration composed of yellow corn 97 parts, common salt 1 part, and lime two parts, plus four pounds of skimmed milk per pig per day. The other groups were fed the same except the ration includes white corn. One group of each had access to an out-door pen with direct exposure to the sun. The other two groups were kept in similar quarters except the pens were boarded up on all sides and roofed over to prevent the entrance of any sunlight. Stiffness appeared in the groups that were kept away from the sunlight, the white corn group were affected first. The animals exposed to the sun were normal in every way. At South Dakota during a feeding trial in the winter of 1923-24 and also during the winter of 1924-25, rickets had been observed among the pigs on experiment. This one lot which was kept inside receiving a ration of corn and buttermilk had made a total gain of 83 pounds in four weeks. In spite of this, their healthy appearance and all, these same p gs were showing pronounced signs of rickets. They were moved to another pen in the same barn with an outside lot opening to the south. At once their feed consumption continued and they came back to normal, seemingly recovered entirely. The results, which evidently happened by observation and were not planned, emphasizes the importance of direct sunlight in the production of farm animals. For the winter feeding of pigs, a proper arrangement of outdoor pens deserves perhaps as careful consideration as the selection of a ration or the kind of shelter provided. Direct Sunlight for Chicks Mussehl, of the Poultry Department of the University of Nebraska found that when chicks were exposed to direct unfiltered sunlight for an average period of 45 minutes daily, leg weakness symptoms were not evident and growth was apparently normal, but when checks were given the same ration in a well ventilated pen with light only through glass, leg weakness developed within four to eight weeks. These results explain the value of direct sunlight and shows that the ultra-violet rays, are re - moved by common window glass. That feeds may obtain properties to prevent rickets after exposure to sunlight or the quartz mercury lamp, which gives off ultra-violet rays, only, has been proven conclusively." It has been found that food stuffs which have been exposed and fed to animals will prevent rickets, while the same unexposed feeds will produce rickets. This has possibly very extensive practical value, especially in the curing of hays. Just </seg>
            <seg id="p612">612 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture what substances may be treated with success, and just what change takes place within the plant food is not known. The same practices which have developed from conclusions on sani - tation may also be partly attributed to the effects of normal growth and well-being of animals. That the windows be opened outward, that in - dividual house with high doors admitting sunlight to the far corners, substituted for the glass roof and the closed door house because of better results, that pigs be allowed outside in the winter months as much as possible, and early farrowed pigs be turned out on green pasture. It must be remembered that sunlight alone and mountain scenery will not make normal pigs. They require a well-balanced ration, supplying suf - ficient mineral, principally calcium and phosphorous which are usually the only lacking minerals of cereals and easily supplied by tankage, plenty of clean water, some common salt which is so essential to man, and clean surroundings will make a young pig grow and help lift the mortgage from the place. HOW I RAISE HOGS ERNEST TEMPLE, Seward In 1922 my pig crop was farrowed in my old hog house, and was al - lowed to run in the old hog yards. I had thirteen sows and they farrowed eighty-five pigs, of which 65 reached market age. They reached an aver - age weight of 215 pounds at ten months of age. In 1923 I built individual houses. I had ten sows, seven of which lost all their pigs about a month before farrowing time due to a severe HOG SANITATION LOT NO. 1 pig. 4 The pigs were farrowed out in Nebraska B'izzard Beater Hog Houses located on clean ground. </seg>
            <seg id="p613">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association 613 attack of flu. The remaining three sows farrowed 20 pigs, nineteen of which reached market age and attained an average weight of 250 pounds at seven months of age. These pigs were all raised on clean ground and were hand fed a balanced ration. My 1924 pig crop was raised on clean ground. Twelve sows farrowed 85 pigs and saved 79 of them. Their average weight at an age of 6% months was 217% pounds. These pigs were fed corn and tankage in self feeders. Their pasture consisted of alfalfa and Sudan grass. Now coming to my year of 1925. My equipment consisted of ten individual houses 7'x7'x5\ They are built on skids and are easily moved. I used an automatic drinking fountain and two self feeders. I raise high-grade Durocs with plenty of bone and size. I buy a pure-bred boar every year. The sows farrowed at about eleven months of age and weighed an average of about 375 pounds. They were fed corn, oats, leafy alfalfa, skim milk, and some tankage. Just enough corn to keep them gaining in weight. Grain was fed about sixty rods from the house to induce exercise which I consider essential in producing thrifty litters. About a week before farrowing the sows were moved to clean alfa'fa ground. The houses had been cleaned thoroughly. Each house was equipped with three 8-foot gates fastened to steel posts. Each sow was provided with a house and pen so as to become fully acquainted with her new quarters before farrowing. The houses were carefully banked with straw to prevent drafts as pigs arrived the latter part of February. As soon as the little pigs started to eat grain they were encouraged by placing shelled corn, oat flour, and shorts, tankage and skim milk in a creep. About two weeks after farrowing the sows were gradually allowed all the feed they would clean up and about one pound of tankage daily. The sows were taken from the pigs when, the pigs were about eight weeks old. The pigs were given a thorough oiling to prevent mange and lice. They were crowded into a small pen and oil applied with a sprinkling can. At a weight of about 50 pounds the pigs were vaccinated with double treatment to prevent cholera. Artificial shade was provided. These pigs were crowded for an early market and had access to corn and tankage in feeders, salt and mineral mixture, and plenty of alfalfa and Sudan pasture. Fresh water was furnished through a foun - tain attached to a supp'y tank. No slop was fed, and no capsules or condition powders were given. The results obtained in figures were as follows: Twelve sows farrowed 98 pigs of which 90 were weaned. Of this number one was lost from vaccination, two from injuries, three from the heat a weight of 250 pounds each. This left a total of 84 </seg>

I shipped 68 of them, weight 19,280 pounds and an average of 283% pounds each. The cost of the feed for the eighty-four head was as follows: 1500 bushels of corn at $1.00 $1500.00 2% tons of tankage 162.50 Vaccination 39.35 Mill feed and oats 43.50 Six acres of pasture at $5.00 30.00 Depreciation on equipment. 18.00 Total cost $1795.35 This covers the cost of producing 23,380 pounds, making a cost of $.076 per pound. These hogs were sold for $13.15 per hundred, leaving a net profit of $5.00 per hundred, or a net profit of $98.00 per sow. Comparing the results I got from pigs raised in the old house and yards with those obtained from pigs raised on clean, ground, I found that the 12 sows kept on clean ground produced 9,400 pounds more pork at 7 months of age than did the thirteen sows in the old yards at ten months of age. </seg>
            <seg id="p615">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association 615 SANITATION PAYS WELL MB. SANFORD BENSON Mr. Sanford Benson of Saronville, Nebr., led a very interesting dis - cussion on the subject of general practices on hog raising. Mr. Benson said that he first thought there was nothing to be gained from hog sanitation, but was forced to believe otherwise. He said his hogs would not grow and develop as they should in, his old hog yards — that they had rickets, and he had trouble with worms in his pigs. Mr. Benson now has small individual hog houses for his sows during farrowing time, these houses being set on clean ground, usually at the edge of his corn field because the sows kill out the alfalfa if he places them in the alfalfa pasture. He feeds them corn, tankage, and some good mineral feed. HOG LOT SANITATION NO. 4 Fig. 6 — Either a self-feeder or something in which grain may be stored are neces - sary out in the clean field. The pigs are never allowed to return to the old lots until they are at least four months of age. Mr. Benson gave some detailed facts about his 1925 pig crop, which weighed an average of 338 pounds at an average of eight months and six days. He said it seems a great trouble to move the houses out in the open, and to scrub the sows up clean, and all that, but he is firmly convinced that it pays. The discussion led by Mr. Benson showed very clearly that hog raisers everywhere are coming to the same conclusion in varying degrees, and that if we are to make money in hogs we must cut down the losses among the small pigs. An extra pig to the litter means so much clear profit on the upkeep of the sow, and it is up to hog raisers to save these extra pigs after they have farrowed, and take care of the sows beforehand so that they will farrow larger litters of healthy pigs. </seg>

The young men were introduced by their county agent, W. B. Adair, who spoke for a few minutes on the training and experience that the boys had had. The demonstration was very interesting, as the boys worked to - gether throughout, one demonstrating the features of the work that were being discussed by the other. They demonstrated different types of hog houses, pens, and equipment. They discussed various hog ail - ments and parasites, and their methods of meeting and eradicating these pests. They presented a very attractive appearance, and the'r work showed considerable hard work in the way of preparation. They answered many questions asked them by different men in the audience in a way that showed that they were thoroughly familiar with their subject, both from a theoretical and a practical standpoint. </seg>

Thursday Forenoon, January 7 Livestock Judging Pavilion CHAS. GRAFF, Bancroft, Chairman The cattle meeting was opened by an exhibition of the College show steers. The exhibition was very much enjoyed, and considerable interest was manifested in guessing the weight of the various animals as they were shown. There was quite as much variation as there was interest in the guesses. PRESIDING Charles Graff, Bancroft, Nebraska We will come to order and proceed with the regular program of the morning. We have met again to discuss some of the problems that the live- stock breeder of Nebraska is interested in. We have rather a full pro- gram and we hope that the principal speakers will realize that our time will be short and that we would like to have you fellows express your opinions, ask questions, and let us have a little roundtable dis- cussion over the problems that interest us. I think we can remain until 12:30 if necessary. The first speaker this morning drives around these parts on a family reputation; you know all about his brother, and you know his father, and so forth and so on. He gets the privilege of saying what a farmer can afford to pay for a good bull. I don't know what he knows about it, but I expect we will find out before long. His brother is interested in one of the largest newspapers in the country, and M» whole family is interested in farms and farm problems. </seg>
            <seg id="p619">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association 619 " A friend of mine named Wilson went out to get some first-hand information about how the farmers were getting along. The first fellow he came to looked at him and with no more ceremony about it said, 'It's none of your damn business.' So he moved on. The next fellow was too busy to find out how he was getting along. The third fellow says, 'I have done fairly well as a farmer, I have made $18,000 as a farmer." "How did you do that?" You know it isn't much of a story. I had a rich uncle out in Texas who was getting pretty old, and after looking around among his relatives he made out his will and left me $17,500, and there is $500 interest on it now." 'Laughter) Now, gentlemen, I want you to feel at home here this morning and push the meeting along as fast as we can. I have the pleasure of introducing Mr. Claude McKelvie of the Livestock Department of the Nebraska Farmer, Lincoln, Nebr. WHAT CAN YOU AFFORD TO PAY FOR A GOOD BULL? CLAUDE McKELVIE,, Lincoln, Nebr. I don't think Mr. Posson heard about the accident before he assigned me the subject he did. You know we were judging some Hereford steers yesterday in the judging contest. It seems as though there was one bull in the class but I didn't know the difference. However, I rather like the wording of the topic assigned to me. What can you afford to pay for a good bull? Breeders and stockmen are variously situated so that it makes a great difference in what you can afford to pay. The breed, quality, purpose for which he is intended. As a general statement, I will say that I do not know what you can afford to pay for a good bull, but I have more fixed ideas on some other points. I would say that a good Red Polled bull would be worth about $18.00, and a good Hereford might be worth as much as $25.00 or perhaps if he were extra good, about $30.00. (For the benefit of those not familiar with the reason for the above statement, it might be well to say that Mr. Charles Graff, the presiding officer, and Mr. H. J. Gramlich are well-known breeders of the two breeds referred to by Mr. McKelvie.) But to lead up to the major dairy and beef breeds of cattle. The facts all lead to the decision that it is quite apparent that in discussing this subject that it is very hard for me to state any maximum figure that we know would be the value of a good bull. Mr. Posson said he would like to have me bring out some figures, but I have found that there are not many farmers who keep figures, and I do not know where any real figures have been kept, except in one instance where a careful study was made to ascertain this very fact. </seg>
            <seg id="p620">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 620 Mr. W. R. Nelson, late editor of the Kansas City Star, bought about 1700 acres of land in Missouri for the purpose of demonstrating that the average farmer could produce marketable steers by breeding pure-bred bulls to common cows. This experiment showed very definitely that the herd could be built up wonderfully through the use of good bulls. (Mr. McKelvie read a descriptive pamphlet giving the actual figures as com - piled over a period of years at this farm started by Mr. Nelson and continued since his death.) It must be taken into consideration that this was something of an experiment, and that Mr. Nelson had all the money he needed for the purpose. With him it was rather a hobby than a purely business prop - osition, and he had plenty of money to pay for any bull he might have wished to purchase — most of us do not, and the average farmer does not. In classifying the buyers of pure-bred bulls we have to consider the proposition from different angles. Take the range man. Mr. Carna - han of Kiowa County, Colorado, told me that he had not paid less than $1000 for a bull. He is a big ranchman and specializes in cattle. The exclusive breeders, any number -of them in this state, cannot afford to stint in the price they pay for a bull. From these fellows we go on to the fellow with only a few cows. From his standpoint I think that he might afford to pay twice the market price. I do not believe that is too much. My experience in talking with breeders has been that fre - quently good animals do not bring what they are worth because they are not in good condition. The average buyer can afford to pay about what the breeders are asking, because they are not, as a rule, exorbitant in their demands. With the dairy cattle bulls have a somewhat better showing, I think largely because better records have been kept. I can give you two concrete illustrations: In 1914 I was sent to Texas to buy steers for our county. One bunch I saw was priced at $38.00 per head. I thought I might. get them a a little cheaper. An - other bunch I had priced to me at $26.00 per head. The only difference between the care those two bunches had had was in the selection of the herd bulls. The first man said he had never paid less than $350.00 for a bull, the second said he had never seen a bull that was worth more than $75.00. The second week in August I was in Kansas City. There was one bunch of 3-year-olds. I passed them up. Across from that lot were some 2-year-olds. The 3-year-olds sold for $38.00 a head, and the 2-year-olds at $92.00. The 2-year-olds sired by pure-bred bulls sold for more than twice as much as those sired by the cheaper grade bulls. </seg>
            <seg id="p621">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association 621 CAN THE EASTERN NEBRASKA FARMER RAISE BABY BEEVES AT A PROFIT? This is a pretty serious question: and one that you are confronted with every year. During the last four or five years when you could buy good calves anywhere from $30.00 to $40.00 I would say that it is almost impossible to compete with such prices here. The tide is turning the other way now. The ranchman is getting more for his calves, and you are going to have to pay more for them. A ranchman cannot raise them for less than $30.00 and break even. What are our possibilities? I believe we have pretty nearly got to have some special method of getting rid of our calves. We can not plan to sell them in small lots right off the grass to feeders because feeders cannot afford to pay us enough for them. Some of the following plans may prove to be good. First: Have them come early to give them a good growth and sell them off their mothers in the fall. That method has been used in Nebraska by some farmers in the western part of the state. The calves were sold in September the week of State Fair and went to the killer without a kernel of corn in them. These farmers take good care of their calves and take good care of their cows in the winter, and all the rest of the year for that matter. I doubt very much the wisdom of this policy in Nebraska. Second: The next alternative would be to have creeps in the pasture, feed the calves grain and sell them off their mothers weigh - ing about 600 pounds apiece in the fall, after having had access to grain all season. The thing that is necessary is that you have some - where near a load of these calves, because they do not sell so well in small lots. Third: To take calves at weaning time and put them on relatively full feed and sell them when they are about a year old. I think that offers quite a little in the way of possibilities. You can more likely get your own calves ready for the market sooner than the range calves you buy in the fall. Fourth: Take the calves when you wean them in the fall, feed them a light feed of grain and grass them the next year and market them in the fall after having fed them grain during the summer. I think this is a good plan. The prices are about the best during the year. What are the necessities: One should have a good sire. You must get a uniform bunch of calves and a bunch that will finish young. I have heard that the herd bull is one-half the herd, but I have almost come to the conclusion that the bull is about 95% of the herd. Prob- PROFESSOR H. J. GRAMLICH, Ag. College. </seg>
            <seg id="p622">622 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture ably even more necessary than that is that you have roughage or pasture for the cows, the calves do not eat much at first. The problem of providing feed for the calves is not so great but we must have a means of feeding the cows cheaply and keeping them in good shape. Some use corn-stalk fields to a very good advantage. I think we can genera'ly use them to advantage in Nebraska. During the summer months the feed is a big problem. I think the solution of the problem is the use of sweet clover and sudan grass combination during the season. The Blue Grass does not grow so that it can be used during the greater part of the season — that is, it cannot be pastured heavily enough to insure any profit, particularly during the part of the summer that we need it most. Even where they have lots of permanent pasture they are using more sweet clover and sudan grass. Our problem here is one of securing pasture. On dry pasture the cows will not give the milk nor grow the calves as they should. I may be wrong, but I really feel that we can look for possibilities in this direction at least. I believe that we can produce baby beeves successfully here if we use all the resources we can bring to bear on the matter. Question: Why is the silo not used more? Answer: So far we have not had to use it. We have alfalfa and sweet clover. But alfalfa is becoming so expensive that we are going to have to do something unless we can get it, or produce it cheaper. Question: At what age will the calf take to feeding out of the creep ? Answer: When he is a few weeks old. We feed some mixture of corn and oats, or equal parts of oats, corn, and bran. Sometimes you can get them to eating in a very few days, if you are specially careful and painstaking in starting them. Question: Is Sudan Grass hard on the land? Answer: It is hard on the moisture in the land. Professor Burr says it is a problem of soil mixture, not one of soil fertility. LIVESTOCK DISEASE PROBLEMS ON THE AVERAGE FARM DR. L. V. SKIDMORE, Ag. College One of the main reasons why so many farmers do not make a profit handling livestock on the average farm is on account of losses from animal diseases. There was a time when the loss of a cow or a few hogs did not affect the farmer's pocket book. However, conditions have changed. The farmer is working on a smaller margin of profit and to-day the loss of a single steer or two hogs or even a few dozen chickens may determine whether his farming business is or is not a profitable pursuit. </seg>
            <seg id="p623">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association 623 To-day, on the average farm in Nebraska you will find besides a great big mortgage, horses, cattle, hogs, sheep, and poultry. Some diseases affect any one or all of these animals, however, usually each species of animals have diseases peculiar to themselves. What Is Disease? What is disease? It is a condition where the various parts of the body machinery are not working in harmony. Something has been introduced into or upon the animal body that affects its normal and vital functions. BCLLNOSE Fig. 9 — A disease that originates under unsanitary conditions. Sanitation will prevent great losses from this disease. We have in the past looked upon disease with a great deal of super - stitution and misconception. For instance, you perhaps are acquainted with some fellows in your neighborhood who carry buck-eyes or small potatoes in their pockets to keep away rheumatism. Others who pour sulphur into the ears of a horse to cure it of colic or bellyache. I have known of some men who poured ground up glass into the ears of horses to cure them of fistula of the withers. Now there is no logical reason why diseases should be so mysterious and mystifying in this day and age, because in many diseases the exact cause has been found. We know that when a cow does not chew her cud, so to say, that her digestive apparatus is not working normally. A fellow might be in the same predicament after eating a big Thanksgiving dinner. He may not want to eat any food for some time afterwards and in the meantime may have the attendance of two or three physicians. There is a cause for every ailment and disease of animals. Such conditions do not spring up spontaneously. They did not "just happen. 1 ' </seg>
            <seg id="p624">624 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Sometiires you cannot find the exact cause for the presence of disease among your livestock any more than you can find the party who may steal your chickens. You are not always aware and a witness to the beginning of disease in your livestock. This point reminds me of the story of the negro who was being tried for stealing chickens. During the trial the negro appeared somewhat excited. The judge said " Sambo, do you have any witnesses to plead for you in this case?" Whereupon Sambo replied, "No Sir, Judge, I never steal chickens in the presence of witnesses." Disease Must Have a Cause Animals to become affected with disease must come in contact with the agent or thing that causes the disease. You can disc, plow, harrow, and cultivate a piece of land ever so well, but you could never grow a corn crop on such a land until you planted corn in this field at the right season of the year. The same condition is true of an'mal diseases. They must be in some way introduced into the animals of your herds and flocks in order to gain a foothold. Where the cause of a disease is definitely known, its prevention and eradication is greatly facilitated. There are some diseases against which there have been perfected absolute specifics. However, thus far, the greatest success of disease control is brought about by preventive measures. Now let us mention briefly some of the most common diseases found in our domestic animals. On the average farm in Nebraska we find the most common diseases amongst swine to be: Hog Cholera Round Worms Pig Typhoid Tuberculosis Bull Nose Lice and Mange Hog cholera is responsible for the loss of 90% of the deaths among swine. The loss from this disease alone amounts to $30,000,000 to $40,000,000 annually. There was a time when the raising of hogs was more or less a gamble on account of this disease. Today this disease can be absolutely controlled by vaccination. It is the cheapest insurance against hog cholera and one of the surest ways of allowing the pig crop to be marketed. Sanitation Is Valuable Pig typhoid, bullnose, and round worm infestation are filth born diseases and their presence is due to negligence of proper swine manage - ment. Such diseases can be prevented by cleaning the sows and farrow - ing pens then hauling the sows and pigs to pastures away from the old hog lots until the pigs are at least four months old. When pigs are four months old they are very resistant to these diseases and at this age they may be taken to the old hog lots and fed out with but very little danger. The farmers in Nebraska who have tried this system of raising pigs have banished the thumps and runts and a larger per </seg>
            <seg id="p625">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association 625 cent of the pigs farrowed are raised to maturity from fewer sows. The pigs require less feed per pound of gain to get to market weight, and do so four to six weeks earlier and are therefore more profitable. Tuberculosis is a rather common disease amongst swine in Ne - braska, being present in nearly 14% of the hogs. The losses from this disease alone amount to $1,000,000 in our state. Recent research work at the Nebraska Experiment Station shows that nearly 89% of the hogs having tuberculosis contract this disease from poultry. In the eradica - tion of this disease we thus see that the segregation of "biddy hen'' must be given serious consideration in the future if tuberculosis is to be eradicated from swine. The lice and mange mite are perhaps the most common external parasites on swine. Their control and eradication is accomplished by means of dipping and the application of oils and crude petroleum. Common Cattle Ailments Let us now consider some of the most common diseases found in cattle on the average farm in Nebraska. Among these we might men - tion blackleg, bloat, cornstalk disease and abortion disease. Blackleg is prevented by vaccination which has been thorough'y tried and proven to be effective. Repeated vaccinations year after year has to a great extent been responsible for the suppression of th : s disease. The bloating of cattle and sheep is a common condition observed in these animals on the farm. This condition is characterized by an abnormal collection of gas in the first stomach or paunch. It is usual y caused by the rapid and excessive fermentation of the green plant foods taken into the stomach. Such plants as red clover, sweet clover and alfalfa especially when wet, by dew or rain, seem especially apt to cause bloat. Prevention consists in gradually getting the animals ac - customed to such feeds. Do not turn the animals on new pastures until the dew is gone and not too soon after a rain. If the animals are fed heavily a few times before they are turned on new pastures, bloat ng is not likely to occur. Cornstalk Disease So-called cornstalk disease comes up for discussion nearly every fall. The exact cause of this condition is not fully understood. Various theories have been advanced in an attempt to explain this condifon. To make a proper study of this condition would require a vast sum of money, hundreds of acres of land and a large number of animals. And with all those things I am not so sure that our means of preventing cornstalk disease would be very much different than they are at the present time. The best advice we can offer at this time is to first turn into the fields a few of the least valuable animals and see how they fare. If all goes well, in ten days or two weeks more animals may be turned into the fields. It is always a risky proposition to throw open the gates and allow all the animals to have access to the cornfield. However, fields that are dangerous in the early fall may later be entirely safe. Some changes take place that make such fields harmless to the animals. </seg>
            <seg id="p626">626 Report of Nebraska State Board op Agriculture Abortion Is Serious We now come to the subject of abortion disease. This perhaps is the most damaging and dangerous disease of our cattle industry. Some livestock men have gone bankrupt because of the presence of this di - sease in their herds. Where the breeding efficiency is normally 90% to 100% the presence of abortion disease in a herd will reduce the breeding efficiency 60% to 75% to say nothing of the loss of calret and milk. The presence of this disease in a herd is manifested by the animals giving birth to dead or improperly developed off-spring. Even if the calf is born alive it is usually weak and readily contracts such diseases as pneumonia and scours. The retention of the afterbirth in the heifer or cow is a common condition observed in herds affected with infectious abortion and should always be looked upon with great concern by the livestock owner. Abortion disease in most cases is caused by a specific organism or germ, the Bacillus Bang. We too often want to attribute the act of an abortion to some mechanical cause or injury. It is true that this is possible, but the safest plan is always to regard every abortion as due to infectious germs until proven otherwise. All types and breeds of cattle are susceptible to the disease, how - ever, it is most prevalent in heifers. There is a rather common belief that pure bred cattle are more subject to the disease than scrubs or grades, but such statements are not founded upon facts. Cattle most often abort during the 6th, 7th, or 8th month of pregnancy, however, it may occur at any time during the period of gestation. Cattle that have aborted or retain their afterbirth should be placed in strict quarantine for at least two months and should not be bred again until all signs of discharge have disappeared. It is a common observation that when a period of three to four months intervenes be - tween the act of abortion and breeding that the animals are more likely to conceive. The reason for placing an aborting animal in strict quarantine is to prevent such animal from transmitting the disease to other pregnant animals in the herd. Research work shows that abortion disease is most often contracted by animals eating or drinking foods infected by the vaginal discharges and aborted fetus. Thus when a diseased animal is completely separated from the other animals in the herd there will be no danger of contami - nating the feed or water that is received by the animals in the healthy herd. There is no cure known for this disease. Strict hygiene and sani - tary measures are the most important measures of prevention and control. If you have a clean herd you should guard with great caution the possible introduction of this disease into your healthy herd. When buying animals from a strange herd the per cent of calf </seg>
            <seg id="p627">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association 627 crop in that herd is perhaps the best index to the presence of abortion disease. If the buyer's herd is a valuable one, it would be well to buy the animals subject to the serological or abortion test. Cleanliness is one of the biggest factors in the control of this disease. Absolute destruction of all infectious materials from diseased animals and the liberal application of disinfectants to the stables where diseased animals are quarantined are measures that should be strictly observed. Other animals such as swine, sheep, and horses may become affected with abortion diseases. The prevention and treatment of these animals are practically the same as for cattle. Preventative Measures Are Gaining Ground In conclusion, I might say that a new era of animal hygiene and sanitation is being entered upon. Scientific study is being made of animal surroundings. We are endeavoring to appreciate more fully the advantages of preventive measures over the old time "cure policy." The advice and services of your veterinarian will be of great help to you in solving the problems of disease control. Those breeders who continue to look forward to the discovery of remedies and cures by those persons who have no conception of the exact nature of animal diseases will remain in darkness so far as the control of many of our animal disease problems are concerned. THE FUTURE OF THE BEEF CATTLE INDUSTRY DR. C. W. McCAMPBELL, Manhattan, Kansas In the future I believe the man in the corn belt is going to confine himself to finishing cattle that someone else has raised. The man in the southwest is going to raise cattle for someone else to feed. Times have changed. The west is beginning to cut a little on its beef supply. In the southwest and the corn belt we have a fine combination of raising, growing, and finishing for market, but in the main our efforts are confined to putting growth on these younger cattle and passing them on to someone else to finish. In Kansas we have a slightly different situation than you do here in Nebraska. We have long season, and generally I believe we have a younger class of cattle and send them off and let someone else finish them for market. Last year I got a man to buy fifteen hundred head of calves and bring them up to Kansas with him. He got these calves wintered for $11.00 a head. In the spring these calves were turned out on grass. They made a good growth. This fall he marketed them off this grass and received $56.00 a head for them, which made him a return of $11.00 per head for the grass they used. The actual figures show that he exactly doubled his income off his land by feeding calves. He is now sold on the proposition of raising calves for someone else to feed. </seg>
            <seg id="p628">628 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Fig. 10 — Nebraska ranks high in cattle production. Her sandhill country with it? lakes, good grass, and hay meadows is one of the greatest cattle producing; sections in the entire world. This shows the change that is taking place in our country. We must handle cattle in such a way that we can sell this grass and rough - age with a minimum amount of grain. For many years they have been telling our wheat farmers to diversify. We are trying to figure out a grain crop that we can sell through our cattle. We are not interested so much in the matter of roughage. I want to give you the results we have secured, and I want to say a word about silage. Your alfalfa is all right here, but what about the fellow who cannot raise alfalfa ? And even if he could raise it, it is getting so high priced that he could not afford to feed it. He can cut some of his corn field and make si' age out of it much more cheaply. There are only two or three reasons I ever heard advanced against the silo. In the first place a good many men have an idea that there is only one week in a year that you can fill a silo. At our station we have but three silos, and they are not large enough to handle our requirements for the entire season, so we have to refill them, and the best silage we ever had we put in, the silo in February one year. Another reason offered is that we have to have so much help. The best system we have in filling our silos is by the use of a two-man crew. And then some farmers get scared about what it will cost. This is because they do not go into it very deeply? Our silage cost us about 73c per ton to put in last year. During the rest of his talk Dr. McCampbell used a very good collection of charts showing the results of feeding experiments conducted at his station. The results were very interesting from the standpoint of feeding on pasture. The various lots had been fed for a term of years and sold. The figures on these experiments can probably be se - cured by addressing Dr. McCampbell, at the College of Manhattan, Kansas. </seg>

A motion was made that the secretary be tendered an official thank you for his work in connection with the work of the Annual Meetings of Organized Agriculture and the Annual Banquet. Seconded, and carried. Mr. H. J. McLaughlin, State Secretary of Agriculture discussed the future work of this organization. He stressed particularly work which might be done in connection with war on scrub cattle. C. B. Steward, Secretary of the Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation, discussed, pro and con, the organization of a " Promotion Society " similar to what is known as the "Nebraska Dairy Development Society." He forwarded some excellent arguments both in favor of and against such a society organized to promote better meat producing livestock. F. C. Crocker of Beatrice discussed the possibility of advertising thru directories, etc. Professor Gramlich took up the matter of a directory and expressed his belief that the directory was not an efficient method of getting in - formation before the public because of the great amount of work and expense of issuing such a publication which at best would be rather incomplete.

            <seg id="p632">632 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture seemed to bring out the quite general belief that a more logical way would be to add another man to the College extension force, to work thru organizations already existing. Mr. Weyland Magee then offered his belief that the Breeders Or - ganization, as a whole, was dying of creeping paralysis because it had nothing to do and nothing to do with. He further stated that he had a dream which ran somewhat as follows: "Why could not registration of all breeds be handled here in the state, and the funds from registry be applied on overhead expenses for important development work?" Mr. C. B. Steward then informed those present how the plan sug - gested by Mr. Magee had been attempted in Ohio and Kentucky, but had failed in both places. It was suggested that Mr. Graff take these matters before the State Board of Agriculture for their careful consideration in hopes that some development helpful to the livestock industry might develop. Dr. Hays, State Veterinary, was then called upon by Mr. Graff for a few words. Probably no man in the state realizes more fully what the Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders Association has done the last three or four years than does Dr. Hayes. He lauded the work already done by the Association, giving some of its prominent members nearly entire credit for present tubercular legislation in Nebraska. He also went on to say that this association was entirely justified if all they did was to throw their strength in favor of sensible livestock legislation. Meeting was adjourned at 11:00 p.m. </seg>

Very respectfully, H. O. WERNER, Secretary. </seg>
            <seg id="p640">640 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture THURSDAY AFTERNOON SESSION November 12, 1925 The Ninth Annual Convention of the Nebraska Potato Improvement Association met in the Fraternity Hall at Kimball, on Thursday, Novem - ber 12, 1925, and was called to order by the Vice-President, Mr. J. Ped - rett, of Kimball, at 1:30 P. M. CHAIRMAN PEDRETT: First we will call on Reverend Wilcox to say a few words to us at this time. A FRIENDLY GREETING REV. J. H. WILCOX, Pastor Methodist Episcopal Church, Kimball Mr. Pedrett has asked me to say a few words. The Mayor is here to give the Address of Welcome. I am very glad to be here in a com - munity enterprising enough to have a potato convention. I think we all realize that back of everything else lies the soil. We are dependent upon agriculture. Some years ago I went to a Grange Hall in Michigan and preached one Sunday afternoon. They had a sign which read: "The Farmer Feeds Them All." There were not any farmers in that community but who were conscious of the other fact: "The Farmer Needs Them All." We are sort of a co-operative company. While we are dependent upon the soil, we are also dependent upon methods of distribution and upon the commercial system of the day. We ought to be glad to rejoice in each other's success. There can be no true prosperity, in this country, especially, without the success of the farmer. Of course I am a preacher and you will excuse this, but I think the farmers ought all to be religious, living in God's great outdoors and seeing the wonderful miracle of Nature each year in the growth of the things in the field. It seems as if the farmer, especially, ought to be a devout man. I remember calling upon an old Scotchman in Michigan. There was something about his early life that had soured him on the churches. He showed me a stalk of wheat, and pointing to what I call its "elbow", he said: "Talk about the farmers. Why, when a man looks at that joint he knows there is some great Divine purpose behind the universe — just as if everything had been planned for man's comfort and strength." I think that is true. "Whatever decks the velvet field, Whate'er the circling seasons yield, Whatever buds, whatever blows, For you it buds; for you it grows." </seg>
            <seg id="p641">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 641 As a rule, I believe the fanner is a devout man, because I find so many of the choicest of the earth out in the country, in school district or church. So I have always had a friendly feeling for the farmer. As I am not on your program, it would not be fair for me to take up any more time. I am glad to greet you, and I truly appreciate this opportunity Mr. Pedrett has given me of saying these few words. I hope you will have a fine convention; that everything will turn out well; and because of the success of the potato growers this year, that not everybody will go into it next year. If they do not, you will have a chance to duplicate your success. I suppose that is one of the problems before you — what and how much to raise. I am not a farmer, so I can not say as to that. I thank you. (Applause). CHAIRMAN PEDRETT Next we will call on our Mayor, who is also our representative, Mr. Reader. (Applause). ADDRESS OF WELCOME HON. FRANK E. READER, Mayor, Kimball, Nebraska Mr. President, Members of the Nebraska Potato Improvement Association, Ladies and Gentlemen: I have no alibi for not being prepared, because Secretary Werner notified me some time ago what I would be expected to do. It would seem I should be in as good a con - dition as the farm hand who observed his employer coming from the house with a suspicious looking jug which he concealed in a shock of oats. After the farmer was out of sight on his binder, the farm hand investigated and found the jug to be full of hootch. He was about to take a swig when he saw a rattlesnake all coiled ready for business. He said: "Strike, confound you; strike! You will never find me better prepared than I am right now!" (Laughter). It is a pleasure and privilege to greet you with a few words, and I may throw in a few boastful remarks about ourselves. I heard of an official who, on greeting a convention, said: "Ladies and Gentlemen: It is my duty to greet you. It seems to me whenever these fellows have any disagreeable job to do, they make me do it." (Laughter). That is not the case in this instance. It is easy to be whole-hearted and spontaneous when you know those in attendance have come for a purpose, and that we whose guests you are will receive many times the value of our meager entertainment. Your specific purpose is the improvement of the Nebraska potato and all of the kindred con - nections and ramifications that go with this industry. Kimball county at the present time is in a generally good condi - tion, and we attribute our present prosperity to a great extent to the potato industry. </seg>
            <seg id="p642">642 Repobt of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture In order that you may get together and exchange your ideas and experiences, it is necessary for you to meet some place to do that work. We are highly complimented to have Kimball chosen as the city for this, your ninth annual convention. • We who live in Kimball live here from choice. We like our sur - roundings. We have a fine citizenship throughout the county. Our sur - roundings are of the best. We have fine roads. We are on a fine rail - road. We are surrounded by thousands of acres of rich land, the pos - sibilities of which are scarcely touched. It might be well to state the eggs produced in Nebraska are of more value than the citrus crop of California; and the products of the sand hills of Nebraska are of more value than the entire crop of Florida. When we become organized and developed in the potato industry, it looks like hard times for California and Florida. We have no pay roll, and the churches and schools and business houses and dwellings are absolutely the products of the soil. We pay our preachers real money. Our churches are free from debt. The city itself is on a cash basis. We have no outstanding warrants. In the last five years, instead of creating new bond issues, we have retired 850,000 of those already created. The entire indebtedness of Kimball county is eight mills on its valuation, and the entire indebtedness of our school district is 5 mills. We have some poor farmers, but we do rot have any farm for the poor. (Laughter). We are glad to have you visit us in our home town. Remember although our doors are broad, our hearts are broader. If we had keys, we would give them to you. We trust your stay here will be instructive and beneficial, and that the friendships you make will be many and lasting. I thank you. (Applause). CHAIRMAN PEDRETT: We will now have the report of our Secretary, Professor Werner, ANNUAL REPORT OF SECRETARY-TREASURER H. O. WERNER, Lincoln, Nebraska I have not very much to report. I remember very pleasantly that in 1923 I had to account for something like $12,000 in this organization treasury, as the certification funds were then handled through the Treasurer of the Nebraska Potato Improvement Association. I think I had the balance within five cents, and we have never found that nickel. (Laughter). Now we only have our membership fund to account for, and the members have not been any too busy in paying up their dues; so we do not have a big bank account. The balance, according to the auditing statement of Dec. 1, was $231.62 The receipts during the last year are listed in detail in the ac- </seg>
            <seg id="p643">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 643 count book I have with me which is available for the Audit- Our state fund, which is administered by the State Board of Agri- culture, is more or less a variable amount, depending upon the needs of our own and similar organizations. The expenditures from December 1, "last, yftar, to November 6, this year, including $120 of advance ex - penses for this convention have been $1,518.11. That is more than we have ever spent in one year out of the state fund. In many previous years we have not used our total allotment, and that is probably why the Board of Agriculture has not said anything about this slight over- draft. That is all I have to report at this time. I shall be glad to turn over my accounts to the Auditing Committee. The expenses of this Show run into a considerable amount of money. We have been trying to bring in the men from the various other states adjoining us, or from any state where we think they may have some way of doing things from which we might learn. Consequently the railroad fare runs into considerable money in a short time, and the ex - pense accounts get to be quite an item. In the hopes of building up a better Show, we have been offering liberal prizes, and the premium money takes up a considerable amount. Most of the money spent in the course of a year has been expended for those two items. The print - ing of the report is taken care of out of the printing fund of the State Board of Agriculture. It is not charged to us at the present time. Being directly in charge of the 0. K.-ing of all the bills, I feel considerable responsibility for these funds. The only thing I regret about the work of the Association is that the attendance at our meetings is so small on the part of the potato growers of western Nebraska. It makes me feel rather embarrassed when I have to make an accounting. Of course the membership represents more than so many individuals, because you men go back home and spread the news, and your neighbors adopt practices which you suggest. Still, we could go forward faster if each would do as requested in our program, and bring in one new member. I do not know whether any of you did that this year. If this Association is to be to western Nebraska what it should be — a leading force in agriculture in this part of the state — then you must get behind it not only by absorbing what you can out of these meetings, but get your neighbors out, especially some who do not have very much ing Committee. They total $281.59 (This sum does not represent that many memberships how- ever). This makes the total credits $513.21 The total expenditures were 277.78 Leaving a balance in the treasury of $235.43 </seg>
            <seg id="p644">644 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture faith in the proposition because of ignorance of it. It also means the better support of our Show. We might just as well do the thing right while we are at it. I see no reason why we should not have as many people at all our meetings as we had at Chadron two years ago. We had three times as many as last year or this. That is a thing the Sec - retary can not take care of. If you want to. have a good organization to foster the potato business, you must get behind it with a little more individual sense of responsibility. There is another fact that I should like to mention, that is that the impression is prevalent in western Nebraska that this organization is interested only in certified seed potato growers; consequently all un - certified seed growers take it for granted they are not wanted. I have tried by voluminous correspondence, personal conversation, and a good many other contacts to disillusion people of this idea and impress upon them this Association is for all the potato industry — not only the po - tato growers. It is for the entire potato industry of western Nebraska, whether growers or dealers or consumers; but primarily for the pro - ducers and dealers. We should like to have wider interest among those people. In your contracts I think it would be well to impress upon them they are losing out. We have put special features on the program that we thought would be of interest to the noncertified growers, only to have those features fall flat, with none of the noncertified growers present. We have a dis - cussion on this question later in the program, and I am bringing the ideas to you at this time so that you will be thinking about them. To - morrow morning we hope you will be prepared to give us some ideas, and see what we can do to make this organization a more active one, spreading out and getting new members all the time. (Applause). CHAIRMAN PEDRETT: I will appoint some committees at this time. NOMINATING COMMITTEE— Frank Rowly, W. L. Hawk. AUDITING COMMITTEE— Fred Taylor, Gus Forsling. Next we will have "Results of Recent Investigations on Potato Diseases," by Dr. Goss. He is always trying to find something worse than what we have. (Laughter). Dr. Goss. (Applause). RESULTS OF RECENT INVESTIGATIONS ON POTATO DISEASES DR. R. W. GOSS Associate Plant Pathologist, University of Nebraska It becomes increasingly difficult to attend these meetings every year without repeating the same story over and over again. That is why we have to find new diseases to tell you about! A good many of you have heard me talk about potato diseases a number of times, and many are familiar with most of the serious potato diseases we have in west - ern Nebraska. I do not want to take up a great deal of time going over </seg>
            <seg id="p645">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 645 that information. I think I can start in, assuming you know the symp - toms of most of these diseases and something about their control; but there are a few points we can still talk about. A good many of you men know that there are control methods rec - ommended in other states which are not recommended here in Nebraska. Some of you know that with the control methods we do recommend you do not always get the same results year after year, but that they may vary. Many are acquainted with the fact that in certain seasons one disease will be very important, causing severe losses, and the next year it may be of minor importance. You have probably wondered why these things happen, and I think it would be worth while to discuss some of these points at this time. There is a great deal of investigational work as you know, being conducted in the United States on potato diseases, and I wish to mention a few of the many results obtained by different workers in relation to our problems here in Nebraska. It will possibly give you a clearer un - derstanding of these diseases, and explain some of these apparent dis - crepancies just mentioned. Scab The first disease I want to take up is one with which you are familiar — too familiar — common scab. You know that the amount of scab will vary year by year. Most of you know that common scab is caused by an organism which lives on the seed tuber and in the soil, and that you may get infection from either source. This does not mean that if you plant scabby potatoes you will always produce scabby po - tatoes. However, planting such seed is like touching a match to a straw stack and hoping it won't burn up. There are various factors that determine whether or not infection will occur. The organism causing scab is favored by an alkaline soil. This means that scab is a problem in western Nebraska, because the soil here is alkaline in nature. It has also been found by various in - vestigators that the organism causing the disease is favored by dry soil. That also means you can expect to have scab in western Nebraska. In - vestigations have been made on the relation of temperature to this dis - ease, chiefly in Wisconsin and Minnesota. It has been found the disease has its optimum at a temperature of 68° to 73° Fahrenheit. It is a high-temperature disease. In western Nebraska we have a temperature averaging above 70° — an ideal condition for scab infection. We have there a combination of environmental factors determining whether or not scab will occur even when the organism is present, i. e. temperature, moisture, and alkalinity of the soil. The young tissue in the tuber is the most susceptible to scab. Up to the time the tuber is one-half to three-quarters of an inch in size it is more susceptible than later on. If you have a retardation followed by a second growth the new tissue will again be more susceptible to new scab infection than the older tissue. The temperature and moisture </seg>
            <seg id="p646">646 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture conditions during the first six weeks of tuber formation will determine to a great extent whether or not scab will occur even if it is in the soil. There is a distinct scab problem under irrigation, because of the different practices used, as regards the number of irrigations and the amount of water applied at each application. While we do not have a great deal of experimental data available on the effects of different ir - rigation practices on the amount of scab it has been found that a num - ber of light irrigations results in a more uniform continuous growth throughout the season, with less scab resulting than if a few heavy applications are made. Some of you know that in certain sections of the United States, sulphur is used on the soil to control potato scab. You may have won - dered why we do not use it here. The action of sulphur in the soil re - sults in s decrease in the alkalinity to a point unfavorable for the growth of the organism which causes this disease. Our soil is so al - kaline that we could not practically apply enough sulphur to control the disease. In the eastern part of the United States, and even in eastern Nebraska, good results can be obtained by the use of sulphur. In eastern United States, from three hundred to six hundred pounds per acre will control the scab, but in western Nebraska this amount would not decrease the alkalinity of our soils to a point effective in the control of scab. Another method of controlling scab is rotation of crops. We recom - mend a long rotation, because if you have scab in the soil and potatoes are planted the next year there is a great source of infection and the soil infestation becomes worse. At the Mitchell substation under irri - gation and with a four-year rotation, where potatoes followed alfalfa, there was not only a greater yield, but a decrease in the amount of scab to a great extent. In short rotations or where potatoes followed potatoes ,the scab reached such proportions that the crop was a failure. Before taking up other control methods for scab, I should like to mention another potato disease, Rhizoctonia. Rhizoctonia You are more or less familiar with this disease. It produces three distinct types of trouble. One is an infection early in the season where the organism kills off the growing point of the sprout. In the second type, a later infection results in a girdling of the underground stem of the plant and this is shown above ground by a rosetting of the tops. The third type is characterized by the black spots on the tuber with which you are familiar. They resemble dirt, but do not wash off. Rhizoctonia is transmitted on the seed and in the soil. In studying this disease and the conditions under which it occurs in other states, they have found that the temperature relations were entirely different from those just given for scab. It is comparatively a low-temperature dis - tase, and works best at a mean daily temperature of about 64° F. </seg>
            <seg id="p647">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 647 The type of early infection where you have killing of the sprout and a resulting poor stand is most favored by a temperature of 59° or below. Above 70° F. you do not get a great deal of Rizoctonia. When we have cold spells early in the year you are apt to get Rhizoctonia, and date of planting will have a great deal of effect upon the amount of Rhizoctonia The temperature during the first six weeks after planting will determine the amount of growing point injury. Usually we do not get a great deal of that type in Nebraska. In Kansas and some other states it is a serious problem. During the past summer we had considerable late infection during a period of cool weather and as a result there was a much greater amount of girdling of stems and rosetting of the tops than we usually have in Nebraska. I have mentioned the use of sulphur and rotation of crops for con - trol of scab. We also have the common seed treatments for control of both scab and Rhizoctonia before planting. There has also been some work done recently on the use of dust treatments to replace the liquid treatments, i. e. a treatment somewhat similar to the dust treatments for the control of wheat smut, but using an organic mercuric compound instead of a copper dust. So far the results have been favorable with one or two dusts. They are high priced at present and it is not a prac - tical proposition to use them but they are still in the experimental stage and if a good dust treatment can be devised for use on either cut or uncut seed, it will have distinct advantages and will possibly be priced so that it will be a profitable treatment. We hope to test out some of these treatments here in Nebraska next year. In regard to the formaldehyde and corrosive sublimate treatments, cold formaldehyde will control scab but it is not effective in the control of Rhizoctonia; therefore we have not recommended it in this state. The formula is one pint of formaldehyde to thirty gallons of water for two hours. It is not poisonous, the solution does not weaken, and it does not corrode metal, thus having these advantages over corrosive sublimate where Rhizoctonia is not a serious problem. In recent years a modification of the above method has developed in Iowa, and is now being used in a good many states, known as the hot formaldehyde method. This increases its efficiency in the control of Rhizoctonia. With hot formaldehyde two pints are used to thirty gallons of water and the seed is treated two minutes at a temperature from 118° to 120° F. In Kansas thdy use that treatment for three minutes at a Temperature from 124° to 126° F. This is because in treating in sacks, it takes a certain length of time for the potatoes in the center to come to the temperature of those on the outside. We have not recommended that treatment here for various reasons. The advantages are obvious — a treatment of two minutes instead of two hours is a great saving in time. The disadvantage lies in the fact that the seed can be damaged by getting the temperature too hot or by treat - ing too long. We do not care to recommend it until we have a man </seg>
            <seg id="p648">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 648 available to start the growers right in the use of the treatment, and to put on demonstrations of the method. This method is of great im - portance in communities where the growers live close together and a community treating vat with steam heat can be used. The other method is the corrosive sublimate treatment. In this method use four ounces to thirty gallons of water, and treat from one and one-half to two hours. It has been found effective in controlling both scab and Rhizoctonia. The solution becomes weakened by repeated usage and it is necessary to increase its strength for each treatment by the addition of a certain amount of corrosive sublimate, or by in - creasing the length of treatment; and then throw the solution away after four or five treatments. If you use the same solution without increasing the length of treatment or the strength of the corrosive sub - limate, the solution decreases in strength about 10 per cent for each treatment and is ineffective in a short time. In New York they have been using hot corrosive sublimate solution — something similar to hot formaldehyde solution. We have not recom - mended it in Nebraska. Here again the entire saving is in time. They use double strength, using four ounces to fifteen gallons of water, and treating at a temperature of 114° to 116°. Black Leg Black leg is a disease I do not think we need to take up here. It occurs so seldom in western Nebraska and is of such minor importance that I do not want to confuse you by talking about it. Fusarium Wilt — Stem-End Rot You are familiar with the losses caused by this disease and know that it will vary in different years. It is carried over in the seed and in the soil. You can not control it by seed treatment. We get a great deal of infection in certain sections of western Nebraska, where it causes severe losses to both table stock and seed potatoes. We have found it to be a high temperature disease — not as high as many people think is necessary; but a temperature of about 73° is optimum for Fusarium wilt. You will get a great deal of variation in the amount of infection and loss due to temperature and moisture conditions. Infection occurs here usually from the soil through the roots or seed pieces, going up the plant and causing the wilting of the tops. Under dry conditions, rotting of the roots and infection in the stem are enough to cause rapid wilting, and the symptoms are quickly apparent. If it is severe you will have practically no potatoes. The difficulty comes when you have plenty of soil moisture and a fairly low temperature. The few roots destroyed are more than equalized by the abundance of moisture in the soil and wilting of the tops does not occur. It may be producing stem - end rot of the new tubers without symptoms of the disease showing on the top. There are a few minor symptoms that appear from which you </seg>

            <seg id="p650">650 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture can spot this infection, but the casual observer would not distinguish the disease under these conditions. It might then be stated that in a general way high temperatures and low soil moisture results in a rapid wilting of infected plants, while low temperatures and high soil moisture result in a stem-end rot of the new tubers. Mosaic and Spindle-tuber Coming to the group of diseases known as degeneration diseases or "running out" of potatoes, I shall not go into a description of the symptoms. You are familiar with mosaic and spindle-tuber. Both these diseases are transmitted through the tuber, and also in the field by insects from one plant to another. You are familiar with the fact that the symptoms will vary according to climatic conditions, and mosaic particularly in regard to temperature. With a high temperature, the mottling does not appear in cases of mild mosaic. At low tempera - tures, the symptoms are obvious and it is possible to go through the fields and rogue out the diseased plants. Normally it is hard to detect here in Nebraska. Once in a while we get seasonal conditions where the disease can be readily detected, and these opportunities to eliminate the mosaic plants should not be neglected. In regard to spindle-tuber, we have a much more severe problem than with mosaic. We have heard a lot about mosaic, but spindle-tuber is much more severe with us. You are familiar with the symptoms, commonly known as "run out" potatoes. In regard to conditions under which these symptoms are increased or diminished, it has been found that high temperatures will tend to in - crease the severity of the symptoms both in tops and tubers. High soil moisture and heavy soils will also tend to increase the tuber symptoms. The problem is further complicated by the fact that a healthy potato without any spindle-tuber, grown under very high soil temperature or high soil moisture will tend to take on the appearance of spindle-tuber, although it has no disease; and the tubers will produce healthy plants the following year. That makes it difficult to distinguish between mild spindle-tuber, and healthy plants grown under high temperature and moisture conditions. It is difficult to inspect in a bin unless you know under what conditions the potatoes have been grown. The exact reverse occurs with opposite conditions. With low tem - perature, dry conditions, and light soils, the spindle tubers will take on the appearance of healthy tubers. It is possible to grow a spindle-tuber potato where it will look healthier than another which is free from disease. One plant is still diseased and the other is healthy, however. When I speak of the symptoms disappearing, I do not mean the disease has disappeared. Even if the symptoms are not apparent, the tuber is still infected, and it is possible to transmit the disease by insects from plant to plant, or by planting the tuber, ov making a tuber graft to healthy tubers. </seg>
            <seg id="p651">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 651 Because of the difficulty in distinguishing the symptoms on tubers, we have attempted to work out other methods of detecting diseased tubers in the bin. A good deal of work has been done in Maryland by Dr. Appleman on what he terms "apical dominance." If a healthy tuber is planted whole the sprouts from the bud end will start first. If it is cut in half crosswise, the sprouts at each end will come out equally well. If for any reason one eye is given a better advantage than the other; if the bud eyes are not getting enough air so that they are prevented from growing, you have a loss of apical dominance and all the eyes sprout equally. He recommends that in addition to the roguing and tuber unit work, we should run a sprouting test and take only potatoes that show vigorous sprouts at the bud end first. In working with spindle-tuber, we often find the infected tuber tends to produce sprouts from all eyes at the same time. You do not have any apical dominance such as occurs in healthy tubers. We have not run enough tests under practical conditions to say it always occurs with spindle-tubers. We have run enough to know that in a great many - cases we have not only a retardation of sprouting, but weaker sprouts, coming from all eyes equally, rather than the dominance of apical sprouts. We recommend that you discard such potatoes. They may not all be spindle-tuber, but they are weak potatoes. Spindle-tuber increases in fields in western Nebraska much more rapidly than we would expect on the basis of the number of insects occurring and known to be capable of transmitting the disease, that is, aphids. We get a large increase in the percentage of spindle-tuber, and can not find many of these insects which are supposed to transmit the disease. It is possible that we have other insects present, capable of transmitting the disease, that have not yet been determined. So far we have not found other insects occurring in the fields that we have been able to use to transmit the disease from one plant to another. In considering other possible means of transmitting the disease it occurred to us that we might get some infection from the cutting knife. We ran tests in the greenhouse, and found by rubbing the healthy and spindle-tuber seed pieces together, we could transmit the disease. We then conducted a test at Mitchell this year in which we took a certain number of healthy potatoes that had been indexed in the greenhouse and cut them in half; one-half was cut again into quarters with a knife just used to cut a spindle-tuber seed piece. The other half was cut into quarters with a sterile knife, and planted in a check row. The check row was planted between the inoculated row and the row of spindle - tuber seed used as the sources of infection. As a result of this method of inoculation by the catting knife, 32 per cent of the plants inoculated in that way showed distinct signs of the disease; 47 per cent were doubtful — not severe enough to class with the rest, but probably containing considerable spindle-tuber. Only 20 per cent remained healthy on the same basis as the healthy checks. </seg>
            <seg id="p652">652 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture We ran the same number of hills by contact inoculation, i. e. by rubbing together the freshly cut surfaces of healthy and spindle-tuber seed pieces. The healthy checks, as in the previous test were grown from the same tuber as in the inoculated seed piece. As a result, there was 47 per cent of spindle-tuber; 45 per cent were doubtful, and only 7 per cent of the total number remained perfectly healthy. (Figure 1.) That was the result of only one year's test. The symptoms, how - ever, were so evident anyone could pick out the inoculated from the healthy row. The symptoms not only showed up distinctly on the tops, but the tubers also showed typical symptoms and a decrease in yield. Averaging together both methods of inoculation, the diseased stock used as a source of infection yielded an average of .3 lb. per plant, the in - fected plants yielded 1.3 lbs., the doubtful ones 2.1 lbs., and the healthy ones 2.5 lbs. per plant. We, therefore, obtained a considerable de - crease in yield from those plants that showed infection; and even from those classified as doubtful. Also a much smaller number of plants in the inoculated row produced No. 1 tubers. How much of this kind of transmission occurs under ordinary con - ditions I am not in a position to say. We have not worked with it long enough to know but there is no reason why it can not occur. There is a great deal of transmission occurring which we have not been able to account for in any other way. As far as controlling this method of infection, it is not practical to try to sterilize cutting knives. You must make a more rigid sorting of your seed stock before you start cutting, and eliminate the source of the infection you can get by contact. It may be possible to work out a seed treatment on cut tubers. PRESENT STATUS AND PLANS FOR THE FUTURE OF SEED POTATO INDUSTRY IN SOUTH DAKOTA GEORGE VALENTINE South Dakota Agricultural College, Brookings, S. D. It is with the greatest of pleasure that I come to Nebraska to at - tend your Ninth Annual Convention and Show. I appreciate the courtesy being shown to a representative of the South Dakota Potato Growers Association. I bring to you from them — greetings. It would seem futile indeed for one from South Dakota to come to you with much of value as regards the raising of Triumph potatoes. It does seem most logical however, for me to come to your Convention and Show for the purpose of learning more about our problems. I am assuming that many of our problems now are very similar but I also assume that we in South Dakota are just approaching some of the perplexities that you in Nebraska have already overcome. I note from the subject suggested on the program for this after - noon that we are to open up a big subject namely "The Present Status </seg>
            <seg id="p653">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 653 and Plans for the Future of the Industry in Our Representative States." For some of you there is, no doubt, a large volume of material, from which you can draw, to talk on present and past conditions. For South Dakota it will be necessary, for obvious reasons, to make that part of my discussion very brief. South Dakota is in its infancy as far as production of Triumph seed potatoes is concerned. Our Triumph sec - tions, two in number, are widely separated. The leading section is north of the Black Hills. This section is both irrigated and dry. The altitude of this district is about 3000 feet. The soil is classified by the Bureau of Soils as a Morton loam. Some excellent yields of potatoes are pos - sible in this section. The best yield I have record of this year was produced by Mr. Julius Gaver of Belle Fourche. His yield was over 300 bushels. One-half of his field was planted to South Dakota Certified Triumphs and one-half to Nebraska Certified Triumphs. The Nebraska seed was raised last year by Mr. Anton Stenberg of Berea, Nebraska. The yields of the two parts of the field were about the same. However, the half planted to Nebraska seed showed the stronger plants early in the season. It seemed that the germination of the Nebraska seed was quicker. When I was in the field about August 15th, the plants on the South Dakota side were in every respect as good as the other half of the field and one could not tell the difference. In another field however, a few miles distant where conditions were not quite so favorable, the Nebraska seed showed up the best throughout the season and I am sure would outyield the South Dakota seed although I do not have records on this field as the field was disqualified on the second inspection be - cause of excessive spindle-tuber. The portion planted to Nebraska seed was so small that it would not warrant the costs of certification but he is saving his seed for next year from the Nebraska planted portion and will enter it for certification. A cost of production survey has been made of this section and it was estimated that the average cost per bushel on the irrigated land was 48 cents per bushel as compared to 52 cents per bushel for the non-ir - rigated. This survey included the production of all potatoes in that section and the cost of producing certified seed would of course be higher. The situation in this district differs considerably from any other in the state. The total consumption of table stock in the whole Black Hills country exceeds the total production. Each year many carloads of table stock are shipped in from Nebraska and Wyoming and possibly some from Montana. There are also many carloads shipped into this district from eastern South Dakota. Each fall at digging time, grow - ers of certified seed who had probably originally planned to sell cer - tified seed are confronted with the problem of whether to sell to the local markets of Lead, Deadwood, Rapid City and Hot Springs and other Black Hills towns or ship south as seed. Last year when prices of table stock in eastern South Dakota were about 25 cents per bushel and certified seed about 90-95 cents these growers in western South Dakota were selling field run at about 75 cents per bushel for table </seg>
            <seg id="p654">654 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture stock. Many of the certified growers accepted these prices rather than attempt to meet the more strict requirements of certified stock. From this it is very evident that the Black Hills section will not figure prominently in the production of seed potatoes for some time. There are however, a few growers who plan to sell part of their Tri - umphs each year as seed in order to establish a market and take ad - vantage of a condition when prices of table stock are low. The main disease problem of this section is with the degeneration diseases and particularly spindle-tuber. It is a slow process to get growers to realize that they have these diseases because it does not give them a great deal of trouble and to train them to carefully rogue their fields. We do not have, as yet, a system whereby all strains are accurately tested in the south. We hope to develop a system similar to the one you have here in Nebraska, but our present problem in that district is to get more growers interested and to increase the volume of production and to also multiply and develop our best strains of foundation stock. Eastern and western South Dakota conditions vary almost as black from white. The potato section in eastern South Dakota is in the vicinity of Watertown. Over half of the certified seed grown in South Dakota has been in one county just south of Watertown. The altitude in this section varies from 1600 to 1800 feet. Most soils are classified as Sandy Marshall loams. Excellent quality of potatoes are raised in this district and yields commonly reach 200 bu. per acre. Last year 95% of those marketed at Hayti, the leading shipping 1 point, graded U. S. No. 1. U. S. shipping point inspection was given to all shipments from that point. In eastern South Dakota the main variety grown among certified growers is Cobblers and, with few exceptions, all of this seed for the past four years has gone to Virginia and New Jersey. However, we have growers who are breaking into the Triumph business but rather slowly and carefully. We were very fortunate, we think, to obtain in 1924 some foundation stock of the Sharpies strain. This stock is being multiplied this year and next year we will have some of this strain to sell on the southern markets. Another strain very prominent is the Fletcher strain. It has performed well wherever tried but does not seem to be as free from spindle-tuber and mosaic as the Sharpies strain of Montana. Most of this in the past has been sold in Alabama. Here again we have the problem of getting growers to realize the importance of these two diseases because they have never seen them grow in the south which so magnifies the diseased condition. As regards a system of improvement we require all certified grow - ers to have a seed plot equal in area to 5 per cent of their total. This percentage is to be increased next year. We have not required them to use the tuber unit method in a seed plot but we are contemplating this as a requirement in the future. I should like to get the opinion of you men here regarding such a plan. It is very easy to have the re- </seg>
            <seg id="p655">655 Nebraska Potato Improvement Association quirements so high that it will appear to be unprofitable to meet them but our policy at present is to have them high enough so that the pro - duction of certified seed will increase gradually by cooperating with the better growers and by attempting to train the recruits. At the College we plant in seed plots, samples of all growers seed. Here it is possible to compare them. A half day of our annual tour each year is spent in the study of these plots. This plan helps con - siderably in the study of degeneration diseases but it is indeed a problem to get even all the interested growers to come to the College to see these plots as the College is quite a distance from the center of the district growing certified stock. Upon the suggestion of Dr. Stuart, we hope to be able to do some tuber index work for the growers but this is rather hopeless now until we have better facilities for handling so detailed a plan. However, we have this in mind in the future. Our plan would be to cooperate the first year with a very few of the leading growers and develop the plan gradually to serve all certified growers eventually. This would give all an opportunity to have high quality seed for a small seed plot each year. Another problem which has given us no little concern is that dealing with the tuber-borne diseases, mainly Rhizoctonia and scab. It seems that even though the seed treatment be most carefully performed, these diseases do persist. We do have, in that respect, conditions quite sim - ilar to those in the Red River Valley of Minnesota and North Dakota. There they have always been troubled and still are. We have tried all treatments. For a while we had great faith in hot formaldehyde but when tried on a large scale by a large number of growers it did not seem to give satisfactory results. Last year in cooperation with the Agronomy Department of the College, we made a survey of the state as regards water analysis. Sim - ilar surveys have been carried on in other states to quite a large de - gree. We found that in South Dakota, samples of the surface well water reduced the mercuric chloride ranging from 28 to 67%. We had anticipated that the water in the artesian belt would cause the greatest reduction but to our surprise these artesian samples showed the least reduction. Since that survey, the College has recommended that soft water be used and results thus far are promising. This year in an ac - curate test, the corrosive sublimate, used with soft water, showed less than 1% infection of Rhizoctonia and less than 4% scab as compared to 10% Rhizoctonia and 8% scab with hot formaldehype. This was not an extensive test but next year it will be carried out on all principle soil types. In 1924, blackleg gave us a large amount of trouble but during 1925 it appeared in only a very few fields. When we are troubled with blackleg we are certainly at a loss to know what to do as definite in - formation seems to be as lacking as regards its control as with some of the degenerative troubled. </seg>
            <seg id="p656">656 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture We also are familiar with Fusarium troubles but not so seriously affected. Growers having this problem are advised to hand cut their seed and discard all tubers showing any discoloration regardless of cause. I have tried to give you a brief account of certified seed potato production in South Dakota. I hope that I have said something which will stimulate thinking about these problems which are probably more or less common. I was in hopes that your program committee would put someone else on this part of the program first so that I would know what to say and what not to say. I trust that I'll get more from hearing of conditions in other states than you have from hearing of South Dakota conditions. I thank you. CHAIRMAN PEDRETT: We have another man from outside the state here with us. I do not know whether or not he came to learn. I hope he may be able to tell ub something. He is our neighbor from Wyoming, Mr. F. P. Lane. THE PRESENT STATUS AND PLANS FOR THE FUTURE OF THE POTATO INDUSTRY IN WYOMING MR. R. H. ZIEGER County Agricultural Agent, Cheyenne, Wyoming Mr. Lane could not be here, and asked me to express his regrets that he could not get down. I do not think I can take his place, but maybe I can present a better example of what Wyoming produces. If you will look me over and then look over these other gentlemen, you will realize they do have spindle-tuber in other states. As "Exhibit A," shows we are comparatively free from it in Wyoming. (Laughter). I want to say, Mr. Chairman, I believe Mr. Lane was expected to speak at the banquet. He told me I could take his place there. I speak much better after a banquet than under present conditions, but I will do the best I can. I do not have the viewpoint of the whole State of Wyoming. My experience in potatoes has been largely during the last five years in Laramie county, as your immediate neighbor to the west. The con - ditions of which I shall speak will be largely those of that county. In running tests there, there is one test we have run I do not think any other state has attempted, and that is a test on these potato experts to find out how expert they were. (Laughter). Maybe it is a pretty im - portant thing to do. We had one man come into the Experiment Station and look over our plots with the idea of diagnosing mosaic and spindle-tuber. I want to say in that plot we had twenty-seven strains or selections. Each row was the progeny of one hill of potatoes, not of a tuber unit, but of a hill. I believe our experts will agree to this extent that if one of those plants we started with had either a mosaic or spindle-tuber dis- </seg>
            <seg id="p657">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 657 ease, all of those plants derived from it should have shown the same disease. As a matter of fact, when he came to check out on these rows, only one row out of twenty-seven rows was passed by Mr. Expert as free from disease. On digging there were several rows — some half dozen — that out-yielded the one he had called the best row in the plot. I am not throwing stones, but I want to say it woke us up to the fact it was exceedingly difficult to tell mosaic and spindle-tuber dis - eases in their incipient form. Where the disease was advanced, any one could tell it. Certainly at times both of those diseases were ex - ceedingly difficult to tell. If we can not tell them ourselves in certain cases, what right have we to expect the growers to pick out the dis - eased stuff and do a decent job of eliminating it? It seemed to us the problem was to get a method whereby a man might recognize discard plants and get them out of his field. With that idea, the next year I had one grower dig 126 of what he considered his best hills. Each hill was sacked separately. In the spring they were planted to separate rows, and each row labeled as to the type of plants it had come from the year before. Of the rows derived from 126 hills the following spring, because we considered there was some doubt as to where disease was and where it was not, we eliminated all but 24 rows. Those 24 rows were planted last spring and we dug them this fall. By that time the increase had been such that for every one of the 24 strains, we had from three to four rows 390 yards in length. If there were disease there, we felt we would be likely to see it — anybody would. One of these strains was a great big, bushy type, noticeably dif - ferent from everything else. We told the fellows at Kimball about that strain, and promptly Mr. Forsling labeled this type "bull" po - tatoes; so we call it the "bull" strain. I was expecting that this strain would show up the best of the lot at digging time. This fall we found the "bull strain" did not yield the highest or the lowest of these strains, but this year produced probably the smoothest potatoes we had. This work was mostly done by Mr. E. W. Burroughs of Egbert. The three highest yielding strains he could get out of the 26 strains will be planted by him next year and will make up his entire lot of certified seed potatoes. In looking over his seed plot, we could only see one strain out of the 26 which seemed to be inferior as far as uniformity of plants and quality of tubers were concerned. I think our lowest yield was 93 bush - els, and the next lowest was 98. The best ran 127 bushels. Do not think we consider those exceptional yields. It means we were showing comparative yielding value under our conditions. Not only has Mr. Burroughs done this work for three years, but we have three other men who have done it. Practically all our certified seed growers next year will have planted a large part of their potatoes which have been se - lected by this hill to row method. I do not think anybody can doubt but what we must have eliminated the bulk of the disease in those potatoes. We thought we had pretty good strains to start with. Neces- </seg>
            <seg id="p658">658 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture sarily they were more or less mixed. Mr. Burroughs next year will have potatoes all of which originated with three original plants. Three years ago he had three plants. Next year he will have a whole field of the progeny of those three plants. We think we should have uniformity. As to the spread of the disease, we have been unable to observe any aphis or insects of that type. We have not been able to see where the disease has spread. In his seed plot he rogued some plants. They were mostly affected with Rhizoctonia and fusarium wilt. So much for our work in the way of seed plots. I believe the method of selecting from hill to row has an advantage for the practical grower over the tuber unit method, in that you get a more rapid increase. It would seem reasonable, where it is done by this method that you should get freedom from disease the same as with the tuber unit method. I do not know whether Dr. Goss and Mr. Valen - tine will agree with that. We at least so far can see nothing against this method for the practical grower. We realize where you use your tuber unit method you have a slow system of increase, and a difficult system for the average grower to carry out. By our method we shall have all our growers using seed which has been selected in that manner next year. We do not grow a great many certified seed potatoes in Wyoming as acreages go in the surrounding states. We are a young state. Our population is scattered. Where we can get one grower, more populous states can get ten. We are trying to keep up our standards and sustain what reputation we may have won so far. I want to speak of the matter of grading. Early in the game we graded very carefully to definite size. Our certified seed was run over a one and one-half inch screen, and everything over that and under two and one-half inches went for certified seed. We have found lately that the buyers were more anxious to buy the big potatoes, so last year and this, there was no discrimination against large potatoes. It looks as if we were coming to the point where the buyers of seed would want to take the whole crop, regardless of size. I have had a man hounding me to buy potatoes that went through a one and one-half screen. He represents a growers' association in a neighboring state. I feel that we are coming to the day where size will not be much of a criterion of the value of seed potatoes. I think Nebraska is doing some splendid work in the way of elim - inating disease and in producing a good article. I do think all of us have been very remiss in marketing our product. We have waited for the buyer to come to us. Gentlemen, I do not believe you can sell any article to the best advantage by waiting for the buyer to come to you. I think it is time we all did some missionary work and got out and work together on these problems. Even if we cannot control as much as some other states, perhaps we can in the future. I thank you. (Applause). </seg>
            <seg id="p659">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 659 PRESENT STATUS OF THE POTATO INDUSTRY AND PLANS FOR ITS FUTURE IN MONTANA C. C. STARRING Assistant Horticulturist, Bozeman, Montana Ladies and Gentlemen: Since the question tii seed plots has been brought up I will first give our experience with the tuber unit-system which we have been using for ten years. This system was first used to keep track of the progeny of different tubers and certain things hap - pened to encourage continuance of the plan. We found that most tubers produced hills of similar vigor and that hills lacking in vigor could be more easily detected when in groups than when separated. When alone weak hills are often hidden by vigorous hills or they may be left in the field as being backward from causes other than diseases. As a result of our experience, we are now encouraging and requiring certified seed growers to plant a seed plot on the tuber-unit system. Before this, men have been slow to adopt the method; perhaps because it seemed like a lot of work. However there were many small seed plots in Montana last year. One grower planted six acres on the tuber unit plan. The fact that he has quite a number of children may have been a factor in trying the plan on such a large scale. He marked off his field in check rows. Then he took his potatoes into the field, cut each tuber into four pieces which he planted with a hoe. This may seem impractical and slow to growers who rush pell mell through their planting but during two years, this grower says it paid. The extra time to plant was offset by the time saved in roguing. In summer when other field work is pressing, he can rogue four rows in one trip across the field and furthermore, time is not wasted in debating questionable plants. His decisions are easily and quickly made. In our earlier experiments with the tuber-unit system we cut four seed pieces from a tuber and planted them in succession with a hoe. That was the primitive method. The next step was to use one-fourth pound candy sacks, each one containing the seedpieces from one tuber. The hopper of our Iron Age two-man planter was then loaded with the sacks. The normal feeding of the planter was prevented by placing burlap bags against the wooden pegs. Before starting down the row, the rear man would place seedpieces in the spaces of the horizontal wheel, fill each hand with seed. In this way we could go between 100 and 150 feet without stopping. Better time was made by having a man walk beside the planter to help empty the sacks. The past year we made a series of trays that would fit the planter, each tray holding sixty-three small tin cans. At each end of the patch (200 feet long) we had men placing four seedpieces from each tuber into each can. When one row was finished, the empty tray would be replaced by a full one without the planter losing time. No time was lost in the row as the cans were easily emptied; also they were more easily filled than paper bags on account of the rigid sides. No me- </seg>
            <seg id="p660">660 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture chanical contrivance has been worked out for the one-man planters. We hope that some day the manufacturers will devise something practical for planting tuber units, and reasonable in price. Our idea in the beginning was that the tuber-unit system would materially help in roguing fields, as indicated by the experience of the grower before mentioned. But the system has an educational advantage worth mentioning. It has taught growers what to remove from their main fields. In the dryland sections of the state, some virus diseases are difficult to detect. In irrigated fields, growers often find backward plants with no other striking indication of a harmful disease. Should such plants be removed ? The answer to this and similar questions can be found in the tuber-unit seed plot. A study of this plot gives the farmer assurance when roguing. It is, then, of special benefit to the one who is growing certified seed for the first time. Even the more experienced growers find it helpful. We find the tuber-unit plan of great value in studying the samples of seed sent to us for trial. These samples are required from growers who apply for the certification service. Each sample is divided into three parts, one of which is grown under irrigation at the home station, another without irrigation two miles away; the third lot is planted in the western part of the state. At first we planted the samples in the regular way but found it rather slow work to determine the percent af virus diseases, not of the evident cases, but of the intermediate forms. This year all samples were tuber-united, which saved considerable time in making the disease counts. If you have not used this method in the seed plot it ia worth while to give it a trial. With regard to the present status of seed certification work in Montana, I will say that our tracts are small when we consider com - mercial fields, especially those in other states. We look upon ten or fifteen acres as a pretty large field. In some states a man has to have a hundred acres or more to be much of a potato grower. Compared with these localities our acreage is small and yet this situation is de - sirable for most of our folk are wheat growers and they must learn the potato game. Consequently for them to start with a large acreage would likely mean failure of the potatoes to pass inspections. It is quite a job to rogue out a big patch of potatoes. The farmer with a large wheat or hay field may say to an inspector, "I was busy putting up hay" or "I had to harvest grain." These excuses are not effective in potato improvement. A few acres are more likely to get the necessary attention and thus pass inspections. Hence we want our growers to start with small acreages and work up as they become more proficient in seed growing. Another factor which has influenced the seed situation was the small original stock to start with. In various parts of the state, particularly the northern and eastern sections, farmers have been growing small patches of Bliss Triumph potatoes to supply local markets. Luckily these men were in isolated districts so far as the potato industry is con- </seg>
            <seg id="p661">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 661 cerned, one promising strain being thirty-five miles from a railroad. This isolation and, no doubt, other factors favored the growing of po - tatoes for years without degeneration diseases creeping in to a serious extent even when no special attention was given to seed selection and roguing. This situation has naturally led to some inquisitiveness in these localities as to why the necessity of Toguing now. It is easy to pass over the matter by saying that apparently along with civilization have come these degeneration diseases. Whether this is correct or not, does not alter the situation that the time has come when roguing is essential. The stake is too great to take chances on no-roguing practices. Many of these stocks have been tested in connection with our seed certification work and we are encouraging our growers to plant only the best ones. Naturally we found problems in some of the growers who fancied that they would like to have their pet stocks widely ad - vertised with their own names attached. Each figured that this would be worth about ten million dollars. There was a real problem. How - ever, our growers found it easier to sell recognized stocks than unknown ones, also that an inferior stock was not good advertising. Hence the experiment station has had excellent cooperation from farmers in this matter of locating good stocks and discarding the poor ones. These two factors, few desirable stocks and small quantities of each, have been important in preventing phenomenal increased production. If I weTe to tell how much we grew, you would say, "That is hardly a drop in the bucket and would not materially affect the market price." In 1924 we certified 223 acres of which 58 acres were Bliss Triumph. In 1925 the total acres certified were 452, of which 227 acres were Bliss Triumph. Two years ago a certain gentleman from down near the Gulf of Mexico came up and said, "You folks are not ready to ship seed. Keep every potato and plant it at home." If he could get other Bliss Triumph sections to do the same thing, a buyers' market would be created. Fine! But for whom? That is where we are interested. I think the general feeling of our growers is to try to keep in touch with seed producers of Nebraska and the Dakotas in such a way that will prevent cutting the throat of the seed industry in the near future. Professors Werner and Harrington have kept in touch with each other in this matter and are trying to avoid such a situation. A tremendous crop with poor prices would be a calamity. For instance, a few years ago a fellow contracted with farmers in one sec - tion of our state to grow commercial stock. When digging time came, did he appear with the money to pay for the potatoes ? No! After such an experience it was hard to renew interest in the potato game. If a similar situation should arise in seed growing, it might be difficult, if not impossible, for this infant industry to survive. We want the industry to develop, for potatoes have a place in our cropping system. Where non-tillable crops, grains and peas, have been grown for years, the weed problem is serious. What can they grow to </seg>
            <seg id="p662">662 Repokt of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture get rid of weeds? Probably nothing better than the potato. This crop is also promising as a substitute for summer fallow. Hence, potatoes are desirable, if they can be grown with profit, and seed stock is more likely to return a profit than commercial stock as the greater value of the former reduces the disadvantage of distance to markets. There will, no doubt, be increased acreage in the future. We do not look for any striking increase, although the present price is an in - centive. I think most of our seed growers will consider very carefully before they make a big jump. This year we have had .sixty to seventy cars of Bliss Triumphs, which is quite a jump from ten cars of the previous year. We do not look for proportionate increases to continue indefinitely. Other factors will help to keep the increase gradual. With increas - ing acreage of potatoes there must be an adjustment of labor problems, because it takes people to harvest potatoes. This year in one section of the state farmers started to grow sugar beets and there was competition for labor. This made it impossible to dig some potato fields. These experiences make men cautious. Another factor will be seed. It is hard to tell, at this time, how much seed our growers are holding for next year. It looks as though there would not be enough left of good stocks to make any great increase next year. In closing I wish to repeat that I expect the seed industry to de - velop gradually to keep pace with the demands of the market. Also, that our seed growers would like to keep in touch with you folk, es - pecially in the matter of prices, so that we won't be fighting each other, a situation which would please some parties, but not you, nor us. Discussion Q. What potatoes besides Bliss Triumph do you grow? A. Irish Cobblers. We are specializing in the Irish Cobbler, Bliss Triumph, and Netted Gem. This year we certified one field of Green Mountain and a few Early Ohio's. We are encouraging the certification of nothing except the first three varieties. Q. What proportion is sold outside of the state. A. It is pretty hard for me to estimate. I should say probably 80 or 90 per cent of the stock that is sold for producing commercial potatoes. Q. Are other growers, aside from those who plan to have their potatoes certified the following year, using certified seed to produce their commercial crop? A. Practically none. That is another thing that seems peculiar. The idea of producing table stock from certified seed has not percolated through certain characteristic structures. (Laughter). Why commer - cial growers want to plant something that will give one hundred bushels to the acre when they might produce twice that, is one of the mysteries. Q. Then wasn't it a good suggestion that a good deal of the certi - fied seed should be planted at home ? A. He had another end in view. (Laughter). </seg>
            <seg id="p663">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 663 The gentleman who spoke before me reminded me of a situation that occurred at home. A man came from Washington to sell our po - tato men Washington grown seed of his own certification. He had a nice scheme worked out on the basis that any change of seed was bene - ficial regardless of locality, that seed quality did not depend so much on high altitudes or north latitudes as on any new environment. Hence Montana could benefit from Washington seed even though it came from a locality that is not adapted to seed production. Several farmers con - tracted to grow seed for him from his own certified stock. In the sum - mer time, the contractor came to instruct his growers in roguing. His first proposition was to rogue out some of those connected with the state department of agriculture and state colleges. He was not able, however, to do this at the particular moment, and before the year was over he was the one who got rogued out. We had a grower who planted his seed stock, and other seed stock which the experiment station recommended. He wrote in that from the first lot he only got his seed back, while the second lot increased fifteen or twenty times, even though it did not have such a pretty tag as the other lot of seed. The color of the tag does not always tell what the potatoes will yield. But if buyers prefer certain colored tags, why not accommodate them ? However, we must back the colored tags with potatoes that are productive. Otherwise, the color will soon lose its value. (Applause). SECRETARY WERNER: I cannot help but bring up at this time the fact that there is a big market near at hand which we have never touched. It seems to me one of the best things for potato growers in Western Nebraska would be to see to it in years of low prices, that certified seed is distributed in counties in the irrigated regions. In the North Platte valley, it is often impossible for the potato grower to borrow money to buy superior seed potatoes. He can borrow money to buy junk, but not to buy really good certified seed potatoes. There is an opportunity for you to work on the bankers in western Nebraska. MR. VALENTINE (South Dakota) In the southern part of South Dakota they do not raise a large amount of potatoes. There are two tiers of counties in the southern part of the state that only raise enough for their own use. A year ago we put on a campaign in cooperation with county agents, getting them to take two carloads per county and distribute them in small lots. Last year they got them at about $1.25 a bushel, laid down. I wish I had some of the reports here we gathered after that crop had grown. They were entirely satisfied with that stock over and above what they had been raising. Maybe the individual farmer would get two bushels to plant. It would take a large organization to pool those orders to make a car - load, but it is a very profitable undertaking for the growers to try that </seg>
            <seg id="p664">664 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture kind of scheme. We are going to do it again this year, and try to get more of the farmers in the southern part of our own state to buy certi - fied potatoes, especially of the Early Ohio variety, because of lack of demand from other states for that variety. CHAIRMAN PEDRETT: We will call on Mr. Morrow, our chief inspection and marketing agent at Alliance. (Applause). PRESENT STATUS OF THE POTATO INDUSTRY AND PLANS FOR ITS FUTURE IN NEBRASKA WM. MORROW, Jr. Manager Nebraska Certified Potato Growers, Alliance Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: When I heard this morning that the convention was to be postponed and have its opening meeting this afternoon, I felt sure that I would not be called on; so I can not help but feel like the boy who came running home from high school and informed his father the high school was to have a banquet and he was to be called upon to speak. The father and son got together and pre - pared a very nice little speech for the boy. That evening the banquet went off very well. The boy enjoyed his meal. The Toastmaster arose and called on several speakers, and finally it became the boys' turn to speak. He got on his feet and said, "Worthy Toastmaster," and stopped. "Worthy Toastmaster," he repeated and stopped again. "Worthy Toast - master: Before this banquet there were just two people knew my speech, but there is only one of us knows it now!" (Laughter). Certification in Nebraska at the present time promises to become much more stable than it has been for the past three years. The work as conducted under the College of Agriculture gradually grew until in 1923, 5800 acres were entered for inspection. Together with that, we had a very high yield that year. In spite of the fact 51 per cent were rejected, we had a much greater supply that fall than we had developed a market for. We received a serious set-back last year in the work; so two years ago we started the season with a very much reduced acreage — probably not over 2400 acres are being entered for certifica - tion. Likewise we had a lower yield than normal, so there were only a few over one hundred cars to put on the market. In 1924 there was also reorganization in the certification work. The College of Agricul - ture felt since certification had gained such proportions, it should not be conducted directly by an educational institution. Likewise a clamor arose for more systematic methods of marketing. The result is our present Co-operative Marketing Association, also conducting certifica - tion work under the supervision of the College. We made mistakes in marketing last year. We set a price too high, in spite of the fact that we had a low yield. This year the acreage was increased, although a good many growers fell out of the certification </seg>
            <seg id="p665">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 665 list. We had fewer growers, but those who stayed increased their acreage. We had a better yield this year than a year ago. About the time of the potato tour, we had prospects of 600 acres of certified seed. Since then we had a hot August and adverse weather conditions, and practically 50 per cent of the fields entered on. the north side of the river rejected because of fusarium wilt. As a result, we will probably have 200 cars of certified seed. Our principal variety, the Triumph, is short the country over this year. They want the seed, and for that reason we have been able to market these 200 cars at a good price that has satisfied most of the growers. It is not over yet, and there is still danger that we may hold too high on the balance of the crop, and cause trouble. It is not be - cause we have not paid enough attention to developing the demand for certified seed. One of the most serious drawbacks to the industry is the fluctuating supply — one year a tremendous amount; the next year a reduction, and again a large supply. Certification has settled to where each year only a few new men enter. A few drop out. From now on we can hope for a steadily increasing supply, and can steadily increase our demand. This year, up until the third inspection, our prospects were bright. We had cool weather conditions in which mosaic symptoms could have been seen, and we found it necessary to reject but two fields. In 1923 most of the rejections were for mosaic, and mosaic symptoms showed late that year. At the third inspection we found fusarium wilt showing up extensively on the north table. Over 50 per cent in Box Butte county was rejected, and the same along the Northwestern. It is a difficult proposition. It is hard to talk to a grower when it is necessary to reject bis field for fusarium. One man said, "You inspected these potatoej last year. Did you find any stem rot?" "Less than one per cent." "This ground has never had potatoes on it before. What is the use of trying to raise potatoes and rogue them if they will grow like that?" It was due to climatic conditions and the fact that fusarium orga - nisms are present even in prairie soil. The best method is to plant clean seed on clean ground — on ground that has not had potatoes for a good many years. We have found only an average of one or two per cent of spindle tuber through the fields this year. A year ago it was the cause of more rejections than any other disease. We must remember again cold weather conditions possibly mask symptoms of mild spindle tuber. We do not want the growers to feel too encouraged and think it is abso - lutely eliminated; because it will show up again with proper weather conditions. Probably 15 per cent of our growers follow the seed plot system. Five per cent do not isolate the plot. It is not of much value to grow a seed plot directly next to your main field, because transmission can occur and the disease be carried into your seed plot, regardless of how </seg>
            <seg id="p666">666 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture well you rogue it. I doubt if there is another state certifying seed po - tatoes where the large fields are rogued as much as in Nebraska. It is an expensive proposition to go through the fields five times. Every grower should have a seed plot and rogue it so thoroughly that he gets any plant that even looks suspicious, and save seeds from that plot. In that way we can eliminate to a large extent some of the roguing in the commercial field. I do not want you to think that would mean no roguing, but keep it down as far as possible. This fall we have practically all of the potatoes sold. As nearly as we can estimate, there are twenty-five to thirty acres left to sell out of probably two hundred. They are sold, but not bagged or shipped, and a good deal of the territory has had field frost — one of the difficult things to get from your seed when sorting. One thing our growers have been criticised for in the past has been putting up a poor pack. Some people argue even if the potato is knobby, it is good seed. We will concede that point, but we must please the buyer. The same holds true with scab. You should not start grad - ing your potatoes with the idea you are making United States No. 1, and deliberately leaving 6 per cent defects. If you do, you will find 12 per cent. More attention should be paid to the pack. Our principal variety has been Triumphs. Some work has been carried on by the College in an effort to introduce the Cobblers. There are sections in our territory that can produce good Cobblers; but in many places, particularly about Berea, it is an impossibility because of scab. Some of the growers in Kimball county tried this year, and had them go down with stem rot. I do not think you are giving the Cobbler a square deal. Try it again another year. The Hay Springs district is raising Cobblers successfully. We have considerable inquiry for Cobblers. In an ordinary year, the Triumph sells for more money than the Cobbler, but it does not do any harm not to keep all the eggs in one basket. I should like to see more growers try the Cobblers experimentally. They promise to be a good variety, and there should be a demand at all times for them in the North Platte valley. There are a few lots of seed that should be discarded, and we should get more into the strains that have proven to be better throughout. We are getting more of them spread throughout the country. If more of our growers would take hold of these, there would be fewer rejections in future. We have excellent prospects for next year unless a good many who have not the real seed interest at heart get into the certified seed busi - ness and cause serious rejections and dissatisfaction throughout. Un - less we have that condition to contend with, we should have a promising future for the certified seed industry in Nebraska. (Applause).

Now he is county agent for the Burlington Railroad in the city of Denver. (Laugh - ter). Mr. Taylor. (Applause). PRACTICABILITY OF INCREASING CERTIFIED SEED POTATO PRODUCTION FROM THE STANDPOINT OF POTENTIAL MARKETS FRED L. TAYLOR Agricultural Agent, C. B. &amp; Q. R. R., Denver, Colorado Mr. Chairman, Members of the Nebraska Potato Improvement As - sociation, Ladies and Gentlemen: Your Chairman has stated I am now county agent for the Burlington for the city and county of Denver, which is synonymous. They cover the same territory of Denver, which is small and has very little agricultural possibilities within its border. Very recently a man from our Department was talking to a Honey Producers Association in a neighboring state, and he stated honey was a good revenue producer for the railroads. The Association later used his statement to get a reduction on freight rates on honey. In order that I shall know what will be written in your records, and for the convenience of the Secretary and the protection of myself, I have writ - ten my speech which I will turn over to the Secretary. I am sure it will make a better report than what I may say, because I know what is written in there, and I am not sure of all the things I may say in this discussion. CHAIRMAN PEDRETT Did you write this? (Laughter). MR. TAYLOR, (Continuing): At least it has been passed on. When I saw the number of speakers and the subjects they were to cover, I felt like Josh Billings, who was called on to talk at a dairymen's convention. When he reached the convention, he noticed he was tenth on the program. As one speaker after the other got up, he saw the speech he had prepared vanishing in the distance. He thought surely there would be nothing left to say. He made these few remarks: "Ladies and Gentlemen: Before coming to this meeting, I had done considerable reading on dairying. Since being here, I have heard much discussion on dairying; but the best thing I have ever seen on milk is cream." (Laughter). I might preface my remarks by saying the best thing I have seen on potatoes is certified seed, and sit down; but I should like to call to your attention some of the possibilities of expanding the market for certified seed. I was deeply interested in Mr. Starring's remarks about the man who said the thing for the growers was to plant all the certified seed </seg>
            <seg id="p668">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 668 they had. I was anxious to get his viewpoint, because I have assumed quite definitely in my remarks that if certified seed potatoes are good for the southern growers to use to produce a crop, they are also good for the commercial growers within the states where the certified seed is used, to produce their crop. While I do not know the gentleman who made those remarks, I was anxious to get his view point on that. PRACTICABILITY OF INCREASING CERTIFIED SEED POTATO PRODUCTION FROM THE STANDPOINT OF POTENTIAL MARKETS By FRED L. TAYLOR Assistant Agricultural Agent, C. B. &amp;. Q. The increased yields which have been secured in the many tests with certified seed potatoes from various states as compared with un - certified seed, coupled with the fact that certified seed production in the United States has increased from 475,000 bushels in 1919 to 7,293,000 bushels in 1924, is sufficient evidence, I believe, that certified seed is much superior to uncertified seed. If this were not true, then southern commercial growers of the early crop would not be paying growers of certified seed in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Nebraska, Montana, Wyoming and other northern states a premium of from 50c to $1.25 a hundred over common seed. To what extent it is practical to continue to increase the production of certified seed may be concluded from the fact that in 1924 approximately 35 million bushels of potatoes were used for seed in the United States, of which a little over 7 million bushels, or one - fifth, were certified. We are primarily interested, however, in the production of certified seed in the great plains section of the central west and the present and future market demand for such seed. In 1924, Montana, Nebraska, Wyoming and Colorado produced around 325 cars of certified seed. The following spring, 2,322,000 bushels of potatoes, or 3870 cars, of seed were required to plant the commercial and seed crop in these four states. In other words, if all the certified seed produced in Montana, Nebraska, Wyoming and Colorado was used at home, it would only plant about 8%% of the entire crop grown within their boundaries. There is then a large market for certified seed to be developed right here at home. At present, comparatively few, aside from those who plan to produce a crop of certified potatoes, are using certified seed in the four central western states which I have just mentioned. The principal southern states securing seed from this section for the early commercial crop are Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas. The early, or truck crop of these states is very largely confined to certain definite areas, such as the Mobile and Atmore districts of Alabama and southern Mississippi; the Alexandria </seg>
            <seg id="p669">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 669 and Bayou Lafourche districts of Louisiana; the Eagle Lake, Wharton and Brownsville districts of Texas; Fort Gibson of Oklahoma, and Fort Smith of Arkansas. The Triumph, Cobblers and Spaulding Rose have been the principal varieties grown in the south for the early crop, but at the present time Triumphs are grown almost exclusively in Alabama, Mississippi, Louis - iana, Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas. In 1924 these six states planted 43,440 acres to the early crop, which required approximately 450,000 bushels of seed, or 750, 600-bushel cars. Most of this seed is secured from Nebraska, Wisconsin, Montana, Wyoming, North and South Da - kota and Minnesota. These states last year produced approximately 425 cars of certified Triumphs, with Nebraska and Wisconsin producing more than 80% of the total. The middle western states which I have just mentioned fell short of producing sufficient certified Triumph seed in 1924 to plant the early crop in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas by 325 cars. In addition to this, there is a potential market for more than 600 cars of Triumph seed in Florida and Tennes - see. These states are now looking with more favor on seed produced in the middle west than in years past. This is due partly to the increasing demand on the part of the consuming public for the red skinned variety of early potatoes, and also because the best Triumph seed at the present time is being produced in the central western states. Cobblers make up a very small percent of the early crop in the south. They are grown almost exclusively, however, on the coastal plans extending from Dela - ware to Georgia. In addition to the demand for Triumphs in the south, the irrigated section of the North Platte Valley plants from 100 to 140 cars of seed annually, a large percent of which are Triumphs. The Kearney district last year, with less than half the acreage which was planted in 1922, used over 50 cars of Ohios and Cobbler seed while the farmers of east - ern Nebraska and the McCook district, which has just recently become interested in potato production in a commercial way, will use an ad - ditional 50 to 100 cars. In the Kaw Valley of Kansas, where from 15,000 to 16,000 acres of potatoes are planted annually, there is a need for 500 cars of seed of these two varieties. The Fort Morgan-Brush district, which produces a second early crop and is comparatively new in potato production, the Fruita section of the Western Slope of Colorado, and the San Luis Valley are in the market for 20 cars of Cobblers and 15 cars of Triumph seed. The demand for seed in these sections can be greatly increased if their seed requirements are met by the certified growers. The Greeley district, which produces about half of the main potato crop of Colorado and uses from 700 to 800 cars of seed annually, offers a large field for seed growers. This market can be developed when the commercial growers of the district are shown the economy of using certified seed. The principal variety grown is the Rural New Yorker. Most of the Ohio and Cobbler seed </seg>
            <seg id="p670">670 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture supplied to the above districts at the present time is coming from Minnesota. In Wyoming the Powell section of Park County and the irrigated valley of Goshen County offer a market for 50 cars of seed, or more, annually. The principal varieties grown in these two sections are Tri - umphs and some Cobblers. In conclusion, let me again call to your attention the importance of developing, through demonstrations, a demand for certified seed in the commercial growing sections of your own states where at the pres - ent time little, if any, is being used. Wyoming has a splendid outlet for her Cobblers in the Fort Morgan-Brush, Fruita and San Luis Valley districts of Colorado. Likewise, there can be a demand created for many times the Triumph certified seed now produced in the state in Park and Goshen Counties of Wyoming. The Nebraska certified growers also have a large market which should be developed in the irrigated sections and among growers in the eastern part of the state. In order to de - velop some of these seed markets close at home, the Nebraska Associa - tion will do well to develop some good strains of Ohios and Cobblers and increase the seed production of these two varieties. Last year Colorado produced 412 bushels of certified Rurals while approximately 1000 cars of this variety were used for seed within the state. You should continue to increase the demand for your seed in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee and Florida through the Boys and Girls Potato Clubs, with test plots at the Agricul - tural Colleges of these states and in commercial fields. With these methods, you have already well established in the minds of the growers of Louisiana the superiority of your certified seed. It is well to keep in mind when considering a program of expansion, both in the produc - tion of certified seed and the market for that seed, that its degree of su - periority is governed very largely by the rigidity of the inspection ser - vice. Careless inspection of seed, or the granting of a certificate to in - ferior stock, will restrict rather than increase your demand for certified seed. CHAIRMAN PEDHETT: Next we have a man from Kansas. I suppose he has come to see if we raise anything up here that looks good to them down there. We will hear about "Seed Potato Needs of the Kaw Valley," by E. A. Stokdyk, specialist in marketing, Kansas Agricultural College, at Man - hattan. (Applause). SEED POTATO NEEDS OF THE KAW VALLEY E. A. STOKDYK Kansas Agricultural College Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: I guess I do not classify with the spindle tuber, nor with the field run; so I meet with what some of our boys call the "swindle" tuber. (Laughter). </seg>
            <seg id="p671">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 671 My talk will be perhaps from an entirely different angle than the one that preceded me, because we are regarded as consumers of potatoes instead of producers of potatoes. It is an old saying among the potato men that Kansas buys potatoes in the spring to plant, and buys them in the fall to eat. We ship in July and August, and those same potato growers eat northern grown potatoes. We have quite a market during July and August. We fit in after the south is through and before the northern grown stock conies on. We distribute them at a time when people want potatoes badly. In Kansas, our main section is the Kaw valley. We also have a section developed in the Arkansas valley under irrigation. They have recently found that they can apply electric power to the shallow wells and pour water on good potato soil and raise mighty fine crops. Around Dod£»e City and Garden City quite an industry is springing up to de - velop potatoes under irrigation. We plant about 16,000 acres annually in the Kaw valley. We plant twenty bushels to the acre, because the soil is highly fertile and we try to keep it so. We have an abundant amount of rainfall. By apply - ing green and barnyard manure some can plant nine inches apart in the row. The average is twelve inches apart. I brought some pictures to pass around. You will notice if you try to look down the rows you can not see them. The people from other states who see the Kaw valley crop say, "You will not have many potatoes because you have all vines."' The land is worth between $300 and $500 per acre, so we must have a good yield per acre to make it pay. Our best growers claim they must have an average of 200 bushels to make a paying proposition. We have all classes of growers — some special growers who leave no stone unturned to make a good yield. We have some you might class as "medium," who do the best they know how. We have some poor growers who do not care about anything. They say "certified seed is all bunk." They are being eliminated. They are losing their farms and the better growers are buying them and making a success of them. I believe our men are becoming specialists in potato growing, because they have learned they must pay attention to lots of details. The past few years the Kaw valley has changed from Early Ohio's to Cobblers. We used to think of it as producing nothing but early Ohio's. Now we produce 95 per cent Cobblers. Sometime we get a dry spell and the Ohio's will stop growing. When we get more rain, they go to knobs. We find the Cobblers will stand more dry weather, more frost; and when leaf hoppers come in they leave the Cobblers. As far as records of yields are concerned, over the last five years where we have had the Triumph and Early Ohio and the Cobbler, the Triumph has yielded 30 bushels, the Early Ohio has yielded 100 bushels, and the Cobbler has yielded 150 bushels, on a number of different farms. I always plant a few Triumphs, but I have to cover them with papers when there is any sign of frost. A few years ago the leaf hoppers seared a few of our bigger growers, so now they plant a row </seg>
            <seg id="p672">672 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture or two of Triumphs to watch the attack of the hopper. They know they have eight or nine days to spray before the hoppers take the Cobblers. Our main source of seed has been Minnesota. The Red River Valley has supplied us with seed for a good many years. One of the first questions that came up when we started potato work in an extensive way, was to find out if other states were producing potatoes adapted to the Kaw valley. We secured seed from Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Wisconsin, North and South Dakota, and other states. In order that you will not think I am telling you anything I would not tell our own growers, I will quote from our Bulletin, No. 231, of the Kansas Agri - cultural Experiment Station. "There was a wide variation of the four strains of Early Ohio's from Nebraska. The Nebraska seed used in experiments in 1921 seemed as good as the Minnesota seed for Kansas. At the end of 'the five years' experiment, the conclusion was 'several states are growing seeds adapted to Kansas conditions.' " All states are raising some seeds that are adapted to the Kaw valley. It is not particularly Minnesota nor Nebraska nor Wyoming. We had 5 cars from Lusk, Wyoming, two years ago. They did well. This year we have had carload lots from South Dakota and Minnesota that have done well. All the states are producing some good seed. We find a great variation in the stocks grown by various growers within the state. We try to call them "stocks" because they tell us, "You have no strain. If you are going to have a distinct strain, it must come from the seed ball." You may have a seedling from a seed ball, and one man may get a Cobbler and another man something else. If all the seed came from the same seed ball, all we have is stocks. Why do some of these stocks yield differently? There is a big argu - ment about that. Some pathologists claim it is due to disease. We won't quarrel about that. We are all trying to locate stock that have superior yield. For that reason we conduct test plots every year. We are getting more particular each year. We are getting various lots of seed, selecting all about the same size and shape, quartering them, and planting thirty-two pieces in one two-rod row; then go to another part of the plot and plant thirty-two in another two-rod row to eliminate soil variation. Then you have some idea what the "possible doubt" is. We have found considerable difference in yielding power of different stocks of potatoes. This year it happened South Dakota yielded first in the replicated stock plots. We had a number of stocks that were good. We have that way of locating good stocks of seed. It is a great big job to test every grower's seed all over these different states. The best we can hope to do, is to let you fellows know what we find to be good for us. Another way we have of locating good seed is by visiting your fields both in growing and digging season. Some of our men do that. They have gone through the fields in Minnesota as soon as they had their crops dug, to see whether they found much spindle tuber or mosaic </seg>
            <seg id="p673">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 673 or black leg. They have been looking at seed mainly from the stand - point of varietal mixtures and black leg. Minnesota has been raising potatoes for us for a long time. If you wanted Green Mountains, they would put the tag on Cobblers; and if we wanted Cobblers, they would label the Green Mountains. (Laugh - ter.) It was impossible to get a pure lot of Cobblers. The Green Mountains get to be about the size of peanuts when our Cobblers are ready to dig. It makes a fellow sore. Most of our growers have come to the conclusion the best way is to depend on state certification. When certified seed first came out, the growers in our leading county in the potato industry planted about 75 per cent of their planting with certified seed. That was Shawnee county. Some of those fellows ran out of potatoes before they ran out of tags. They put a lot of certified tags on poor stuff. They had to explain. That gave certification work a black eye. It just about killed certified seed in the Kaw valley for quite a long while, until with actual demonstration we could sign up the fellows and say, "Will you take ten bushels and compare with the stuff you are getting?" "Yes." They did. In that way we have been able to win back the certified seed game. When I see the way they are obeying the rules, and the closer checks they are making on tags, I realize certified seed is winning out. Mr. Valentine talked about one of our growers who raised some seed in South Dakota. "Have you seen him lately?" "Yes." "What did he have to say?" "He said if they had not turned down that seed he would have lost all faith in it. In his opinion it was not qualified to certify. He had a good deal of respect for certification because they had turned him down." We are keeping a lookout for good seed. Before I came up here, I knew you would be interested in trying to see whether you could get into our market. I looked up the freight rate from Kimball to the Kaw valley, and also from two Minnesota points. I found the rate from Moorhead is 46% a hundred; from Hollendale it is 41c a hundred, and from Kimball to Topeka it is 38%c a hundred. So Kimball has a better rate than Minnesota points, if that is an advantage to you. We treat practically all our seed. Our soils are ideal for Rhizoc - tonia. About 11,000 acres were treated this year. From the discussion that came up here on the seed plot business, it occurs to me probably what might happen to you people is that some of the growers would become pedigreed seed men. They would make a particular study of spindle tuber and other diseases, and build them - selves a little green house, and go to college and study that particular thing, and raise seed for the rest of you that they can say absolutely </seg>
            <seg id="p674">674 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture is free from disease. Maybe that is a good thing. I doubt if you could go through all the seed plot work. Our men won't pay more than forty or fifty cents a hundred more for certified than for other seed. You can not budge them beyond that. If you can not figure to make enough money by growing a seed plot of your own and roguing and learning those troubles, it appears to me the thing would be to get one of your men and make a pedigreed seed man out of him, and have him go through this trouble so that he could provide seed for your seed plot that you would not have to pay much attention to. That may be a wild idea. Maybe Professor Werner will tell me it is. When it comes to detecting degeneration diseases, you have to check up on the expert some times. Maybe he was looking from the .standpoint of one little thing and was not taking into consideration some other factors that have to be taken into consideration. It may be some of you men will become pedigreed seed growers to raise certified seed for our growers in Kansas. I thank you. (Applause). Discussion Q. When do your Kaw valley growers desire delivery on seed ? A. That varies year by year. Our men buy potatoes in spring and plant in the fall to eat. The problem comes up, "Shall we buy this fall or wait until spring?" We took a tip from Minnesota that showed from a comparative study of their prices year by year, they lost money by holding the potatoes, over an average period of years, if they figured shrinkage, interest, taxes, and loss from decay. This year our men jumped in early. We got the forecast in September and called our grow - ers' attention, and they bought pretty heavily this year. Ordinarily they buy one-half in the fall and one-half in the spring. Our better growers are beginning to buy in the fall for several reasons. First, they get the best pick in the fall. Another reason is some are beginning to treat their seed and dry it and put it in the cellar, and it is all done. The third reason is they are sure they have it. Once in a while, even if they have it contracted for, they can not get it. Q. They will receive seed in the fall ? A. Yes; about one-half the stuff. Q. Do you plant as high as twenty bushels to the acre ? A. Yes. Q. How close? A. Some are planted nine inches apart in the row. The rows are thirty-two inches wide. Q. How big will your potatoes be when planted so close ? A. They get pretty good size. We try to get them to make the 400-bushel block. One grower missed about four bushels, and another about eight bushels. </seg>
            <seg id="p675">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 675 Q. You stated they planted 500 cars in the Kaw valley. How many in the state of Kansas ? A. We have something like 60,000 acres of potatoes scattered all over the state. Outside of the Kaw valley, an average of twelve bushels to the acre is planted. The county farm agent would see a dealer gets in a car or two of certified seed. They divide it. That has helped out a lot. Q. That's the market for our potatoes. It is bought every year. A. Western Kansas uses a lot of your table stock. Adjournment was then declared until 9:30 a.m., Friday.

For fear I would too far overrun the time allotted, I have written out what I intend to say. It is difficult to follow a manuscript and a bunch of charts at the same time. If the Secretary sees fit to use the manuscript which is prepared, it will probably not be just what I say. Those of you who get the report and hear me this morning will have your choice of which of the things you want to believe. We are interested in soils because of the crops which can be grown upon them. The farmer handles his soil in the way which he thinks will give him the largest crop yields for the effort expended. In dis - cussing the management of western Nebraska soils it is necessary there - fore that we include a discussion of western Nebraska crops. Since the weather is perhaps the most important element in determining the suc - cess or failure of crops in western Nebraska it will be necessary also to say something about the weather. My subject, therefore, might appro - priately have been called, "Soil, Crops, and Weather in Western Ne - braska." The weather is a thing beyond our control. Out of it comes those conditions of temperature and moisture by which crops are sus - tained. Out of it also frequently come conditions of temperature ex - tremes and moisture deficiencies which make the growing of crops dif - ficult or impossible. In western Nebraska there has always been some rain. A good deal of the time the supply is deficient; occasionally it is adequate; very rarely is it excessive. There is no evidence at hand indicating that these conditions have changed in the years past or that they are apt to change in the future. The problem of western Nebraska soil management must then be builded about water economy. Those cropping systems and tillage practices which in the long run make the best use of the limited supply of moisture available will produce the greatest crop yields. Whether such systems and practices are perma - nently adopted or not will depend also upon their practicability. That is, if an increase in cost is involved, whether this increase will be justi - fied by the returns secured. When the moisture supply is limited and uncertain there is an ele - ment of risk or chance involved which is unavoidable. There is no cure-all for the ills of dry farming. No cropping system or tillage prac - tice has as yet been discovered 1 which will always work. In western Nebraska the season of highest average rainfall is during the summer months, that is during the growing season of crops. May, June and </seg>

            <seg id="p678">678 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture July are the high months, with the amounts tapering off both ways to the low points of December, January, February. The average monthly rainfall at North Platte is shown on Chart 2, in the upper left hand quarter. The monthly rainfall in comparison with the normal for 1922, 1923 and 1924, is shown on the other three quarters of the chart. The monthly rainfall variations in these three years and their de - parture from the normal show the shifting nature of the occurrence of drouth. The 50-year average annual rainfall at North Platte is 18.6 inches. In 1922 the total was 18.3 inches, in 1923 the total was 26.8 inches, in 1924 16.10 inches. In totals then the three years represent an average year, a year of excess rainfall and a deficient year. In month to month performance none of them approach the normal very closely. Let us see how these variations effected crop production. Taking up first the case of winter wheat we find low yields in 1922 and 1923 and a very good yield in 1924. In the fall of 1921 moisture conditions were favorable. Wheat got a good start and came through the winter with good stands. Spring growth was rapid but the severe June drouth left the crop without sufficient moisture to reach its full development. On summer tilled ground enough moisture was carried over to make fair yields. On early plowing the same condition held true in less de - gree. The average yields in 1922 were only about 60% of normal al - though the rainfall for the year was normal. The June drouth was followed by heavy rains in July. Corn made a heavy growth and dried the ground out thoroughly during the drier months of August and Septem - ber so that there was very little moisture available at wheat seeding time in the fall. Stubble fields not early plowed or disked became badly infested with weeds and were likewise dry by winter wheat seeding time in the fall of 1922. In most cases wheat seeded after corn and on late tilled stubble ground did not germinate until November. It was then too late for fall growth to occur and in many cases the plants did not emerge until spring. A cold dry spring in 1923 delayed development and many fields were abandoned. Where the stands were sufficient to leave, the growth was slow. The May-June rainfall was above normal and wheat was slow in ripening. These conditions favored the development of rust and the rust epi - demic of that year will be long remembered. Late wheat was almost a total loss. On summer tilled ground and early plowing some fair yields were secured. At North Platte the yields on fallow ranged from 25 to 40 bushels per acre. On early fall plowing from 16 to 20 bushels. The average yield was only about 70% of normal, while the total rainfall was much above normal. In the late summer and fall of 1923 conditions were again favorable for moisture storage. As in 1921 there was ample moisture on all methods of tillage to cause good germination and growth in the fall. There were good stands on all methods of tillage and practically no winter killing occurred. Heavy snows and rain occurred in March 1924. </seg>
            <seg id="p679">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 679 April was very dry, but wheat made a rapid early growth on the re - serve moisture supply of March. May and June were somewhat low in moisture but the supply was adequate in those cases where tillage the previous summer had made possible a reserve of moisture in the subsoil. In this case the stage was set to bring a rich reward to the man who had plowed early the previous summer. Table 1 shows yields secured at the North Platte Substation. In all cases the yields are on land which was in small grain in 1923. The yields given in the first column are those secured on land which was plowed about September 10. That is just before the wheat was seeded. The yields shown in the second column are from land plowed the latter part of July. The yields on early plowing are the highest ever secured at the North Platte Substation on land that had been cropped the pre - vious year. They compare very favorably with the yields on summer tilled land which are shown in the third column of the table. The upper and lower parts of the chart which are averaged separately, are from different fields. In one case the variety used was Turkey Red, in the other Kanred. The marked differences between late and early plowing are obviously due to the unusually favorable conditions for moisture storage on the early plowing in the fall of 1923. In this case a tillage period beginning about the third week of July was nearly as effective in storing moisture and producing conditions favorable for crop growth as one extending through the entire year. This is, of course, an unusual condition. If it were to be expected every year, we could afford to plow early at almost any cost. How different the results of a tillage practice may be in different years is shown by comparing Table 1 and 2. The results in the two cases were secured by exactly the same tillage practices. The plats were located in the same way and the same varieties of wheat were used. In one case the yield after early plowing was over three times that after late plowing. In the other case the yields were about equal. In 1924 the yield after early plowing was 90 percent of the yield after summer tillage, while in 1925 it was only 25 percent. It is evident then that while tillage may be a very potent factor in controlling crop yields, that very much depends upon the conditions under which it is done, and that seasonal effects may at one time make a practice at one time seem unusually promising and the same practice at another time appear wholly worthless. This emphasizes the danger of drawing conclusions from only one or a few years' experience. </seg>

The plats are treated the same in all respects except for time of plowing. The late plowed plat received no cultivation until shortly before seeding time in the fall. The early plowed plat is plowed as soon after harvest as conditions will permit, and is kept clean of weeds until seeding time. The average yields are 12.8 and 18.2 bushels per acre or 5.4 bushels per acre in favor of the early plowing. In the 14 years period the higher yields occurred on late plowing only three times, 1917, 1919, and 1925. The yields in 1920 were equal. In the 10 years in which the yields on early plowing were ahead the amounts have varied greatly. The benefits from early plowing as has already been said depend upon the conditions under which the plow - ing is done, the amount of rainfall during the interval between the early and late plowing and the amount of weed growth on the land left for late plowing. Going back again to 1922 on the rainfall chart, let us follow through the seasonal effect on corn. Corn in contrast to wheat depends largely upon the rainfall of the growing season for its development. Moisture stored in advance is usually less effective than in the case of wheat. Corn does not require much moisture until about the first week in July. Very favorable conditions early in the season are sometimes detrimental; .912 ! .913 .914 .915 7.2 3.2 3.3 39.7 .916 23.5 .917 .918 5.0 4.0 .919 920 19.8 21.2 921 .922 .923 18.5 4.8 5.7 924 925 16.3 7.2 </seg>
            <seg id="p682">682 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture the result being a large vegetative growth which requires an excessive amount of water for its support later in the season. The June drouth of 1922, which cut the wheat crop short, was thus a benefit to corn. Heavy early growth was prevented and the abundant moisture of July caused a good development of ears. Yields were about 75 percent above normal. TABLE 4 Average yearly yields of corn and winter wheat at North Platte Experimental Substation, 1912 to 1925. The year 1923 was a banner year for corn at the North Platte Sub - station. There was no lack of moisture at any time during the growing season. Temperatures were favorable and the crop matured well. Yields ranged from 30 to 67 bushels per acre. The average was about 2% times the normal. In 1924 the average rainfall for May, June, July and August was about 2 inches per month, a total of 8 inches well distributed. In 1923 the average was close to 4 inches per month, a total of about 16 inches well distributed. The 1923 total moisture for May, June, July and August was almost exactly twice that of 1924 and the resulting corn yield was almost exactly twice that of the 1924. In 1925 the 4 months total was over 9 inches, but 5% inches of this came during May and June. Corn made a heavy early growth. July rainfall dropped to 1 1-3 inches and the crop burned badly. August rainfall of 2% inches came too late to be of much benefit.

            <seg id="p683">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 683 ture in May, June, July and August but with an unfavorable distribution produced less than one-half as much corn as the season of 1924. The annual average yields and 14 year average yields of corn and winter wheat on one of the crop rotation fields at the North Platte Sub - station are shown on Table 4. Corn leads wheat for the average of the period by 2.6 bushels per acre. In pounds per acre; comparing shelled corn and wheat, the difference is only 89 pounds per acre in favor of corn. It is of interest to note that honors are evenly divided in number of years that each crop has been in the lead. Corn outyielded wheat in 1912 and the six consecutive years from 1918 to 1923 inclusive. Wheat out - yielded corn each year from 1913 to 1918 inclusive and in 1924 and 1925. Yields of both crops were unprofitable in 1913, 1914, 1917, and 1925. Yields of both crops were above their 14-year average in 1919, 1920, 1921, and 1924. The crops thus moved up together four times and down to - gether four times in 14 years. Six times in 14 years a good yield of one or the other was associated with a poor yield of the other. It is in the shifting effect of seasonal variations on crop yields, the ascendency of first one and then another crop, that we find the strongest argument for the use of more than one crop in a dry farming cropping system. Another is better distribution of farm labor. If the crops are grown in rotation the control of weeds, crop diseases, and injurious in - sects is also made more effective. There is also a benefit, in the control of fertility, as different crops have different requirements and draw upon the plant food elements in different ways. The adoption of a crop rotation system requires that two or several crops be grown, but it also necessitates that some balance be maintained in crop acreages. It is particularly desirable to keep some balance be - tween the acreages of cultivated or intertilled and uncultivated crops. This is difficult in regions where crop yields are uncertain and variable, not only because the failure of one crop and reseeding to another fre - quently disturbs plans and proportions but because the success or failure ure of a crop and its price fluctuations have such an influence on the popularity of that crop with the farmer. A success of one crop and a failure of another, almost always results in the planting of an increased acreage of the one and a decrease of the other. This is particularly true if the price of the successful crop happens to be high. Table 5, shows for Eimball County the acreages of corn and winter wheat, their acre yields, the acreages of intertilled crops, and grain crops and the percent of intertilled crops to the total from 1918 to 1924 inclusive. The figures are typical not only of Kimball County but of much sim - ilar territory in Western Nebraska and bordering states. They show a considerable shifting in crop acreages from year to year a strong pre - dominence of grain crops, especially winter wheat, over the cultivated or intertilled crops. </seg>

It has brought more dollars into this territory than any other one crop. It has done more to boost land values than any other one crop. It has also been the cause of much financial distress. It has not only been the favorite crop of the plunger and agricultural gambler, but has led many level headed men somewhat astray. It would be futile to argue that it is not a good crop, or that it is not well adapted to the conditions of the territory. It would not have held the place that it has for the time that it has if it had not made a favorable showing in comparison with the other crops grown. The only trouble has been that too many farmers have pinned their faith to it too exclusively. According to the table there were 21,000 acres of wheat in Kimball County in 1918. By 1921 the acreage had gone up to 80,000. That is it was almost quadrupled in 4 years. The corn acreage in the meanwhile was only a little more than doubled. Yields in 1921 suffered a severe drop over those of 1920. The price also suffered a heavy decline. The acreage for 1922 was cut to 66,000. Yields were again low and the price remained low. The figures indicate a very heavy reduction in acreage for 1923, but this is partly due to abandonment on account of winterkilling and reseeding to other crops and partly due to abandon - ment at harvest time on account of the rust epidemic. The rust epidemic was largely responsible for the low yield, and the large acreage of corn planted was the result of planting corn on fields where wheat winter killed. Farmers who planted their wheat to corn made a wise guess. They were rewarded by an unusually good corn yield. This good corn yield and the wheat failure created much enthusiasm for corn. In 1924 the winter wheat acreage remained rather low and corn held up well. As compared with 1923 however corn yields dropped from 25 to 15 bushels and winter wheat yields went up from 6 to 17 bushels, wheat .918 I .919 I ;920 I Ml 6 10 10 14 19 17 20 19. 21 41 53 an 14 14 19 19 8 12 11 ifl 59 69 68 inn I 12 15 14 13 .922 .923 .924 14 25 23 16 25 15 66 23 37 10 6 17 15 29 25 82 71 71 15 29 26 Year Ave : 18 13 </seg>
            <seg id="p685">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 685 prices also made a good recovery. At a corn show in Deuel County in 1923 I was told by several farmers who had been heavy wheat growers that they were abandoning the crop entirely and going in for corn. In 1924 at the same place, the come back of wheat both in yield and price, and the much poorer yield of corn, made it difficult to keep up enthusiasm for corn. Many new converts to corn were returning to their old first love for wheat. I do not know what they are doing this fall but I have not heard of a corn show in that town. I shall not attempt to say what proportion of wheat or corn or any other crops the farmers in western Nebraska should grow. I am con - vinced, however, that there is a real need in this part of the state for a larger proportion of intertilled crops such as corn and potatoes. I do not know what this proportion should be but I am convinced that agriculture would be on a safer basis to continue with 25 to 30 percent of intertilled crops as in 1923 and 1924 than to go back to 12 to 15 per - cent as was the case from 1918 to 1922. Without doubt a certain shifting of crop acreages to meet price fluctuations and to replace wheat when winter killing occurs, is also necessary. I am convinced, however, that some of the shifting has been more the result of fancy than necessity, and as the advantages of crop rotations and certain tillage practices become better understood that there will be fewer violent changes made.

            <seg id="p686">686 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture I wish next to call attention to some effects of crop sequence. That is what effects some crops have upon the yields of the crops following them. Table 6, gives winter wheat yields after winter wheat after corn and after summer tillage at the North Platte Experimental Substation. Of the two plats of wheat after wheat, one is early fall plowed and the other late fall plowed. The same plats are used as in Table 3, but in this case the yields of the two plats are averaged. The yields after corn are from two nearby rotations, one of oats, corn and winter wheat, the other of field peas, oats, corn and winter wheat. The four plats after summer tillage are from the same field. In one case wheat alter - nates with fallow, in the other three cases wheat follows fallow in rota - tion of three, four, and five year length. For the 14 year period the average yield of wheat after corn was 4 bushels per acre more than the yield after wheat. On a percentage basis this is an increase of 26 percent. The increase after summer til - lage was 9.8 bushels or 68 percent. The average yield after corn was therefore near the midway line between the yields after wheat and sum - mer tillage. There is a considerable variation from year to year, but only one year, 1915, in which the yield after wheat was above that after corn. There were only two other years, 1922 and 1923, in which the gain on corn ground was less than 1 bushel per acre. The effects of intertilled crops on the yields of oats following were similar to those with wheat. Table 7 gives the average yields of 5 plats of oats after wheat, 8 plats of oats after corn, 4 plats of oats after potatoes and 1 plat of oats after summer tillage from 1912 to 1925 inclusive. In the 14 years yields of oats after corn exceeded those after wheat 10 times. The average gain for the corn land was 4.2 bushels per acre or 17.5 percent. The yield after potatoes exceeded that after wheat 11 times. The average gain was 8.6 bushels per acre, or 36 per - cent. The average yield of oats following the two intertilled crops was therefore about midway between the yields after wheat and after sum - mer tillage. </seg>

The 10-year average gains for the corn land were 1.5 bushels for spring wheat and 2.9 bushels for oats, the percentages of gain were 13.3 for wheat and 14.1 for oats. There seems to be ample evidence indicating that intertilled crops exert a beneficial influence on the grain crops which follow, and that substantial yield increases can be expected over those secured where grain is grown continuously. If we could show a like benefit to the intertilled crop when it follows small grain the case for the rota- tion of crops would be complete. The chief cause of increased yields of small grains after intertilled crops seems to be that the intertilled crops exhaust soil moisture less completely than the grain crops, thus more frequently leaving a residue of moisture which can be used by the succeeding crop. In the work conducted at the Scotts Bluff Substation for a 7-year period the average amount of moisture to a depth of six feet, in the spring, after corn over that to the same depth after wheat was equiva- lent to 1.68 inches. This moisture would be beneficial in carrying through the succeeding crop whether it be grain or another intertilled o. of Plats... 5 After After Corn After After S. Till. Year Wheat Potatoes </seg>
            <seg id="p688">688 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture crop. Thus at the North Platte Substation yields of corn after corn have been more than the yields of corn after small grain. On two plats which have grown corn continuously the 14 year average yield is 23.9 bushels per acre. In two nearby 3-year rotations where corn fol - lows two years of small grain the average yields were 21.3 bushels per acre. The gain of the continuously cropped corn land was thus 2.6 bushels per acre or 12.2 percent. In stover yields however the yields from the two cropping systems are reversed. Stover yields of corn after corn averaged for the 14-year period 2038 pounds per acre, while the average stover yield after small grain was 2533 pounds per acre. The stover yield after corn was thus 495 pounds or 19.5 percent less than the stover yield after small grain. Just why stover yields should be depressed and ear yields increased when corn is grown continuously on the same ground is difficult to explain. The comparisons in this case have been continued for a sufficient length of time however and have been sufficiently consistant from year to year so that there seems to be little doubt of their accuracy. Where ear yields alone are considered the gain from growing corn continu - ously are insufficient to offset the benefits to the small grains from growing the crops in rotation. All crops considered there is then an advantage in growing corn and the small grains in rotation rather than growing corn after corn and small grain after small grain where both are included in the cropping system. Another advantage in rotating crops is economy in preparation of the land. Seeding of winter wheat in corn stalks, even if the seeding is preceded by an extra cultivation is much cheaper than plowing and preparing grain stubble. In the experiments at both North Platte and Scotts Bluff thorough disking of corn land has been about as effective as plowing as a prepara - tion for spring grains. There is some increase in cost in preparing stubble land for corn over preparing corn land for corn, when fall disk - ing of the stubble land is necessary to control weed growth. This is offset to some extent however by the cost of clearing the corn land of stalks or the inconvenience of cultivation when the stalks are left on. So far in the discussion we have made only incidental reference to summer tillage. We will now examine the results secured by this prac - tice a little more directly and carefully, to see what light they may throw on its value and practicability in western Nebraska agriculture. In so far as we know there are no published figures on the amount of land being summer tilled in western Nebraska at the present time. General observation leads one to believe that the practice has increased a good deal in the past few years. I shall not hazard a prediction as to whether it will continue to increase or not. Summer tilling is the only practice so far devised by which the wheat farmer can break the spell of declining yields without adopting crop rotation. Wheat is a wonderful new land crop. As the farmer with the plow has moved westward across the Mississippi valley, onto the plains and toward the slopes of the Rockies, his main first crop has </seg>
            <seg id="p689">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 689 everywhere been wheat. As the land became older wheat yields de - clined, other crops were substituted and a diversified type of farming including live stock was adopted. As the frontier was pushed further into the region of limited rainfall however the number of crops which could be substituted successfully for wheat became more limited. Also in recent years the wide open spaces of the plains have been attractive fields for the use of specialized machinery. The tractor, with plow or disk, harrow, packer, and drill hitched in series, combines preparation and seeding in one operation. Some months later the tractor pulls the combine over the same field and the twice over farmer has completed his year's work. This machinery has made possible the so-called "suit case" or "vacation farmer;" the man who is attempting to accomplish the ideal of Henry Ford in doing all necessary farm work in 20 days in order that he may have the remaining 345 for self-improvement, recreation and an opportunity to spend his money. It is difficult for this type of farmer to see the merits of diversified farming and crop rotation systems. His tractor does not work well in a corn field, neither can it consume crops, the market value of which has been impaired by unfavorable weather but which may have considerable value as forage. By slight modifications or additions to his machinery he can however, by adding a few more days to his year's work, summer till a part of his land and possibly stay in the wheat game.

            <seg id="p690">690 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Summer tillage in regions of limited rainfall has as its purpose the storage of moisture in the soil. It aims to carry over in the soil a part of the moisture of one season to supplement that of the next season in supplying the needs of the crop. Just what percent of the rainfall may be caught and carried over in this way depends upon several fac - tors. Among these are the depth and carrying capacity for moisture of the soil, and the nature and distribution of the rainfall. The table - land soils at the North Platte Substation are typical of much of the upland soil of Western Nebraska, roughly classed as hard soils to dis - tinguish them from the sand hill soils. The Substation soils are cap - able of storing from 1 to about 1% inches of water for each foot in depth. Within the upper six feet which is about the average feeding depth of ordinary crop plants these soils are capable of storing from 6 to 9 inches of water. This is only one-third to one-half of the aver - age annual rainfall, but in actual practice it is only occasionally that this amount is stored. The reason for this is that so large a proportion of the rainfall comes in light showers. These wet the soil to only a few inches in depth and much of the moisture is evaporated out by wind and sunshine before it has time to penetrate to a depth where these agencies act with less force. An isolated rain of less than % inch may afford some relief to crops but is of very little value in stor - ing moisture in the soil. A striking example of varying seasonal ef - fects upon the 'storage of soil moisture is furnished by the seasons 1923 and 1924. The number of days upon which rain was recorded at North Platte, from April 1 to September 30 was almost the same for the two years, being 57 for 1923 and 54 for 1924. The 1923 total for the period was 23.54 inches and the 1924 total 10.89 inches. The difference was not much in the number of rains as in their size. The 1923 average amount of water which fell per rain was .41 inches in 1924 the amount was .20 inch. In 1923 there were 14 rains in which more than % inch of water fell. In 1924 there were only 7. In 1923 from the first week in April to the last of July land being summer tilled accumulated 6.2 inches of water in the upper 6 feet of soil. This amounted to 35 per - cent of the rainfall for that period. In 1924 for the same period there was no storage of moisture at all in the summer tillage. The total amount of moisture in the upper six feet of soil being .3 inches less at the end than at the beginning of the period. Table 8 shows for 11 different periods varying in length from 11 to 14 months, inches of precipitation for the period, inches of moisture stored to a depth of 6 feet in summer tilled ground, and the percent of the total stored. The most efficient storage was for 11 months period ending in July 1923 when 9 inches out of 21.6 inches, or 39.8 percent, were stored. The least efficient storage was for the 12 months ending in July 1916 when only 8.6 percent of the precipitation was stored. This was due in part to the wet season of 1915 having left a good storage of moisture in the soil at harvest time and thus reducing its capacity for additional storage. The average amount stored for the 11 periods was 28 percent. </seg>
            <seg id="p691">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 691 These figures do not indicate that it is possible to store within reach of the crop a very large proportion of the rainfall. Crops grown in summer tilled land may be benefitted in a much greater ratio than that of the water stored. With even a small amount of reserve moisture stored in the subsoil crops may be able to grow more continuously and normally than is the case when they are entirely dependent upon the rainfall of the growing season. When growth is continuous and normal there is a more efficient use of water, than is the case where growth is occasionally checked by dry weather. Table 9 shows available water, that is stored moisture plus rain - fall, yields of winter wheat in bushels per acre and the amount of water available for each bushel of grain produced, on adjoining plats after wheat and summer tillage at the North Platte Experimental Substation for 11 years. The average amount of available water in these years was 17.3 inches where wheat followed wheat. Where wheat followed summer tillage 23.1 inches were available. The increase due to summer tillage was 5.8 inches or 25 percent. The average yields were 11.3 and 25.8 bushels per acre, an increase of 128 percent. The amount of water available for each bushel of wheat produced ranged from .59 inch to 4.29 inches after wheat and from .54 inch to 1.73 inches after summer tillage. The average amounts used were 1.53 inches and .89 inch.

            <seg id="p692">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 692 It is apparent that anything which checks the normal development of the plant increases the water used per unit of crop produced. In 1915 a better yield was produced after wheat with 23.4 inches of water available than after summer tillage with 28.7 inches available. This was due to heavy lodging rust and imperfect filling on the summer tilled ground. The showing for summer tillage is somewhat more favorable when judged by the averages of Table 9 than by those of Table 3. This is due to the omission of the years 1911, 1919, 1920 and 1921 from Table 9. Good yields were secured on continuously cropped land in three of those years. They are omitted from Table 9 because moisture determin - ations were not made in such a way that comparisons could be made with the other years. In comparison with continuously cropped land late fall plowed, sum - mer tillage has slightly more than doubled the average yields of winter wheat at North Platte. In 14 years the yields have been more than doubled 9 times. At Scotts Bluff the 10-year average yield of winter wheat from continuous cropping was 6.2 bushels and after summer til - lage 16.7 bushels. At Scotts Bluff summer tillage failed to double con - tinuously cropped yields only twice in 10 years. It would seem then that in so far as these tests represent conditions in western Nebraska that it would be more profitable to summer till than to plow late and grow wheat continuously on the same land. About as much wheat would be raised by summer tilling half the land each year as by cropping all of it. There would be a saving of half the seed. There would only be half as much land to cover in seeding and harvesting but this would be about offset by the additional cultivation necessary to keep the summer tilled ground free from weeds during the summer. In comparison with continuously cropped land early fall plowed, summer tillage at North Platte has increased winter wheat yields an average of only 7.5 bushels or 42 percent. On this basis a field of 100 acres, if half were cropped and half summer tilled each year would produce 575 bushels less wheat than if it were all early fall plowed and continuously cropped. The average yield of winter wheat after corn at North Platte is given in Table 6 as 19.5 bushels per acre. This is 5.8 bushels below the yield after summer tillage. In Table 4 the average corn yield for the same years at North Platte is given as 22.2 bushels per acre. With these yields as a basis of comparison between growing wheat alone under a summer tillage system and wheat and corn in rotation we get results as follows. One hundred acres one-half summer tilled and half in wheat would produce 1265 bushels of wheat. One hundred acres half in corn and half in wheat would produce 1110 bushels of corn and 975 bushels of wheat. That is the first 100 acres would produce 290 bushels more wheat than the second. The second 100 acres would pro - duce 1110 bushels more corn than the first. Each bushel of wheat gained by the summer tillage system was therefore purchased at a cost of 3.8 </seg>
            <seg id="p693">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 693 bushels of corn it would have been possible to produce had corn and wheat been grown in rotation. At Scotts Bluff over a 10-year period each bushel of wheat gained by summer tilling was offset by 3.3 bushels of corn from the corn-wheat rotation. Summer tillage has everywhere made its best showing when used as a preparation for winter wheat. In practically all cases the responses have been less with spring grains than with winter wheat, while the responses with corn have been even less. About the only place that the experimental results reported have shown summer tillage to be profitable is in comparison with continuous cropping of wheat where it is not possible to plow early. The practice has merit for the exclusive wheat farmer, and to a less extent for the general farmer who wishes to grow more wheat than corn, especially in those years when corn ground is very dry and storage of moisture slight, even on early plowing. Considerable advance has been made in recent years in the methods of handling summer tilled land. Control of weeds is of the utmost im - portance and very difficult to accomplish if not given attention at the proper times. The disk is quite effective in controlling weeds on stubble ground after harvest. It is even better to miss some of the weeds than to fall plow land to be summer tilled the following season. This is especially true on soils which are apt to blow. In the spring we find that it is best to gain control weed growth as long as possible by disk - ing and to delay plowing until the latter part of June or early in July. By this time much of the weed seed has germinated and been destroyed and as consequence not much further work is required to keep the land clean. The disk is a poor implement to use on plowed ground. Its pulverizing action leaves the surface so fine that water does not pene - trate readily and blowing is also much more apt to occur. Shovel cul - tivations which leave the surface somewhat rough and open are much superior to the disk for killing weeds after plowing. Summing up the phases of soil management and crop reactions upon which this discussion has touched, we would make the following con - clusions: There is an element of risk in farming under limited and varying rainfall, which no system of tillage or soil management will wholly overcome. Among the practices which in the long run seem most prom - ising are: 1. Diversification of crops to distribute risks. 2. Rotation of crops, with a fair balance between intertilled and un- cultivated crops. 3. Early fall plowing or disking to control weed growth as soon as possible after harvest, in order that moisture may be stored for the crops of the following year. 4. The use of summer tillage only as a supplementary measure where the use of intertilled crops is insufficient to maintain a balance in the rotation. </seg>
            <seg id="p694">694 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture PRESIDENT PHELPS: I am wondering if you would like to ask some questions on these in - teresting facts brought out? Discussion Q. I did not hear all the discussion. Has any work been done in regard to the nitrate content of soils or food supplies after summer fallowing ? A. We have done a limited amount. We find a heavy accumula - tion of nitrates usually after summer tillage. In some cases we have greatly increased the nitrate development after early plowing. These studies are so fragmentary we are not saying very much about them. The great trouble with the nitrate problem seems to be the development of methods so that they can depend upon results which they do get. In those years we have made determinations, we have found high nitrate development in fallow land in the fall, and a very much higher rate of nitrification in western lands than in the eastern part of the state. Q. At Lincoln when we follow summer tillage with corn, the corn ears out slowly in the spring. Does it work that way with you? That is not practised except in an experimental way, but summer fallow re - tards the early development of the crop. The corn to begin is not as promising looking as following some other crop. A. That has been the result practically everywhere I know where corn has been grown on fallow. Our average yields for nineteen years with corn on fallow have been only three bushels more on fallow ground than on continuous corn ground. There is a retarding of early growth on fallow. We find this yellow color. Later in the season the corn will usually make a higher yield on fallow. This year we had thirty-five bushels per acre on fallow and eight bushels on continuous crop land, but that is an unusual difference. Our average yields in our part are twenty-five bushels on fallow, and twenty-three on continuous crop land. PRESIDENT PHELPS: We have with us Dr. T. A. Kiesselbach. IMPROVED FARM CROPS T. A. KIESSELBACH Professor of Experimental Agronomy, University of Nebraska, Lincoln Aside from proper tillage and crop sequence, practices and favorable weather conditions, as Mr. Zook has just brought out in his discussion, the success of our crop production depends pretty largely upon the use of suitable seed. Except through our cultural practices we can do little to adapt the environment or conditions to the needs of the crop, but we can do a great deal through the choice of crops by way of adapting the crop to the environment. As we proceed westward in Nebraska these crops should ordinarily be selected for relative earliness and small </seg>
            <seg id="p695">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 695 vegetative size. These characters fit them for relatively low water sup - ply and short growing season. In the eastern part of the state we are confronted by the same problems as compared with the states farther east where the rainfall is still greater and the growing season longer. Nebraska has made great progress during the last 30 years — in fact during the farming years of most of you here — in providing new and more productive crops. I recall when I was a boy on the farm in Custer County, Nebraska, we were growing Bluestem Spring Wheat. Probably many of you men were also growing this variety in early days. Now it is no longer being grown anywhere in the state. It is unsuitable to our conditions, being too late ripening. We were probably growing this sort because it was popular in more northern states and had re - ceived considerable publicity. This late type of spring wheat has now been entirely replaced by early and far better adapted sorts. Such var - ieties as Marquis, Java, Preston, and some good Durums yield nearly double as much as Bluestem under our conditions. In the pioneer days, not so many years ago, a great deal of large late ripening oats was also being grown. We were growing them be - cause they did unusually well in Canada where they produced large heavy grain. When grown in a favorable northern oat climate this late type is especially well suited, but not so in Nebraska. We are now growing small early ripening varieties with far greater success. The change was brought about a quarter century ago, following the introduction of the early variety known as Kherson from the province of Kherson, Rus - sia. Now 90 per cent of all oats grown in Nebraska are of the Kherson or similar early varieties. The extensive substitution of winter wheat for spring wheat in this state affords a most striking example of the wholesale substitution of better crops. Spring wheat was grown almost exclusively prior to 1890 and in this western portion of the state prior to 1900. The bringing of seed of the Turkey Red winter variety by persecuted Mennonite emi - grants from Russia, paved the way for this change. The Turkey Red wheat ripened earlier, rusted less and yielded far more than spring wheat, and the wheat industry of the state was revolutionized. The problem of growing corn varieties adapted to the local condi - tions has been more serious than with the small grains. Corn is so much more variable, and being a late-summer ripening crop, is subject to frost damage in the fall. General recognition of the decided disad - vantage of growing poorly adapted corn has been a matter of rather gradual growth. For many years there was a strong inclination for the corn grower to send farther east for his seed corn or to pick a type of seed which resembled the corn grown in the more favorable corn sec - tions of the country. The result was plants which grew too large vege - tatively and therefore suffered unduly from insufficient water supply. Such plant types also ripened too late and produced light yields of soft and chaffy corn. We were inclined to send to Iowa for the "Mortgage Lifter" variety because we liked the name, but it was too late for our </seg>
            <seg id="p696">696 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture conditions and did not fulfil its purpose. We actually lifted the mort - gage when we realized the importance of corn adaptation and began growing local varieties which represented a better balance between the local conditions and the crop requirements. The general adoption of alfalfa into the family of Nebraska crops during the last 25 to 30 years marks a distinct stride of progress in the agricultural prosperity of the state. This crop thrives in nearly all sections. Its introduction solved the cattle feeding problem. Alfalfa not only is unexcelled in the production of high yielding and high qual - ity forage, but also has a highly beneficial effect upon the soil pro - ductivity in all eastern localities. I realize that in western sections of relative moisture shortage its profitable production and rotation value is more largely restricted to the low lying and the irrigated land. The state now grows 1% million acres of alfalfa. Sweet clover is the latest crop to be introduced and has met with widespread approval. It has an extremely valuable place among our forage plants, especially for pasture and rotation purposes. It used to be thought that cattle would not eat sweet clover. You seldom hear that suggestion any more. No great difficulty is experienced if the cattle are turned out to pasture while the sweet clover is still young and tender. Sweet clover is now grown to the extent of a quarter million acres in Nebraska and this has all been brought about in the last 15 years. From this little review it is clearly seen that the search for better adapted crops and their introduction into extensive farm use has been of tremendous value to the state. Together with this successful search for better crops a second move - ment has been active at the same time, to further improve these crops through selection and breeding practices. This has been an effort on the part of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, various State Experi - ment Stations and individual crop growers. When one considers, that nearly 8,000,000 acres of corn, 3,500,000 acres of wheat, and 2,500,000 acres of oats, as well as other crops, are grown in Nebraska alone, it is easy to see what a tremendous addition to the wealth of the state may be derived from any practice which will increase the average acre yield of grain even 1 bushel. It is generally recognized that the work of the Agricultural Ex - periment Station has added more than this amount per acre through its crop improvement projects and development of principles pertaining to the selection of seed. It is an increased production which comes not only one year, but each successive year. As a result of small grain breeding, Kanred and Nebraska No. 60 and Nebraska No. 6 winter wheat have been developed and have very extensively replaced the Common Turkey Red previously grown in this state. The chief merits of these improved wheats is their superior yield. Higher yield is largely the result of some one or more qualities such as superior winter resistance, rust resistance or other intangible </seg>
            <seg id="p697">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 697 physiological difference. These three wheats at the present time merit being the most popular of all sorts grown in Nebraska, because they do yield better and are satisfactory from the standpoint of milling and baking quality. Each of these strains originated from a single kernel of grain in a wheat breeding nursery. The Kanred of course must be credited to the Kansas Experiment Station. Marquis spring wheat which is now the most popular variety of this crop, originated in a breeding nursery of the Canadian Government. Superior yielding varieties of barley have been developed and dis - tributed by several State Experiment Stations. Barley merits greater use in western Nebraska. The development of smooth bearded produc - tive sorts should help popularize this crop. Nebraska 21 oats is an extensively grown superior yielding selection made from ordinary Kherson oats by the Nebraska Experiment Station. It has averaged several bushels higher yield than the original Kherson during a period of years. Not only does it yield more but it also has a better grain color. You have all had experience with the winter killing of alfalfa. The artificial breeding of superior strains of this crop has proved a more difficult undertaking than with small grains. But very distinct differ - ences in hardiness have been discovered for the alfalfa obtained from various sources. In general, northern grown seed is more hardy than southern grown. The western Nebraska Common alfalfa finds greater favor throughout the country. Seed grown in this or more northern states is usually satisfactory under our conditions. But seed introduced from such countries as Argentina, Italy, Spain, Peru, and extreme southern United States, is decidedly unhardy. Nevertheless it has been extensively planted in this state without the farmer being aware of its origin. This will account for much of the winter-killing experienced in recent years. The solution is to insist on home grown or northern grown seed. The Grimm and Cossack are hardy varieties which have come to be extensively grown in the northern states. Certified seed of the Grimm variety is in such demand that it commands nearly double the price per bushel of seed as does common alfalfa seed. If you plan to produce seed it may be more profitable to grow some of this certi - fied Grimm or Cossack alfalfa. For hay there does not appear to be sufficient difference in yield to justify paying such a high price for the seed. At approximately the same price, the Grimm or Cossack might be favored. One thing is certain — the Nebraska farmer should insist on secur - ing seed grown for several seed generations under conditions at least as severe as those which prevail in this state. By way of corn improvement, a great deal has been accomplished in the development of principles of adaptation which the grower may apply to his own crop. The question of local adaptedness is of great importance due to the wide range of climatic conditions prevailing in this state. The degree of adaptedness depends upon the state of har- </seg>
            <seg id="p698">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 698 •.r.ony between the plant's requirements and its environmental growth conditions. The highest degree of adaptedness is regarded as that re - sulting in the maximum yield of sound grain per acre. Since the crop environment of any locality is rather variable from year to year, the type of corn to be grown must be determined by its average perform - ance over a term of years. Regional Types of Corn in Nebraska Extensive surveys and comparative tests within the State have sug - gested some important principles in regard to the correlation of plant and ear characters of dent corn as grown and best suited to various parts of Nebraska. In general, the more adverse the growing conditions are for corn the smaller will be the plant and the earlier its maturity. This adjustment manifests itself in a reduction of all the plant char - acters, including stalk and ear height, number and size of leaves, length and circumference of ears, and number of rows on the ear. In associa - tion with these changes, the kernels become shorter and more flinty. The two extremes of plant type adapted in Nebraska are found at opposite ends of the State, in Richardson and Kimball Counties. When native seed from both of these regions was planted at the rate of three plants per hill under the rather favorable conditions of the Experiment Station at Lincoln, it was found that in comparison with the Richardson County corn the Kimball County corn ripened 16 days earlier, was 2.3 feet shorter, bore the ear 1.9 feet closed to the ground, had 51 per cent as much leaf development and yielded 43 per cent as much grain per acre. The ears of the Kimball County corn were 19 per cent shorter, their circumference was 10 per cent smaller, the shelling percentage 9 per cent lower, the kernel 20 per cent shorter and the shrinkage of ear corn was 6.5 per cent less. The Richardson County ears were moderately rough while the Kimball County ears were smooth with a mere dimple dent. The corn types grown in other parts of the State were found to range between these two extremes very much in accordance with their proximity to either extreme in locality. In a 7-year test at the Experi - ment Station the Kimball County type of corn was found to use only 57 per cent as much water per plant, because of its smaller vegetative size, as does southeastern Nebraska corn. As an illustration of the effect of moving corn to less favorable climatic conditions than prevail in its native locality, we may compare the results of native Richardson County corn and Kimball County corn when grown in Kimball County. The Richardson County corn had two and one-half times as much leaf area per plant and also per pound of dry plant substance, and the yield of shelled corn per acre was only 24 per cent as large as for the native Kimball County corn. These data suggest the inadvisability of moving seed corn to conditions materially different from those where it is adapted. </seg>

Home grown seed produced the best. The farther east the source the poorer was the yield and quality. Sources of seed : 1, Richardson County ; 2, Lancaster County ; 3. Washington County ; 4, Thurston County ; 5, Nuckolls County ; 6, Kearney County ; 7, Holt County ; 8. Lincoln County ; 9. Grant County ; 10, Cherry County ; 11, Kimball County. Representative locally adapted seed was obtained from each of the 12 counties indicated by number in Figures 1 and 2. This corn was grown under the climatic conditions of Lancaster and Kimball counties, respectively. Typical ears grown from each regional type are shown in Figure 3 for both Lancaster County and Kimball County crop. All types matured quite well when grown under the favorable conditions of eastern Nebraska, whereas when grown in western Nebraska the maturity and grain production were rather proportional to the nearness to the seed's source. Acquiring Greater Adaptation Through Ear and Plant Type Selection In the preceding discussion it was pointed out that there is a definite natural transition in the hereditary growth habits of the corn plants best suited to the various localities in the State to correspond with the underlying climatic differences. The farmer's main corn crop is more likely to lack full adaptation in this State by virtue of being too large and late rather than too small and early maturing. Under such circumstances the corn may often advantageously be made both smaller and earlier by selection. This may be accomplished in several ways: (1) Direct selection of the normally early ripening plants. (2) Indirect selection for earliness by selecting for seed, (a) ears that are somewhat smoother, hornier, shallower grained, more slender and fewer rowed than has been customary, and (b) seed borne on plants that are somewhat shorter, less leafy, and have the ears lower on the stalk than the average for the crop as a whole. </seg>
            <seg id="p700">700 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Fir. 4 — When selected for seed from the same field planted to some standard full season variety of corn, the rather smooth, slen - der, horny ears with kernels of only medium depth usually produce a larger and better quality crop under Nebraska conditions than do the ears of opposite type illustrated above at the left. All these characters tend to be associated together, and greater earliness or lateness may be secured by selection of any or all of these characters for either extreme. A large number of ears should always be mixed for seed in order to insure against fertilization by pollen from closely related plants, as this is likely to reduce the yield. Extreme uniformity of plant and ear type should be avoided for the same reason. Relation of Ear Type to Yield of Corn During the 6 years, 1906-1910, long, smooth ears of Reid Yellow at the Nebraska Experiment Station with the standard medium rough Dent corn with kernels of only medium depth were compared for yield </seg>
            <seg id="p701">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 701 corn of the same variety. Continuous selection of the smooth ears was practiced in this test. As an average for the 6 years, the long, smooth ears yielded 57.3 bushels and the standard type 53.3 bushels per acre. In a 2-year test (1916-1917) with Hogue Yellow Dent corn seed ears with relatively shallow, smooth kernels surpassed ears with deep, rough kernels by 5.6 bushels, and the original corn from which both types were selected by 5.1 bushels per acre. In a 6-year test with Nebraska White Prize corn, the long, slender, smooth type of ear outyielded the large, rough, deep kerneled type by 5 bushels per acre and also slightly outyielded the original Nebraska White Prize, from which both types were selected each year. This is a gain of 9.3 per cent for the smooth over the large rough type. The yields for the various ear types of all 3 varieties are summarized in Table 5. Altogether these results suggest that a definite improvement would result from selecting a somewhat longer, more slender, smoother type of seed ear, with more horny and shallower kernels than is now cus - tomary. This type of ear probably yields more, for the reason that the plants grown from it are commonly slightly smaller and earlier matur - ing. Both of these qualities are elements in relative adaptedness where the tendency has been to grow a type that is too large and late maturing. Helping the Crop The various crops can be assisted to yield more profitable by proper attention to soil tillage and crop sequence as Mr. Zook has outlined. It may also be helped by proper execution of the seeding practices. Early or timely seeding of practically all crops is advantageous. In the case of fall seeding small grain the crop becomes established and well stooled out and endures the winters better if seeded relatively early. In the more eastern sections where the Hessian fly is sometimes a serious factor, the seedng should ordinarily be delayed until approximately the fly-safe date as established by the State Entomologist. The early seeding of spring small grains causes them to ripen ear - lier, thereby escaping to some extent the detrimental effects of hot, dry weather. It also increases the insurance against serious rust damage. Corn planted early, ripens earlier and the amount of soft immature corn and frost damage is reduced. The amount of vegetative growth per acre is wisely held down for all crops in this part of the State through reduction in the seeding rate. By having fewer plants per acre, the limited water supply available for the crop is made to go farther. Seed treatment of oats and wheat for the prevention of smut is a very desirable practice and will often greatly increase the yield. The dry copper carbonate dust treatment is considered most satisfactory for wheat. A little extra labor and a small expenditure for material will often bring increased yields ranging from a few bushels to more than old standard formaldehyde treatment is still recommended for oats.

And in the case of wheat the quality and market value of the grain is greatly improved by way of eliminating the pres - ence of stinking smut. The advantages are so apparent that the treat - ment of seed for smut is becoming quite general. In closing, I want to congratulate the farmers out here in the west for exercising such good judgment in the choice of their crops and their production practices.

We will hear Mr. Werner at this time on that topic. THE POTATO ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA AND THE RELATION OF NEBRASKA POTATO GROWERS TO IT H. O. WERNER, President Potato Association of America Last summer Jake Pedrett introduced me as "President of the United State Potato Association." The organization here was kind enough to send me as the representative of Nebraska to the potato convention in Washington last December. In view of the fact that the annual con - vention of that organization will be held at Kansas City this month (I think that was the chief factor) I was elected to the presidency of that Association. We should like to have more active members from Nebraska in that organization. We have all of the certified seed potato growers at the present time. We are going to endeavor to make it worth a great deal more to the actual potato growers. I do not have very much to say concerning it. You have received copies of the Potato News Bul - letin. It is the one organization for potato growers in the United States as a whole. Through its periodicals you can get the best up-to-date in - formation. We should like to have you become active members, then you will get the annual report. It is a volume about twice as large as the volume of the Nebraska Potato Improvement Association. It con - tains the latest reports on the most careful investigations in progress in various parts of the United States. If you feel you can afford the trip to Kansas City, or can take a car of cattle down there about the thirtieth of December, I think you might find it well worth while. I will admit some of the papers pre - sented might appear to be above the heads of the average potato grower. Some of them are sometimes rather abstract. It would be worth con - siderable for you more wide-awake potato growers to get acquainted with the certification men throughout the United States, and with the Potato specialists in pathological and horticultural lines who will be there at that time. We are looking forward to a successful conventon, and I should like to have a good representation of growers from the west. </seg>
            <seg id="p708">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 708 Most likely we will approach you in a circular way for membership in this organization. Please keep in mind and talk it up among your neighbors. The Association has been crippled for lack of funds because of lack of membership. I think it may be made an organization worth considerable to you. I might say we have a pretty good representation in the work of that organization this year. Dr. Goss is Chairman of the most important Committee — that on Research — and several other members from the state are members of various committees. Gus Forsling is a member of the Executive Board, and he got there through no electioneering on my part, but because some of the people in attendance knew him. His name was put up by a man from Maine, so our Nebraska potato growers are known quite a little distance away. At this moment we are more especially concerned with the Ne - braska Potato Improvement Association. I will cut my speech short this afternoon. With the price of potatoes up to five dollars a hundred, I thought we would not have a place in town big enough to hold this convention. Last year every one said our small attendance was due to the low price of potatoes. If it works that way, it would appear we should have a tremendous crowd in a year like this. I am not under - estimating the interest or intellectual quality of those present. That is perfectly all right, even though we had some doubts last night concern - ing some of them. We should have more of the same type of men and women as are here, in order to justify our existence and make it worth while for the speakers who come from outside the state. We have had no less than six or seven men who have traveled over four hundred miles each to come to these meetings, and some of them have traveled seven or eight hundred miles. When we have people coming that far, we should give them a better hearing than we have been able, not from the standpoint of attentiveness, but from the standpoint of more listeners of the same type. I should like to have you express some ideas on this proposition this afternoon. I told you yesterday we would have some time, and warned you to take the opportunity to think things over. In order to start the ball rolling, I will call on Jake Pedrett. (Applause). J. PEDRETT, (Kimball) : That is nothing new to me. I have studied on that for a long time. I made the proposition to have the convention here in Kimball. I was sure we would turn out a good attendance; but the condition of the weather has interfered. Our people are busy. I have two boys who would be glad to be here but they must be there and take care of the beets. Most of them are busy in the fields. You can hardly blame them. While the convention is well worth while, to come away is to take a chance on work they have been doing all summer. From the attendance yesterday and the way they held out, and here now, and last night, I </seg>
            <seg id="p709">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 709 am satisfied it is as good as we have had for the last two years in other places; although not as large as it deserves to be. You may say the Board should increase the interest in Association work and make it a bigger proposition; but at the same time, it takes each individual grower. There is not a potato eater who has not an interest in the potato industry in Nebraska. Every one must be a helper. We have troubles with the farmers in this way: Each man thinks the other fellow must do it. If it is good for you to promote or organize something, it is good for me. The grower thinks, "I will see first how it will come out. If it is good, I will use it and get the benefit anyway." The only way to succeed and make this thing grow is for each individual grower to put his best effort into it. I did not do anything in advance of this convention this year, and there are a good many more. When we had the last convention at Kim - ball, I had some of the best samples. Mr. Girard got the silver cup at that time. Now the young ones come in and make us old farmers take a back seat; and I am glad of it. We won't last long, but the young ones are growing up faster than we realize. They are the future po - tato growers. I do not believe you can get them to raise potatoes like we have on the north side of that table. I do not think these Club boys and girls would raise that kind. There is improvement in there. We may think it was not much of a Show or an attendance, but think of the boys and girls who raise po - tatoes. They will fill our places more efficiently than we have. I should like to see more members. We can not get along without money. The last time we had the convention, the farmers had to give $300 to carry the Show on. We had the right spirit, and made a be - ginning. Later on it has grown bigger. They appropriated $750 from the state. It took over $600 to print the report, so it did not leave us much to go on. I was called to Lincoln, and. they raised the appropria - tion from $750 to $1250. They asked us how we ran the Potato Improvement Association. "Do you pay the Secretary and Board of Directors?" 'No, sir." "Any transportation?" "No, sir." "Do you charge fees?" "No, sir." "Do you pay premiums?" "Yes, sir." "Where do you get the money?" "From charity." (Laughter). "We do not know how you have carried it on for three or four years." Now we are on our feet, and I believe they appreciate it and do their best to make the Potato Improvement Association one of the best associations in Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p710">710 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture I was down to the meeting of the Board of Agriculture last spring. We have a new Secretary — Mr. Jackson. His clerk was there. They said if all associations that received appropriations from the state were as active as the Potato Improvement Association, it would be a pleasure to work in the office. I took that as a compliment. We want to keep it up. At the same time they asked, "How many members have you?" If you are member, your name is in the report. That shows you are an active member and appreciate having an Association and want to do something. We should keep our numbers up. If we lost in num - bers, we lose credit down there, and we do not want to do that. I think the only way is to become a member and induce somebody else to help along, and make this a success. I do not know where we are going next year. We are not going to quit. Wherever we go, we try to be one of the leading counties. Let us stick together and make it a success and be proud of it. (Applause). SECRETARY WERNER: I should like to add, at the very special request of two or three members, we incorporated the program features we had this morning. We had hesitated to get away from strictly potato subjects, but de - cided to do so this time and see to what extent the people were interested. It is not extremely encouraging to note that two or three men who were talking about having these special features, did not make their appear - ance at the meeting. All of you received circular letters. I want to see to what extent you backed up your Secretary. How many asked one other grower to come to this convention? (Several hands raised). How many brought another member? (Only one hand raised). Evidently you did not ask very emphatically. In times past, the Secretary and former President both have been accused of being the "one man" in a "one-man organization." Jake had quite an argument at Alliance with a grower-dealer about that. It may appear that way, but if only one man persuades another to come, we will not spread out from a little clique very fast. Fred Taylor used to be with us. He is on the outside now and can look at us from a semi-interested standpoint. FRED L. TAYLOR, (Denver, Colo.): Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: It is hard offhand to make any suggestions to any organization which may be of benefit in trying to expand that organization. It is true organizations such as this through - out the state year by year have very much the same kind of a program, and we see much the same faces. I attended the Corn Show a year ago and say many of the same faces I saw ten years ago. I think it is very important that something be instilled into the organization to create an active interest among all of the people in this particular organization who are interested in producing potatoes. Those </seg>
            <seg id="p711">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 711 things are true, and we all know it. But what you want are definite sug - gestions that might be practical to work out. While nobody, unless he has been working on the subject for some time, will have a definite sug - gestion, I should think it might be well to appoint a very small com - mittee — a small committee always accomplishes more than a large one — to work out some suggestions that might be presented to your Board at a later time and be considered at your next annual convention. A point brought out which I think is a good one is to have an ex - hibit by this organization at the Central Agricultural Exposition at Kansas City. Exhibits are splendid not only in advertising your pota - toes, but in advertising your country in which these potatoes are grown, and interesting some people who might be interested in growing potatoes in future to come to this section. I have nothing definite to offer at this time, I thank you. (Applause). SECRETARY WERNER: I wonder to what extent the date of the meeting is a factor? How many of you would prefer this time to the first week in December? (Several hands were raised). Are there any preferences in favor of December? (No hands raised). I am very well aware we are making lots of progress in this orga - nization. I have mentioned to several the potatoes on the show tables. The poorest lots in the case of Triumphs are probably better than the prize-winning lots in 1919 — the first Show I attended. May we have comments from some of the others present? PETRUS PETERSON, (Dix) : I have one suggestion to make. In looking over our premium list, we find we give premiums only to certified seed growers, while here in western Nebraska there are about ten carloads of No. 1 seed grown to one certified. I have talked with several growers up through this valley the last two weeks about this Potato Show, and they say, "What is the use for us to go down there? It is useless to take our exhibits because they will reject them or put them in the commercial class; and we are not interested." I was wondering if we were not excluding one-half of our really good potato growers? I would like to hear further on that. SECRETARY WERNER: This is a potato "improvement" organization. No potato expert living can tell whether potatoes put on the table are seed potatoes. If he has seen the potatoes in the field and knows they are free from dis - ease, then we have a legitimate right to have a seed class. We have no right whatsoever to have a seed class for uncertified seed potatoes, because we do not know what they are. At Spokane in 1920, I was chosen as Judge of the Potato Show with some four hundred exhibits. They had a seed class. There was </seg>
            <seg id="p712">712 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture a beautiful lot of Russet Burbank potatoes. We gave it first prize. The man capitalized on that and sold his entire crop at five dollars a bushel. They were scattered over Idaho and western Montana and eastern Wash - ington. The following year they produced an average of about twenty - five bushels to the acre, because they were infected to the extent of 90 per cent with leaf roll. That was a black eye to the Potato Show. Perhaps it did more damage in that one year than it has done good in two or three years since. You might have potatoes with 100 per cent mosaic, that would look better than a lot free from it, and we would then not be improving very fast. It might meet a temporary demand, but it would not get us any place. C. C. STARRING, (Bozeman, Montana) : Professor Herrington bought those fine samples we had. We tried to get material for class work. We did not have class stuff when fall came. Our pathologists had been in the western part of our state in the days when we did not have certified seed lots at fairs. I went through a man's field. "Here's a little mosaic." "Yes; those are the plants we pick our Fair stuff from. I make a practice of going through my field and take those and get my exhibit stuff from them." (Laughter). I talked with a grower in southern Idaho who has the same practice. SECRETARY WERNER: I appreciate that that argument is before us, but it will not get us any place. I should like to hear from Mr. Stenberg, ANTON STENBERG, (Alliance): I do not believe I have much to say. This year in my neighborhood there were several who planned attending this Show, but most of them have potatoes to dig. I pretty nearly did not come down myself on that account. I believe that is why we did not have the attendance this year we would have had if the Show had been held later. Some years this time of the year would be better. I have no suggestion to improve it. MAYOR FRANK E. READER, (Kimball) : As a citizen of Kimball, I am a little bit chagrined to see not a great many of our local men have taken advantage of this opportunity. I am not a potato grower, although I live here. Anything that pros - pers the county, I get my share down the line. Perhaps the time of year has something to do with the small attendance. I know our people are fairly busy, but I want to say you have a program that is not only full of potato, but full of meat. I have learned a good deal about the po- </seg>
            <seg id="p713">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 713 tato industry here myself. Perhaps I will not put it to actual practice, but I believe I can talk more intelligently about the proposition. Of course locally the farmers who do things in the potato line are Gus Forsling, August Gadeken, Jake Pedrett, Fred Stanfield, and some others, and they are conscientious in their attendance. The other fel - lows perhaps will depend upon them for next season for what has been going on here in this session. I believe the business men have held back thinking this would be more of a Show and Convention for potato growers, and not much for them. We thrive best when we work against adversity. I notice you have apparently plenty of money for your operations. Perhaps if you charged these men five dollars apiece to come here, you could improve your at - tendance. It seems like that in church circles. I have had considerable experience along that line. I am sure we have been complimented by having your convention with us. Perhaps the outside attendance has been slackened by the fact we are a little off in the corner from the main part of the state. I think the fellows around Kimball who have not taken advantage of this con - vention have really lost a great deal. (Applause). SECRETARY WERNER: I do not know that it is worth while to continue this discussion. I have been usurping the position of chairman. We want to hear from him. No matter what we say or do this afternoon, I serve notice on you now that I am going to count on some support from you next year. I do not want to be placed in the embarrassing position of having to get the best speakers I can possibly find in the United States to come, and then always have to apologize and say, "Of course these fellows are good, only we have more of them." I can not get them out, but if you individually take it upon yourself to do so, we will all prosper by working together that way. FRANK G. ROWLEY, (Berea) : I have four blank applications I will sell for a dollar apiece during this session. PRESIDENT PHELPS: I understand there has been no Resolutions Committee appointed. I should like to have a report from the Committee on Nominations. The vacancies created by the expiration of the terms of P. L. Wilson and William Newman on the Board are to be filled; and the President and Vice-President must be elected, as this is done every year. The other two members of the Board hold over one year longer. </seg>

Mr. Phelps is therefore elected as President for the ensuing year. THE GROWER AND THE RAILROAD K. L. Pierce, Hemingford Refrigerator cars enter into the orderly marketing of potatoes to such an extent, that a few words on this subject is not amiss at this time. There are refrigerator cars enough in the U. S. to take care of the perishable products that need to be moved, except possibly at the very peak of certain commodity movements. It is not the lack of re - frigerator cars but lack of system and orderliness on the part of ship - pers in using them that causes, sometimes, a shortage. When you stop to consider that in the eastern part of the U. S., where four-fifths of the people live in about one-fifth of the territory, there is a constant piling up of refrigerator cars in the way of unloads, and that the loads for these cars comes from the rest of the U. S., and that the refrigerators have to come back empty, you can begin to get an idea of the magni - tude of the refrigerator car distribution problem. The Central Advisory Board at Washington has considerable to do with the allotment of refrigerator cars, and they are making up their survey of the requirements somewhat independent of the railroad. On the return trip the refrigerator cars are concentrated at strategic points, where they can be readily distributed to the using territory. The local problem that is effecting the shippers is that we are using these cars in competition with California, with a lettuce crop in Colo - rado, and with various other movements of potatoes which come at the same time as ours. It is, therefore, essential that when the cars come into our territory that they be used, as other territories are clamoring for them. It is es - sential also that each community know its needs, and communicate either with the Railroad company, or preferably with a member of the Re- </seg>
            <seg id="p716">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 716 gional Railroad Advisory Board and have their wants made known and filled, and then the cars used. Nothing will upset the whole proposition more than for either the Railroad companies, or the Chairman of the Committee representing the Shippers Association, to make a wrong estimate of the number of cars needed for a certain month, especially when they are badly needed in some other territory and the cars are unused. I recommend, therefore, that each community appoint some one to make a survey of the needs of the refrigerator cars for each particular territory, and to take the matter up with the proper Railroad Officials and also with the Chairman of the Committee which represents his particular commodity. In pota - toes, that would be myself, K. L. Pierce, Hemingford, Nebr. We are having no difficulty, whatever, in getting all the refrigerators we want on the Burlington where the thing is properly organized. This is not true of the Northwestern, as they are not a through railroad and don't have the opportunity to get unloads of refrigerators that the Bur - lington has. It is very difficult, however, to anticipate the needs along the Northwestern, as the shippers there are not particularly alive to the fact that the information must be furnished to the Railroad and to the Chairman of their commodity committee. There is a great deal of com - petition for the Union Pacific cars for the reason that the Union Pacific serves territories that handle other commodities than potatoes, and when these are clamoring for cars, and load them promptly, and have longer hauls, the Railroad company is very apt to favor long hauls. However, the Union Pacific potato territory is on the way west, an&lt;J most refrigerators come from the east to the west empty. Therefore, if the railroad company is sure that they will be used they will, no doubt, be set off for the potato territory of Nebraska. A general word in connection with car distribution of other products, because all potato farmers raise other property as well, may not be out of place. It is very important that in orderly marketing the cars be used and kept on the move, promptly loaded, and promptly unloaded. The Shippers Regional Advisory Board recommend and urge all people who use cars to do so expeditiously, and not to hold them any longer than possible when there is any indication of a shortage. It is not to the interest of the general public for the Railroad company to have a great deal of dead equipment, on which interest and fixed charges are running, because there can be no reduction in roadroad rates except when the cars are moving efficiently and rapidly, and in an orderly way. We are going to find out as the time goes by that it is the co - operation of the "whole endurin' bunch" that makes for prosperity, for happiness, and well being in America, and while the movement of cars is but an incident in the general routine of general living, if we become efficient along this line and take thought, there is no question in my mind but what we will learn to become more efficient in other ways, all of which will tend toward prosperity and success. </seg>
            <seg id="p717">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 717 I, therefore, ask the co-operation of all the potato growers of Ne - braska and other shippers to order cars only when they need them and to anticipate their wants by letting their wants be known ahead, either to the Railroad company, or the Chairman of the committee of the particular product that you wish to ship. By doing this, you can assist in orderly marketing, one of the big advance steps toward prosperity possible, at this time. The difference received between products moving when you want them and held into a market glut, sometimes makes a big difference to the shipper. There fore, it is very important that the shipper get his cars, and to get the cars the people disposing of the cars must have confidence that they will be used. The names of the Regional Advisory Board Chairmen are posted in each depot, and in case of shortage in cars wire him your needs and he can help in a very few hours, usually. REPORT OF AUDITING COMMITTEE Presented by FRED L. TAYLOR, Denver, Colo. We, the members of your Auditing Committee, have gone over the books of the Secretary-Treasurer for the year December 1, 1924, to November 6, 1925. In the general fund we find a balance of $231.62 up to December first. Receipts during the year to October first have brought the total to $513.21. The expenditures during this time amount to $277.78, which leaves a balance on November 6, 1925, of $235.43. This balance cor - responds with the bank balance. The expenses from December 1, 1924, to November 5, 1925, from those secured from the state, the expenditures and receipts are the same, because the expense accounts are turned into the State Board of Agriculture and they pay these bills. It amounts to $1508.11. We have checked these items, and in our opinion they are just expenditures. We wish to submit, Mr. President, our report, and I move its adoption. The motion to adopt the report was seconded and carried. PRESIDENT PHELPS: We will have time to hear some of Mr. Werner's report. I want to say a word about our Secretary. In years that have gone I heard, as others did, a few times something about a "one-man Show." I have come, like a lot of other people, to realize if there were not one man, there would not be a Show at all. If at any time some growers thought they should have a free hand or more of a hand in the working of the Show and certification work, they have not carried it out. I should like this body of people for just a moment to show its ap - preciation of the continuous work done in this state by one man, and that is Mr. Werner. (Applause). </seg>
            <seg id="p718">718 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture SECRETARY WERNER: I seem to have the floor this afternoon. Thank you for your vote of appreciation. I will have to include Mr. Morrow in that. He has been doing more for this Association without his name appearing in any connection with it than I have within the past year or so. I want him to get due credit. You are extremely fortunate in having him out here with you to work not only for the Certified Seed Growers, but for the potato producers in general. You can take advantage of him more than you have. You took advantage of him by keeping him from going into Montana last spring. Mr. Starring's Department was unfortunate owing to the promptness with which your Board acted in keeping Mr. Morrow here in Nebraska. IMPROVING CULTURAL PRACTICES IN THE LIGHT OF RECENT EXPERIMENTS H. O. WERNER, Associate Horticulturist, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska During the past season in several experiments conducted, potatoes were planted in different ways., i. e. at different dates, and seed size and planting differences were varied. While results of one year are not always conclusive, the data secured, with some deductions, are presented at this time so that you can profit by them. Date of Planting— Relation to Tuber Quality and Yield In 1925 good type tubers were selected from the bin of F. G. Rowley for planting at successive 10 day intervals from May 15 to July 5 — the customary range of dates for planting in western Nebraska. Five 4 rod rows were planted on each date. These lots were harvested on Oct. 3, 1925. At harvest time the degree of maturity was estimated for each plant. The potatoes from the center row of each plat were sent to Lin - coln for calibration and weighing. The 4th row of each plat was saved on the farm for future planting. The following facts seem quite definitely established by data secured: 1. Better stands were secured with the early plantings. The last planting having the poorest stand. 2. The mean percentage of maturity decreased from first to last dates but there was little difference in lots planted from May 15 to June 15. The plants in sets planted after that date were relatively very green, especially the July 5 lot. 3. All tubers were sufficiently ripe so that the skin was well set and was not injured in digging except in the case of the July 5 planting. The skin of these tubers slipped very easily. The 25 lot was relatively firm. 4. The tubers of the first two plantings were much lighter in color and showed very poor Triumph characteristics. For seed purposes they </seg>
            <seg id="p719">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 719 would have been discriminated against because of appearance. The tubers of the other lots were of a deeper red color and presented a much better appearance. 5. The proportion of seed size tubers (over 51 grams) increased with each later planting date till June 25 and then declined. 6. The percentage of scabby tubers (seed size) was greatest with the first planting and decreased with each successive planting so that the July 5 planting contained! practically no scabby tubers. 7. The tuber type or shape improved with the later plantings. The ratio of width to length for seed size tubers being: May 15, 86.81%; June 15, 100.97%; and July 5, 104.88%. 8. There was no fixed tendency for the total yield in relation to planting time. 9. The yield per acre of clean tubers of No. 1 size increased with each successively later planting date till June 25. July 5 planting pro - duced more bushels of clean potatoes than the June 5 or earlier plantings.

Note that with the late plantings the amount of scab decreased and the amount of good clean potatoes increased. </seg>

The potatoes were planted on June 6th under very favorable condi- tions. Growing conditions were very favorable during the early part of the season, but during the last two months the soil was quite dry. The seed pieces for each plot were cut from the same seed tubers. The sizes used were 60, 30 and 15 grams or approximately, 2 oz., 1 oz., and % oz. The planting distances were at 24, 18 and 12 inches in the row. </seg>
            <seg id="p722">722 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture During the 1925 season the large seed piece was of very little ad - vantage in giving the plants an early start. Differences in vine growth were not as great early as late in the season. The number of stems per plant increased with the size of the seed piece as follows: 15 gram seed piece produced 1.59 stems per plant 30 gram seed piece produced 2.22 stems per plant 60 gram seed piece produced 3.44 stems per plant Seed piece size did not seem to affect rate of maturity, although the smaller seed piece plants seemed less mature on Oct. 2 than the others.

            <seg id="p723">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 723 There is a general fear that if too much seed is planted per acre and the ensuing set of tubers relatively heavy, that in case of a dry season there will be a crop of excessively small potatoes. Because of that opinion the 1925 • results are of considerable practical value. Dur - ing that season conditions were very favorable for a heavy tuber set and good growth early in the season, but later drouthy conditions pre - vailed in this particular field. Consequently these results can be con - sidered as "safe" for dry years. As the seed piece size was increased the number of stems per plant also increased. This increase in the number of stems was relatively greater at the greater planting distance (of 24 inches). The tubers averaged smaller as the number of stems and number of tubers per plant increased. This relation applied after the little cull potatoes were removed. The largest yields were secured from the largest seed pieces and from the most seed pieces per acre. This same relationship holds after the seed planted is deducted from the yield so as to give the net increase above seed planted. When comparing plats using the same amount of seed but with size and distance varied we found that the smaller pieces close together slightly outyielded the larger pieces further apart. This was probably due to the better distribution over the field — by close planting. Con - sidering the slight difference as compared with the advantages of large pieces, through less labor in cutting and less cost in doing better roguing, the small size is hardly to be recommended. Our southern Triumph seed markets prefer and some actually de - mand small and medium sized tubers. The actual size of most of the potatoes is therefore more important than the average size for a whole field. The potatoes were classified into arbitrary weight groups as follows: :m am luction Seed piece size Mean No. Mean No. Planting of stems tubers distance per plant per plant I I I Mean wt. per tuber Tubers over 51 grs. Mean No. Mean tubers Wt. per I per plant j tuber 60 grs. 60 grs. 12 in. 24 in. 3.45 3.55 4.23 7.27 98.1 grs. 98.3 grs. ! 3.14 5.04 122.1 131.5 30 grs. 12 in. 2.17 3.80 98.5 grs. 2.74 127.4 30 grs. 15 grs. 15 grs. 24 in. 12 in. 24 in. 2.28 1.66 1.68 5.75 3.56 4.63 102.7 grs. 100.8 grs. 115.4 grs. 4.18 27.4 34.3 131.9 123.3 146.8 </seg>
            <seg id="p724">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 724 TABLE 4 The so-called "seed size" tubers are those in the 51 to 250 gram or 1.5 to 3 inch group. Tubers smaller than that size are seldom picked up. The larger tubers can be sold for table purposes or used for seed. They are more liable to be injured in harvesting than the smaller ones. The percentage of total yield in this seed size group was as follows: TABLE 5.

Gross yield above seed As the seed piece size increased the percent of seed size tubers also increased. There was likewise an increase in per cent of seed size tubers as the planting distance was decreased. More seed per acre increased the yield of seed size tubers. These same findings apply with regard to the yield in bushels per acre and to the net yield after deducting the amount of seed planted in each case. When considering the relative efficiency of each bushel planted we found that the plats with the lowest per acre planting rate produced the highest number of bushels for each bushel planted. Thus if seed is very valuable and becomes the limiting factor and land and labor are of less importance, then greatest returns from each bushel of seed will be secured by planting a relatively small amount per Weight 'er Tuber Probable width based on previous Metric System English System measurements • Under 50 grams 50 to 250 grams 251 to 500 grams Under 1.76 oz. 1.8 to 8.8 oz. 8.8 to 17.6 oz.

Generally land and labor costs are the most important. Considering again yields per acre we find that the difference in yield of seed size tubers between the 60 gram 12 inch plat and the 15 gram 24 inch plat was 71.6 bushels whereas the difference in the amount of seed planted was only 24 bushels. In view of that situation let us con - sider these results from an economic standpoint. At planting time in 1925, certified seed potatoes were selling at $1.50 per cwt. or 90c per bushel. During most of this October (1925) certified seed was contracted at $2.50 per cwt. or $1.50 per bushel. At these prices the extra 24 bushels of seed planted were worth $21.60 in June but the additional yield of 71.6 bu. of seed size tubers harvested were worth $107.35 in October. Thus the income gain by planting more seed was $75.75 per acre. After deducting 15c per bushel for picking hauling, sacking, etc., these additional tubers, the net gain is still $65.00 per acre. When figuring seed at $1.50 per hundred at both ends of the season the results would be: Less 24 bu. @ 90c = 21.60 On the basis of seed at $4.00 per hundred in the spring (or possible sale value during the previous winter) and $2.00 per hundred the next fall. Less 24 bu. seed @ 2.40 = 57.60 Difference in income $28.32 Less 15c per bu. for handling 10.73 Net gain $17.59 per acre 71.6 bu. @ 90c — $64.40 71.6 bu. @ $1.20 = $85.92 Bu. planted Yield of seed size per each bu. of Seed piece size Planting distance per acre seed planted 60 grains 60 grams 30 grams 30 grams 12 inches 24 inches 12 inches 24 inches 27.4 bu. 13.7 bu. 13.7 bu. 6.85 bu. 6.50 bu. 11.06 bu. 11.63 bu. 18.35 bu. 15 grams 15 grams 1 12 inches 24 inches 6.85 bu. 3.43 bu. 22.6 bu. 33.5 bu.

            <seg id="p726">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 726 Or figure again on last spring's seed market and the market price about November 1st when certified seed was at $4.00 per cwt. Less 24 bu. seed @ .90 = 21.60 From the above figure in each instance a charge of $5 per acre might be added for cost of cutting the additional seed. That would not affect any of the situations materially. Thus when figuring on any possible reasonable combination we find that planting a large amount of seed per acre is the most profitable practice. In a season less favorable during the planting period relatively bet- ter results would be secured from the larger pieces. Many small seed pieces dry up or rot and many produce small plants which are at a de - cided disadvantage in dry or hot weather. At the present time the stands in most dry land fields are not very good. Planting larger seed pieces would help much to improve stands. In this experiment the larg- est seed pieces produced perfect stand fields. Where seed fields are rogued large seed pieces planted far apart will be most practical. Instead of planting 6 to 8 bu. per acre the dry land seed grower should plant more nearly 25 bushels. The accompanying tables showing results secured at Scottsbluff on dry and irrigated land and at Alliance on dry land bear out the general principles established by the 1925 data. TABLE 7.

They would not have done much damage to the yield. The high percent of mosaic in two lots and of spindle tuber in the other showed that type selection in the bin is not very satisfactory even with relatively good strains; also that these better strains are not nearly as good as they might or should be. Discussion M. E. ADAMS, (Scottsbluff): You spoke of the seed lots. You would have to have two plantings perhaps thirty days apart. THE SECRETARY: I would not be ready to recommend planting thirty days apart. I would consider it good practice to plant them before your general plant - ing date. </seg>
            <seg id="p729">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 729 MR. ADAMS: How soon? THE SECRETARY: It might be well to plant two weeks MR. MORROW: In these lots you have indexed and planted apparently normal tem - perature, then when you harvested them they have been indexed? THE SECRETARY: Some of them. MR. MORROW: How much progress do you notice? THE SECRETARY: We got mosaic out so that some had less than one-half of one per cent. MR. MORROW: How about spindle tuber ? Can you index that out. THE SECRETARY: We think we can. Two years ago we did not think we could. Dr. Goss and I think we have learned the symptoms of spindle tuber under winter greenhouse conditions, which are different from field conditions. MR. MORROW: Have you indexed three generations yet? THE SECRETARY: We will have this winter. MR. PIERCE: I am interested in those large seed pieces. Last year when I was finishing up planting, I discovered I had plenty of seed, and for about three acres on one side of the field we cut the pieces large. They would have averaged possibly twice the general size planted throughout the field. From the time they came up, you could tell right to the row in the size of your plants and the hardiness of them. There was the same difference when I dug them in yield, and the same difference in the type of the potatoes. This spring I culled out some potatoes and ran them over a one and seven-eighths screen and back over a one and one half inch. I took a two-acre field, and out of those sizes large enough to cut in two, I did so. I planted just one-half of that field. The other acre I did not cut any at all, but planted them all whole. The acre on which I planted whole seed out-averaged the other acre. I could not say how much be- </seg>
            <seg id="p730">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 730 cause I was not there to measure and weigh them, but considerable. In the certified field I planted some of the same size I had screened out, and in that part where I planted whole potatoes, if I have ever seen a 100 per cent stand, I had it. Where I cut the seed pieces I did not have more than a 75 per cent stand. At that time it was wet and hot, and the cut pieces started to decay. When this dry weather came on, where I planted the whole seed pieces showed the effects much quicker. When I dug them, just from a rough estimate as we estimated them in the sacks as we packed them, this whole-seed plot outweighed the other by the side of it at least ten bush - els to the acre. In roguing it, when I came up to them I did not find one-quarter of the plants showing spindle tuber I did by the side of it in tiie cut seed. I am going to cull out more this spring and will "go one better" and put it over a one and seven-eighths screen and back over a one and three-fourths, and will plant them. THE SECRETARY: I am glad to have that corroborative evidence. MR. PIERCE: On this one acre I planted on this two-acre plot, I put twenty-two bushels of seed which I did not cut. THE SECRETARY: If Mr. Holden is here he can tell us something about the margin of profit in producing crops. In growing beets, a man does not make a cent of profit until he raises about nine and one-half to ten tons or more per acre. A man who raises a big yield from a big acreage may be losing money. On potatoes it is the same. Twenty-five bushels at fifty cents a bushel won't pay for the raising of the crop. The greater the cost per acre, invariably the less the cost per bushel; consequently the greater the margin of profit per acre, provided your expenditures are wise. Farmers get total production and yield per acre confused. These big total yields throughout the United States are always unprofit - able, and these poor total crops are extremely profitable. Anybody can make money on potatoes this year. In an average year, the man who made money — and there were a lot who did — was the fellow who got the greatest yield per acre; be - cause the cost per bushel was less with him. That will apply to po - tatoes more than to any other crop because that crop responds so gen - erously to proper treatment of seed, cultivation of land, proper seed size, and cultivation afterward, and all the details. These things are all decidedly worth while. Keep that idea in mind and pass it on to your neighbors when they K excited thinking this organization is for increasing production. We striving for a better quality product and more bushels per acre. In </seg>
            <seg id="p731">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 731 the dry-land section it sometimes amounts to more bushels per man, but do not overestimate that figure too much with potatoes. Even on dry land, it will pay you better to raise two hundred bushels per acre on a few acres thoroughly cared for, than fifty or seventy-five bushels on three times as many acres. MR. TAYLOR: As a result of your College work, is it right to conclude even with the best stock of potatoes mildly infected with disease, grown continu - ously under the most favorable conditions in this state, that they will not only not get well, but continue to get worse? THE SECRETARY: I would not want to make too unqualified a statement. Once in a while we pick up lots isolated for quite a while and they are pretty good. Some grower's seed has been very good but when it got into the hands of growers who did not rogue, the stock went to pieces pretty fast. Before I recommend any lot of potatoes to a grower not well ex - perienced. I emphasize that this new lot won't solve his trouble for more than a year. MR. TAYLOR: I was also wondering if that would not apply to some of the officers of the Association? (Laughter). THE SECRETARY: I notice some of the officers are isolating themselves a little bit, A MEMBER: To come back to the amount of seed used per acre, we will put it on a basis of being worth four dollars in spring and two dollars in the fall; and comparing two bushels of seed with twenty-seven bushels of seed, the marging of profit would be about $17. If you compare fifteen bushels of seed per acre with twenty-seven bushels, do you think you would have that margin of profit. THE SECRETARY: I do not know how that would figure out. It might wipe out the profit. From my familiarity with the figures, I would say it would just about take up the profit. I used a lower figure because I think you will agree there are tremendous acreages planted with six bushels per acre. Probably the average is not over eleven bushels. A few years ago when circulating among the potato growers, I found they thought they were doing well to plant eleven bushels to the acre, and thirteen bushels was almost unheard of in 1922. MR. PETERSON: Have you noticed what kind of planter and digger are used? Which are the best? </seg>
            <seg id="p732">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 732 THE SECRETARY: I have not tried to check up on these diggers. I have noticed the efficiency of the digger depends almost entirely on the man who runs it. Some men can make a poor digger work well, and some men can not make a good digger work right. It might not be a bad investment to have one of these small portable engines available so that you could rig up your potato digger with one in these wet seasons; or even in dry seasons when you have trouble to get enough dirt to go over the chain to protect the potatoes, you might run it deeper, you cannot do it with horse power. If you have an engine on, you only need horses to pull the engine. This works fine in irrigated sections. One or two concerns are making extra wide diggers. A friend of mine back east — Daniel Dean — probably the best informed potato grower in the United States — said some people in New York are this year going ahead of the potato digger with the snow plow. They could not get them out with the stand - ard digger. They use a digger with a long chain. It works well in mud. MR. C. C. STARRING, (Bozeman, Montana) : I am interested in the size of seed pieces under irrigation. We have been trying two ounces, one and one-half ounces, and three ounces. Our standard distance for ordinary experiment work is fifteen inches, with rows three and one-half feet apart. In digging and sorting potatoes, we have under two ounces and over twelve-ounce sizes. In regard to size, the average yield the past three years has been a triflle over 6,000 pounds per acre with one and one-half ounces; and with three ounces our average yield has been a little over 11,000 pounds. The yield of the eight-ounce was about the same — in the neighborhood of 13,000 pounds. We sorted for eight to twelve ounce and the yield was in favor of the three-ounce seed pieces. I think two ounces represents our best seed size up there. We have had an increase of 5,000 pounds per acre due to doubling the size of the seed piece. I think our people have been planting too small seed pieces, from the standpoint of table stock. THE SECRETARY: This matter of getting our seed cut as we plant it is quite a job. Sometimes it is necessary to cut in advance and store cut potatoes. We know they have gotten unfavorable results in Montana from this prac - tice. Some scientists in England studied the question as to what en - tered into causing the potatoes to heal over after they are cut. A hard shell forms and new cells are formed and the potato actually grows a protective covering. These cut pieces are covered with a fatty cover - ing. The formation of that coating on the cut surface, they have found takes place better if potatoes are kept in a dark, cool and damp place. It probably does not develop in the sun. If it does, it is in little blotches. It is important to have it develop evenly and closely on your cut sur - faces. If it develops properly in a cool place, it will be fairly flexible, and the potatoes can be handled quite a bit, and it will protect the po- </seg>
            <seg id="p733">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 733 tato about as effectively as the skin itself. When thoroughly healed you can pile cut potatoes thickly. The procedure recommended is to store cut seed in your cellar, keeping them as cool as possible; spread in thin layers on the floor, not over six inches deep at deepest, then shovel them a few times the first day, and frequently enough after that — perhaps once in three days for the first week — in order to keep them from heating and sticking to - gether. If you follow that procedure you will have less loss. Under some conditions it is the practice to cut over a month in ad - vance. In Kentucky they cut in the fall for planting in the spring. I would not recommend that. When you find yourselves against the neces - sity of cutting in advance, remember to store as I have mentioned. In our experiments we have cut sometimes two or three weeks in advance We have had good success and very little loss, with no disease present. If we spread disease with the cutting knife, we had loss. A MEMBER: There would be no advantage in cutting these seed in advance more than you would have them cut? THE SECRETARY: There is often a pretty bad loss from overheating. Sometimes through scarcity of labor it must be done. The way you have loosened up, I think we are just about ready to start the potato session. We ought to get acquainted a little bit earlier in the convention. (Applause). PRESIDENT PHELPS: Before the newly elected directors leave, I believe we should have a meeting of the officers and directors of the Improvement Association. A lot of questions should be discussed, and ordinarily but a few meetings of this Board are held. Upon motion, the Ninth Annual Convention of the Nebraska Po - tato Improvement Association adjourned, sine die.

            <seg id="p736">736 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture EXHIBIT OF NEBRASKA CERTIFIED POTATOES AT THE CENTRAL STATES HORTICULTURAL EXPOSITION Kansas City, Mo., December 8, 9, and 10 GLEN HUNT, County Agricultural Agent, Kimball Co. Nebraska held a conspicuous place at the National Fruit Show this year being represented by a very elegant exhibit of apples grown in eastern Nebraska, six competitive samples of potatoes and a non-com - petitive exhibit of seed potatoes grown in Western Nebraska. Fig. 12 — Nebraska's exhibit at the Kansas City Horticultural Congress in De - cember. 1925. The competitive samples of potatoes were the six highest scoring samples at the Nebraska State Potato show. C. A. Buehler of Gering, won first, Kenneth Brittell of Pine Bluffs, second; and Joy Brittell, third. All Nebraska samples were of the Bliss Triumph variety, and were criticized principally because they were too small having been produced in a seed producing district. Practically the only competition in Bliss Triumphs came from Colorado and while the specimens were large, the quality was not such as to compare favorably with the Nebraska samples. On the whole the potatoes in the competitive display were of exception - ally high grade, even for a show of this character. Practically all the samples were the very best from the several central states exhibiting. Samples of the Irish Cobbler led in number as well as quality when judged in a commercial way. Upon arrival of the non-competitive exhibit on Monday, December 7, it was found that space was at a premium and the exhibit was al - lotted a small booth in the potato section of the Convention Hall. After </seg>
            <seg id="p737">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 737 leaving an aisle to allow inspection of the potatoes there was room enough on the tables provided for thirty-four samples representing that number of Nebraska growers. About fifteen samples were on hand for which space could not be arranged. A large sign with a map of Ne - braska showing the seed potato district, was used for a background. Upon completion the exhibit made a very pleasing appearance, and in view of the scarcity of potatoes and the consequent high prices, it attracted a great deal of attention from consumers, as well as those inter - ested in the seed business. The writer, who was in charge of the exhibit, found interest so great that it was necessary for him to explain the merits and demerits of seed potatoes constantly during the hours that the show was open to the public. Most of those interested were merely seeking information. A few were county agents, leaders, and college men in early Triumph pro - ducing districts in Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Southern Missouri. Quite a number were Kaw Valley farmers who were interested in Irish Cobbler seed potatoes, principally, and were anxious to find a source of Cobbler seed more free from disease than their present source. Circulars furnished by the Nebraska Seed Potato Grower's Coop - erative, Alliance, Nebraska, were distributed to those who were in a position to use, handle, or recommend Nebraska seed. Considerable pub - licity was obtained in the Kansas City Star, the Packer, the Journal and other publications. On the whole it is believed that friendly relations were established with a number of people whose friendliness will be valu - able to Nebraska Growers. In addition to this the publicity gained through this exhibit showed innumerable people that Western Nebraska is on the map as a seed potato producing district. One example of the publicity obtained was an article published in one of the dailies showing a picture of the Nebraska Seed Exhibit with a prominent Missouri Experiment Station man in the foreground. The paper quoted this man as saying that Nebraska produced the finest Bliss Triumphs in the world. The truth of the matter was that he had been misquoted, but the act could not be undone. This exhibit was worth many times its cost to Nebraska growers. However the same exhibit would have been worth a great deal more, if located at a similar show in a region using more Bliss Triumphs since that is our principal variety. </seg>

PRESIDENT: The next in order is correspondence. Mr. Secretary, have you any correspondence ? SECRETARY: No, I have nothing of any importance PRESIDENT: The next in order is Committee reports. There were no Committees to report. PRESIDENT: We will now take up the unfinished business. MR. DAVIS: I think this is the proper time to take up the matter of the State Farm selling their birds in competition with the Association Producers. Everyone knows that we cannot compete with them when the State fur - nishes them with everything. We have already gone on record as op - posed to their competing with us, and I think there was a Committee appointed to see what could be done about it. MR. SKINNER: Mr. President. I cannot say that the Committee accomplished any - thing, except that the State knows that we have gone on record as you have stated. MR. NORBERG: I move that this Committee be discharged of their duties. Seconded by Knudsen. Carried. Is their anything further in the order of unfinished business. Are there any reports of any other committees ? SECRETARY: Nothing essential. PRESIDENT: We will now take up the new business MR. DAVIS: Mr. President. I understand that the Poultry Department of the State Agricultural Farm are planning on putting on an Egg Laying Con - test at North Platte Station. I think this a very fine thing and that it would be advisable for the Nebraska Poultry Association to go on record </seg>
            <seg id="p748">748 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture as in favor of such a contest if the State wishes to put it on, and that we are willing to co-operate with them in every way, and I move that a committee be appointed to keep us in touch with this proposition. MR. KNUDSEN: I think we should follow this egg laying proposition closely, and I move that a committee be appointed for that purpose. Seconded by Smiley. Carried. PRESIDENT: I appoint the following to serve on that committee: Mr. Knudsen, Mr. Davis, Mr. Smiley. MR. SMILEY: Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: I am glad indeed to hear 6 report of Mr. Davis that the poultry department of the agricultural 1 will put on an egg laying contest at the North Platte Station. How - ', I believe that the logical place for such a contest is at the head - quarters at Lincoln. Perhaps in the future we may be able to have such a contest at the home station. What I am going to say in regard to the State Poultry Association may seem a little harsh in regard to their activities during the year. Our association is practically dead ten or eleven months of the entire year. We all get enthused during the show and after that we hear very little of the state show during the year. I was very much impressed with the Oklahoma State organization which I had an opportunity to investigate while judging at the Oklahoma State Show. It seems that the large appropriations were divided so that it is possible for a poultry show to be held in every county with a set sum of $250.00. Each county is divided into precincts. The final show then comes during the state show of each year. A great deal of activity is seen in the Boys and Girls Clubs and at the recent Oklahoma State Show there were at least 350 fowls on exhi - bition which were raised by the boys and girls. It seems to me that if the Nebraska State Poultry Association would put forth a little effort we too can get such an appropriation and get more benefit than we now are. Another activity that is now being pushed on the press and in the poultry papers is the registration of poultry. This idea is advanced by some theoretical poultrymen who have never made a success of any - thing they have tried. They advance the idea that it will make more work for the judges as all must be scored, but I want to say right here, that that is not the class of work the judges are after. I would like to know, is there any exhibitor who would like to go back to the old score card methods and have your birds placed according to score. There is not one, and I doubt if we ever go back to the method The cost would be prohibitive.. *s i* costs 50c each for your birds regis - tered. You must trap nest and win^ band all specimens. The amount </seg>
            <seg id="p749">Nebraska State Poultry Association 749 of work that goes with this would make your specimens so costly that it would be a detriment to the poultry business rather than a benefit. We must realize that the American Poultry Association is meeting in the hot bed of the egg producing country and that if anything is to be put over which will benefit them much, they have the best opportunity in the world to put it over at the convention, and unless the Associations in this part of the country bring to bear a lot of pressure that we are absolutely opposed to it there will be no chance whatever for us retain - ing the exhibition poultry on its present merit. Much is said about the 200 and 300 and even more egg producers. The egg producers who are really high in their production are not the reproducers of laying specimens. Take any hen that has had a high record and if the egg production has been forced, they cannot possibly produce any healthy chicks. In. our hatchery, we do not buy the eggs if the hens produce a 50 per cent yield of eggs during the month of December. We cannot advertise 200 and 300 eggers because we don't have them. If a hen will lay 150 eggs per year we are entirely satisfied, and I think the sooner the people realize that the forced egg production does nothing but weaken the viltality of their stock, the better it will be for both the producer and for the buyer as well. Only a short time ago I had a meeting of the buyers who claim that the poultry comes in in such a weakened condition it is almost impossible for them to feed more than a day or so before they begin to go down and they must be killed at once to prevent a loss. Mr. President, I move that the Association go on record as being absolutely opposed to the registration of poultry, and that a copy of said motion be sent to the secretary of the American Poultry Association. Motion made by Mr. Neitzel that the Nebraska Poultry Association go on record as opposed to the registration of poultry. Seconded by Deaver. Carried. Motion made by Knudsen that the Nebraska Poultry Association be represented at the American Poultry Association to be held at Portland, Oregon. Seconded by Skinner. Carried. MR. KNUDSEN: In view of the fact that Mr. Smiley is a member of the Judges sec - tion of the American Poultry Association, that he has the interests of the poultrymen at heart, I move that he be appointed to represent the Nebraska Poultry Association at this meeting. MR. LAING: I am heartily in favor of sending someone to Portland to defend out interests there, and I make a motion that Mr. Smiley be sent to carry out the interests of this asosciation whatever they may be.
