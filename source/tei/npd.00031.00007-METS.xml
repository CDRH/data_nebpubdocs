            <seg id="p007">COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC LANDS AND BUILDINGS Lincoln, Nebr., Dec. 1, 1914 To His Excellency, John H. Morehead, Governor: Sir: In compliance with constitutional requirement, I have the honor to submit the following report of the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings, who is also the Secretary of the Board of Educational Lands and Funds, for the biennium beginning De - cember 1, 1912, and ending November 30, 1914. The Board of Public Lands and Buildings has, since the last report from this department, been abolished, and the present Board now has charge only of the educational lands of the state and is custodian of the Capitol Building, governor's mansion and State Fair grounds. I During the past two years, under the direction of the Board, ral rooms have been fitted up in the basement of the eapitol for railway commission, and the fourth floor of the building has been e tenantable by the addition of nineteen splendid office rooms, congestion which has been especially apparent in the building ng legislative sessions has been thus relieved in a large measure, at an expense trifling compared to the benefit derived. A new »tor has also been installed in the eapitol building. IThe sidewalk scheme about the eapitol grounds has been carried by the laying of concrete walks on the north, east and we«t of the building, and by the making of fine asphalt roadways le east and west entrances. KThe inadequate heating apparatus in the governor's mansion has superseded by an underground connection with the power e on the eapitol grounds, the mansion thus being heated in the • manner as the eapitol itself. »Two buildings have been erected on the fair grounds under the •rvision of the Board. One is a fireproof Armory building for use of the National Guard, erected at a contract cost of $5,995.00. »This building is intended as a storehouse for the supplies of the :ia headquarters, and is contiguous to the railroad tracks, making loading and unloading of goods an easy matter. KThe other is the magnificient new Agricultural Building— one of handsomest structures of its kind in the country erected at the ract cost of $95,563.00. Besides these two buildings, the Board uleted for the state the purchase of $8,000 worth of land ad - it to the fair grounds. </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 LAND COMMISSIONERS REPORT Review of Appraisement tit is generally known that when a lease holder, who is entitled urchase land from the state, makes application for such purchase, land in question is appraised for sale purposes, by the super - « or commissioners of the county wherein it is located. This »tion thereupon becomes reviewable by the State Board, to de - ine whether the appraisement is adequate or otherwise. During the biennium just closed, 19,243 acres in twenty-five counties have been so purchased and reviewed by me personally and individually. The county officers' valuation of about $226,000.00 was raised to $256,000.00, and this increase of $30,000.00 was ap - proved by the Board. As the purchaser pays the expense of the county officers' appraisement, the increase in review is net, less the small cost of review by the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings or other representative of the Board. Reappraisement of Leased Lands I During the biennium, the lands under lease in seven counties be state have been reappraised and the new valuations approved the Board of Educational Lands and Funds. The appended e shows the counties thus affected: » Besides these counties, 83,939 acres in Madison, Cedar and x counties have been reappraised, but are not included in the e table for the reason that the reappraisement has not been as approved by the Board. IThe increase in valuation of leased lands so far approved means nnual increase in rentals of $17,309.00, the lease holders paying mtal 6', on the valuation of the land held by them. More counties would have been reappraised as to their leased lands, but lack of appropriation prevented. In the estimate of expenses for the coming biennium, I have asked for an increased appropriation for this purpose. Many counties should be reappraised as the state is not as present receiving rental from them propor - tionate to their value. COUNTY Old Value New Value Increase iherman $61,172.00 33,662.00 33,942.00 27,479.00 86,517.00 24,557.00 19,864.00 $90,178.00 58,500.00 57,597.00 64,050.00 215,367.00 56,320.00 33,669.00 $29,006.00 24,838.00 23.655.00 36,571.00 128,850.00 !E p - h * Totals $287,193.00 $575,681.00 $288,488.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p009">THE STATES SCHOOL FUND 9 The State's School Fund The temporary school fund is derived from the following sources: Interest on permanent school funds, rentals on lands under lease, in - terest on balance due on lands sold, bonus received as premium to secure lease contracts, interest on delinquent rental and in - and money received for licenses, fines, fees, etc. This temporary school fund is apportioned twice a year to the different counties in the state for the support of the public schools. KThe permanent school fund is derived from the sale tl lands, escheated lands, and 5', of the purchase pri. rnment lands sold within the state. This fund is invested in est-bearing bonds in amounts at present as follows: I Appended to this report will be found tables showing the ac - ition and disposal of the educational lands of the state, and the i accomplished in this department for the two-year period. I ' also attached hereto the rules and regulations now governing sale and lease of educational lands which may be of inter* pective lessees and purchasers. A table of the fees charged in department is also shown. ■ In conclusion, I wish to thank my fellow members on the Board their uniform kindness and courtesy to me.

These auctions r generally but once each year at the offices of the various ty treasurers. Lease Contracts The Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings may at least once in each year designate a day and hour for offering in a public manner, at the office of the county treasurer in the respective coun - ties, lease contracts on all of the educational lands, which may be subject to lease in that county at the time of such offering. The same shall be subject to lease at an annual rental of six (6) per cent on the appraised value. Provided, that if two or more parties desire to lease the same land, the officer having control of the auction shall lease to the person who will pay the greater amount of cash bonus in addition to six (6) per cent on the appraised value as annual Lease rentals are due in two installments, January 1 and July 1 of each year. If not paid within six months after due, the lease holders are declared delinquent and notice is sent them if their post - office addresses are known; if unknown, advertisement is made in a newspaper. Ninety days after date of such notice lease contracts are declared forfeited and are subject to auction thereafter. (See 1 Delinquent lease holders are not permitted to bid at the sale of lands they have forfeited, but at any time before the land is ally put on the auction block they may reinstate their leases by ng all back rentals and penalty fees.

Sale Contract* A lease holder whose lease may be converted to a sale, desiring to purchase the lands described in his lease, should apply to the county clerk in which the land is located, to have same appraised by the county board for the purpose of sale. Such appraisement shall be subject to review and approval by the Board of Educational Lands and Funds, before the same shall become effective. I'pon the sale of any lands on which full payment is not made the Commis - sioner of Public Lands and Buildings will issue a sale contract running for a term of twenty (20) years, showing the land purchased, the amount paid, the amount due and the time when the interest and principal are due, and on the payment of such amount, according to law, the purchaser or his assignee shall be entitled to a deed of such land. The contract holder has the privilege of making payments on the principal at any time and in any amounts, which should be done just on or before January 1, thus reducing the interest of the ensuing year. The owner of a sale contract may, at any time, pay any portion of the purchase price thereof to the treasurer of the county in which the land is situated: Provided, all interest at that time earned and due has first been paid; and when the principal is paid in full, other than at the first of the year, interest upon the obligation having been paid for the entire year, the county treasurer receiving such principal payments may refund to the payor, out of any interest money then in his hands, the interest so paid in advance in excess of the amount earned and due at the time said final payment is made.

INo educational lands shall be sold for less than seven dollars acre, nor for less than the appraised value as approved by the •d of Educational Lands and Funds. Notes The Board of Educational Lands and Funds meets on the second Tuesday of each month. No assignment of a school land lease or sale contract is valid until recorded in the office of the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings, and will not be recorded if any interest or rental is due at the time said assignment is offered for record. The original sale or lease contract must be sent in with the assignments or the latter cannot be recorded. The contract will be returned with the recorded assignments. When a subdivision of not less than forty acres in any contract is Assigned, a new number is given the assigned portion on the ledger account, and a copy of the original should be given to the assignee. A fee of seventy-five cents is required for such copies. When assign - ments are made as above, the original contract must be reduced and the interest or rentals as the case may be is adjusted to the new conditions. 1 Whenever a lease or sale contract becomes lost or destroyed, a lied copy of the same may be procured by filing an affidavit of contract. Fee for recording affidavit fifty cents, and for each Red copy of contract seventy-five cents. Such copies may be in lieu of the original for the purpose of passing title. KWhen interest on a sale contract or rental on a lease contract is paid when due, county treasurers will collect "penalty" interest per cent for the time purchaser or lessee has been tardy in ing such payments. Improvements on leased land, and the owner's equity in land under sale contract, are subject to taxation. t County treasurers are requested to send in school land receipts iast once each week. Sometimes tardiness in this particular leads considerable unnecessary correspondence and occasionally to iquencies being charged against contract holders who are not in jrs but whose receipts have not been sent in to the Land Com - ioner's office. </seg>

KA11 correspondence regarding surveys is referred to this depart - ;, and during the biennium 1708 letters have been written, and mation given in a large number of telegraphic and telephone ages and personal calls from county and private surveyors and owners. Iln making the government surveys the general topographical ares of the country and character of the soil were noted, along section lines surveyed and at the close of the township a general ription of each township. These records although made from .y to sixty years ago form the basis of information as to the acter of the soil at that time and the changes which have been g on. While there are publications giving general information townships and counties, scarcely a day passes that personal and ihone calls are not received for particular information from these inal records made by the surveyors in the field. In the sandhill region of the northwest part of the state which was considered, in the early history of the state, wholly or in part, entirely worthless or adapted to grazing purposes only, hundreds of townships were surveyed many years before a farmer or grazer had located therein. The region being almost entirely destitute of timber or stone the corners of the surveys, in great part were mounds of earth taken from the witness pits, which by the time peramnent settlements began were so nearly destroyed by wind and storm and the witness pits so filled that the land seekers and settlers were very often unable to find their land marks without the aid of experts in that particular line of work. IThe great error in having the original surveys made long before necessity therefor existed, resulted in the government having to •sey hundreds of these townships where it still holds the title to iast M% of the land. ■During the biennium there have been received from the General I Office at Washington, D.

Proclamation of the President dated September 30, 1913, pro - viding for allotment and entry of lands in the Nebraska National Forest Reservation and the Fort Niobrara Military Reservation restored to Public Domain by Executive orders dated August 1, 1911. ■The field notes and maps of a large number of resurveyed ships in the central and northwestern part of the state will be ved from Washington, D. C. during the next biennium. It will not be practical to bind the notes of these resurveys until a sufficient number of contiguous townships are received so that proper index titles of volumes can be arranged for convenient and ready reference. KThe old leather bindings of the field notes made from thirty xty years ago are rapidly deteriorating so that it is necessary eep rebinding the most ruined covers; during the biennium 104 mes have been rebound in khaki or printers cloth of uniform with those rebound in previous years. In the basement storeroom there have lain for nearly twenty five years, several hundred maps of surveys of meridians, standard parallels and township lines, elegantly drawn by experiecned topo - graphical draughtsmen which cost the government a large sum of money. During the biennium 136 of these, and all east of the 6th Prin - cipal Meridian executed on drafting paper and more than fifty years old, have been mounted on fine muslin and bound into three books or portfolios in khaki covers, leather backs and corners, and appro - priately labeled, for $15.00. t There are still in the basement, in old worn-out portfolios, maps le meridians, standard parallels and township lines, west of the principal meridian, that should also be taken care of in the i manner. These are a part of the records of surveys of Ne - ka entrusted by the general government to the state for its use. (The office has in past years been at times greatly embarrassed &gt;t being able to find the notes of occasional fragmentary surveys, cially of fractional townships along the rivers, in their consecutive r in the bound volumes. As far as range 17 west, many of the iships, through which runs the Platte river, the surveys were jted under two and sometimes three independent contracts: the fractions on the south side of the river, then the fractions he north side, then the islands or long strips of land among the channels. Independent fragmentary surveys were made along Missouri and Niobrara rivers and frequently these were im - &gt;6rly bound: </seg>

R. 7 W. was bound in R. 8 W. and fractional $4 N. R. 8 W. was bound in R. 7 W. T. 18 and part of I W. was accidently found bound in R. 56 W. I To discover and correst these errors and to restore the mis - id notes to their proper relative positions, the office, during ? periods, has been preparing an abstract and index of all govern - t surveys in the state. The contents of each volume are care - examined, then abstracted on prepared blanks; each volume ven a corresponding consecutive number displayed on the back, township maps of surveys are also abstracted and numbered, racting and indexing of the notes and maps of surveys, east of sixth principal meridian have been completed, and the notes of ity ranges west and four ranges of maps. The law of 1903 provided that the state surveyor should prepare and issue, under the direction of the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings, a circular of instructions to county surveyors, for their direction and guidance in the restoration and establishment of lines and preservation of corners in conformity with the law*, rules and regulations of the United States, and established rules of surveying; and for the concise and comprehensive preparation of field notes, and maps of surveys. In compliance with the law, a pamphlet was prepared and 500 copies printed under the title of "Circular of Instructions to County Surveyors." Copies were mailed to all the county surveyors and their deputies. In this circular all subjects usually discussed in the text books and manuals on sur - veying were discarded, and particular attention given to original corners, how constructed and witnessed in the prairie country. How many townships were subdivided into sections by what I designated as the "Short Cut Method." The retracement of lines and the law for the restoration of "Lost or Obliterated Corners" and the evidence by which corners and their witnesses, such as the "Trench and Pits" in the early surveys of the state, and later by the "Witness Pits."

A table showing the latitude of each of the eight Standard parallels, and of each mile from the Nebraska-Kansas base line to the north boundary, and a table showing the length of a degree of longitude in chains and miles on the base line and each standard parallel, not heretofore given in any publication on surveying. This circular consists of sixty-two pages and 1,000 copies were printed; of these, 106 were bound in leather for the use of the county surveyors and the files, and the remainder in gray paper tThe limited available funds permitted only a treatise on land sying. The many consultations had, and questions submitted dvice makes it necessary, when the funds can be spared, to issue nilar circular on town and city surveying. According to law, disputes between owners of lands or lots over their boundary lines, when applications are made to the Com - missioner of Public Lands and Buildings, are referred to this de - partment for settlement, and when surveys thereof are made, and the field notes and maps, etc., approved by the Commissioner and certified copies thereof sent the county surveyor of the counties for record in which the surveys were made, it is a final settlement of the disputes, provided, however, that any person having an interest in the land affected by such survey may appeal to the courts as pro - vided by law. At the beginning of the present biennium the Commissioner continued the deputies appointed by his predecessor, conditioned, that such of the deputies who could devote all or most of their time should be kept employed, while those who could only devote a small part of their time should be assigned the overflow applications as they might be able to spare the time. Mr. H. D. Patterson, county surveyor of Sarpy county, on account of the volume of work in his county, was unable to take care of any work during 1913 and when about to take the field last spring was stricken with diphtheria from which he has not sufficiently recovered to perform the arduous duties of working out the complicated cases requiring adjustment. Mr. J. L. Paul, of Howard county, was unable to take care of any applications until after the dry weather of 1913. Geo. C. Reed, of Harlan county, and E. C. Simmons, of Lincoln, were kept quite busy during 1913, but early last spring, Mr. Reed removed to Montana, and Mr. Simmons was employed by the County Board of Adams county, Iowa, to superintend the construction of roads and bridges for one year.

Field Work During the summer of 1913 I surveyed the farm on which the Boys' Industrial School at Kearney is located, and the purchase of 284.69 acres in an irregular tract adjacent to the Home, under the legislative appropriation of 1913, and undertook to survey the lands of the Agricultural College at Curtis, Frontier county. In this case the Dean desired that the corners be examined as to their identity and perpetuated with iron posts conspicuously displayed so as to avoid future trouble with adjacent land owners. I found there had been recent surveys of the section lines, few, of any, of the original corners found, and court decisions in accordance with these surveys had been rendered, and it was these corners I was to examine and certify as being correct and perpetuate. Before this could be done it was necessary to rerun and remeasure the lines, make a thorough and exhaustive search for original corners, and if not found, then recalculate the position of the corners to see if they had been cor - rectly placed. II proceeded to examine the location of two corners nearest college, but the long continuous drouth had rendered the ground Iry and hard as to make it impossible to get into the ground out the aid of picks, which was liable to destroy the evidences riginal corners, besides the weather was so excessively hot as to e such work very exhaustive, therefore it was mutually deemed sable to adjourn the survey to await more favorable conditions. I also made a preliminary survey of the Old Presbyterian Mission site, established in 1855, on the right bank of the Missouri river, in the Omaha Indian Reserve for the State Historical society. The necessary assistance was donated by the Omaha Indians and the Historical Society paid the necessary traveling expenses and board. Also the survey of part of the south line of the State Fair Grounds for the Agricultural Soeifty. which furnished the necessary assistance. In April of the present year I made a survey in the Niobrara Valley near Bristow, Boyd county, and early in May, of the north, south and west lines of the grounds of the Soldiers and Sailors Home at Milford. A few days thereafter, at the request of the Board of Educational Lands and Funds, I was sent to Grant county to repre - sent the state in the examination of the original survey of school sections 16 and 36, which was to be conducted by U. S. surveyors under the direction of the Interior Department, Washington, D. C. and was absent on this work nearly six weeks, during which time it was impossible to satisfactorily look after surveys for the settlement of disputes. I also did extra work on the fifth guide meridian in Dundy county. it v pfiit t { no t fipsf survevs All o t hers hn vt* h$*€* n m«\d6 b v fie d u t i&amp;s </seg>
            <seg id="p030">LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT 30 E Simmons, Paul and Coon. Mr. Paul has been kept quite making surveys under applications filed in the central and n part of the state. In the matter of the resurvey of the fifth guide meridian through T. 1 N. Dundy county, which I completed in May, 1911, by re - storing missing corners and monumenting all the corners on the en - tire six miles with iron posts furnished by the government, but I was only provided with 2 inch iron posts for section corners, and 1 inch for meander corners. These not being of uniform size with those along the north 18 miles of the line, I was requested by the government to return and replace the section and meander corners with 3 inch iron posts. I have been ready to make the change as requested but the government has failed to furnish the posts until the last few days, when I had notice that they were at Haigler. KThe work of making the change has been completed, and the vey of the line is therefore finished and $13.75 of the appro - ion returned to the treasury. I stated in a former report that I was assisted in the examina - tion and resurvey of the line by a government surveying party in May, 1910, and in October by two government parties at an approxi - mate cost of $700* for service in the field, and material for corners, which added to the state's cost, made an approximate cost of $1,200. This was an extraordinary case of deception practiced by the U. S. deputies in 1872 who ran the township and subdivisional lines, in falsifying the original measurements of the base line and of the Nebraska-Colorado line, as well as their own closing lengths of lines, thus casting a grave suspicion that the original meridian run in 1869 by John W. Daugherty had been tampered, causing great diversity of opinion as to the proper procedure, a number of surveys, neighborhood quarrels, litigation and bloodshed. The number of men and length of time engaged, the care in making the examina - tion and the effort to collect all the available evidence of the work in the field as well as the knowledge of early settlers, resulted in finding sufficient original corners and other data to restore the entire line of twenty-four miles, resulting in peace and quiet and good feeling, excepting perhaps in one or two cases of adverse possession which can easily be settled by arbitration or in the proper tribunal.

After a survey is made the field notes are typewritten in dupli - cate giving a full explanation of the field work with the conclusions, or findings, of the surveyor, together with a map in conformity with the survey, all of which, after due examination, are submitted to the Commissioner for approval, upon which the original becomes the office record and the duplicate or eo| tat to the county surveyor of the county in which the survey was had for record in the Official Record of land survey of the county ■ My experience in the survey itutions has been that no care uments; that they have been of grounds belonging to has been taken to preserve the ind are now being destroyed by travel, cultivation and careless search so that their discovery is be - coming a difficult matter. In every case there have been encroach - ments either by the state or adjacent owners causing disputes over boundary lines. The grounds of all the state institutions should be surveyed and the corner monuments of durable material conspicuously displayed, as in the survey of the farm for the Boys' Industrial School at Kearney, purchased in 1913, where the monuments were of pipe five inches in diameter by five feet long, filled with concrete and set three and one-half feet in the ground, in concrete, leaving eighteen inches above ground, excepting in the public roads where the posts were thirty inches long and set in concrete, full length in the ground. Iln order that all unsurveyed state institutional grounds be •yed during the coming biennium I recommend that sufficient a ative appropriation be made for this purp&lt;&gt; I It has been my experience in more than forty years spent in retracement of lines and searching for corners in Nebraska, that greatest interest centers around the question of the identity of nal corners. ■ Land owners want all the land that by right belongs to them, to avoid quarrels and litigation are desirous of having the iden - of their landmarks definitely settled and perpetuated. (The experience of this department is, that this interest is in - ing, accentuated no doubt by the marvelous increase in land »s in recent years, and by the further fact that the original rmen or patentees of the land, have seen their corners gradually ipear and become lost or obliterated, so far as visible surface ations are concerned, by reason of travel, cultivation or covered and knowing that only a few years of life remain to them, pre - ave all disputes over landmarks and boundary lines settled, !r than hand them down to their children. </seg>
            <seg id="p034">34 LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT are over the question of lost or obliterated corners, and in our sur - veys we make the greatest effort to recover the original corners. tTo enable a surveyor, however expert he may otherwise be, lires special training in the manipulation of the surface soil to aver and bring out the characteristic marks of identification in kinds of soil and under all conditions in which corners were blished and are being found, special training in the watchfulness bserve and detect the smallest and faintest indications and to be to read and interpret their meaning. This training requires ths and years of continual actual field work and even then no becomes so perfect in this line of work that it can be said he ;r makes a failure. There are many excellent county and private surveyors in the localities in which they operate, who do not have that varied ex - perience in making resurveys in different parts of the state and be - coming acquainted with the methods of the different government surveyors who executed the original surveys, nor the experience in all kinds of soil, localities and conditions to enable them to handle the confusing and complicated cases submitted. And unfortunately, these students of the engineering course in the University, notwithstand - ing their high standing in the theory of surveying and engineering do not have the opportunity to acquire that training in actual field practice, for it would require months of work and excursions into different and distant parts of the state, besides, such work must be done in the milder portions of the year for it cannot be done when the ground is frozen. Therefore, this office has found it difficult to find surveyors who have had this special training in searching for original corners, which would enable them to successfully handle the confusing and complicated cases referred to us, which are usually cases that the county surveyors are too glad to get rid of and very often they recommend the parties in dispute to make applications to this office for a survey. Iln addition to the regular duties of the state surveyor the slature of 1911 made an appropriation for the purpose of assist - in the procuring of marking the "Oregon Trail" through Ne - ska with suitable monuments to be erected under the supervision the state surveyor, the State Regent of the Daughters of the erican Revolution and secretary of the State Historical Society. ; appropriation has been expended in payment of monuments and able inscriptions and necessary field work of identification of the rail" and points of special historical interest. There only remains &gt;w monuments paid for by the appropriation to be erected. In the division of the work among the three members of the Commission the greater portion assigned to the state surveyor, aside from. the actual field work has bean performed outside of the regular office hours, so as not to retard the regular office work. </seg>
