            <seg id="p002">2</seg>
            <seg id="p003">3 FOREWORD To His Excellency, the Governor : The Board of Control herewith transmits the Fifth Biennial Report of the State Institutions of Nebraska for the period ending June 30, 1923. The biennium formerly ended on November 30 of each even-numbered year, but this date was changed by an act of the legislature, so that this report really covers a period of thirty-one months from December 1, 1920, to June 30, 1923. During the period, no change has occurred in the personnel of the Board, but several changes have been made in the chief officers of institutions. Dr. Beverly A. Finkle, superintendent of the Orthopedic Plospital, Lincoln, Nebraska, resigned to enter private practice, and was succeeded on August 23, 1921, by Dr. J. H. Matthai. Miss Amy V. Stevens, who had been superintendent of the Home for Dependent Children. Lincoln, Nebraska, for a number of years, resigned on July 5, 1922, being succeeded by her sister, Miss Nellie Stevens. The latter served until February 19, 1923, when her resignation was received, and Miss Lena Driever was appointed to the position. We call attention with pride and pleasure to the fact that the report shows the institutions to have gone through the bien - nium without incurring any deficiencies ; although the cost of living, and consequently the cost of supporting the state's depen - dents, has certainly not decreased since the appropriations were made for the biennium. Some improvements of a permament character have been made at the various institutions during the period covered by this report. A hospital building, bakery and scullery have been erected at the Nebraska Institution for Feeble Minded, Beatrice, Nebraska ; a cottage for girls at the Girls' Training School, Geneva, Nebraska ; a hospital building at the Soldiers and Sailors' Home, Burkett, </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 Nebraska ; a gymnasium building at the State Industrial School, Kearney, Nebraska ; a hospital building at the Hospital for Tuberculous, Kearney, Nebraska ; a farm house and a barn at the Lincoln State Hospital, Lincoln, Nebraska ; a warehouse at the State Penitentiary, Lincoln, Nebraska ; a hospital building at the Soldiers and Sailors' Home, Milford, Nebraska ; a kitchen building at the Norfolk State Hospital, Norfolk, Nebraska ; a main building at the State Reformatory for Women, York, Nebraska. These buildings were badly needed, and they will have to be followed by others in the very near future if our wards are to be properly, efficiently and economically cared for. The legislature just past made provision for two or three buildings, but failed to see the necessity for several others that were urgently requested. Brief mention was made in the last report of the establishment of the Reformatory for Men at Lincoln, but the importance of the institution calls, we believe, for rather more extended notice. This institution was established as a result, primarily, of a wide recognition of the need of segregating young first-term offenders from more mature criminals. The legislature of 1921 authorized the establishment, therefore, of such an institution, making an initial approproation of $300,000. Of this sum the Board ex - pended $37,500 for 10 acres and a brick building known as the Hay ward Military Academy, later buying about 152 acres of contiguous land for the sum of $49,531.25. This land is used for farming, stock raising, dairying, and intensive gardening. Various trades are taught such as tailoring, shoe repairing, carpentry and joinery, brick laying, electricity, automobile repairing, launder - ing, engineering, firing, and barbering. The manual labor about the institution is, of course, performed by the inmates, of which there are at this date 189. Mr. A. \V. Miller, the superintendent, is doing much constructive work with the young men committed to his charge, and we believe the institution is amply justifying itself. The difficulty of employing the penitentiary inmates at suitable labor that does not conflict too much with the prerogatives of the free workers of our state, has been pretty well overcome. The state still operates the fibre furniture factory which has been at the prison for some years, and has also established relations with the Oberman Company by which shirts are made and disposed of with a minimum of competition with free labor. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">5 INMATE POPULATION There are seventeen institutions under the control of the Board, and at this time (July 1, 1 c '23 ) the inmate population is 5917, as compared with an average of 4 () S0 for the biennium ending in 1921, ami 4 ( X)7 for the biennium just prior to that.

In conclusion we wish to express our appreciation of the efforts of the officers and employees of the various institutions in striving to bring about a betterment of the living conditions of the wards under their care. We wish also to thank the Governor for his manifestations of interest and for his assistance in the work of this department, and we trust that he will continue his efforts to help us provide better means of caring for the wards of the state.

            <seg id="p019">19 To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. The report covering the operation of the Orthopedic Hospital for the period ending June 30. 1923, is herewith respectfully submitted. The purpose of the Orthopedic Hospital is that of correction of twisted little bodies in children, prevention of deformities, and stands as an advisor to the medical and surgical professions of our state. Those are admitted, whose parents or caretakers are unable to stand the financial burden of prolonged private treatment. Tables appended hereto will give a very comprehensive idea of the scope and magnitude of the work being done. Xo charge is made for the hospital service nor for the medical or surgical procedure, if such is indicated after careful observation and examination of the patient. However, parents or caretakers are required to supply adequate clothing and meet the expenses of mechanical appliances if these are indicated. Owing to the number of applicants on the waiting list at all times, it is necessary that application blanks be executed and sent to the Superintendent, prior to bringing the patient to the hospital. If blanks are found satisfactory, then the Superintendent makes an appointment and goes over the patient thoroughly with a view to treatment and admission, if this is indicated. The hospital stands ready at all times to give free consultation to physicians throughout the state and will give every help to solve perplexing problems. The patients, while under treatment in the hospital, are given the advantages of continuing their school work, and classes are conducted each day in all grades up to and including the eighth. The work is outlined by the county and city boards of education. The teachers are all registered and duly accredited with both the county and city boards of education. On completion of the eighth grade, the pupil is permitted to take the examinations of the county for admission to the high It is pleasing to state that in 1922 we had three such graduates, and in the past year we had four </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 pupils who while being treated finished their work and passed the high school requirements by examination. It is a well recognized fact that the minds of our little cripples have to be given first consideration, for without an easy and well occupied mind the work from a medical and surgical standpoint is of little avail. Supplemental to this grade work, the hospital is supplied with a splendid library by the State Library Commission. This is very valuable as a great source of pleasure to our patients as well as to our employees. The Orthopedic Training School for Nurses is under the direct supervision of the Superintendent of the hospital. A su - perintendent of nurses has charge of the student body, adminis - tering to its needs and aiding whenever necessary. Only student nurses of high moral character are acceptable and the work is so directed that all receive individual attention and get the most out of the work. The requirements are the same as maintained by all A-class schools. The teaching staff consists of active practicing specialists in their respective lines, thus assuring the student all that is new and up-to the minute. Classes are purposely kept small to allow all individual instruction and assure each student of a given amount of attention. Application blanks can be had from the Superintendent by addressing him direct. The constant watchword throughout the period has been economy in all departments. In defense of the high per capita cost and high proportion of employees to patients, we wish to present this hospital and its activities from a business standpoint. The first cost is the least, for we always think of the hospital as a wise business venture on the part of our state because all juvenile cripples coming from indigent homes are potential state wards in the future. We are removing this potential state ward from his position and saving the state the expense of perpetual custodial care in the future. It is on the above business basis that strong recommendations are made for more room. We need it to broaden the scope of our work. Many worthy patients cannot be given treatment for want of room. Dr. H. W. Orr, attending Orthopedic Surgeon, has given good service throughout the period and his work has proven highly satisfactory. His interest has held and to the hospital management his affiliation has been most pleasant. </seg>
            <seg id="p021">21 To that small percentage of employees, that have remained through my service to the state, must be given great credit for loyalty and unwavering endeavor to do all that was asked of them. We especially wish to commend Mrs. Carrie Harrison, the matron, for her loyalty and never-flagging interest. Her kind manner and quiet efficiency has tided over many a rough spot in the administration of the hospital's business. This report would be decidedly incomplete without mention of those individuals and groups of individuals, who have helped us solve the problem of amusement for the patients. Many clubs, societies, business firms, as well as lodges and private individuals, have contributed to the amusement and comfort of the little wards. These benefactors are too numerous to mention, though I want here to express appreciation for all that has been done. The Junior League, a noble body of women, representative of the best of our great city of Lincoln, have done a pioneer act, in that they saw fit to establish for the benefit of this institution a de - partment of occupational therapy. Over this department rules a very efficient occupational therapist, trained in her line to the nth degree. The expense of this undertaking has been entirely borne by the Junior League and the value of such a department cannot be here given in mere words. The Home for Dependent Children, adjacent to the Orthopedic Hospital, is supplied with heat, laundry and hot water from the Hospital, and up to November 30, was supplied with food. After the above date, separate kitchens were decided upon and the common store room divided. Since this separation, the Home maintains its own kitchen and store room. This arrangement is more pleasant for each institution. Each institution solves its own problems and acts as a separate unit. Relations between the two institutions have always been most cordial and the co-operation most pleasant. It must be borne in mind that the great percentage of patients are admitted in very low, enfeebled, physical condition as the result of various deformities. Often times, it takes weeks to treat the physical state and bring it back to where surgery can be attempted. Good food, rest, occupied minds and intelligent medical dietary measures, all are practiced and given. Children are often unclean and without moral or ordinary training. Each child is a problem itself and to bring them all under a routine is often a huge task. </seg>
            <seg id="p022">22 No have upon deal, large The general health of the hospital has been good epidemics of any importance have been experienced. There been sporadic cases of the ordinary childrens' diseases but prompt isolation and care they have ran their course. To the members of the Board of Control, we owe a great and on their kind counsel and ministrations depends to a extent the smooth and efficient functioning institution. Signed, H. H. MATTHAI, Superintendent </seg>

            <seg id="p029"/>
            <seg id="p030">FOREWORD To His Excellency, the Governor : The Board of Control herewith transmits the Fifth Biennial Report of the State Institutions of Nebraska for the period ending June 30, 1923. The biennium formerly ended on November 30 of each even-numbered year, but this date was changed by an act of the legislature, so that this report really covers a period of thirty-one months from December 1, 1920, to June 30, 1923. During the period, no change has occurred in the personnel of the Board, but several changes have been made in the chief officers of institutions. Dr. Beverly A. Finklc, superintendent of the Orthopedic Hospital, Lincoln, Nebraska, resigned to enter private practice, and was succeeded on August 23, 1921, by Dr. J. H. Matthai. Miss Amy V. Stevens, who had been superintendent of the Home for Dependent Children, Lincoln, Nebraska, for a number of years, resigned on July 5, 1922, being succeeded by her sister, Miss Nellie Stevens. The latter served until February 19, 1923, when her resignation was received, and Miss Lena Driever was appointed to the position. We call attention with pride and pleasure to the fact that the report shows the institutions to have gone through the bien - nium without incurring any deficiencies; although the cost of living, and consequently the cost of supporting the state's depen - dents, has certainly not decreased since the appropriations were made for the biennium. Sume improvements tif a permament character have been made at the various institutions during the period covered by this report. A hospital building, bakery and scullery have been erected at the Nebraska Institution for feeble Minded, Beatrice, Nebraska) a cottage for girls at the Girls' Training School, Geneva, Nebraska j a fms|iii;tf iiHiMiug At the Soldiers and Sailors' Hume, Htirkett, </seg>
            <seg id="p031">4 Nebraska; a gymnasium building at the State Industrial School, Kearney, Nebraska; a hospital building at the Hospital for Tuberculous, Kearney, Nebraska ; a farm house and a barn at the Lincoln State Hospital, Lincoln, Nebraska; a warehouse at the State Penitentiary, Lincoln, Nebraska; a hospital building at the Soldiers and Sailors' Home, Milford, Nebraska; a kitchen building at the Norfolk State Hospital, Norfolk, Nebraska ; a main building at the State Reformatory for Women, York, Nebraska. These buildings were badly needed, and they will have to be followed by others in the very near future if our wards are to be properly, efficiently and economically cared for. The legislature just past made provision for two or three buildings, but failed to •ee the necessity for several others that were urgently requested. Brief mention was made in the last report of the establishment of the Reformatory for Men at Lincoln, but the importance of the institution calls, we believe, for rather more extended notice. Thifc iiiktitiilKin was etitabliHhed as a result, primarily, of a wide recognition of the need of segregating young first-term offenders from more mature criminal*, The legislature of 1921 authorized ili«* fkUliluliHiriii, therefore, of Midi an institution, making an initial appropriation of $.HX),(XX). &lt; &gt;t thin sum the Board ex - pended $A7,MM for 10 wren uiul a brick building known as the Hayward Military Academy, later buying about 152 acres of Hrtriitfumiii land for thr Mini of $49,531 J5, Thin land in used for UrmiiiK, »i&lt;m It raUiug, dairying, and intensive gardening.

            <seg id="p047">19 To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I present to you my report of the Nebraska State Penitentiary, together with tables showing the general income, etc., for the period ending June 30, 1923. At this time our population is five hundred fifty-six males, and eleven females, making a total of five hundred sixty-seven. There are now employed three hundred men in the manufacture of work shirts; eighty men manufacturing fiber furniture; fifty men farming, stock raising, gardening ; the balance of the number, who are physically fit to work, are employed as firemen, engineers, cell house runners, waiters, cooks and at other lines of work necessary to carry on the work of the institution. At the present time we have a very crowded condition here, as four hundred fifty is about our capacity. We expected some relief from the Legislature but in this we were disappointed as no appropriation which would guarantee us more room was provided. There are at least one hundred men in the county jails under sentence which we are unable to accommodate. Ii will be necessary that they be held until our population is reduced in some way, or more room provided. I would recommend that a building be erected outside the walls for all trusties, such as farmers, stock raisers, dairy men and others working on the outside. This would relieve our crowded condition on the inside. I would also recommend a cold storage building, something we have been badly in need of for many years, as our old one has become too small for so large a population. Our large dining room is badly in need of a new floor. I hope this improvement can be made soon. Our inmate kitchen is too small for the number we are required to care for, and I believe some improvement should be made on same. Our dairy barn is badly in need of some improvement. With the increase of our prison population, in my judgment it will be necessary in the near future to provide more cell house </seg>
            <seg id="p048">20 room, but as this institution is located where the flood waters fill our basement and sometimes two or three feet of water in our cell houses, I would not recommend that any more expensive cell houses be built in this location. Our new ware house, which was built back of the walls last year, has proven a great help to us in making more shop room, as all our extra supplies are kept in this ware house, where the chances of destruction from fire is much less than if those materials were kept inside. Our prison night school has been well attended ; about one hundred fifty are enrolled at the present time. Our prison library is cared for by one of the boys and is well patronized by the men. Chaplain Maxwell and our Voluntary Chaplain Reverend McKenna are looking after the spiritual welfare of the men. A number of the good people of Lincoln are looking after the Sunday School work each Sunday. In conclusion, I wish to thank the Honorable Board, Ex- Governor McKelvie, and his Excellency, Governor Bryan, for their kind cooperation in the administration of the affairs of the institution, and I appreciate the good work of my Deputy, Mr. Kavanaugh, and all my co-workers for their loyalty and grateful consideration of the affairs of the institution. Very respectfully submitted W. T. FENTON, Warden. </seg>
