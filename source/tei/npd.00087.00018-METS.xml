         <seg id="p002">SUMMARY The irrigated rotation plots at the Scottsbluff Substation were utilised (or a study of the occurrence of potato scab, rhizoctonia, and fusarium wilt. These rotations were started in 1912. The disease records were made in the years 1929 to 1936. The crops grown in the rotations in addition to potatoes are sugar beets, corn, oak. and alfalfa and in some of the rotations barnyard manure is applied. The rotations vary from one to seven years in length. The study included the effect of (1) the length of the rotation, (2) the use o( manurial treatments, (3) alfalfa as a green manure, and (4) the other crops in the rotation, aixcially the crop immediately preceding potatoes, upon the occurrence of these snil-bornc diseases. . ... The data were obtained by sampling the harvested crop and examining tubers for each of the diseases. Records were also made of the development of fusarium wilt in the field during the summer. . Scab was most severe in the short rotations with sugar beets and least in the long four-to-svx-ycar rotations in which alfalfa preceded potatoes. Applications of barnyard manure in the short rotations increased the amount of scab. The total yield was so greatly increased, however, that more marketable tubers were produced in spite of the increase in scab. Rhizoctonia was most severe with continuous culture of potatoes and in the short rotations, while very little occurred in the long rotations with alfalfa. The application of barnyard manure in the short rotations decreased the per - centage of tubers infected with rhizoctonia. The highest percentage of fusarium wilt occurred in the two-year rotation with corn. Continuous potato culture and short rotations with grain resulted in more fusarium wilt than did the longer rotations with alfalfa preceding potatoes, in which the percentage of infection was very low. On the basis of foliage symptoms, F. solani v. mmartii was responsible for the greater part of the fusarium wilt. The disease was most evident in the field during the first half of September. The percentage of tubers showing symptoms in the bin closely paralleled the percentage of infected plants in the field. Considering both yields and disease, the best rotations are those with alfalfa preceding potatoes anil with three- to six-year intervals between potato crops. If short rotations are employed the use of manure is advisabk. M fusarium: wilt is a problem, the use of corn preceding potatoes is inadvisable. </seg>
         <seg id="p003">Influence of Crop Rotations under Irrigation on Potato Scab, Rhizoctonia, and Fusarium Wilt R. W. GOSS AND M. M. AFANASIEV One of the problems of maintaining high yields of marketable potatoes is that of controlling the diseases that reduce'either the total yield or the quality of the crop. While many potato diseases can be controlled by the use of disease-free seed tubers, seed treatment, or sprays, these methods are not entirely effective against soil-borne diseases. Potato scab, rhizoc - tonia, and fusarium wilt may be caused by infection from either the seed tubers or the soil. The use of seed free of these diseases is an advisable practice, and seed treatments have proved effective in the control of scab and rhizoctonia. The results of such control methods, however, are often very disappointing if no precaution is taken against infection from the soil. V". ¦.¦¦•': . "'. . ' •¦:¦¦ .". v¦' ¦'¦¦;. It is often recommended that three or four years should elapse between crops of potatoes on the same soil, and this has been found by experience to be desirable; Undoubtedly the continuous cropping of land to potatoes increases the microorganisms which cause these diseases and is therefore a poor practice. On the other hand, these diseases have been known to , occur in a severe form when apparently healthy potatoes were planted on virgin soil or soil not previously planted to potatoes. It is obvious then ' that the mere lapse of three or four years between potato crops is not in J itself a guarantee against disease. Other factors, such as the crops pre - ceding potatoes or die cultural practices employed, probably influence the occurence of these diseases. In order to determine the effect of different ' cropping systems, a careful record was made of potato scab,- rhizoctonia, and fusarium wilt in irrigated rotation plots during the years 1929 to 1936 inclusive. DESCRIPTION OF THE PLOTS. The plots used in this study are located at the Scotsbluff Substation 1 on the North Plane reclamation, project in western Nebraska at an altitude of about 4,000 feet. During the years 1932 to 1936 the average monthly mean maximum and minimum temperatures were as follows: June 82 and 53, July 92 and 60, August 88 and 57, and September 77 and 45. The greatest divergence, from these temperatures occurred, in September, 1934, when the mean maximum and minimum temperatures, 72 and 41, were much.lower than the average. The year 1936 was characterized by higher temperatures throughout the growing season than occurred in the other four years. '"-• 'The rotation experiment! wed in this itudy were planned and are conducted bj the Dmiion oi Western Irrigation Agriculture of the U; S. Department of Agriculture cooperating with the Univer* litr of Nebraska. The author! arc greatly indebted to the late Jamei A. Holden, former luperintendent of. the Substation, and to Lionel Harris, acting superintendent, for ail yield data, plot histories, temperature records, and samples used in this study. . ¦¦ .*** .-. </seg>
         <seg id="p004">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 317 The effective rainfall 2 for the period June 15 to October 1 for the same years was as follows: 1932, 3.50 in.; 1933, 4.56 in.; 1934, 454.in.; 1935, 1.79 in.; and 1936, 1.16 in. In 1933 about 70 per cent of the rain - fall listed above occurred in August and September, while in 1934 about 60 per cent occurred during the first two weeks after planting. The irrigation water applied * averaged 16.22 inches per year. This was applied in four irrigations, except in 1933 when an additional applica - tion was made immediately after planting and in 1934 when because of a shortage of water only two applications could be made. WJiile these two applications in 1934 were heavy, the plants suffered severely from July 20 to August 9, and again during the last half of September. This moisture shortage was reflected in the low yields for that year. The soil of the experimental plots has been classified as a Tripp very fine sandy loam and is typical of the extensive areas of terraces lying north of the North Platte river. It is readily permeable to water, well drained, and productive. The reaction is alkaline, averaging about pH 7.5. The plots are one-fourth acre in size. The following is a list of the rotations used for this study arranged in numerical order for convenient reference: 4 Potatoes 20 Sugar beets, potatoes 21 Sugar beets (manure), potatoes 24 Oats, potatoes 25 Oats (manure), potatoes 26 Corn, potatoes 27 Oats (rye), potatoes 30 Oats, sugar beets, potatoes 31 Oats (manure), sugar beets, potatoes 40 Sugar beets, alfalfa (2 years), potatoes 44 Oats, alfalfa (2 years), potatoes 60 Oats, sugar beets, alfalfa (3 years), potatoes 61 Oats (manure), sugar beets, alfalfa (3 years), potatoes 64 Sugar beets, oats, alfalfa (3 years), potatoes 71 Sugar beets (manure), sugar beets, oats, alfalfa (3 years), potatoes All of these rotations were started in 1912, except rotations No. 64 and No. 71, which were started in 1920. Each crop in the rotation is grown each year; that is, there are as many plots for each rotation as there are years in the cycle of the rotation. The cultural practices employed have been in keeping with the better practices used in the locality, and as far as possible the same treatments have been given to all plots of the same crop. Spring plowing has been used in all potato plots except those preceded by oats, which were fall plowed. All plots in potatoes have been planted to the same variety from the same source. The Bliss Triumph variety has been used since 1920. 1 Effective rainfall ii here considered as precipitation amounting to more than 0.25 inch in 48 hours. The records were obtained from the U. S.

The largest yields were harvested in 1933 and the lowest in 1934. The rotations of four years or more with alfalfa preceding potatoes and the shorter rotations in which manure was included produced the greatest total yield and also the greatest yield of marketable tubers. The continuous potato plot No. 4 had the lowest yield, while the other plots fell midway between these two extremes. While these yields may include the influence of diseases that reduce total yields, they do not take into account those diseases that affect the quality of the potato. These effects will be dis - cussed with each specific disease. . ..!

The crops used in the rotations arc those commonly grown in the area and the plan of the rotations is such that a study of the soil-borne diseases can be made in relation ;to the effect of (1) the length of the rotation, (2) manurial treatments, (3) alfalfa as green manure, and (4) the other crops in the rotation, especially the crop immediately preceding potatoes. The original plan was devised primarily for a study of. the effect of these various factors and modifications of them upon the yields of the crops andthe continued fertility of thel soil. Because they were not originally planned for the study of disease factors, it is often impossible to separate the effect of the length of time elapsing between potato crops from changes in disease content due to the crops| used in the rotation. It is possible, however, to determine the desirable and undesirable rotations </seg>
         <seg id="p006">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 317 from the standpoint ot both yield and disease, even chough the reasons for their differences cannot be deduced with certainty. The data in the following tables and figures are based upon a careful examination of each tuber in a 100-pound random sample selected from each plot in the field at harvest time. During the years 1929 to 1932 disease records were obtained separately for each of the size grades listed in Figure 1. The sizes listed are No. 1, ovei V/t inches; No. 1, \ IA to 1% inches; and No. 3, less than V/z inches in diameter. Since 1932 only the No. 1-size tubers were examined, except in 1934 when the yields were low because of drouth and all sizes were used. Inasmuch as the potato grower is primarily interested in the market - able-size potatoes, the discussion of the data in this bulletin is chiefly confined to potatoes of that size. The detailed methods used in recording the diseases will be presented with the discussion of the data. SCAB A record of the occurrence of scab was made by grading each tuber in the sample as having slight, moderate, or severe scab, on the basis of die amount of the surface of the tuber infected. The scab was also listed as being of common, pitted, or russet type. These scab classes were recorded separately for each of the size grades during the years 1929 to 1932 5. Thereafter only tubers over 1% inches in diameter were used in making scab records, except in 1934 when all sizes were grouped together. In order to conserve space and for clearer presentation, the records for the first three years are not given, because the classes used for grading scab were slightly different from those used in the later years and the results were similar. The results during the first four years of the test indicated that while the amount of scab varied with the size of the tuber, the relative effect of the rotations on scab was similar for each of the size grades. The results for one year, 1932, are used as an example in Figure 1. It is evident from Figure 1 that the percentage of healthy and slightly infected tubers was usually greater in trie smaller size potatoes in all of the rota - tions where a large percentage of scab occurred. In the best rotations, Nos. 40 and 60, the peicentage of scab was so small and there were so few small tubers that any differences due to size were not evident. This greater severity of scab on the larger-size tubers has been observed each year. Figure 1 also illustrates the effect of the size of the tuber on the type of scab produced. The percentage of pitted scab was always least in the small-size tubers. As regards the effects of the different rotations, the results presented in Figure 1 show that the least scab occurred in the long rotations, Nos. 40 and 60, where alfalfa preceded potatoes. The amount of scab was not so great, nor was the type of scab so severe in the continuous potato plot No. 4 as in the short rotations. The greatest amount of pitted scab occurred in rotations 20, 21, 30, and 31. &gt; The amhon &gt;te indtblcd to Dr. H. O. Werner for the icab &lt;hra for ttw yean W29 lo W3l. </seg>

         <seg id="p010">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 317 marketable-size tubers because of lack of fertility (Table 1). The vines are usually dead by the middle of August. Examination of the tubers reveals that many scab infections are present on each tuber in the form of small, inconspicuous surface lesions and much russeting but no conspicuous or pitted types of scab lesions are present. Contrasted with this, the per - centage of pitted scab has usually been found to be greater in those rotations with high fertility even though the total number of infections may be very small. It would thus appear that there is a relationship between the type of scab and tuber development. _ The amount of scab occurring in the years 1933 to 1936 on No. 1-size tubers is recorded graphically in Figures 2 and 3. As previously noted the basis for classifying scab in 1932 (Fig. 1) was different from that used in the next four years (Figs. 2 and 3) and for that reason direct com - parisons of percentages are impossible. The same relative differences, however are evident. The long rotations with alfalfa preceding the potatoes produced the fewest scab culls. The two-year rotation with oats (No 24) the same rotation with the addition of winter rye turned under preceding potatoes (No. 27), and the two-year rotation with corn (No. 26) produced about the same percentages of marketable potatoes as did the longer rotations. These two-year rotations, however, were undesirable from the standpoint of yield as shown in Table 1. The greatest amount of scab occurred in the rotations in which sugar beets preceded potatoes, Nos 20 and 30, and these were much worse from the standpoint of scab than the plot continuously in potatoes. In the longer rotations where the sugar beets preceded alfalfa there was no increase in scab. The use of manure in the short rotations materially increased the amount of scab as shown by the comparison of rotations 20, 24, and 30 with the corresponding rotations in which manure was added, Nos. 21, 25 and 31 This effect of manure was evident even when it was applied one year before the potatoes, as in rotation No. 31. The addition or. manure in the longer rotations, Nos. 61 and 71, where it was applied four or five years before the potatoes, had no apparent effect on scab. It is possible that with a heavier soil the decomposition of manure would be retarded and the effect on scab might be apparent even after this longer period of time. While these results might indicate that neither sugar beets nor manure should be used in short rotations with potatoes, an analysis o£ the^ yield data in TaWe 1 shows that this conclusion is unwarranted, tven though the amount of scab is increased when manure is applied the yields are doubled and the number of marketable tubers is greatly increased. It is clear that if a short rotation must be used the addition ot manure is a desirable practice because of the great increase in yield. RHIZOCTONIA The records in this bulletin of the occurrence of rhizoctonia are limited to that phase of the disease exhibited by the production of sclerotia on the tubers It was impossible to obtain records of stem lesions or sprout </seg>
         <seg id="p011">Influence of Rotations on Potato Diseases injury without seriously interfering with the yield records of these perma - nent plots. Each individual tuber in the sample was examined for the presence of sderotia and the severity of infection. The infected tubers were graded in three classes as follows: slight, aggregate sderotia being less than two per cent of the tuber surface; medium, two. to five per cent of the surface; and severe, more than five per cent. The results were recorded on a weight basis. '.¦¦'¦ The relation of the size of the tuber to severity of infection was studied in 1932. There was less of the severe type of rhizoctonia in the smaller - size potatoes but there was very little difference in the percentage of healthy tubers. The relative amount and severity of infection in the different plots was much the same for each size grade and therefore in the following years the records were made only on die No. 1 size tubers. It was evident from the same data thatl die plots having the highest percentage of infected tubers also had the most severe infection (number of sderotia-or area of tuber surface infected as shown by a comparison of the slight, medium, and severe classes of infection). It was therefore decided that the percentage of all infected tubers served as a good basis of comparison for the different plots and die data are used in this way in Table 2, which presents the results for the| five-year period 1932 to 1936.

         <seg id="p012">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 317 or sugar beets alternated with potatoes. There was a reduction in the percentage of infected tubers in most instances when manure was used in the two-year rotations, Nos. 21 and 25, preceding! potatoes, as compared with the corresponding rotations without manure, Nos. 20 and 24. This effect of manure was also evident in a comparison oi the three-year rota - tion 30 with 31, where manure had been applied preceding the sugar beets. The use of rye as a green manure in the two-year rotation, No. 27, with oats, materially decreased the percentage of tubers with sclerotia in the two years that records were made, as compared with its companion rotation No. 24. The effect of manure is also shown in Figure 4, where the different classes of rhizoctonia are presented for these plots in contrast with the continuous potatoes and examples of the four- and six-year rotations. The degree of severity paralleled the percentage of infected tubers. It has often been stated that manure tends to increase the amount of rhizoctonia infection but this was not true in these plots as regards the formation of sclerotia on the tubers.

         <seg id="p013">Influence of Rotations on Potato Diseases It might be argued that even though sclerotia did not form on the tubers, the percentage of stem infection might be increased. No direct evidence is available from these plots on this point but a glance at the yield records in Table 1 reveals that if this 'did occur it did not have any marked effect on yield, because these manured plots always had greater yields than the unmanured. There was no indication of sprout injury affecting the stand and there were no foliage symptoms indicating stem girdling. Further investigations are being undertaken to try to determine the reasons for these results with manure. It is impossible from the available data to make direct comparisons to determine whether the time factor or the type of crop in the rotation is the cause of the smaller amount of rhizoctonia occurring in the longer rotations. It is quite obvious from Table 2 and Figure 4 that the four - and six-year rotations result in such a small 'amount of rhizoctonia that it is of no practical significance. In the two- and three-year rotations without manure the amount of infection was serious. Samples from additional rota - tion plots in which sweet clover precedes potatoes in two-, three-, and four-year rotations, have failed to yield consistent results, probably because of the shorter period of time these rotation plots have been in use. The tendency, however, has been toward a decreased amount of rhizoctonia in those plots where potatoes are preceded by :sweet clover. It is evident from the data presented that four- and six-year rotations with alfalfa preceding potatoes are desirable from the standpoint of con - trol of rhizoctonia. If a short rotation must be used, it is advisable to use manure in the rotation. Judging from the decreased amount of infec - tion resulting-from plowing under rye in the oat and potato rotation (No. 27), it is possible.that a green manure such as sweet clover might adequately control rhizoctonia in a short" rotation. FUSARIUM WILT During- the years 1932 to 1936 records were made of the number of plants in each plot showing typical symptoms of fusarium wilt. The num - ber of readings varied but the last reading was made during the first part of September in each year. The most accurate records were made in 1934 and.1935, when all infected plants were staked, while in the other years: it is possible that plants killed early in' the season may have been missed in the late-season inspections. All of the plots had comparable stands, approximately 3,800 seed pieces being I planted per plot. In all of the field records an attempt was made to distinguish between wilt caused by F.oxysporum and that produced by infection with JF. solanl v. eumartii. While it is admittedly impossible to distinguish these cor - rectly in every'instance, the method of staking each infected plant and watching the development of symptoms, as was done in 1934 and 1935, reduces the error to a very low point as compared with any single examina - tion. It is probable that a few of the plants listed as being of the F. oxysporum type may have been caused by the other species, but the reverse was improbable. ¦ . » ;,-;' </seg>
         <seg id="p014">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 317 The records for the three years 1933 to 1935 are presented (in Table 3. It can readily be seen that the great majority of irifected plants do not develop symptoms until late in August or early September. The few plants showing symptoms in July and early August were mostly of the F. oxysporum type, while the majority of those developing symptoms later were of the F. solani v. eumartii type. The last reading for each year is the total for the year and the data show that the F. solani v. eumartii type constituted 65 to 95 per cent of all the wilt occurring in the plots.

Each reading includes the infected plants of the previous date so that the final reading is the total for the year. An examination of the detailed data for each of the plots failed to show any consistent differences in the two types of wilt that could be attributed to the rotation system employed. In the following discussion relating to the rotations, only the total of both types of wilt will be presented. The severity of the disease varied from year to year but the relative positions of the different rotations as regards disease content remained fairly constant (Table 4). In general the rotations of four years or longer resulted in the least disease each year. The two-year rotations of potatoes and sugar beets resulted in less wilt than any of the other two- or three - year rotations. The two-year rotation with corn (No. 26), had the most wilt in two of the five years, that with oats manured (No. 25), in two of the years, and the one with oats and rye (No. 27) in the other year. </seg>
         <seg id="p015">Influence of Rotations on Potato Diseases ';¦¦¦' These three rotations were among the highest every year, the average for the five years being much higher than for any other rotation. The three-year rotations with potatoes, oats, and sugar beets (Nos. 30 and 31), had more wilt than the two-year rotations of potatoes and sugar beets but less than the ones with potatoes and oats and.about the same or. less than the continuous potato plot No. 4. The use of manure in rotations 21, 25, and 31 showed a slight increase in wilt over the comparable un - manured rotations when the averages for the five years are compared, but the differences were too slight or varied too much from year to. year to be significant.

I. '•' It can be concluded from the data presented on fusarium wilt that the long rotations with alfalfa preceding potatoes are desirable. Short rota - tions with com preceding potatoes should be avoided, since the per - centage of fusarium wilt was about the same as resulted from the con - tinuous culture of potatoes. If a short rotation must be used it is possible that sweet clover might result in less wilt than would the grain crops.

The effect of the length, of the rotation . was much the same with all three diseases, particularly when there was an interval of four years or more between potato crops. The effect of some of the crop {sequences and cultural prac - tices varied with the different diseases, but the rotations resulting in the least infection were the same for all three diseases. Fortunately, the desirable rotations from the disease standpoint are also the best ones as regards yields. It has been shown by Coons and Kotila 6 •G. H. Coon! and I. E. Kotila. Influence of Preceding Crops on Damping Oft- oC Sugar Beeti. Phylopath. (Atat.) 25:13, 1935. ; I </seg>
         <seg id="p018">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 317 that when sugar beets follow alfalfa there is much more "damping-off" of beet seedlings than when they follow corn or small grain. It has also beca pointed out by Harris 7 and others that the beneficial effect of alfalfa is not as great on the yield of sugar beets as on potatoes, while the reverse is tnie of manure. In this bulletin it has been shown that the four- and six-year rotations with alfalfa preceding potatoes result in less disease in the potatoes. It is therefore quite obvious that the rotations containing both sugar beets and potatoes as cash crops, should have the soil-building legume alfalfa preceding the potato crop, and the grain ciops, if in the rotation, should precede the sugar beets. In the short rotations the addition of manure increased the amount of scab but also decreased the amount of rhizoctonia on the tubers and doubled the yield. Applications of barnyard manure are therefore advis - able if a short rotation must be used. It is possible that short rotations with sweet clover might have the same beneficial effect on the disease content as does the alfalfa in the longer rotations. Data were not avail - able in this test to decide the point but such rotations might be found very advantageous, particularly if the sweet clover is desired for pasturage. The least desirable rotations were the corn and potato rotation and the continuous culture of potatoes, as regards both disease and yield. There was no evidence during the five to seven years during which records were made that there was a cumulative increase in these soil-borne diseases. The plots have been under these crop sequences since 1912 and it was considered that the effect of the crop sequences was sufficiently fixed. The results presented in this bulletin were obtained under a certain set of conditions that have been described in some detail. The application of the results under other soil and climatic conditions should be made with some reservations. A great deal of careful research will be necessary before we can accurately determine the underlying principles and apply the knowledge to other environmental conditions. 7 Lionel Harm.
