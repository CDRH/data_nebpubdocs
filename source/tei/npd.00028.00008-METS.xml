            <seg id="p063">SECRETARY OF THE STATE BANKING BOARD 63 In submitting this the twentieth annual report of the con - dition of the Building and Loan Associations of Nebraska, with summaries and detailed information, it is with pleasure I call your attention to the fact that these institutions still continue to show growth and prosperity, and seem to be keeping pace in the fulfillment of their purposes with other financial institutions that go to build up the wealth and resources of the state as a whole. There can no longer be any question as to the need of such institutions, as they are demon - strating by their steady growth that the people need their services. No material suggestions are thought to be necessary at this time as to the supervision. Time and experience will doubtless bring such changes and improvements as may be necessary to safeguard the vast sum of the people's money (now approximately $30,000,000.00), entrusted to their care. With the increasing wealth of the state as the years go on and the sum entrusted to them becomes larger the responsibility of supervision will grow to be a no inconsiderable burden. The resources in their care, drawn from the people who can illy afford to have their earnings jeopardized, will require in - creasing care and. watchfulness. No longer is there any doubt that these associations have a permanent place among the financial institutions of the state, in a field practically their own and which they are peculiarly adapted to occupy. It is to be hoped that when periods of depression come, as doubtless they will, that the interests of the wage earner and home builder will have been safeguarded so far as human integrity and care can provide. In presenting this report it is gratifying indeed to this Department to state that the management of the various in - stitutions operating under the building and loan law of the state, are following closely its provisions, and infractions and violations thereof are exceptions. It is with pleasure that I commend them to your honorable body. Very respectfully, E. ROYSE, Secretary State Banking Board. </seg>
