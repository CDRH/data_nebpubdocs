            <seg id="p015">RKPORT OF NKHRA.SKA STATK BOARII OK \lill( I I.TI RK 15 PHKSIDKXT'S ADDHKSS The time has arrived, according to the program, when your Presi - dent is to deliver his address. I wish to make a few preliminary remarks at this time. Some time ago I had in mind that I would not write my address; that the few words I would say to this body f wanted to look you men in the face and say without reading it from paper. I know these written addresses and communications sound well to many of you, and thinking the matter over again I thought perhaps it would be better to write it down because of the fact that I have not a very good command or language, and when I get warmed up on a subject I am likely to use some pretty rough expressions I have been handicapped all my life when it comes to speaking plainly. I was not over fifteen or sixteen months old, as I have been informed by my mother, when I fell out of bed one night, and I had some pretty sharp little incisors, and in the rail I bit off a little piece of my tongue, and I guess it was the piece of tongue that you use when you say something It has always been hard for me to say some - thing, and I thought I might get around that by putting it on paper and leaving it to you to judge whether or not that is an improvement. So, gentlemen of the convention, I will read you in a few moments what I have here recorded. State Board of Agriculture, Gentlemen: As chairman of your Board of Managers the past year, it again becomes my arduous duty to address you at this time. Were it not for the fact that our Secretary will no doubt submit a complete and com - prehensive report dealing with the activities the past year, my message might be severely criticised more for what it does not contain rather than the other way around. Back to normalcy has been the cry now for several years; back to the good old times prior to the war when everybody was apparently prosperous, happy and contented; back to the good old days when more of our citizens were making an honest living; that is the cry of the hour by those engaged in the greatest and noblest occupation, agriculture. The millions who are tilling the soil today are not getting a square- deal, and it seems everybody admits this and has a remedy; especially those running for public office are prone to make use of this, and have a sure-cure for all of our ills in our body politic. The Nebraska State Board of Agriculture is no doubt the one bianch of our state government which comes in more direct contact with those engaged in Agriculture than all other activities combined; in fact, they act much in the capacity of a clearing house for all agricultural promotional activities. It is here where they all find a </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 KEPOBT OF .\EBBASKA STATE BO ABO OT AGBICl'I.TLBE friend in court who is willing and ready to assist them in all their laudable undertakings, and spur them on to better effort*. In comparison with agriculture in Nebraska, all other interests fade into insignificance. It is the one basic industry which makes it pos - sible, if made remunerative, to make all other business activities also prosperous. Prosperity in our state must first come from the farms. It is not alone increased production we must be striving for, but the producers of these products must have a fair return for their products if we are to retain a happy and prosperous people. As a member of the Board of Managers, with the past two years as your President, I have had the opportunity to discover that some otherwise good people seem to think that the State Board of Agri - culture functions chiefly as a benevolent or missionary society, and is otherwise not entitled to much consideration for a place in the sun; that it is a state institution and therefore everybody, under one pre - tense or another, has certain rights and privileges, which, however, the management for good and valid reasons cannot grant. In carrying out and championing the cause of agriculture. th» - management the past year encountered difficulties which for a time seriously threatened the constructed and contemplated activities of the organization. Funds were sadly needed to take care of state property of which they are in charge and in duty bound to handle in a practical and businesslike way. The urgent need for an appropriation by the Legislature was taken up by our Board early in the year with Governor Bryan and several conferences held, but the final results was that when the Governor submitted his message to the Legislature it did not recommend a single dollar for the State Board of Agriculture. The same thine happened with the appropriation for the eradication of bovine tuber - culosis, championed by the livestock breeders and all farm organiza - tions in this state. Heaping insult on injury, the Governor rushed into the press of this state, calling those who championed and fostered these appropriations for the sole benefit of agriculture, a small bunch of grafters endeavoring to raid the state treasury. Fearing that the Legislature might not understand the situation the Governor proceeded to crack the party whip, threatening those of his party with dire results should they stray from the fold by disobeying his command. The Legislature, composed of practical men selected from all parts of the state, understanding the situation and the vital importance of these appropriations, proceded to pass these bills, and did- so with sufficient votes in both houses so that under the new constitution they put it out of the Governor's reach. Gentlemen, the Governor has formed a habit, it seems, by making a lot of big noise, of pretending to be the farmers' friend, but It is an evident fact that he has made a mighty poor showing to prove it. It is one thing for a governor to make uncalled for and bombastic </seg>
            <seg id="p017">BKFOBT Or XEBBASKA 8TATE BOARD OF AGBICLLTUBE 17 statements slandering those who may differ with him, but entirely another thing to prove these charges. If it were reduction of taxes the Governor had in mind in opposing those appropriations requested for a maintenance fund for state prop - erty on the State Fair grounds, as well as the appropriation for T. B. eradication, he has been, to say the least, inconsistent. He did not forget to slip an item into his budget requesting an appropriation of $10,000 in order to eradicate the pesky dandelions and sunflowers on the lawn of the Governor's mansion. To many of us out over the state that transaction smells to high heaven, and it is difficult to understand the action of the members of the Legislature in supporting this bill. They perhaps felt that $10,000 of the state's money might be a good investment used in that way to help change the entire program two years hence. Gentlemen, perhaps you doubt the wisdom of your President touch - ing upon this matter in such blunt form; perhaps plain barnyard language is a little out of order; but it is the only form I have in presenting the facts, and it is cold facts herein recorded; also I think the people will at least give me credit for presenting them in an understanding way. Forty years I have been a resident of this state, engaged in agriculture, have held many positions of public trust, and believe I am in a fairly good position from past experience to know something about the trials and hardships the man out on the farm has to endure. When a man, even though he happens to be Governor of a great state, gets reckless with the truth I would almost consider it a crime to let it pass unnoticed. If there is anything in public life I detest, it is one who cannot restrain himself when elevated to a position of public trust from using that position to political partisan advantage. To say that those affiliated with an opposing political party also do this is no defense for his action, and this is one of the sins Governor Bryan has committed. It would also seem quite unreasonable to think that all the farm organizations of this state would enter into a combine with the big packers and then proceed to make a raid on the state treasury. Such absolutely false and reckless statements are willful slander upon the thousands of intelligent citizens of this state who are conversant with these problems. They are the people who pay more taxes in the aggre - gate than all the political job-hunters and professional lobbyists Gov - ernor Bryan councilled with. For that bunch to stand around and yell "Down with the taxes," has about run its course; playing this sort of bunk is getting somewhat stale. Gentlemen, I have done my best in order to be brief in presenting to you the foregoing matter, but in bringing the same to a close I want to request your indulgence, and call your attention once more to the fact that the Governor enjoyed the Nebraska State Fair last </seg>
            <seg id="p018">18 BETOBT OF XEMAHKA STATE BOARD OF AGKICIXTI'KE fall, at least he said so. He claims we bad a wonderfully fine fair; he was out there most every day, and his butlers or flunkey* — I do not know what title they carry — were always around to see that the Governor was provided with grandstand courtesies and a proper car sticker— you know a Governor never asks for these little favors him - self. I myself saw Governor Bryan several times State Fair week on different parts of the grounds and he gave one the impression that he was really pleased with the fine fair. I recall one day in particular when we had a little fish dinner on the grounds that I saw him. I understand there were several during the week — but why go into details. I also recall that the Governor gave out some very flattering statements to the press about the Immensity of the fair, leaving the impression with the reader that this was to be expected when you had the right kind of a Governor. I Once again I wish to call your attention to the pass evil, not be - se I have fears of your not being able to eventually handle this ation, but just to jog your memory, and call your attention to the fact that it still remains a big problem unsolved. I know that you will pardon me in saving that the Board of Managers is to be congratulated for its efficiency in bringing the Nebraska State Fair to a point where it stands out today almost in a class by itself in being clean, an exposition of all the things that are educational and unlifting. I fully realize that bringing this to pass means a considerable loss in revenue to the management and must be made up in some other way, and it is being done. In taking this stand you should feel well repaid by ail the favorable comments received from the public and the press at the close of the fair last fall. Having served my allotted time on the Board of Managers, I can look back over the past eight years with much pleasure and satisfac - tion over the wonderful progress that has been made by the manage - ment. The grounds are slowly, as finances permit, being whipped into shape, for which our Secretary is entitled to the lion's share of the credit. With the numerous permanent buildings, the shrubbery, the trees, both shade and ornamental, added to that, paving and curbing, the grounds are becoming a beauty spot where once every year people congregate by the hundreds of thousands to feast their eyes upon the worth-while things there to be seen. You men who have labored without compensation to put the Ne - braska State Fair in the front ranks as an exposition will have the satisfaction of feeling that a grateful people will appreciate your efforts. To the Board of Managers and the Secretary, with his assistants in his office, I want to extend my hearty thanks and good will for the kind consideration shown me at all times. I will always remember and treat re my association with the State Board and the strong, up - standing men who have been associated with me in this work, and wish you Godspeed in your efforts. </seg>
            <seg id="p019">REPOBT Of 1EDIASKA STATE BOARD OT AORIOI'l.TIRE 19 SECRETARY'S REPORT In years past the statement has been made that Nebraska hat no sublime scenery, that we cannot boast of glacier, avalanche, geyser or volcano, ruins, or antiquities. Long regarded as a mysterious Sahara, it has now lost even that gloomy attraction for within the past fifty years, or better, our state has been transformed from the wild plain and desert into the greatest panorama of fields of waving grains, tame and wild grasses, herds and flocks of the best livestock to be found on the continent. It is dotted here and thefe with flourishing cities and villages, and rural sections showing progressive homes substantially built and well cared for. To those of us who have spent the greater part of our lives in this middle-west section of our nation, there is no scenery that is more pleasing to the eye than agricultural Nebraska when she is dressed in her best during the growing season. NVbrawka of today is the culmination of her pioneers, those men and women who loved nothing so well as the logic of facts and figures, to prove that they could better their conditions. They came to this desert and, long ago, have proved through their pioneering and industrial habits that the growth of Nebraska was much greater than they had ever expected or ever thought it would be. Not only was our soil deep and of a productiveness nowhere sur - passed, it was everywhere ready for the plow. To best illustrate this, let me call your attention to the story of the Pacific Islanders who had labored with infinite ado to carve them - selves idols of wood and stone. One of these sculptors, blown off his native shore, drifted before the wind to the Fiji group. Landing there, the stranger was hospitably treated, but when a cocoanut was placed on a mat, which served for a table, he at once fell down and worshipped it. When asked the reason for his devotion, he answered, "I behold a god already made — eyes, nose, everything. In my country it takes a life of labor to make up such a god." Similar must have been the feeling of those who had wasted half their lives heaping up stones in the New England states, or clearing off the forests of Indiana, where stumps outlived the settlers. Therefore when the eyes of our first settlers feasted upon our prairies, they were lost in their admiration of farms ready made to hand. We can say with pride that no Nebraska lands needed the term "unimproved" applied, since the virgin soil contained within its borders was naturally more ready for cropping than the chopping, stone-gather- </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 ing and manuring of which a generation could render the acreage of the eastern part of our nation. Accordingly, those who once shunned our great state as a desert we can now compare to the Yankee skipper, who, when in spite of a fair wind made no progress, said he was trimming and tacking to escape a certain shoal laid down on his chart, but had been, in fact. all the while boxing the compass around an accidental fly speck. What they feared as a lion in their way turned out nothing more formidable than the shadow of their own ears. The west drew new settlers into its capacious bosom, by its fertility, its free homesteads, and its infinite demand for labor, whether skilled or unskilled. It also drove them to take shelter under Its wing by competition. New England once raised her own breadstuffs, but she has long since ceased so to do. The produce of cheaper and cheaper land com - rwith her farmers, until it proved more than a match for their and energy. Many of them then turned to manufactures, but still a larger num - ber were driven west. They made their home of the cheap acres here, and enlisted in the ranks of the agricultural army which had van - quished them, as after election the beaten party, many of them, go over to the majority, and thus secure some of the crumbs that fall from their tables. Hence the west acted on the east with an increasing weight, and that at the end of a longer and longer lever. It is close to ninety years since the first white families settled west of the Mississippi river. Forty years later statistics tell us that not more than one-third of the population of this great middle-west was born within its limits. The other two-thirds had come in; today these figures are about reversed, and we find the larger per cent of our population native-born. The Nebraska of today was made possible by our forefathers who realized that wealth could not be obtained without industry and a life of ease without effort. How many of us today pause for a moment to reflect on what has transpired in this state before them, — what has been accomplished by perseverance and privations; that we are privileged to enjoy the fruits of the pioneers' labors. It will be thus twenty-flve — yes, flfty — years from now. But what are we doing to instill into the minds of our future citizens the debt we owe to those who broke the furrow ahead of us? Many of you men here have played your part in the building of our great state and many more of us have our work lying before us. Kwe, as the men of today, meet the present and future situation, rds the progress of this wonderful state, and give our best s and efforts to its future advancement and welfare? </seg>
            <seg id="p021">21 KEPOBT OF VKW1ASKA STATE BOARD OF f GKK'l I.Tl »t I have mil the confidence in the generation of today that they will meet any exigency that may arise and that our future will show the same safe and sane advancement that it has been our privilege to enjoy since our inception. If Nebraska needs anything at the present time, it is clearer vision and stouter hearts. Did our forefathers turn their backs on their new homes when drouths, floods, and grasshoppers came? Were they dis - couraged with their lot? Not much; they had unlimited faith in the new land they had come to conquer. We have been spoiled with too much prosperity; it is hard for us to forego anything that gives us pleasure, even for a short time. This is more so with the younger generation than with those who have had to deprive themselves in the past. Before we can expect to enjoy the fruits of life to their fullest extent we must first learn to put something into life, for one gets out of anything in proportion to what they put in. I have called your attention in the past to our unbalanced economic conditions, the condition that prevailed and still prevails regarding the prices that our middle-west farmer has been getting for his produce in proportion to what he has to pay for the things he has to purchase. I think that everyone is familiar with conditions as they exist, many have offered remedies and panaceas, but nothing as yet offered has been workable. I repeat my statement of two years ago when I said that general prosperity would come when the purchasing power of the farmers' dollar was put on a par with thedollar of the other fellow. Only time, better financial conditions in the foreign countries, a reconstruc - tion of our business, wages, transportation charges, and a better co - operative marketing system will bring the desired results. The past period of depression in the prices of agricultural produce has caused many men in the state to lose their perspectives; to become discouraged; to even begin to doubt whether this commonwealth would live up to the great promise which she gave in the last decade and a half. Nebraska, like all other states, has her doubting Thomases, in - cluding representatives of all classes and industries — men who seem - ingly know little of the history of their own state, and care less for the facts. While we have had Nebraskans who, in the past two years, have been shaking their heads dubiously and gloomily, downcast and dis - couraged, in the greatest financial center in the world we find one of the greatest institutions reaching out for Nebraska business; pro - claiming to the world the greatness of our state. This financial insti - tution knows Nebraska better, perhaps in a way, than do many of our own citixens. They know us as a state of diversified farming, they know the richness of our soil, and they realize that the rapidly multiplying in- </seg>
            <seg id="p022">22 duatries combine to make Nebraska one of the most attractive invest - ment fields of any state in the Union. There is no disputing the fact that Nebraska is in much better shape today than a year ago. Lei us scan a few figures to substantiate this statement. In 1922 the corn crop of the state produced 182,400,000 bushels ted at $105,792,000; in 1923, 272,052,000 bushels valued at $144. - 000, or an increase of $38,000,000. Wheat showed a loss of $31,393,000, this being due to the extreme dry fall and winter preceding. Oats in 1922 produced 56.106.000 bushels valued at $19,076,000: in 1923 they produced 81,048,000 bushels valued at $27,556,000. an increase of $7,480,000. Potatoes in 1922 produced 11,676,000 bushels valued at $5,488, - 000; in 1923 they produced 8.880,000 bushels valued at $7,104,000. an increase of $1,616,000. wild and tame, produced in 1922, 4,905,000 tons valued at ,868,000, and in 1923 the production was 6,375,000 tons valued $59,468,000. an increase of $9,600,000. Thus you will notice that with the decrease in the loss of the 1923 wheat crop by $31,393,000, the other crops mentioned made enough of an increase to offset the wheat loss and leave a net gain of $25,303,000 for the state at large. I have only made mention of the main crops in an endeavor to bring to your attention that financially, we as an agricultural state, are in a much better condition than we wece a year, or even two years, ago. t Nebraska, in common with other states in this great agricultural t of the United States, has passed through a very unpleasant ex - perience. In addition to the sudden drop in the prices of farm products, we have faced further hardships through a restricted credit due to the rules promulgated by our district federal reserve system. Our ranges have been denuded of livestock, our farms of their grain, when livestock raisers and our agriculturists could not obtain necessary credit to tide themselves over to a more favorable time and price. It is true that Nebraska secured some $12,000,000 as relief through the war finance corporation, and of all of the states who were favored with money from this source, I thing none has made a better record than Nebraska. This loan, from last reports, has now been reduced to less than a million. From these figures it would look as though Nebraska had turned the hill and was over the crest. Let us recognize the strength of our position and set to work with a stronger determination, and an optimis - tic spirit. The future lies before us and contains just what we make of It. </seg>
            <seg id="p023">23 REPORT OF NKBRASK A STATE BOARD Of AGRICULTURE In looking back over the development of our state I am inclined towards the thought that our pioneers had a vision of the future and this vision would read something like this: "The really successful farmer is he who thinks about his soil as he plows it; who looks back beyond the day or year when he first raised a crop of it, and pictures its development and previous treat - ment at the hands of other men; who looks ahead, beyond this year's harvest and next, with the desire and firm intention of making for its permanent betterment." Understood and well treated, the soil becomes the farmer's faithful servant, his friend, his ally, his banker, the cornerstone of his success. Neglected and abused, it rebels and becomes, perhaps his master, but at all events, his enemy, his creditor, the false support through which he plunges down into failure. The lesson clearly is, "To know thy soil as thou knowest thyself." The Nebraska farmers of today should give heed to this lesson for we are now reaching a point where our soil must be given more consideration if we are to keep it at its maximum capacity of produc - tion. They must watch their tillage, for tillage is the means whereby all that can be is taken from the soil and all that can be is put back. Improved farm machinery, including the tractor, can be used to great advantage, as the increased power makes possible deeper plow - ing, necessary for future production. Hand in hand with the campaign for better and more profitable farms is going a broad movement for more attractive, more home-like homes. We must not let the Nebraska farmers become discouraged; we know their lot has been a hard one, but let us bear in mind that had America never done anything else, it could justly claim its place among the foremost agricultural nations of the world, as the source of maize, — what we know as corn. Wheat was raised when the world was young; today it is man's greatest bread grain. Upon it has always hung the fortunes of war and the fate of nations. Do not be unmindful of the fact that corn and wheat are our two largest crops. We of Nebraska can produce these products as cheaply as any of our competitors. We have a home market for the larger per cent of our production. As long as this condition exists there is no need for fear of the future. In the past we might say that one of the things that has handi - capped the permanence of agriculture has been the disposition of the farmers to change their operations to meet temporary conditions. History tells us that when prices for certain farm products were high there was a large movement upon the part of our farmers to get into that branch of farming. We well realize that such a result has </seg>
            <seg id="p024">24 BEFORT OF SIBIASKA STATE BOARD Or AGEICULTl BK produced an over-supply of that certain commodity, depressed prices for same, and disappointment to the producer. Many illustrations could be used to verify this statement. For in - stance, I do not think that we have forgotten the very recent exper - ience of our farmers with their enlarged wheat acreage. The past year's experience with the livestock market, more espe - cially the hog market, has been another lesson along this line. I rather anticipate that many of our farmers will become discouraged in their endeavor and effort to maintain their livestock herds and flocks, and figure that a better income can be derived from some other source. There will probably be a tendency to give scant attention to the livestock they have on hand, figuring that such commodities are not worth much at the present time and perhaps will not Be for quite a period. (Most of us know from experience that the hog is a mortgage lifter. it let's not put it up to the old sow to do it all; give her a chance, id one year with another, she will pull us out of the hole, but we nnot expect her to do it over night. The livestock now on Nebraska farms should be given the best of care; this is the more important because of the present low market prices. The purebred breeders should look to the consuming market for the disposition of all except the very best of breeding stock. Under present-day conditions it is impossible to make our farms pay if we undertake to put our eggs all in one basket, and be dependent upon the profits from a limited range of operations. We are extremely fortunate in Nebraska from the fact that our soil and climate enable us to follow a plan of diversified farming; as yet we have not made the best of our conditions. Sooner or later we must come to this realization and proceed to correct our errors of the past. tWe are living in a wonderful age; we are living in a wonderful e; the world has been progressing since its inception and we have ry right to feel that greater progress will be made in the future. LLet us not forget the fact that since Nebraska's farmers began to her fertile soil properly, there have been no total crop failures, and only a few short crops. The labor of our farmers has created wealth beyond the dreams of our early pioneers. Their experience proves that they have been able to take care of themselves, and that industry, plus good soil, will triumph over disaster. Their successful development of our agricultural wealth has made possible other Indus* i Mai activities; it has been the true and only basis of the growth of the ttate. </seg>
            <seg id="p025">RKPOBT Or NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 25 The spirit of Nebraska farmers has been faith, and work, and self - reliance. Faith without work is a dead thing. The most fertile soils, the greatest of nature's bounties, are useless unless developed by intelligent effort. The solution of most of the world's troubles can be found only in self-reliance and hard work. Prosperity by legisla - tion will no more succeed today than it did a half-century ago. The year 1923 was a memorable one from the standpoint of the State Board of Agriculture. On September 27th, at Nebraska City, ten thousand people wit - neaaed the formal transfer of Arbor Lodge and Morton Park, the old homestead of J. Sterling Morton, to the state of Nebraska. It might be said that in the transfer of this historic place Ne - braska has embarked upon three big educational values; first, to give a popular demonstration of plant and animal life; second, to give historical associations: and third, to aid civic progress by giving the younger generation ideals and heroes. It was J. Sterling Morton, a past president of this organisation, who on January 4th, 1872, introduced a resolution at the annual meet - ing of this organization, designating April 10th of that year as a day to be known as "Arbor Day." In this resolution he urged upon the people of the state the importance of tree planting. This resolution went farther than merely the formality of its pre - sentation. Mr. Morton included a provision whereby the State Board of Agriculture was to offer a special premium of $100 to the county agricultural society in Nebraska which planted the most trees on that day, and another prize of $25 worth of farm books to the person in Nebraska who planted the greatest number of trees. It is said that a million trees were planted in the state on that first Arbor Day, and certainly since that time, billions of trees have been planted in Nebraska and the many other states which have through legislative action set aside one day in the year for tree planting. The first Arbor Day proclamation was issued in April, 1874, by Governor Robert W. Furnas, who later became president and secretary of the State Board of Agriculture and served this organization for many years. In 1885 an act was passed by the legislature designating April 22nd, Mr. Morton's birthday, as the day for Arbor Day, which is now one of the legal holidays in Nebraska. Arbor Day is now annually observed in more than forty states and territories. Arbor Lodge is known throughout the state, in fact the whole nation, for its historical associations as well as its natural beauty This state, still being comparatively young, has preserved very few places or objects through which to foster more of the state pride as well as public spirit. </seg>
            <seg id="p026">26 The gift of Arbor Lodge to the state was not only a generous act on the part of the Morton heirs, but is unusually appropriate. It has been known as a model farm for more than a half-century, for its owner was a good farmer in addition to possessing those qualities which made him a national as well as a state figure. For years the place has been a sort of a shrine for all nature-loving Nebraskans, and as such it was already a semi-public place of interest for everyone who could visit it. But above all it was the home of the founder of Arbor Day, the home of a Nebraska pioneer, the home ia past president of this organization. J. Sterling Morton certainly e a life of service to his adopted state. It was very fitting that four of the present members of this board were permitted to serve in the session of our legislature which passed the bill accepting this traditional home. 1 refer to Senators Banning. Purcell and Reed, and Representative Parkinson. This organization still has a connection with Arbor Lodge in having a present member of this board, Mr. A. J. Weaver, a member of the State Park Board, the board that now has charge of the handling ot Arbor Lodge and Morton Park for the state. t After sixty-five years' continuous service the State Board of Agri - ure can now feel that this organization has been of real value to state if the acquiring of this property was all we had to show for existence. t Arbor Lodge stands today as a perpetual memorial to J. Sterling 'ton, the pioneer whose gift to humanity has transformed countless ren wastes to places of beauty where people live and prosper. It is ng at this time to repeat Mr. Morton's own words: "Oaks thrive in the tempests that would rend them and draw nutriment from the howling storms. L"Men of right fibre are like oaks and develop best in antagonisms; by constant attrition with adverse criticism and harsh opposition establish, at last, good name and high character." We measure the success or failure of our efforts by public opinion. The public spoke and declared through the press that the fifty-fifth Nebraska State Fair of 1923 was enjoyed more than any of the fifty - four held previously. As an explanation of this statement they declare that it was larger, more complete, better balanced, and a cleaner fair by far than has ever been held in the state. We heartily agree with this statement and wish to assure the public at this time that the 1924 State Fair will surpass those that have gone before. The assembling of a well-balanced fair is a problem of no small proportion. A fair such as Nebraskans were privileged to witness last </seg>

The foundation for the present day fair was laid more than a century ago. Guided by those who have the interest and progress of the fair at heart, your state fair will naturally grow with the progress of the state. Properly assembled, properly presented, your state fair can do more to advertise your state and assist in its development than any other institution. It is the show window of your state; It is the yardstick by which we can measure the mighty march of man. It records the upward climb of human kind. It portrays the progress of brute and breed, from scrub to purebred and pedigree. When fairs first became the rule the bull and boar were wild and the stud untamed and untrained and roamed at will. Hair instead of wool grew on the back of sheep and goat. Breed and bloodlines were not considered then. The day had not come to have aristocrats among the brutes. The fair is an engine room and power house. It improves the race of men and the breed of brutes. Long ago it won its official standing, — the tax dollar now uniting with the gate receipts and other income to erect great buildings that give a flavor of permanency to these in - stitutions. The Fair is a clearing house for all creeds, colors and breeds. It la the most democratic game in the world. It has a mighty influence, it can take hold of the four corners of a county or state, and lift it up to a higher plane of life and living. When we improve the breed and the seed we sow we are sure to improve the race of men and women who are the scaffolding by which a nation is builded great and strong. When fairs decay men may do the same. Therefore fairs have a mission and a vision. They have a great responsibility, as great in a way as have our schools. Then is it not time that those of us who are responsible for the fairs of this great state awaken more to our responsibility? Before any man or set of men can successfully manage a fair they should have a thorough understanding regarding the origin of fairs, and the growth and influence of fairs upon Christian civilization. Unless they know this story they cannot have the heart, the punch and pep to keep their fair growing. It is essential that they lead the way for their fair and not lean upon it; they must be able to lift it out of the old rut and place it in a new channel. Fairs are like a ship upon the sea; it is necessary to have a good pilot to guide them on their way that »hey may reach the harbor or go»l victoriously. </seg>
            <seg id="p028">28 BKTOBT OF XEBBA8KA STATE BOARD Or AfiBlrl I.T1 RK Eilrs never mark time. They either go forward or backward. We have no hesitancy in proclaiming that, not only your state fair, our county fairs of Nebraska, have been moving forward, and at f rapid pace. This has been brought about by those charged with the respon - sibility of the management of these institutions gaining a bigger and broader vision of what these institutions were created for, their duty toward their community, and the educational value they may be toward mankind. The fair is no more a game of skill or chance, it is graduating from that level to one of real education and wholesome recreation. The fair that survives is the one that places before its patrons an institution well-balanced, with plenty of the educational and an abund - ance of clean, interesting and amusing entertainment. For the first time in its history, to our knowledge, in 1923 your State Fair was void of a game of any nature on its grounds. It has repeatedly been said that no fair could survive without the games of skill or chance. That might have been so in the past, but the fair of today is taking on a much different place in our activities and now that public opinion has decreed that these games must go, foolish is the man — or set of men — who will permit themselves to stay In the rut. Keep astride the band wagon, and so much better if you can get a front seat. The good showman knows how to please the fad and fancy of human beings. The fair man must be as wise. From every angle your 1923 State Fair was the best in our his - tory. - I can truthfully say this for many reasons. Since becoming your secretary, I have had but one aim in view, and that has been to impart to the citizens of our state the educational value of their state and county fairs: to build up these institutions so that they can serve the purpose for which they were created; to familiarize the public with the work these institutions were doing and rt they are capable of accomplishing if given the proper support i the public. Too many people have looked upon these institutions as gala weeks: they have taken an attitude toward them as a carnival proposi - tion. While we cannot afford to eliminate the recreational side of our fairs. I feel that more of the educational side should be featured. Again let me say that they have a similarity to our schools. When a child starts to school that child is given a recess period during both the morning and afternoon sessions. This system is continued through the grades to a certain extent. When the high school and advanced colleges are reached other methods of recreation are ottered and afforded as, for instance, athletics in all its branches. </seg>
            <seg id="p029">29 KZPOBT Or ■fCMASKA STATE BOABD OF AGEICII.TIBK School authorities long ago have come to the definite conclusion that in order to hold the average school pupil through high school and college, they must offer other incentives beside the one idea or obtaining a proper education from books and charts. Statistics show that since this situation has been thoroughly analyzed, a much greater per cent of the pupils who now enter our high schools finish their four years than formerly. This gives us a concrete example that there must be some recreation with our work and in the plans for your coming fair a recreational and entertaining program must be assembled in keeping with the edu - cational side of your fair if you are to maintain the proper interest and Incentive of the general public. Fairs are a peculiar institution. They occupy a peculiar place in the activities of our state and nation. It is hard for the average citi - zen to see in these institutions what we, as workers in the cause, can see. By the proper methods of publicity and untiring efforts upon the part of those who believe in these institutions and the work they are doing, we hope that the time is not far distant when fairs and exposi - tions will be looked upon with much more universal favor than they have been in the past or even at the present time. As has been stated repeatedly, fairs are not money-making insti - tutions, they are not money dividend paying propositions. They are strictly educational in their scope, provided they are functioning as they should. For twenty-three successive years your state fair has been held on its present site. During this period of time the legislature of Nebraska has appropriated $640,000 for the purchase of the grounds, erection of buildings and minor improvements. During this same period of time this organization has staged the twenty-three fairs, paid out for premiums during this time the sum of $662,000. and have put back into the grounds In the way of permanent improvements and upkeep a total sum of $715,000. You will note that from our receipts during this twenty-three year period we have paid out $12,000 more for premiums than the total state appropriation for grounds and buildings. We have been able to keep pace with the state, and while they have been appropriating this $640,000, we have been able Jo match these appropriations and return to the people of the state an equal amount or more in the way of premiums than it has cost the state to build up the greatest advertising medium that Nebraska possesses. Your State Fair has not been a begging institution, or one that can be classed in the charitable line. </seg>
            <seg id="p030">30 acrorr or Nebraska state board or agrh-ii.ti rf. Every surplus cent that is left from the receipts of the fair has been placed back into the improvement of the institution. Seven years ago there was not a sewer line on the grounds larger than a six-inch pipe. Today the sewer system on the grounds is adequate to take care of all the storm water and ail the sanitary sewerage that will come from future buildings that will be placed on the grounds to keep pace with the natural growth of the institution. I The, water system, electric light system, the streets and grounds general have been remodeled and placed in position to take care of the large crowds that now reach on a single day the population of the second city of our state. People are demanding more in the present day than they used to. and if your institution is to continue to have the confidence and support of our citisens and to be favored with their patronage, we must keep abreast of the times with our facilities for properly en - tertaining them. The people like to see improvement, and I feel that many Ne - braska citizens come to the fair from one year to another to see the improvements that we have made. They take pride with us in watch - ing this institution grow. LAt the last session of the legislature we were fortunate enough tn vince the members by facts and figures that it was impossible for us to maintain these grounds and buildings as they should be main - tained without seriously handicapping the show part of the fair. The money that we were compelled to put into maintenance right - fully belonged to the show, such as premiums and the securing of added educational exhibits. In other words if we had to continually keep on taking the surplus receipts from our fairs and putting it into the grounds, we would be able to build up the grounds, but could not keep up the standard of the educational and exhibit end of the fair. The members of the last session got this viewpoint and appro - priated $50,000 for the biennium for storm sewers and maintenance. There was a sum of $43,606.44 used this past year from this appropriation. Close to $10,000 was used in the laying of new sewers made necessary by the erection of a sanitary disposal plant for the city of Lincoln and we had to rearrange our sewer system to meet the requirements of the new system. W ane not coming to you with a balance in our treasury, but we are coming to you with a profit from the last state fair of $19,735.43 which was placed in the plant as permanent improvement. As most of you are aware, this money was spent in the removing of one of the oldest landmarks on the grounds, the old agricultural </seg>

In its place were erected six concession buildings, two dining halls and an arch that leads into the playground of your fair, and twenty-seven uniform concession buildings that supplanted the eye-sores that have lined our streets in the past. These buildings were erected with the thought in mind of perma - nence, sanitation, and beautifying the grounds. The erection of this type of building was something new on the present-day fair ground already has the office been besieged with requests from far and near for pictures, and plans of these buildings. There was added to the administration building an annex. This was a much needed improvement; by the growth of our fair we have had to place many of the heads of departments and their forces in out-of-the-way corners and buildings scattered over the grounds. This Rystem was not conducive to the proper administration. While we still lack the proper room, even with this addition, for expediting our business as we should, it helped greatly in relieving the old system and gave much better satisfaction to our employes, ex - hibitors and concession people. I could go on for a long time enumerating what has been accom - plished in the way of building up the grounds, making them attractive, presentable and comfortable for our patrons, but think that results speak for themselves. I will agree with you that it would be nice if we were in a poaition where we could have a snug balance in our treasury at the end of every year, and also have something laid aside for a rainy day, but until the people of the state, through their legislature, wake up to our pressing needs and come to our rescue financially, it will be im - possible for us to maintain the present standard of the fair, unless we take our surplus money and put it back into improvements on the grounds that are demanded from one year to another on account of the steady growth of many of our activities. I speak more especially now in reference to the boys' and girls' club work. If this work advances in the next two or three years as it has the past two or three, we are going to be confronted with the problem of finding suitable quarters to house these activities. If we do not meet this situation, then we are a handicap to them instead of an incentive. Your present grandstand has stood for ten years, and how much longer it will serve its purpose is a matter for conjecture. We must give these things proper thought and consideration. Your fair cannot stand still; it must go forward or It goes back - ward. It will advance in proportion to the amount of energy, support, and the battle that we all wage in its behalf. </seg>

Through your leadership and high ideals you can raise the standard of your fair and while doing this you will be, perhaps unconsciously, raising the standard of life and living in your community. The fairs and expositions are community and state builders, there is no disputing this fact, and it therefore behooves those engaged in these institutions to study their communities or state that they may be in a position to lead the way to a greater county, state and nation. Nebraska can boast of a large number of successful county fairs, which have men at the head of them that are striving to make better communities. To such men I want to express appreciation for their efforts and labor. I know from experience that their task along this line is not one of roses, but you will have the personal satisfaction of knowing that you have given of your time and effort to an extremely worthy cause. </seg>

Wake presented the report of the Revision Committee. Lincoln, Nebr., Jan. 15, 1924 To the Honorable President and the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture. Gentlemen : We, your committee appointed on the revision of the 1924 premium list, beg leave to submit the following report: All dates of the 1923 premium list to be changed to conform to the year 1924, in this year's premium list. </seg>
            <seg id="p041">UNIT Of NBBASKA STATE BOARD OF AGBICULTUBE 41 Page 31: "PAYMENT OF PREMIUMS." Eliminate: "Where the quality of the exhibit does not, in their opinion, deserve the full premium." For Class "B," Beef Cattle, adopt suggested classification for Beef Cattle as adopted by the International and American Association of Fairs and Expositions. Class "C," eliminate Lot 6. Class "E," require exhibitors to have birds banded when brought to the Fair. Class "F," adopt changes to conform with suggestions as presented in conference between P. H. Stewart, Secretary of the State Crop Grow - ers' Association, and exhibitors in Class "F." We recommend that any further changes or additions to the prem - iums be left to the decision of the Board of Managers. Respectfully submitted, T. H. WAKE, W. B. BANNING, h. j. Mclaughlin, A. W. LAMB. T. B. KEEDLE. President — I think perhaps I rather encouraged the Committee to take the action they did in this suggestion in regard to Lot 6, Class C. 1 And in the north and in Canada, the people are more inclined to reduce the number of breeds than to encourage them to Increase the number. In Canada in a number of the provinces, they have adopted certain breeds of livestock in that province and they give no other breeds any classification in their big fair. They have selected plenty of breeds and they believe that by miscellaneous bunch of breeding, this selection, it has a tendency to breed up the quality of the livestock, and I believe their theory is on a sound basis. There is such a thing as overdoing the thing. This organization has in mind also that our premium list is large as it is and we have a world of dead matter in it, which it is very difficult to eliminate, but it seems to me that with all the swine breeds we have in Nebraska today, when there is no classification for this breed of swine they are not so apt to take them up and it would not do them any good if they did, and I believe it is right in eliminating that class. Mr. Lamb — One man came to the Superintendent of the swine barn this year and he had a very uncommon herd, and he was out for the premium money alone; said the premium money he could pick up with Tamworths at the county fairs would make him more money than to raise the other breeds. There is the Yorkshire and the Tarn - worth that were eliminated because there was not competition enough and we don't want to pay out the money when there is no competition. </seg>
            <seg id="p042">42 BEPOBT OV -TEBKASKA STATS BOARD OF AGRICULTVBE If applications enough come in for some breed like that the Board, I think, would have power to let them in. Wake— In connection with the report on Clan "F," Farm ducts, I will say that these men have gone over the entire grain and corn lists and have re-classified the entire premium list. It simply changes some premiums. It has raised premiums on the corn, a certain quality of corn that is raised in the state of Nebraska, and eliminates or reduces the premiums on some of the minor grains that are not essential and of which very little is shown. It means about the same money in the total. The Crop Growers' Association were instrumental in getting up this new schedule, and were unanimous in recommending the change. Mr. Wake moved the adoption of the report of the Committee on Revision of Premium List as read, and the motion was seconded and carried. REPORT OF COMMITTEE OX RESOLUTIONS Read by Mr. Jackson WHEREAS: Since the last annual meeting of this body, death has claimed one of our members, Doctor P 1». Hall, and WHEREAS: Because Doctor Hall was a pioneer in the settlement and a builder in the development of our state, serving with distinction as Secretary of the State Banking Board, as Regent of our State University, and as a member of this Body, and because of his ability, business record, fine character and public spirit, was a real factor in the progress of Nebraska, and WHEREAS: Because of our appreciation of these qualities and services as a public official and citizen, and also because of hfs fidelity to the agricultural welfare of the state as evidenced by his loyal sup - port of the purposes of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture, and by his service as a member of this Board and as one of its Board of Managers, he was universally recognized as an exemplary and useful citizen, therefore BE IT RESOLVED: That the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture at this annual meeting, January fifteenth, recognize the great loss which through his death has come to his family and to the agricultural, educational and financial interests of Nebraska with which he was so long and actively associated and in all of which his wise counsel will be greatly missed BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED: That this body extend to the fam - ily of the deceased our deepest sympathy, and that as an evidence of </seg>

GEORGE JACKSON, c. McCarthy, PERRY REED. The Memorial section of this report was read with the entire body standing. Mr. Jackson moved the adoption of the report and the motion being seconded, the same was carried unanimously. Mr. McCarthy — There is a little matter I think might be discussed by this body if you have time, and otherwise it can be taken up by the Board of Managers. It has been suggested to the members of the Board that certain days be given for Judging certain breeds of livestock, and I believe by getting an expression from you men we will have an expression from the breeders of the state of Nebraska. In the first place they have been postponing the judging of fat cattle until Thursday, and I believe -that is a mistake; they should be judged on Monday, and baby beef on Monday and they should be judged in the coliseum, if possible. I want to suggest to the Board that we designate Monday as beef cattle day at the fair; Tuesday for Here - fords; Wednesday, Shorthorns; Thursday, Polled, Angus, and Gallo - ways. With those breeds of course we will judge the dairy cattle. Hundreds of men come to the Superintendent every year and ask: "What day will you judge Shorthorns, or Herefords," and they like to be on the ground when their cattle are to be judged, and even the judges do not know when their services are to be required, and it seems to me we would accomplish a great thing for these men if we should designate certain days for the various breeds. Mr. McLaughlin — They say honest confession is good for the soul, and I have a confession to make. I overlooked something which I consider very important in our County Fair meeting, and that is the question of the County Fair organizations of the state holding their fairs during State Fair week. I wanted this question thoroughly threshed out in the County Fair meeting, but I didn't bring it up, and I would just like now to put it in the shape of a plea as President of the County Fair Association, that we try to avoid that. There are several counties in the state that hold their fairs during State Fair week. Our county fairs as a whole are dependent on the State Fair, and the State Fair is dependent on the county fairs of the state, and we must work in harmony with one another. I think it is very im - portant that State Fair week should be kept absolutely open for the State Fair. I don't know of anything we can do at this time, but I wanted to just bring up the subject in order that we may think about it. O. G. Smith — I think the suggestion is good. A bill is to be brought before the legislature and I hope that provision will be put in the County Aid Law. Dakota has it today. No county fair in </seg>
            <seg id="p044">44 South Dakota can be held during the State Fair week, and I think it is a mighty good thing and that it should be done in this state. EMr. Purcell — That provision could not be made to give us relief this year, and I believe I will offer a motion that it is the sense this meeting that the county fairs be requested not to hold their •s during State Fair week. Mr. Purcell's motion was seconded and unanimously carried A. H. Miller — Having been connected with the horses, I can see great merit in Mr. McCarthy's statement and suggestion to have special days for special things. They do run after the Superintendent to know when these things are to be done and if we had a regular program it would create a good deal more interest and I believe would be advisable. Many people come to see certain breeds judged and when they find it is not the day for judging that particular breed, they wander off and perhaps do not get back another time. Mr. Mitchell — I believe the Board of Managers can handle that to that it will be perfectly satisfactory- President Graff — I don't believe the Board is entitled to a hundred per cent failure, because that is not worked out as well as it should be and could be. I think it is a matter that should be taken up early in the season with the Superintendents and the Board of Managers. I think it is the right thing. The people wish to be here on a certain day and can't be here for several days, and they want to be here at certain times or when certain things are to be done, but I think that can be worked out with the Superintendent of the cattle and horse division and they can take it up with the Board of Managers. The Superintendents will be appointed early in the season, and I venture that matter will be looked after and made a little more satisfactory Mr. McCarthy — This is not a criticism on the management. We have taken for granted that we have some real big men at the head of our fair who are always open to suggestions. If this is the wrong time it is due to my blundering, but I took it that any time was a good time for a good suggestion. On motion the Board then adjourned until 9:00 o'clock on Wed - nesday morning, January 16, 1924. On Wednesday morning, January 16, 1924, President Graff called the Board of Agriculture to order and the final report of the Creden - tials Committee was received. On motion the entire report of the Credentials Committee was adopted and the Committee discharged. The Secretary called the roll of members, showing a quorum pres - ent. Mr. Lowe of Scribner, a delegate, and A. J. Weaver of Falls City, a member of the Board, having been called home unexpectedly, the Secretary moved that they be excused from attendance at this session, which motion was seconded and unanimously carried. </seg>

"I represent the Western Horseman, which most of you men know, a journal that has been in the field in the interests of the harness horse for 45 years, and inasmuch as the harness horse and the county fair are linked up together, the harness game cannot exist without the county fair. Our paper some years ago put in a Fair Department and that is what I jrxtUed especially to speak to you about and tell you that we are always glad to have you take up any question of Fair management through our columns. Owing to the fact that these horsemen use our paper, it gets into the hands of the Secretaries all over the country. I am glad to have been able to be present at your meeting of the State Association of Fair Managers and also at this meeting of your Board. We make these meetings all over the country and give reports on them in the paper and I trust you men will find something of interest in what the other states are doing, and I am sure they find an interest in what you are doing, and that is what we are doing through our paper for our Fair people.

ELECTION OF OFFICERS KMr. Roberts — When this fair was moved from Omaha to Lincoln aa interested in horses and have been for years, and I became a member some 18 years ago of this Association, and I have seen it grow from infancy to one of the best, if not the best, State Fairs in the United States; when I look over the men at the present time at the head of this organization and see the line-up of our membership and the careful selection of new members that come into this Association, I feel that its success is assured . Some ten years ago, when I had the honor of being President of this Association I appointed as Chair - man of the Board of Managers a man whom I thought was well-fitted for the place and it proved that I made a good selection from the fact that ever since the Presidents have retained him in that position. The State Fair has some outstanding men, as every other organization has. We have one in particular whom I have in mind at the present time: he has been interested not only in the State Fairs but in the County Fairs of the state and has used his beat energy and influence for the good of both of these associations. We have had during the last ten years great problems to solve on the fair grounds; we have had entertainments and concessions and questions for big men to solve, and this man has moved around the fair grounds quietly, without any pomp, and he has won the admiration of every man who has been connected with this Fair, and I believe every exhibitor, and I am almost sure that he has neglected some of his personal interests in the interests of this Association and I want to say to him, "Well done, good and faithful servant, you are entitled to a higher office," and to the highest office that this Association can give, and it gives me great pleasure at this time to nominate George Jackson for President of this Association. Mr. McArdle — We old fellows who served through many yean with George Jackson want to add whatever we can to our apprecia - tion of the close Intimacy and friendship that has grown up among us. We have learned to know the man probably better than the younger members of the Board; having served the longest term of years of any man in this organization I felt I would like to place him in nomina- </seg>
            <seg id="p047">BCTCBT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOABD OF AOBICtTlTDIK 47 •ion, I felt I would like to have that honor, but I found a man who waa a little older than I, and the man who discovered, in a way, Mr. Jackson, and placed him in a position of trust, and it goes without saying that so far as your knowledge and mine are concerned he has made good. There is no necessity of eulogizing George Jackson. His work, which is known to you, shows that he has made good and he does not need a eulogy. I know this is a serious time for me, because the personal elements entered so strongly, but about two or three o'clock this morning there was a man outside the room over there on the street and he woke me up with his noise, and I didn't know where I was, and I thought maybe I was in the Millard Hotel at Thirteenth and Douglas streets at Omaha, and he admitted in a loud voice that he was drunk and he didn't care who knew it, and I thought, you better get away before you wake up George Jackson because if you don't he will come down there and sell you all the banquet tickets we have. But seriously, I feel that there is no man in the state of Nebraska so big that this position would not do him honor, but in this instance we have the knowledge that the man who is elected and fills that posi - tion, if it be George Jackson, will bring honor to the position, and the last words that can be said about him is that he is a man's man. Mr. Mitchell moved that the nominations be closed and the Secre - tary be instructed to cast a unanimous ballot of this organization for George Jackson as its President for the coming year. The motion was seconded and carried unanimously, the ballot was cast and amid enthusiasm Mr. Jackson was declared elected. Secretary Danielson — In casting this ballot I would like to make a little explanation. I know something of this man personally over a long period of years. I am very familiar with his home life down in his little home town. I remember once upon a time this gentleman whom you are honoring with the presidency was a candidate for governor of the State of Nebraska, and he was walking down the street there in the little town of Nelson, which, like most little towns, has its "Abe Martin" and as this man walked down the street a bunch of men was walking down the other side and among them was Abe, and Abe said, "See that man walking down on the other side of the street?" And they said yes, and he said, "Have any of you fellows ever read that book, 'A Man Without a Country'?" And some of them said yes and some said no, and they said, "Why?" He said, "Well, there goes that man Jackson, and he is a governor without a state." Now gentlemen, I wish to assure this State Board of Agriculture that we are going to have a President and I wish to assure George Jackson as President that he is going to have a State Board of Agri - culture. Calls for Mr. Jackson came from all parts of the room, and he responded as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p048">48 UTOBT Or NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OT AGRICULTURE Mr. Jackson — Mr. President and Members of the State Fair Board iMr. Secretary, I wish you would bring a looking glass in here let me see whether I am the man they are talking about. (A large looking glass is produced by the Secretary)- Well, it looks like e but it surely is not so. I can't find words this morning to express my appreciation for what you have done for me. It is an honor to me to be President of an Association of this kind. It is an honor for any man to belong to an Association and become its head executive, an organization of men who are working and have one purpose in view and that is the build - ing up of agriculture. It is an honor to any man to belong to an association that has the dollar down below and the citizenship above, and that is what this Association is doing. It is true as the Secretary said, that at one time I thought I would like to be governor of the state, but since I looked over the President's address I have concluded that it is not the best thing for me. But gentlemen, this is a fast age we are living in; this is an age of graft, every kind of graft, greed, fault-finding, everything that brings out the very worst that is in us, and it is time our environment was changed. We are thrown Into an environment everywhere that brings out the worst in us and it is time we were encouraging the people to look for the bright spots instead of the dark .spots, and when I think of this Association of public-spirited men who are reach - ing out all over the state, stepping in between the schools and the homes and making home-builders and community leaders of our boys. tonder sometimes if the rank and file of the people realize what Association is doing. It is building up citizenship for tomorrow. Someone has said if you want to do something for men and women you must start when they are boys and girls, and that is what this Association is doing. You may think it is only a few camps and clubs out here, but the inspiration of the State Board of Agriculture during the State Fair and the County Fairs and the Farm Bureaus and the Extension De - partment are all standtag on the one hand and radiating out all over the state of Nebraska and into every county where the girls are taught so that many of them can prepare perhaps a better dinner even than their mothers and it adds much to the homes in this country. You can pick up any daily paper and you will see an account of the bank robberies and train robberies and petty thefts and butchery, and the statistics show today that 85*^- of the crime is committed by boys of school age; they say It Is the aftermath of the war; possibly that is true to a certain extent, but the homes of America are to blame more than the war and it is time an organization of this kind is putting on a campaign for better homes for our people.

A Swede came to our town from the north part of the state the other day and he said he was up to the Ak-Sar-Ben a few days ago. He met some fellows there from all over the state, three of them, and the four went into a cafeteria to get a chicken dinner, and the fellow said, "Where are you from?" He told him, and he said, "I have a chicken but you are from the north part of the state," the fellow said he was from Bancroft, and he said, "You will bave to pick the neck;" and then he turned to the fellow from the west and asked where he was from, and then he said, "You will have to take the left wing." and to the man from Omaha he said, "You are from the east part of the state and you get the right wing," and then he said to this Swede, "Where are you from?" He said, "I am from the south part of the state, from Nelson, but I don't care for any chicken." Mr. McLaughlin — It gives me great pleasure at this time to place in nomination for First Vice President of this Association a man who needs no introduction to you people, Mr. E. R. Purcell of Broken Bow. I have lived the greater part of my life on a Nebraska farm. For thirty-one years I have lived on the same farm, and I will live there as long as the sheriff and the good Lord let me live, and in these years I have been very closely identified with agriculture and livestock in the state and it has been my lot for some years to be pushed to the front in helping to look after the livestock interests of the state and it has been a privilege and a pleasure when I have been drawn on for help and advice and aid by the members of the State Board of Agriculture; and through my work in the livestock interests in the state I have been brought into the State Board of Agriculture as a member and through talking with these men I have learned that they are real men and give their services to the state and the unbuilding of the state through this Board of Agriculture in the putting on of the great show each year, men whose interests are identical with those who have interests on the farm, and I know of no man who has given these interests more support and more aid than Mr. Purcell has, and it is a great pleasure to me, knowing Mr. Purcell as I do, and knowing that he is in the same mind and that he recognizes the fundamental principles of agriculture and that it is the basic interest of this state and that livestock is the life and salvation of agriculture, I believe In him thoroughly; and he is always ready and willing to work for the interests of we people on the farms and I do not know of anyone that it would afford me more pleasure to put in nomination for tine office than Mr. Purcell. </seg>
            <seg id="p050">50 BKPOBT Or NIBRASKA STATE BO A ED OF AOEICtXTCBE There being no other nominations, Mr. McArdle moved that the nominations be closed, the rules be suspended and the Secretary be Instructed to cast a unanimous vote of this organisation for Mr. Purcell. The motion was seconded, carried, the ballot was cast by the Secre - tary, and Mr. Purcell was declared elected as first Vice President of the Association for the coming year. Secretary — In casting this ballot I would like to reiterate a little bit of this gentleman's past history. He has been a member of the legislature twice, and the first time he was elected, as I recall, he came down to Lincoln at the time of the convening of the legislature and went up to the capitol to report, and he got down in the basement and got to wandering around down there and he couldn't find just what he was looking for, and he said to the janitor, "Where is the House of Representatives?" The janitor said, "That is up on the second floor." And Mr. Purcell said, "No, it can't be, because I was elected to the Lower House." Called upon for a response, Mr. Purcell said LMr. President and Gentlemen of the State Board: I want to say t I appreciate this honor more than I can tell you. I appreciate the fact in the first place that I am a member of such a splendid body, such an able and representative body as the State Board of Agri - culture; I feel that in serving as your Vice President I am particularly fortunate in the fact that you have elected so able a President to guide the State Board and to guide the activities of the Board of Managers. I feel that I can follow under the leadership of Mr. Jackson in every way, perhaps with one exception, and I do want to make one exception, and I think I ought to tell you at this time that there is one thing in which perhaps I cannot follow him, and that is I do not believe I can endorse all of his poetry, but outside of that I think we will get along wonderfully well. I want to say that I feel that the State Board of Agriculture is doing a mighty constructive work in Nebraska and I know that its State Fair stands near the top among the State Fairs of the United States. This has been due to such men as Mr. Jackson, and Mr. Graff, who is just retiring, and we are certainly fortunate in being able to accomplish so much, and I am speaking of this as a Board of Agri - culture, that we are fortunate in being able to make the State Fair what it has been, and it seems to me I can see bigger and better things ahead, and I believe it will continue to be one of the outstanding fairs of this country. I think Mr. Jackson during the next year is the man who will be called upon to do all these things. I think he will endeavor to put his best efforts into the work of the organization, and I am very sure that under his leadership we will meet with success. Mr. McArdle — I think I have a certain privilege and I am going to take advantage of it today and get up on the floor twice. I want </seg>
            <seg id="p051">REFOBT Or NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 51 to place in nomination for this office a man who is also connected with the famous cranberry episode of which most of us know. Mr. Jackson and Mr. Purcell were there and there is another man who has also been in the legislature, and so we cannot hold that against him. He has been connected with the fair in Seward county and has held many positions, and while a member of the State Board he has shown his ability as a Fair man, and it is my privilege and pleasure, as it was at one time when there was a vacancy on the Board of Directors, to select that man, and you know that I selected well and that he has proven to be a big, broad-gauged man, who is thoroughly imbued with the true and right spirit of Fair work. I refer to T. H. Wake, of Seward, whom I nominate for Second Vice President of this Association. Mr. A. T. Miller moved that the rules be suspended, nominations be closed, and the unanimous ballot of this organization be cast for Mr. Wake. The motion was seconded, unanimously carried, the ballot cast and Mr. Wake was declared as elected as Second Vice President for the ensuing year. Secretary — I think this is Mr. Wake's first election to an office at the hands of the public and therefore we will have to wait until next year before we can dig up anything regarding any political office on the gentleman you have just elected. Mr. Wake — Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Board: I am not going to make any speech, but simply am going to thank you for the honor you have conferred upon me and will do my best to merit that honor. I thank you. Mr. Sass — I wish to nominate for Treasurer of the State Board of Agriculture, Mr. W. B. Banning. Two years ago we elected him as Treasurer and in that time he has improved so much and the busi - ness of the treasurer is getting so much better every year that I think we ought to keep this man in this place. There being no other nominations, upon the usual motion duly seconded and carried the nominations were closed, the rules suspended, and the secretary cast the unanimous vote of the body for Mr. Banning as Treasurer, and he was duly elected. Secretary — I refrain from telling any stories on Mr. Banning in casting this ballot, because he knows too many on me. Mr. Banning — For the past two years I have acted as your Treas - urer and in that time I have been doing my best to put that office on a more efficient and detailed basis, and I think we have a good system fairly started. We want a system where we can take every man even down to the gate and know what he has done, and what his qualifica - tions are when we get through, and I have endeavored to get around me men I could trust and who would take hold of this work and </seg>
            <seg id="p052">52 repobt or newaska state board or agriculture see It through. If you have forty or fifty men who are not interested in their work you will not get very good result*. It Is not the com - pensation a man gets when he gets on the Fair grounds to work that he goes there for. He has an interest in the Fair and he goes to aid in its success and any of us who are working want to contribute to the success of the thing, and I think in this time we have put some reforms in that office and now we know where every dollar comes from that comes through the gate, and we know absolutely who took §&gt;ry ticket and if any man comes in short or long we know where try dollar goes and it is an easy matter to trace it, and we need know all these things in this as well as in any other business. I want to thank you gentlemen for your confidence in me. President — I believe it is customary also that we elect a Secretary for the organization. Nominations for Secretary will now be in order. Mr. Purcell — If all the Secretaries in this country were lined up in a row here, and there was a committee of Fair men, those who knew something about the Fairs of the United States, and they were asked to select an outstanding one, perhaps two or three, we know in our own minds that the present Secretary of the Nebraska State Fair Associa - tion would be one of those who would be asked to step forward. He has done a very wonderful work in this state and in this Fair, and when I say that, I say it with a knowledge of the conditions through - out the office; the splendid system of books; the splendid management; the splendid headwork he has done in building a bigger and better Fair; the splendid work done on the Fair grounds and the planning. and I believe we really appreciate his services. I am not going to continue this speech; we all know Mr. Danielson and know his work, and |t gives me great pleasure to place him in nomination for re-election as Secretary. Mr. Reed made the usual motion, and upon its adoption the nom - inations were closed, the rules were suspended, and the President cast the unanimous vote of the entire body for Mr. Danielson as Secretary, and he was declared duly elected. President — I certainly take great pleasure in casting this unanimous vote for Mr. Ed Danielson. Few men perhaps have had better oppor - tunity to know the worth of Ed Danielson to the state of Nebraska in this position that I have had; not alone in the state of Nebraska, but in the United States and even in Canada. Ed is some scrapper; he is clean; he is up and doing; he has the confidence of men with whom he becomes acquainted; and it eertainly gives me a world of pleasure to know that you will again have this man for your Secretary. Gentlemen, I cast the unanimous vote for Ed Danielson for your S«cr«Ury. LMr. Danielson — Men, I have tried my best to keep off the floor refrain from talking to you all the time for the last two or three </seg>
            <seg id="p053">■MM OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGBICULTIBE 53 days, but there comes a time in everybody's life when the support of your loyal friends, as you might say, commences to get under your hide. I am sure that you realize, by the confidence that you hare placed in me for seven years, that I must be interested in this work. I may not appear to you very far advanced in years in this life, but I can remember some things which right at the present time seem to me a long, long time ago. By the unfortunate loss of my father when seven years old, my mother was compelled to leave the farm in Iowa and come to Fremont and later to Lincoln, and when we came to Lincoln in 1892 I was not much more than a barefoot boy. I fell in with a lad here in town and made a chum of him, and at that time his father, who was old J. D. MacFarland, owned the land on which the Nebraska State Fair is now located. At that time he had a herd of Jersey cattle out there, and it was up to Jack and me to deliver the milk from those cattle around the city of Lincoln from the State Fair ground site of today. They had a few old frame buildings there that were torn down last year, and a caretaker's house and the old Manufacturers' building was still there. In 1900 I went to Polk county and came back in 1917. In 1907 I went to work in the cattle show out here at the State Fair as a clerk, and I just want to leave this with you to give you some idea as to why my deep interest in the Nebraska State Fair, in the State Board of Agriculture, and more than that, men, in the state of Nebraska, my adopted state that I have now lived in for thirty - three years. I have spent seventeen years with the State Fair, and how much longer I will be with you I do not know, but while I am here I trust that every year I can do just a little bit more than we did the year before and that we can take just a few more steps on the way up and in time we will reach the place where we can stop planning the steps and reach out to the finish of the work that we are going, and no doubt some of you men will be here when that time comes to do that work, and if a man has not a pride in his nation and in his state, county and community, what is there in life? Let us have faith in our state and nation, put our hearts into the work, work. together, and we can accomplish anything we want to do. I thank you. President Graff — We have reached the stage now in this annual meeting where I am going to step down and out from the management and mingle with those in the ranks; and I want to say to you this morning that in the selection that you have made it is a pleasure to me to feel and know that the business of this organization is going to be carried on by men who are well qualified through experience and otherwise to carry on this particular work. I will now turn over what I haven't got, the gavel, to the President of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture, Mr. George Jackson.

During this period of time the legislature of Nebraska has appropriated $640,000 for the purchase of the grounds, erection of buildings and minor improvements. During this same period of time this organization has staged the twenty-four Fairs, paid out for premiums during this time the sum of $705,000, and have put back into the grounds in the way of permanent improvements and upkeep a total sum of $746,000. You will note that from our receipts during this twenty-four year period we have paid oui $65,000 more for premiums than the total state appropriation for grounds and buildings. We have been able to keep pace with the state, and while they have been appropriating this $640,000, we have been able to match these appropriations and return to the people of the state an equal amount or more in the way of premiums than it has cost the state to build up the greatest advertising medium that Nebraska possesses. </seg>

I cannot discuss this subject from the standpoint of a technician because all I know about it, and it will only take a few minutes to tell it, is from the standpoint of the man out in the country, who promises to pay the tax. I won't say the taxpayer, because I don't want to cast myself as a taxpayer, but one who is assessed for taxes and expects to be able to pay. I have a leaflet here. I don't hand these out to advertise the fact that I come from Thurston County, in fact there are some things against that county. I won't say I come from the best county in the state, because all you fellows come from the best county, but I come from the second best county in the state.

Someone said in Congress some years ago that the tariff is a local issue. It occurs to me that taxation to the fellow who pays taxes is a local issue. When you get a fellow like me into these theoretical questions and thresh them up and down. I can follow a certain distance and then I can't go any further. I feel that a good many people who are paying what I consider an unjust share of the taxes of the state of Nebraska are the mules. There is no use in going into that, because I get mad sometimes, and when a man is mad theories don't go very far. He won't listen to them. But we believe the taxation question is an all-important one, not only at the top and among the leaders, but one which comes down through the rank and file of the people who should have a thorough under - standing of the things on which they are going to pay taxes. The place where I want to begin is down at the County Treasurers office, where I walk up and say, "How much is my county tax?" When I go to the grocery store to pay my grocery bill, or when I go to pay for my farm implements, or anything else I happen to buy, the first thing I ask for, if I have any business judgment, is an itemized state - ment. You don't have to pay a bill to anyone on earth until you have an itemized statement, except at the Treasurer's office. There you don't get it. You don't get an itemized statement that you can under - stand. There are some percentages on the back of your receipt, but I defy 95 per cent of the people to figure them out. Some of them can do it but they don't do it. We have a man in our county who eted out with that idea and he said he would take that tax receipt work it out. A lot of people were hostile and said the County $26,328.08 Total $15.50 'Mage of Walthill $6.5 General $4.00 Bonds and Interest S.50 Total $6.50 otal Tax $30.2 </seg>
            <seg id="p209">bktobt or iniiiri state board or agbiciltube 209 Board was certainly robbing us and passing between that Board and a certain bridge company there seemed to be a lot of money or prom - ises to pay in the form of bonds and warrants, which were not right. Some cool headed men referred the matter to the Farm Bureau and when the Farm Bureau men got through with it they had figured out a way by which a man knew in his own little school district what he was paying in the way of taxes and where it went to. It occurred to me, considering it from the local standpoint, that there are but two ways in which taxes can be reduced. I am talking about local taxation. One is by reducing expenditures that are paid out of the tax money and the other is by getting some more folks to come in and help carry the burden of taxation. You have to get more property on the tax list, intangible or tangible, to carry that burden, or else go up to the fellows who are spending the tax money and say "Let us call a halt." There may be other ways, and doubtless there are, but I cannot grasp them. Our first idea was to get to the people in every school district, which I understand is the smallest taxing unit, and give every man who pays taxes an itemized statement. We started out on the theory that we would work out a division of the tax dollar. We tried to work it out but found wp were dealing with pennies and divisions of pennies, and people who are paying two or three hundred dollars in taxes don't like to figure down to the fraction of a cent. Then we figured it down to one hundred dollars and we thought to divide that up and say so much went to this division, and so much to that division. But we found that one man was paying a hundred dollars on a certain amount of property and I was paying a hundred dollars on a great deal less property because his expenditures in his school district for school district, county and state, and precinct or township taxation, were a great deal different. So we decided on the proposition that we would take a certain number of teams of mules or automobiles or any kind of property, the value of which was supposed to be level, and with that division we would put it into each of the six school districts which we had, and see how much we were paying on that $1000.00 of property as it was moved around from school district to school district. We believe that such a plan is the easiest to accept and the most intelligible form. I believe we spent less than two days with the county clerk and the county treasurer by following out that system at our county seat. Outside of the large cities you can put that system onto paper % for each school district in your county in a day's time. We know that is true because we have tried it. You can go to your county treasurer and county clerk with exactly what you want. He will say, for in - stance, in school district 13 for that year we paid $30.20 on a $1000 valuation, and of that $3.30 were spent for state tax, $4.90 for county taxes and so on down the line and those in the village pay $6.60 more. But that only tells you that one of the branches of government is Retting so much of your money and not what they are doing with it- </seg>
            <seg id="p210">210 MCPOBT Or XEBBASKA STATE BOARD Or AOUCULTUKC You can divide it up a little bit. The president of our Farm Bureau was riding with me and we met a school teacher on the road with her Ford. The president said, "Now it is just things like that jitney which she is riding in that is getting all of our money." I told him that was probably true; I didn't know but what it was, but we were going to find out. We drove along and we met another man and he saw a road grader coming down the road. He said, "That's where all our money goes, all our money goes into that road work." So it is the things you see coming down the road that you think is getting all your money. We met another man who had been down to Lincoln and he said, "I have seen the plans for that new Capitol and that is where all our money is going. We have got to send men down there to tear that thing down." We are so apt to visualize the thing we see coming down the road and think that it is taking all of our taxes. Let us take the money spent for state taxes and we find that 22 cents went for the state capitol, 44 cents for state government, state institutions took 66 cents, state roads took 88 cents, and $1.10 went for state education. You can carry any one of those items down a great deal farther and you can spend a whole evening studying that one item of state taxes, and it doesn't take such a very high grade of intelligence or diligence either to do it. It is just a matter of working it out. But in your county tax you have the money the county board has appropriated in the county fund and the commissioners' road fund, and all the different funds, and you can take any one of those and follow them down to the bridges that we build. The subject of bridges is a delicate one up in our county, you know. But in the school district you are right at home. The President and Secretary of our county Farm Bureau took this material out to the different school districts. We kept a check on it and found that in the school districts where it had been the custom for five of the school boards to meet in annual session and re-elect themselves year after year, or after someone had been taken away by the Grim Reaper, they pulled in another one, it increased the at - tendance from five to fifty or sixty. That is what it will do in your school district. It did this also; when it came to the county board making its levy, instead of three commissioners sitting off in a room by themselves and knocking the ashes off of their cigars and saying they needed about so much money, the room was not big enough to hold the crowd. They were there to demand only the necessary ex - penditures for county purposes and it actually saved them some money. Why didn't it happen the next year? Because the agitation was not kept up. I have had criticism brought up by people saying, "When you are done what have you accomplished?" Maybe they got a little off of the school bill or cut down the appropriation for the Farm Bureau, but it doesn't amount to anything. The average man will say </seg>
            <seg id="p211">211 KKI-OBI OF NKHBAKKA STATIC ROAM) OF AGBICl'LTUBE it amounts to only 10 or 15 cents to him and what doea that amount to. Well, It amounts to something when the people of your county are beginning to get a knowledge and an understanding of where their money goes. If it does not save them a cent, if it tends them away satisfied and with more information it is effort well spent. You have accomplished something. I believe we have, and what has been done in four or five counties in the state can be done in every county if you will Just organize. This is the easiest proposition I know or to assemble, put on paper and a chart, and to present to a school district audience and get them interested. John Aye — Admitting that your taxes are high, that is your direct tax, don't you get more for that than for any other money you spend? Isn't it the indirect taxes, the increased cost of living and of trans - portation and all those things, that are hurting you more than the direct taxes? Taxes are the safest thing in the world to talk about, but don't you get more for your direct taxes than any other one thing? Mr. Keefe — We were able by means of this to reduce the expendi - tures $43,000 one year; and when you spread that over a county of poor people we think it is considerable. I am talking about the matter of interesting the people in the local tax problems; whenever you get a man interested in the direct taxes he is paying he is a little bit more inclined to get interested in this other thing which I grant you is probably more important. Mr. Snodgrass — I am just a plug of a farmer but I have got a little sense. And I say that if we, the farmers of Nebraska, haven't got sense enough to attend to our own business, then we ought to keep our mouths shut when the other fellow does it for us. It is a burning shame. In your district you fellows got together and made things go and why don't we do that all over the country everywhere, and tell the fellows what we want and demand it and if we don't get it. put them out. Mr. Keefe — I will get to the matter later or turning the rascals out and putting in new ones. The suggestion of indirect taxes is a very important one because it is the indirect taxes that is hitting us hard, but I claim we will never be able to shake off that indirect' tax until a machine is created to change this temporary interest to a growing interest and until then I feel that we must consider direct taxation. Now the matter of getting a little more property on the tax list is a pretty delicate subject because it is just across the road some - times. Of course, you are not doing it but some fellow across the road is not putting in all his property. But we devised a plan in which you take the returns from the township or precinct, giving the name of the individual and list the number of horses, cattle, hogs, sheep, machinery, automobiles, and the amount of grain he had on hand on the first of April, and its valuation. We also listed the stock of goods </seg>
            <seg id="p212">212 RKTOUT OF NKBRVNK V RTATK BOARD OF AO»ICII.TI «K the merchant had and its valuation, the amount of insurance he car - ried, the amount of household goods, the amount of jewelry, (nobody has any jewelry but get the amount of it and its valuation), the amount of stocks in corporations, and the amount of intangible property, notes and other evidences of indebtedness. I think there are about fifteen divisions. We checked each man and filled this sheet out and put it up in the window in the postoffice. The principal objection to that plan is that there are so many people outside looking these lists over that you have to go out in the street to get by. It cost us $4.50 per precinct to have those lists copied and made out. They were made out just before assessment time, calling people's attention to the fact thai the assessor would soon be around. Of course every man looks down to see if his name is there. He usually says there must be a mistake, as he handed in more property than that. Then these were submitted by the township Equalization Board and put right there where this chart would be in constant evidence, to see if there would be a differ - tse. In 1921 when the value of property was coming down and down some neighboring precincts, it increased our valuation from 20 to 22 r cent. It helped some. When the property returns should have been less than it was in 1920, it increased from 20 to 22 per cent ana the property didn't come into the county, it was there before. The men about town volunteered to fil these out. Later I heard two of them talking, and one said. "You have a dog and a gun and a hunting outfit worth $100 and you put it in at $10." The other replied. "That is all it's worth now." And then they sot down to the other man's name and he happened tn be a merchant and this first man said, "You told us that diamond ring you have on your finger was worth $200 and you have put it n at $25." And so it goes. You can't point to any individual nor sort out anybody that you are going to make a goat of and parade him as a tax dodger, but it has a general elevating effect. I want to call your attention to this book I have in my hand, which is a report of the state tax commissioner. I believe this kind of book should be printed year after year I believe the people of the state of Nebraska should insist on the book being printed. I was at a meeting in another county and a Farm Bureau man asked me to make a talk on taxation. I was not prepared but I had this book in my grip and I got the school district in which they were living and I memorized the amount of property that the state, county, township and school district was assessing for axation. I got it from this book, and the same is there for every school district in Nebraska. I went to the meeting and told them what they were paying the state and how much they were paying the county, and so on down the line. Those at the meeting were much surprised that I could give them local in - formation about which they knew so little themselves. You will find this kind of a book is very valuable and I believe there should be some </seg>

Professor Virtue — Do you have any kind of organization to meet with the county board every year when they are making up this budget? Mr. Keefe- We have a tax commission board appointed by the farm Bureau to meet with the county board every time they meet. Our county board has agreed that the County Clerk may submit to that Committee, five days before each meeting, a list of the bills they are eoing to consider, and they consider them. The state of Nebraska issues one of those books for every taxpayer in the state. They were sent to your County Clerk and he is probably using them for shaving paper, but you should be able to get one from your County Clerk and I believe the people from the state of Nebraska should demand that the state authorities issue something of this kind to inform the people on taxation all over the state as an educational matter. It is a long road to educate the people on taxation but it must be traveled if you are going to reach your ultimate goal. This turning the rascals out every year is a good thing because, as one man who was running for office said. "There is no reason why they should turn me out; they should continue me because I have made all the money I need and if they put some poor fellow in here he will have to go through the same thing." It is well for the people of the locality and the state to be cautious and take an interest in the men they are electing to office, but that interest must not end when the man Is elected but must continue on to the end. THE SHIFTING AND INCIDENCE OF TAXES Professor C. O. Virtue, University of Nebraska Your committee has assigned me a very important phase of the tax question, but a very difficult one. It is important because justice is the first consideration in matters of taxation and we are not able to pass upon the justice of a tax bill till we know, not merely who pays it in the first instance, but who finally bears the burden of it. It is difficult because we cannot consider the shifting and incidence of taxes without coming into contact with some of the knottiest problems of economic theory. In fact, as will be pointed out more fully later, "shifting" can take place only through a change in price; and in order, therefore, to understand how shifting takes place, we must have in mind the way price making forces operate; that is, we must know something of the theory of value. If I am to do anything more than </seg>

That, I take it, will be of more use to you than a mere listing of taxes as direct (i. e., taxes that cannot be shifted) and indirect, or those which are shifted. What Is a Just Tax? Before taking up this particular task, that term "justice in tax - ation" requires a word of explanation. Everybody professes to be will - ing "to pay his just share or taxes." What is a "just share" for each to pay? That is a question of first rate importance. The most satis - factory way of answering it is in the words of Adam Smith uttered 150 years ago: "The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities." This has come to be generally accepted by writers and statesmen everywhere as the fundamental guiding principle for the apportionment of the tax burden. No doubt the reason why it has been so generally accepted is that it is so vague and indefinite. The practical question with law-makers always is: What should be taken as the best test of "ability?" In other words, what should be made the "base" upon which to levy taxes? Very properly the answer, as found in the tax laws, that no one base, in view of the complexities of modern industrial life, can be found. In the tariff laws the tax is levied according to the quantity of goods imported in some cases and accord - ing to the value of the goods in other cases; though, as everybody knows, these taxes finally fall upon consumers in proportion to the amount of dutied goods consumed. In the state tax laws a great variety of base is used. We tax the insurance companies on the basis of their premium receipts; some states tax railroads on the basis of their gross earnings from operation; corporations are taxed on the basis of the amount of outstanding stock; in this state, in the early days, the basis used in practice was the amount of land owned. But the most important basis now used in this and other states is the value of all kinds of property owned. We were all brought up in the belief that the "general property tax," i. e., a tax based on the value of one's possessions, and at a rate uniform for all the various forms of property, is about the last word in taxation — a sort of a "thus smith the Lord." If only some way could be found to compel men to list all itheir property at its full value, that is, at what it would sell for, equity in taxation would be attained. Three-fourths of our state taxes, and a larger proportion of our local taxes rest on that belief. The Constitution of the State till recently was dedicated to that theory, and even now essentially so. This is no place to go into a discussion of the fallacy of the theory of the general property tax. That it is fal- </seg>
            <seg id="p215">215 BEPOBT OF XEBBASKA STATE BO A El) OF AGBICULTUBE lacious in theory and vicious in practice is beyond doubt. But tha* is another story. Railroad vs. Farm l&gt;aud Returns Let me, however, call your attention to the way the general prop - erty tax idea operates as between farm lands and the railroads. Both kinds of property are required by law to be assessed at their full value and in the same district take the same rate. Were that done with absolute precision, would there be satisfaction all around? Not at all. The land-owners would not be satisfied. They would feel that they were paying more than their "fair share of the taxes," for they would know that for any given value of land they would be getting only about half as much income as the railroads were getting from the same unit of value; from an acre of land valued at $100 the owner would get 12.50 or $3.00 net return, while a railway, for each unit of that value would earn $5.00 or $6.00; and they would pay the same tax. You know how the assessing officers have been laboring with this kind of a situation. For this, among other reasons, farm lands have been systematically undervalued by the local assessors, and the state Board of Equalization and Assessment has apparently not undervalued the railroads in the same proportion. At any rate this is the position taken by the railroads. They have refused to pay their taxes and are con - testing the assessments against them in the courts. The situation thus presented is not a simple one. At bottom it represents a conflict of theories as to the proper basis of taxation. The railroads appear to be satisfied with taxation according to value as pro - vided in the constitution and the statute; the assessing officers appear to think that an unjust basis, and to think that taxation according to income is a fairer basis. Ijhw ami Practice Do Xot Agree This apparent inequality as between the tax on landowners and on railroads must continue as long as we cling to the value base. The reason is that buyers of land and buyers of railroad shares capitalise the return from these sources at different rates of interest. Take Union Pacific shares for example. They have had a range in price from 124 to 144 during the past year; the average has been some - where around 130. For several years the dividend has been $10.00 per share. The company has been able to earn about that much, some - times more, sometimes possibly less. If there were no borrowed capital used, if all the invested capital in the road were in the form of shares, owned by stockholders, we could then say that for every $130.00 invested the company was earning net, say $10.00. But a farm that is worth $130.00 an acre will on the average yield from $3.25 to $4.00 per acre. ($3.90 capitalized at 3%). Dollar for dollar of value, in any given tax district, the same tax it paid. It it fair? I leave you </seg>
            <seg id="p216">216 KNOT Or NEBKA8KA STATE BOAftD OF AGBICULTl BK to answer the question and content myself with saying that if we conclude it is fair we should be doing the logical and square thing to support assessing officers in conforming to the law and nnsr— l«c all property at its true value. If we conclude it is not fair, we should remember that if left to our choice, as we all are, to take U. P. stock at 130 with a present yield of $10.00 or farm land at $130.00 per acre, and a net yield of $4.00, most of us would take the land; we would take that because we consider it safe, because we like to be owners of land in our own name, because we have a hope that some - time it will be worth more; because its value is not likely to be made the plaything of the gentlemen "on Wall Street," as Mr. Bryan would say, in their game of high finance. Furthermore, if we think it unfair we should seek by some lawful means to correct the inequality. I shall later have a suggestion to make in discussing the incidence of railroad Must Truce Tax to Kinal Taxpayer Sit must be clear that we cannot tell whether a tax is just till we ow who Anally pays it; what its incidence is. This is not always easily determined. I shall net enter into the more complex and dif- K aspects of the problem, but shall be content with discussing a typical cases of shifting and with making some application to nt problems of taxation that all are concerned with. As already noted, shifting takes place through a change in price and only so. Prices at any given time are determined by the relation between demand and supply and a change in price takes place only when this relationship is changed. In the long-run goods tend to sell at a price 'that corresponds to the expenses of producing them to somebody's expenses of production. So we say that market price is "determined" by the equilibrium of demand and supply; and the long-run price, or normal price is "determined" by or corresponds to the expense — some expense — of production. It is important always to distinguish between market price, the price at any given time, and normal price — the price at which goods in the long-run tend to sell We must distinguish between the immediate effect of a tax and its long - run effect. It is of course the long-run effect that we are chiefly concerned with. Relation Between Supply and Demand and Tax Asaeaaed Let us suppose now that an excise tax is laid on the production § goods — so much per unit produced: Is it shifted or not? If so, once, or in the long-run only? By the full amount of the tax or part it? We cannot answer these questions off-hand for all cases. Gen - erally speaking we should not expect any Immediate effect on price because there would usually be no immediate effect on either demand or supply. As the old supplies are worked off, however, and new goods </seg>
            <seg id="p217">217 are to be produced they are produced at a higher coat; and if only a sufficient return to cover expenses of production had been realized under the old conditions, there would now be a loss. Producers will, of course, want a higher price. Can they get it by asking? By proving that their cost of production has increased? By arguing that they are losing money? Not at all. The only way they can get a higher price is through a change in the relation of demand and supply. Their main chance is in curtailing supply. If demand remains the same the price will rise and the new item in cost — the tax, is shifted to the buyer, in some measure, but only if the supply is curtailed. Time for Price Adjustment to Meet Taxex How long will it take for this result to work itself out? That depends on the character of the industry. If it is one in which pro - duction can be checked quickly without serious loss, the adjustment of supply to demand, so that market price will conform to normal price, may take place in a short time. If an industry is involved where a shift from one product to another cannot easily or quickly be made* where competition forces producers to keep their plants going for fear of a loss of market or other cause, the period of readjustment may be a long one. The longer the period of operation, between the be - ginning of production and finishing the product, the longer it will take for the readjustment to be made. Manufacturers, especially if there is "Co-operation" among them, may pretty promptly check pro - duction and secure a rise in price. In agriculture the process is slow. A tax laid after a crop is in can have no effect on supply and there can be no shifting till the next crop is put in — and harvested — and then only through curtailment. A tax of $5.00 a head, say on the production of beef cattle, is laid after a man has irretrievably gone into a cattle raising proposition that requires three years to carry through, cannot be shifted. He can do nothing to recoup himself through an increase in price. Absorption of a Tax in the Price Can the price be increased enough to equal the tax, or can only a part of the tax be shifted? That again depends on the industry taxed; this time upon the conditions under which the commodity taxes is pro - duced. Three cases may be distinguished: </seg>
            <seg id="p218">218 BRPOBT OF NRMASKA 8TATE BOABD OF AGBirri.Tr*F. Case I. Goods produced at constant cost; i. e., at the same cost whether more or less is produced. In this situation the process of adjusting supply goes on till the price rises by an amount just equal to the tax. This is due to the fact that the tax — the new element of cost — is added to a producing cost for the curtailed supply which is just the same as the producing cost for the original supply. Fro 2 LCase II. Goods produced at decreasing cost per unit as more and e is produced. Here the effect of an excise is to raise the price by something more than the amount of the tax. This must be true; for as soon as producers curtail production, the unit cost to which the tax is added is higher than the old cost. Fig. 3 </seg>
            <seg id="p219">219 KKPOHI' UK \ KHHA.SK. K KTATK HOABI) OF Atllt'l I.Tl RK Case III. Goods produced at an increasing unit cost as more and more is produced. Here the tax is shifted, but not by the full amount of the tax. The reason for this is clear. As the supply is curtailed in order to get a higher price, the cost per unit becomes less, and the tax is added to this lowered cost of production, making a price that is higher than the old one, but not by as much as the amount of the tax. The consumer bears part of the tax and the producer part. Fig. 4 Who Pays the Sales Tax? Let us see what bearing all this has on the sales tax about which we have heard a great deal and shall probably hear a great deal more. We may look at the sales tax as a form of excise and, applying it to the three cases described we can see why merchandisers and manu - facturers generally favor the sales tax and why farmers ought, in their own interest, to oppose it. Merchandising and manufacturing operate under conditions of constant cost, or of decreasing cost, of production; and a tax on their sales is shifted entirely in the case of constant cost goods, and on the decreasing cost goods the price is raised by more than the amount of the tax. But agricultural com - modities are subject to the law of increasing cost; and a tax on them, while in part shifted, is partly borne by the producer. Moreover, owing to the slowness with which readjustment takes place in this industry, a long period may elapse before any shifting takes place, that is for a long time, the producer of agricultural commodities may have to bear the whole tax. It ought to be said that while manufac - turers and merchants can shift the tax, and in general with prompti - tude, it does not leave them unaffected. They must curtail production or sales. The sales tax plan, however, would make them on the whole merely collectors of taxes borne by other people. It may have certain </seg>
            <seg id="p220">220 KKfOKT OF NKBBAMKA STATE BOARD OF AURK'Ll.Tl RK merits as a means of collecting tax revenue, but there seems to be no reason why it should be attractive to farmers. Effect of a Plat Rate Land Tax IThus far we have considered the incidence of an excise tax on the iuction of agricultural and other commodities, and the incidence of proposed sales tax — a tax on the privilege of selling. Suppose a tax laid on agriculture in other forms: What would be the incidence of a land tax at a flat rate for all grades of land? This would operate in about the same way as an excise tax. Even the poorer lands would pay the tax; it would be an expense at the point where price-making forces would take effect — at the margin, and would in part be shifted, in part to be borne by the land-owner. A tax on the rental value of land — on ground-rent as the writers say, could not be shifted at all; for there would be no rent to be taxed at the very point where price - making forces operate, i. e.. on lands that just pay the expenses of production, and therefore yield no rent. Thug there would be no added expense "at the margin" as we say, the same amount would be pro - duced there as before the tax was laid, and no contraction to cause a rise in price would occur, therefore no shifting of the tax would occur. The owners of the better grades of land would have to bear it all. The Income Tax It has been usual to say that the income tax — a tax on net ineo«e — is direct, cannot be shifted. The income tax decision of 1894 turned on the question whether it was a direct tax within the meaning of the constitution. It was held to be direct and therefore unconstitu - tional in the form in which it was passed It was not till the amend - ment of 1913, that we could lay an income tax without apportioning i! among the states according to population. While it is customary to say the income tax is not shifted, I think a safer statement is that some parts of it can, and other parts cannot, be shifted. As shown above, a tax on income in the form of rent (of land) cannot be shifted; the same is true, generally speaking, of wages, salaries, fees for pro - fessional services and the like, since the tax is in no way connected with the conduct of a business, cannot enter into cost in such a way as to affect the price of anything as is done by an excise or sales tax. Of course, if the tax were laid in the form a specific amount for each case tried by a lawyer, or patient visited by a doctor, it would then affect directly the cost of performing the service and would be shifted. Otherwise a tax on this form of income would have no more effect on the price of services than would an increase in the rent of the house the lawyer lives in, or in the price he pays for steak. It seems pretty clear, also, that a tax on income in the form of profits cannot be shifted, though in case of corporation profits, it may be there is a </seg>
            <seg id="p221">KH1IKI tt MIIUASKV STATK IMJAKIl OK AC.HH'I l.TI UK 221 tendency to shift. On the other hand it seems pretty clear that a tax on interest income can be shifted. Cannot Shift Excess Front* Tax In general, it is safe to say that excess profits taxes are not shifted. The tax does not apply till all expenses of production are paid and an interest return on invested capital allowed which appears to be large enough to keep producers stimulated and going at their full capacity; and as long as they do this there can be no shifting. The agitation a few years ago for substituting the sales tax for these taxes, because the profit taxes were shifted and caused such a tremendous rise in prices, making it so hard for poor folks, had not much logic or fact to support it. If these taxes had been shifted, agitation for their repeal would have come from a source quite different from the one it did come from. Incidence of Railroad Taxes Many complexities arise in trying to trace the effects of railroad taxes. In general, as railroad taxes are imposed, they are shifted. I'nder a system of public regulation, with weak roads operating side by side with strong roads it is the cost of providing service to the weak roads that determines the rate level. All roads charge the same rate and public authorities will permit rates high enough to keep the weak roads going. On such rates the strong roads prosper. They are in the position of a farmer on rich land who with the same outlays ran produce two or three times as much as those on the poorest lands in use. those at the margin of cultivation. It is the cost of produc - tion to those on the poorest lands regularly in use which determines the price nf the product. And so it is cost of production to the poorer roads that, under a system of public regulation, determines the rate level. But the rate level is made up of a vast number of rates on specific commodities; and to trace the effect of a tax in detail would necessitate a study of individual rates. The important question for any person is: Which rates are to be raised and how much, in order to secure the additional revenue made necessary by an increased tax on railroad companies; and how will the higher rates affect the price of such goods. It is to the interest of the railroad to increase the rates most on goods for which there is an inelastic demand. Wheat and farm products generally, are examples of such goods. Coal for a community in which there is no substitute for coal is another. The railroad naturally selects these for rate increases because the falling off in the demand for such goods is comparatively slight and the volume of traffic is not much reduced. In general we may say that increased taxes lead to increased rates, and these to a higher cost of getting poods to market, and this, in time, to higher prices for those goods — higher in some proportion of the rate Increase. </seg>
            <seg id="p222">222 BEPOBT Or HOUHK1 STATE HOABI) OF AUMCl'l.TI'KK Taxes on Common Carriers Paid By Customers This situation has led many to the conclusion that there is no logic in taxing common carriers only to have the taxes shifted in the long - run to the consumer. If all taxpayers used the railroads in just the same measure as they are taxpayers there might be some reason for this contention. But they do not. Take the case of a single carrier in a community, like the Traction Company in Lincoln. There is justification for taxing the company even though specific rates must be charged to yield a revenue equal to the taxes paid. If the com - pany ceases to be a taxpayer, more revenue will have to be got from other taxpayers; and those who contribute most in taxes may be those who use the service least or not at all. There is no reason why users of public utilities should not pay rates high enough to support these services, including the taxes on them, just as the patrons of a butcher pay prices high enough to support the butcher service, including taxes on the business — part of which are likewise shifted. Especially is this true when the same base is used for state and county levies, as for local levies. There can be no possible reason why the people of Custer County should pay higher taxes than they otherwise would in order that those who ride on the street cars in Lincoln may enjoy lower rates. Progressive Tax on Railroad Earning!* But we are very easy victims of a system if we go on authorizing higher and higher rates because of taxes, for the sake of the weak roads, and permit the strong roads to profit thereby. As long as we have a pure ad valorem method of taxation the situation described will continue. Is there any way of laying taxes on the strong roads* so they will not be shifted? I believe there is. What is needed, to attain this end. is a plan whereby additional tax revenue can be gotten from the railroads without increasing the cost of transportation on the marginal roads, on the high cost roads. Perhaps the easiest way to do this is to retain the ad valorem taxes on all roads; retain the attempt to tax "franchise value," making this a small item, if any, for the weak roads and increasing it as is now done, with the earning power of the stronger roads; and in addition to this apply special taxes to the strong roads in the form of a pro - gressive gross earnings tax, progressing as the per cent of net earnings increases. The tax could be made inapplicable to the roads which have no net earnings or very low net. In this way only the ad valorem taxes would be shifted — and they probably only in part. The strong roads would thus be unable to shift these special taxes. They could not properly plead, although they doubtless would so plead, that their property was being confiscated. The railroads, as common carriers, have no right to more than a reasonable return upon the fair </seg>
            <seg id="p223">BKPOBT OF NKKR.VSKA STATE HOARD OT AC.RIdl TIRE 223 value of the property devoted to a public use; this much would have to be left, and in the public interest ought to be left. But the 8 and 10 per cent dividends, and surpluses above these, that eventually ripen into "melons," would under such a method of taxation be subjected to considerable shrinkage. And, according to principles long estab - lished, the public would be taking back in the form of taxes, and in a lawful way, what the railroads have unjustly, though lawfully, taken from the public in high rates. The President — I would like to ask Professor Virtue, what is meant by double taxation? What relation does that bear to the taxa - tion of farm mortgages? Professor Virtue — That is a pretty hard question to go into. Let me take an illustration. A boy starts out to farm and he buys a pair of mules on time for $300.00. Mr. Hedges sells the mules to this boy and takes the boy's note; you have not any more wealth in the world after that transaction than you had before, but you do have twice as much property. There is a difference between property and wealth. The mules are wealth but the note is property, it is an income bearing power, just as a pair of mules is. Suppose you tax the boy with the mules and tax Mr. Hedges for the note. I suppose that would be called a case of double taxation and so far as I can see in that case the double taxation is on the mules because they must pay the taxes on themselves and also pay the taxes on the note, which is Mr. Hedges' property. A Member — If he were not taxing both I would like to ask which Professor Virtue would tax. Professor Virtue — On purely theoretical grounds I would say don't tax the note, but on practical grounds I would say tax the note. But again on practical grounds I would say don't, for the love of Mike, try to tax it at the same rate that you do the mules because you won't get anywhere by that in the long run. In other words, the position that the classified property tax is in now, if they tax the note at a less value than wealth, which is tangible, it is a sound practical prin - ciple and there is also a theoretical ground for it. That is a big question, but it is not the question before us today. A Member — Would Professor Virtue say that the farmer who owns a $10,000.00 form and has a $5,000.00 mortgage on that farm should pay taxes on the full value of his farm regardless of the fact that he owned only half of it. Is that double taxation? Professor Virtue — Yes, I think so, that is the same case as the mules and the note; the law requires ail kinds of property shall be taxed at its full value, whether it is one kind or another. I would like to see a tax system which apportions the burden in proportion to the tax paying ability. Under the rules now a man is taxed on his mortgage the same as on his farm, but it is not a sign of earning power. A trundle bed is not an asset of earning power, but a liability. In regard </seg>

We have had a curious le of decisions on that matter in our Supreme Court and I don't | there is any legal basis for the distinction that the court makes, an in Cuming county sold his farm and took a mortgage on it went into another county and bought a farm and went into debt he amount of the mortgage he already held. He reported to the assessors that he had a mortgage for $2,500.00 on the purchased farm, and also a mortgage on the other farm that he had sold and asked if it would not be possible to offset the one against the other. And the Supreme Court ruled that in that particular case it could be offset, but if you loaned money the thing would be reversed. In a case where he held a mortgage and it was not in the process of a trade the court held that the mortgage was practicable and no offset of his debts were Kwed. So far as I can see there is no difference, because in either I you are holding the representative of wealth or contingent wealth. TAX-K.XEMPT INOOMK Harold Hedges, University of Nebraska I Twenty-four years ago, Ex-President Benjamin Harrison in one of speeches made a statement that is even more significant today a it was then. By paraphrasing one of Lincoln's well-known declara - tions, he uttered the warning that "this country cannot continue to exist half-taxed and half-free" Our nation does have a real tax prob - lem, and it also has a "tax-dodging" problem. This latter problem is even greater than it otherwise would be because it has to do with legalized "tax-dodging." More than the police power of our goTera - ment must be involved in applying a remedy. That a remedy should be found, and found soon, is apparent when we are faced with the fact that the owners of 30,000,000,000 dollars or more of property in the United States will pay no taxes on it, or on the income from it. thin von r Tax Exemptions Not New in History This enormous total of thirty billion dollars represents the amount of national, state and local issues of bonds and securities which are untazed or tax-free at the present time. Exemption from taxation is not new but has long been a common practice in fiscal history. In feudal times, the man who took up arms for the defense of his lord or king was excused from paying taxes. Growing crops and workman's tools have long been exempt because social expediency demanded it. Why have government bonds and securities come to be exempt from taxation? </seg>
            <seg id="p225">BKPOBT Or NEBRASKA STATE BOABD OF AGBKTI.Tl'BK 225 Under stress of war, when government credit is weakest, the need for revenue is most urgent. In order to facilitate borrowing, exemp - tion from taxation of the government's securities covering the war loan seemed advisable. Then the practice of tax exemption was adopted in peace times to aid in disposing of the bond issues quickly and at a low interest rate. The argument in support of this was that the lower rate of interest would mean a reduced cost of public undertakings. Before discussing the truth or fallacy of this argument, let us consider further the cause of the growth in the volume of tax-exempt securities. Our Form of Government One Cause of Growth Perhaps the principal reason for the rapid development in the United States lies in the nature of our plan of government. We have in this country a dual form of government. The Constitution attempted to define the powers and limitations of our federal government, and all the other powers were reserved to the states. The question of tax Jurisdiction was largely neglected and therein lies the reason why public scurities are exempt from taxation. Interpretation of the Con - stitution on this point was such that the federal government could not tax the securities of state or local units, nor could the states tax the securities of the federal government — the old question of states rights again. This was not a serious matter so long as we had proportional taxation, but since the federal income tax was adopted and progressive taxation attempted, complications have developed. The Sixteenth Amendment to our Constitution giving the govern - ment the right to tax income "from whatever source derived" was not so construed by the Supreme Court as to permit taxing of the Income from state and municipal securities. Consequently we may say that the general policy of making public securities exempt from taxation in the United States is founded on the fact that we have the dual form of government — the federal and the state units, each independent of the other except as provided in the Constitution. Total Now Outstanding Is Enormous Consider now more in detail that thirty billion dollars of tax-exempt securities now outstanding. The national war debt of about twenty - two billion dollars is covered by the several issues of Liberty and Vic - tory Bonds. The first Liberty Loan was made entirely tax-exempt, the reason given being that it was necessary in order to meet the com - petition of the large amounts of state and municipal tax-exempt securi - ties then on the market, and to keep the interest burden on the people as light as possible. In the succeeding issues limitations were placed on the exemptions from taxation both as to amount and duration. One authority has figured out that an investor can secure $160,000 worth of these later issues by distributing his purchases, right, and still be exempt from taxes on them. In addition, he would have avail- </seg>
            <seg id="p226">226 urorr or nebkaska state board or aobicultube able for investment all he wanted of the 3% per cent bonds and Z\ per cent notes of the first issue, a billion dollars worth of pre-war bonds and a half billion or more of federal farm loan bonds. Furthermore during the past year, a half billion more have been issued by the government in its debt-refunding operations. I mentioned that there were also limitations as to the duration of the exemptions on the later issues of war bonds. Provision was made that exemptions lasted only a specified time after the declaration of peace. Consequently these exemptions expire at different times between 1923 and 1926. State and Local Issues of Exempts Increasing Nothing has yet been said as to the extent of the issues of state and local tax-exempt securities. Figures appearing in the "Bond Buyer," a New York financial paper, gives light on this. Taking the period 1913 to 1918 the issues of exempt bonds ranged from S91 million in 1913 to 837 million in 1917. In 1919 when the federal war income tax was adopted, the bond issues totaled 1,220 million, in 1921, the total was over 2 billion, and this past year it will probably total a billion and a half. These figures are for bonds issued by the states and local units. Thus we have an increase of a billion to a tlion and a half each year. The estimate on the total outstanding the state and local tax-exempt bonds in 1923 was ten billion dollars. Summing up, we may say that the total of all tax-free securities — federal, state and local — ranges between thirty and thirty-three billion dollars and will remain at this amount until 1926, when the limitations on the later issues of the Liberty loans will expire. After 1926. the total will drop to about twenty billion dollars. I have already made the statement that so long as we had propor - tional taxation, the matter of exemption of bonds from taxation was not a serious matter but with the adoption of the principle of pro - gressive taxation, complications have developed. The distinction be - tween a proportional and a progressive tax can best be made by giving examples of each. The general property tax in Nebraska is a propor - tional tax, the same rate being applied on one man's property as on another's regardless of the amount each possesses. The federal income tax is a progressive tax, those having larger incomes being subject to higher rates than those in the lower brackets. For instance, a man with net income of $10,000 is subject to a surtax of 1 per cent in addition to the normal tax on that amount; one with net income of $50,000 is subject to a surtax of 22 per cent on the last $2,000 plus the cumulative amount from $6,000 up to $48,000 in addition to the normal tax. We stated that with proportional taxes, exemption of bonds from taxes works no hardship. For example, Lancaster County issues some improvement bonds, that are all sold within the state and sold to Nebraska citizens. If they were subject to tax, a higher interest rate would have to be paid to induce buyers to accept them, and to </seg>
            <seg id="p227">227 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICri.TlBK rover the amount of the tax. The county would actually lose by the amount necessary to cover cost of collecting the tax. All the county has done is pay more interest in order to have the opportunity to get that additional interest paid back in the form of a tax. Wealthy Secure Greateftt Benefits from Exempts With a progressive tax, the situation is entirely changed. Those subject to the high rates have an incentive to avoid payment of taxes by purchasing the tax-exempt bonds, and thus escape all taxes. The wealthy classes are therefore benefited much more than the investor of small means. To illustrate this, let us take a $1,000 tax-exempt City of Lincoln improvement bond yielding 5 per cent and compare the savings in taxes of men of low and high incomes. The income from ihis bond on which we would base our calculation would be $50. Con - sidering the savings in surtaxes, alone, as levied under our federal income tax, a man with an income of $6,000 subject to the 1 per cent surtax would save 50 cents in surtax by owning the tax-free bond rather than a railroad bond that is taxable. A man with Income of $25,000, subject to 10 per cent surtax, would save $5.00 in surtax. A man in the $50,000 class would save $11.00 and a man in the $200,000 class would save $25.00 in surtax. Thus you see that with every material increase in income there is greater incentive to invest in tax-exempt bonds rather than in those subject to taxation. KariMil Incomes Bear Heavier Burden Than Unearned Incomes The basis of a progressive tax is "ability to pay. If the way is open for those having the greatest "ability to pay" to escape the higher rates by investing in the tax-free bonds, the actual result is that we have a regressive tax, a most undesirable kind. Opportunity to take advantage of tax-exemption by those owning property in the form of securities permits the man with the property income or "unearned" income to escape the burden of the graduated rates, and the burden is thereby shifted to men less able to pay — those with income from personal services who cannot shift the burden. This results in greater taxation of earned incomes than of unearned or property incomes. Certainly this is not desirable. Other arguments against tax-exemption of securities, I will mention only briefly. Tax-exemption gives an unfair advantage to the govern - mental securities in the bond markets and thus makes it more difficult for industries to secure the necessary capital for expansion. Secretary Hoover of the Department of Commerce made this statement: "Sur - plus capital is pouring by hundreds of millions monthly into tax-free securities and foreign loans and yet our railroads are unable to finance the most moderate of construction programs." </seg>
            <seg id="p228">228 8TATE BOABO OT AGRin 1 TIRK Exemption Privilege May Liead to Extravagance Another statement often heard is this: "Tax-exemption of public securities encourages extravagant expenditures by local and municipal governments." Ease in selling the bond issues is given as the reason for this. There is no way to prove this so all that can be said is that there might be such a tendency. An indication of this tendency is given, however, by the figures previously cited, showing the recent increases in the amount of exempt securities issued in late years. As the bonds have become more desirable for investment, and have sold so readily, the amount issued each year was increased. The standard argument of those favoring tax-exemption privileges for government securities is that the matter is as broad as it is long, that is, that the increased demand for such bonds because of tax - exemption will cause them to sell at enough premium to offset the amount of the tax saved. Admittedly, under proportional taxation this would be true, but not with progressive taxation. If the amount of tax-exempt bonds were very limited and not sufficient to meet the demands of those subject to the highest surtax on their incomes, then the competition to secure such bonds would tend to offset the advantage of exemption from tax. But when we have a veritable flood of such securities as at present, that argument will not hold, and for this „,„„ reason. Pwliim on Exempt** Does Not Offset IjOss In Taxes K These tax-exempt bonds are more desirable than taxed bonds only long as the possessor can secure a greater net income from them. Suppose an issue of exempts were offered on the market at par. All persons subject to the income tax would find them desirable and would bid for them. The bond would then demand a premium. As the premium increased, the small investor would withdraw from the market, demand is thus decreased, and the bonds cease to rise in value. Thus we can see that those of high incomes are the ones who profit. As previously cited, a man of $200,000 or more income could forego more than $25 return (the amount of the surtax only) on a $1,000 tax-exempt bond and still net as much as on a taxed bond of similar denomination. But the premium he is forced to pay will no where near approach the amount saved on the exempted security in the form of taxes. The result of this circumstance is that the small taxpayer is caught. Whenever a taxpayer, legally or otherwise, dodges his full share of the tax burden, someone else has to pay more to make up what the dodger does not pay. In this case, the wealthy who are most able to pay, escape the burden, and the man of moderate means must assume the additional load. Have we any proof to indicate that the rich are avoiding taxes through purchase of exempt bonds? Secretary </seg>
            <seg id="p229">BEPOBT Or NOKA8KA STATE BOARD OF AOBICULTIEK 229 Mellon of the Treasury Department has prepared a table showing the decline in number of taxable incomes of the higher brackets. Here are the figures for the three years, 1916, 1919, 1921, showing number of returns of taxable incomes of $300,000 or more: 1916 — 1296; 1919 — 679; 1921 — 246. There were less than one-fifth as many in 1921 as in 1916. No doubt the business depression caused soma de - cline in incomes but surely not to the extent these figures indicate. This unusual decrease implies that those of high incomes have invested in the tax-exempt bonds and securities. Louis W. Hill gave testimony in court that between the years 1916 and 1920, he put some of the taxed holdings of his mother, the widow of the late J. J. Hill, into tax-free securities, and thereby in - creased her income from $365,000 to $730,000 a year. That is concrete proof that it is being done. liOM in Taxes Offsets Lower Interest Rate on Exempt* It must be admitted that if the tax exemption privilege is not per - mitted, that it might necessitate the issue of bonds with a higher interest rate than exempt bonds now yield. Various writers have esti - mated that it would be necessary to increase the rate by one-half to one and a half per cent. This matter of "spread" between taxables and tax-exempts is considered in the following: "Secretary Mellon 's income tax recommendations have caused bond dealers to look more closely into the 'spread' between tax-free and taxable bonds. The result, as reported by the Bond Buyer magazine, confirms the opinion that the repeal of the tax-exemption privilege will not cost states and communities anywhere near the amount of the tax in the price they can and will obtain in floating their bond issues. "To prove this the Bond Buyer assembles ten typical high grade taxable bonds, such as Santa Fe general 4s and Union Pacific 4s, whose market price November 14 averaged a yield to the investor of 4.66 per cent. "Then it takes a list of ten tax-exempt bonds, State of Kansas 4V4s, New York City 4&gt;4s of 1957 and others, whose price the same day returned to the investor 4.50 on the average. "The difference is much less than the taxes. "The verdict of the Bond Buyer magazine is that tax-exempt bonds have never fully reflected the value of the exemptions they have en - joyed. . . . This authority on the bond market says, 'the spread be - tween taxable and tax-free bond prices is so slight that it does not fully measure the difference in security.' " Suppose it were one per cent. One per cent more interest on the 30 billions in bonds now outstanding would mean the payment of 300 million dollars more interest each year.

            <seg id="p230">230 BEFOBT Or XEBBAHKA STATE BOARD OF AGBICl'LTl'BE would then be collectible add enough to the revenues to offset the higher interest payment? Tendency for Large Holdings Is to Seek Kxempt Bond* Professor Seligman of Columbia University, an eminent authority on taxation matters, has estimated that the revenue lost by the federal government alone through inability to levy the personal income tax on these securities is 270 million a year, and the state and local units would also lose considerable in taxes. A worse feature is that, even if the gain at present would not offset the greater interest payment necessary without tax exemption, the tendency is for the ownership of the exempt securities to concentrate more and more in the hands of the wealthy, and sooner or later, the loss in revenue' will be enormous. Now that the states are adopting the income tax as part of their fiscal systems (twelve states have already done so) the situation will become more and more aggravated. A third evil feature- — the unfair competition of tax-exempt bonds with industrial securities — has already been mentioned. The unfair competition is not due entirely to the lower interest rates that exempted bonds carry. The supply of fresh, new capital needed constantly by expanding industry and upon which it is dependent if it is to grow, is secured from the great incomes which cannot be consumed in living expenses. These largest incomes hunt the tax-exempt securities and are no longer available for new business enterprises. Farmer Is Affected by Tax Exemption It has been said that the farmer profits from the fact that federal farm loan bonds are exempt from taxation and that he therefore should favor continuance of the tax-exemption privilege. I doubt if any fair-minded farmer wishes to continue a system that puts additional burden on those in moderate circumstances like himself while the wealthy reap the benefits. In December, 1920, it was estimated that only one farmer out of fifty-six had secured a federal loan on his land. The proportion is much greater now, but even so, it is evident that the majority of farmers are not benefited from getting loans at a lower rate. The higher federal tax on his income and the increase in the property tax levied by the state offset any advantage gained. Continuing this matter of the offset of tax-exempt securities on the farming class. A farm paper recently made the statement that the fight against tax-exempt securities was not the farmer's battle but the fight of the salaried men and the smaller business men in the cities and towns. It went on to state that "if it were not for the tax-exempt feature of the bonds of the federal land banks and the joint stock land banks, the farmer today would be paying on his mortgage money at </seg>
            <seg id="p231">REPORT Or NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 231 least one-half and probably one per cent more interest." On the sur - face this appears to be true, but is it? Figures issued by the United States Department of Agriculture in a bulletin dealing with farm mortgage loans indicate the percentages of the amounts of such loans held by the various loan agencies in 1921. The per cents held by these agencies were: Banks — 17%; Insurance Companies — 14%; Mortgage bankers — 3%; State Agencies — 1%; Land Bands — 5%. The remaining 60 per cent is the total of mortgages held by former owners and private investors. Let us theorize a little on this matter and see whether the premise made by the farm paper is correct. The supply of and demand for capital is, no doubt, the basic factor in determining the interest rate. Furthermore there is not one but many forms of investment open to the lender. Considering the problem from the standpoint of demand and supply, would not this reasoning be sound? Farm mortgages make up only one form of investment. If it were the only form of invest - ment open to new capital from the several sources mentioned above the land banks offering to make the loan at a lower rate of interest, would force other capital to meet the new rate if loans are to be made by them. But there are other investments available to capital. If rates are low in one, capital will seek a form of investment giving a rela - tively higher return. If farm loans were to pay a low rate out of proportion with other investments, capital would leave the farm loans for other investments. Scarcity of the supply available would necessi - tate higher rates for farm loans, until a new balance between the various forms of investment were reached. Of course, if the land banks could furnish all capital needed or even a large proportion, then the rate would be lowered on all loans; but only 5 per cent was furnished (in 1921) by land banks so their influence was not enough to pre - dominate the farm mortgage loan market. Farmer Benefits From Land Bank Through Better Loan Terms We mentioned that other forms of investment were open to capital if farm loan rates became relatively lower than other rates. One form of investment is tax-exempt securities. It is a known fact that a large proportion of the farm loans in Nebraska have been made by eastern investors. With lowered rates on farm loans, and the opportunity to escape taxes by investment in the tax-exempt bonds, such investors have withdrawn their capital from farm mortgages. The tendency would then be for rates to rise because of shortened supply and capital available. The above argument is theory and we have no way to prove that farm mortgage rates have changed one way or the other since the land banks were established. I am not, in any way, belittling the land banks because I feel they have done an immense amount of good, but not by a marked lowering of rates on farm mortgage loans. They have been a potent factor in bringing about more nearly uniform rates. They </seg>

I believe, however, that it would have been possible to secure these benefits to practically the same extent, if the bonds of the land bank had not been issued with the exemption privilege. What Is the Remedy? Now comes that most vital of questions: What is the solution or remedy? A cartoonist has represented tax-exempt securities as Uncle Sam's "Boarder" cow — a cow that has eaten billions of dollars worth of stuff and hasn't given a drop of milk. No good farmer keeps a cow that is a "boarder." Who is Uncle Sam, anyway? You are Uncle Sam, I am Uncle Sam and every citizen of the United States is Uncle Sam. It is up to us as Uncle Sam to get rid of thafboarder" cow. Considering the future the only solution seems to be a constitu - tional amendment giving the federal government the right to tax state and local securities, and giving the states the right to tax federal bonds. That seems like locking the garage door after the car is stolen because such an amendment will not affect any of the tax-exempt bonds already issued. However, there will be a material reduction in the amount outstanding in 1926 when exemptions on part of the war loan issues expire. Secretary Mellon states that fifty per cent of the outstanding state and municipal securities will expire within twenty years. Conse - quently a constitutional amendment, while not immediately effective, will safeguard the future. Congress has been considering such a step for a number of years, but it has not as yet submitted the proposition to the states for ratification. Our procedure in amending the Con - stitution is slow, so no immediate relief is in sight. Tax Exemption Antagonistic to Progressive Taxation LWe, in the United States, have adopted the principle of progressive ition, which is based upon "ability to pay." We have, as a "hang - over" from the past, the practice of exempting governmental securities from taxation. These two policies — the progressive rates on income and tax exemption of securities — are entirely antagonistic. One must be kept, the other must be abandoned. Progressive taxation has been adopted in other countries, so it will not likely be the policy abandoned, unless we wish to take a step backward. Talk, alone, will not solve the dilemma, though it may call the matter to your attention. Action is necessary. I believe it was Mark Twain who made this remark: "Everybody talks about the weather, but no one ever seems to do anything about it." Is it as hopeless to think about changing our policy of tax-exemption as to change the weather? I </seg>

Clyde Fllley, University of Nebraska In 1914 all taxes levied in Nebraska amounted to approximately $22,500,000. In 1922 they were $53,457,481.56, an increase of about 138 per cent. The ordinary receipts of the federal government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1912, were $691,778,465; for the year ending June 30. 1920, they were $6,695,374,767; and for the year ending June 30, 1923, they were approximately $4,000,000,000. The national debt increased from less than a billion dollars in 1913 to $26,594,000,000 August 31, 1919. It was $21,589,160,000 upon December 31, 1923. Debts for Civic Improvements Increased Fortunately the Nebraska constitution forbids the issuing of state bonds, so that our state debts are limited to occasional deficits in some of the funds. Many other states are not so fortunately situated, and have increased their bonded indebtedness for various purposes within recent years. A few Nebraska counties have issued bonds within the past ten years for the building of court houses and other improvements. Cities have bonded themselves since 1916 with apparently little regard for the day of payment. Miles of paving have been laid, sewer systems installed, water plants enlarged, and other public improvements made on a scale never before equalled. School districts which got along with inadequate buildings and equipment for many years when good build - ings could be erected comparatively cheap, suddenly awoke to the desire for something better and since 1919 have been making improvements at a rapid rate, and issuing bonds in payment for almost the entire cost. The total bonded indebtedness of the counties and their various subdivisions is more than 86 million dollars. This is not an argument against the paving, sewer systems, drainage districts and school houses. The fact is that nearly all these improvements were needed long before the need was recognized. I simply want to call attention to the debts incurred in making these improvements. While the debts already contracted are being paid we can hardly expect taxes to reach the levels of pre-war years. Demand for Public Service Is Increasing More services are being performed at public cost than ever before and the number of these services is more apt to increase than decrease. Most of us, for example, would much rather pay our share of the cost of the state and national pure food laws than to take for granted that the foods we buy of our regular dealer contain so benzoate of soda, </seg>
            <seg id="p234">234 BEPOBT Or ifEBBASKA STATE BOARD OF AGMCULTUBE and that all packaged foods are true to the label, both aa to composition and quantity. Some of us would like to see a truth in fabric law passed that would protect us from adulterations in cloth in the same way that we are protected from adulteration in food. Of course it would cost money, but we believe it would be worth the cost. We would not wish to substitute private schools for our public schools or even to limit the work done in the public schools to the mere essentials of reading, writing and arithmetic. Many necessary services can be rormed by the public much better and cheaper than we can perform i as individuals. The distribution of the cost is another matter. Even before the public performed so many services with the result - ant increase in taxes there was a very general desire to pass on the cost of government to some one else. That effort has increased with the rise in public expenditures and as a result it behooves all of us to study tax laws and the distribution of tax burden. Should Pay Our Debts As We &lt;io One of the most popular methods of escaping the payment of high taxes is to pass on the burden of improvement cost or other unusual expense to some future generation. To state it mildly this is poor finance. It is sometimes said that only cowards fail to meet their moral responsibilities. Certain it is that in the United States each generation has had its own war for which to pay. and the supply of school houses court houses, paved streets and improved roads has never quite kept pace with the demand. Personally, I am not in favor of any very large decrease in federal taxes until our war debt is more nearly paid. It must be paid some - time and it ought to be paid by the present generation, that is within the next twenty or thirty years. So far from agreeing with the poli - ticians who censure the government for having kept in force a tax law that provided a larger revenue than needed for current expenses. I feel that it is our duty to insist that Congress provide sufficient revenues to permit a gradual payment of our national debt. We should not shift the payment of the obligation incurred in our day to our children and grandchildren. Revenue Laws Allow Tax Evasion* L There is unquestionably a need for amendment in our revenue s. Mr. Hedges has already pointed out how many very wealthy persons are escaping the payment of their fair share of the income tax. Whatever taxes they do not pay are shifted to someone else. The present law permits all sorts of evasions. Under present conditions a man with a large income subject to tax may borrow money, invest it in tax exempt securities, and deduct the interest paid from his </seg>

An amendment to the national consti - tution is necessary in order to end this and many other evasions from which we are suffering. Amusement Tax Equitable and Useful There has been considerable demand for a repeal of those sections of the present revenue law which rquire that a tax be paid upon ad - mission to entertainments, the so-called amusement tax. If this tax is repealed, the money must be raised in some other way if the debt is to be paid. Do you know of any class who are better able to help contribute to the support of the government than the men who are willing to pay $10 or $20 or $40 for the opportunity of seeing a cham - pion or near champion boxer and his opponent give an exhibition of their ability? The leisure class, or at least well-to-do people, furnish the greater proportion of the attendance at paid entertainments, par - ticularly of those where the admittance charge is high. The tax on such admissions cannot be shifted to the person who does not attend. Of course none of us enjoy paying this tax, but just what tax do we enjoy paying? By what better means can an equivalent revenue be produced? Can we agree to the plan of the men engaged in commer - cialized amusements and shift the tax to something else? Local and SUte Taxes (an Be Controlled State and local taxes are closer to us than federal taxes, and we can have a greater influence in determining the amount of such taxes and the method of raising them. Mr. Keefe has already analyzed the tax levy in representative communities. His figures prove very clearly that a large part of the direct taxes that we pay are for local expendi - tures that are within the control of our neighbors and ourselves. The determination of how the burden of state and local taxes shall be distributed is a problem for the state legislature to determine and we can have much more influence with the state legislature than with Congress. They will ordinarily do what they believe the majority of the people wish. Taxation Rules and Distribution The first of Adam Smith's celebrated canons of taxation declares that "The subjects of every state ought to contribute toward the sup - port of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state." No rule of taxation has been more widely quoted than has this. It is today one of the standards by which the statesmen of every civilized land test the justice of tax laws. How nearly do the laws of Nebraska make practical application of this rule? Unless it is applied with a reason- </seg>
            <seg id="p236">236 RKPOBT OF NEBIASKA STATE BOABD OT AGBICULTUBE able degree of accuracy there should be a change in our tax laws that would shift the burden and make for more equitable distribution. The money raised for state uses by the 1921 levy came from the following sources and in the following proportions: Percentage Analysis 1. Farm lands represent 56.08% Farm personal property represents. 7.95-, All other property represents 47% .47% 100.00% Farm Taxation It is readily seen that by far the largest source of revenue for the state is the direct tax on farm land. Next in importance is real estate in incorporated cities and villages. The farm personal property has a slightly lower value than the personal property in towns. The total state tax paid by farm property is about two and one-half times the total state tax paid by all the real estate and personal property located within the limits of incorporated towns. As Dr. Virtue has explained, a tax on railroads is reflected in their rates and is therefore actually paid, in part at least, by the patrons of the railroads. The freight charges on goods shipped into Nebraska is shifted to the person who consumes the goods; at least a part of the freight paid on farm products shipped out of Nebraska is subtracted from the price paid the farmer for his products. The farmer in all probability pays about half of the taxes assessed against the railroads. In the final analysis the owners of farm property in Nebraska doubtless pay about 70 per cent of the cost of operating the state government, and the owners of other prop - erty pay only about 30 per cent. Do the farmers receive 70 per cent of the income? If not, then they are contributing more than their just share to the revenues of the state. Probably there is no one who is at all conversant with Nebraska conditions who would maintain that the income derived from farming and the ownership of farm land has equaled in any one year of the last four the income received by Nebraskans from other sources. It therefore seems self evident that farm property is overtaxed under Total Farm Property 64.03% 64.03% City real estate represents 16.89% City personal property represent*. 8.70% Total City Property 25.59% 25.59% ;.

Unfortunately we are not as well supplied with figures as to the amount of income as upon taxes paid. Exact records upon a small number of Nebraska farms indicate that, the farmers pay taxes equiva - lent to a gross income tax of about five per cent. In recent years many farmers have had no net income and in numerous other instances the taxes have equaled from 25 to 50 per cent of the net income. If a city resident with an income of $2,000 paid an income tax of 25 per would be need for a Faneuil Hall on city property of a given value farm property of the same value incident to the service furnished cent or even at half that rate there in every village in the land. Taxes should be normally higher than on because of the higher rate of levy, in a city which the farmer must provide for himself. The landlord who rents his Nebraska farm does not escape either the assessor or the tax gatherer. Upon a Gage County farm for which I have exact records of all expenses and income from 1908 to 1922 inclusive, the taxes paid were equivalent to an income tax of nearly 17 per cent. As a matter of course this discrimination results from relying too largely upon the general property tax as a means of providing revenue. Farm land is in plain sight and comparatively easy to assess. Un - fortunately for the farmer his land is so desirable an investment that a sale value is placed upon it which permits of the return of a com - paratively low rate of income upon the investment. In pre-war years this was about 3 ft per cent but for the past four years has been considerably lower. Fig. 5 — About 77 Per Cent of the Nebraska Real Estate Tax is Levied on Farm Property </seg>

The farmer's horses, cattle, ■ and even chickens are always In evidence and cannot escape the attention of even the most absent minded assessor. He may under - value them, it is true, and usually does, but if the value falls too far below the normal level, the state board of equalization may be relied upon to give a helping hand. The average assessor knows about what machinery is required to operate a farm and the dishonest farmer knows that the assessor knows. As a result farm machinery is aasescd, although at a relatively lower value than farm live stock. tThe personal property in a city, even aside from intangibles, is easy to assess. What assessor is able to tell the value of a stock goods, of materials in the process of manufacture, of the jewelry and fine clothing that is not in sight, of furniture, house furnishings and the thousand and one other possessions of a complex luxury loving civilisation? Hard to Establish Equitable Values We find also that while farm real estate pays such a large part of the state tax, about 56 per cent, that it is not all assessed upon the same basis of value. This is, of course, due in part to the number of assessors on the job, and the lack of a strong centralized authority to supervise their work. For example, in 1920 local assessors gave the land of Butler County an average assessed value of $21.06 per acre and of Coif ax County an average value of $31.99. The State Board of Equalization raised the valuation in Butler County to $25.27 per acre, and lowered the valuation in Colfax County to $26.49 per acre. According to the local assessors the difference in value was nearly 50 per cent, while according to the State Board it was only about 5 per cent. Does anyone here know the exact difference in value? The centralization of all power to assess property in the hands of a single state official would doubtless free us of a part of the present inequality of assessment. No man, however efficient, can know the actual value of all real estate in a state as large as Nebraska and with land that varies in value because of fertility, rainfall and location. In his Essays on Taxation, Seligman says, "We cannot tax all property alike because it is humanly impossible under modern condi - tions to reach all property alike; and if we do reach all property alike, the modern social effects of taxation are such that we should not be putting an equal burden upon the property owners because we should then be hitting the wrong man. Until we recognize the fact that under modern conditions to tax the property is not, in many cases to reach the owner of the property, no solution of the problem can be attained." </seg>

The reparation of state and local revenues permits each locality to raise its revenues by assessing the ocal property in a way that seems fair. The state revenues should be derived from other sources than a general property tax. If we are to tax railroads, express com - panies, telegraph and telephone lines, ind other public service cor - porations that serve the people of the state as a whole, the revenue derived should unquestionably go to the state as a whole. In almost any part of the state may be found two adjoining rural school districts of approximately equal size, but with very different tax rates for school purposes. A stranger might think that one district had poorer land or wanted a better school. Investigation will usually show that the district with a low rate is traversed by a railroad and the adjoining district has none. The obvious remedy is to give the railway tax to the state and relieve other property to that extent. An Income Tax Is Fair A graduated income tax is one of the fairest of taxes. It is levied in proportion to the ability to pay. It cannot be passed on to someone else. Unlike the general property tax it does not penalize the thrifty and relieve the waster or bear down heavily on the land owner and relieve the bond holder. An income tax should go in part to the state. Of course a state income tax cannot be high else wealth and popula - tion will cross state lines. Pay For Service Rendered Another method that has been used successfully is to make property receiving special service pay for that special service. For example, the fire insurance companies of Nebraska pay all the expense of the State Fire Inspector's office, and find it a good investment. The fees paid for testing oil pay all expense connected with testing. Doubtless this cost is passed on to the consumer, but he is the man whom the test protects and should pay for the benefit received. The Uasoline Tax One variation of this plan adopted in many progressive states is the so-called gasoline tax. As everyone knows the federal government has appropriated money for use in building permanent roads. One of the conditions attached to the use of the money in any state is that the state shall appropriate a like amount. There are no strings attached as to how the state shall secure its share of the money. It may be raised by taxing the teamster's horses, the poor man's cottage, the farmer's hogs and the land of everyone without regard to the use that these property owners make of the roads. A tax on gasoline </seg>
            <seg id="p240">240 ■EPOBT OF HEBftASKA STATE BOARD OF AGUCULTVBE of one or two cents a gallon puts a part of the burden equally on the backs of those who derive the most benefit from improved highways. Better yet, it taxes them in almost direct proportion to the use they make of the roads, because road use is fairly proportionate to the amount of gasoline consumed. The city Joy rider who has little prop - erty that the assessor can see, now burns up the road at the expense of the taxpayer who, as I have already stated, is very largely the farmer. The gasoline tax would place the burden where it properly belongs. About the only important objection made to the gasoline tax is that it would bear down heavily upon the tenant farmer. It would actually increase his taxes little if any. A car of the type that most of us who have little property are compelled by necessity to drive will travel about 20 miles on one gallon of gas. If a man lives 5 miles from town and makes a trip to town every other day his consumption of gasoline would be only about 100 gallons each year. At 2 cents per gallon his tax would be only $2.00. His personal property tax would be relieved by decreasing the amount which he now pays to the state road fund. I have been informed that Pennsylvania levies a tax of ten cents upon each ton of hard coal mined in the state. Pennsylvania con - sumers naturally pay a part of this tax. They can, however, well afford to pay it because the major part of the hard coal is consumed outside of the state. These non-resident consumers are therefore paying a part of Pennsylvania's cost of government and relieve to that extent the taxes paid by the residents of that state. About the same situation exists in Nebraska so far as the farmer and the gasoline tax is concerned. More Than 60 per cent of the ears are owned by residents of incorporated towns and a very considerable percentage of these car owners pay very little direct taxes. Tourists also use our roads and there would seem to be no reason why they should not make some contribution to our road funds. The farmer can well afford to shift the state tax for roads to the people who derive the most benefit. Host car drivers will pay willingly, because good roads give economy in motor driving. Summary The following summary may be made of some of the outstanding features of the tax problem in so far as it affects farmers: 1. Taxes — federal, state and local, — have increased rapidly within the past ten years. This is due in part to the cost of the war, in part to the rise in the general price level, and in part to an increase in governmental activities. 2. Federal taxes must remain high for several years unless the payment of the war debt is to be shifted to future generations. Local </seg>

Tbe tendency of the time is to increase rather than decrease governmental activities. 3. There is a very general desire to escap* paying taxes. Numerous loopholes are being found to evade payment of the federal income tax and men with large incomes are demanding that their tax rate be low - ered. The most conspicuous method of evading the income tax is by investment in tax-free bonds. 4. In Nebraska approximately 73 per cent of the state revenues obtained by taxes is provided by a tax on real estate. About 77 per rent of this real estate tax is levied on farm property. This places upon agriculture a tax burden that is not in proportion to either agricultural population or agricultural income. 5. The following methods have been suggested for equalizing the burden of state taxes: (a) Turn to the state government all taxes paid by railways, telegraph and telephone lines and express companies. (b) Levy a state income tax from which a considerable part of the revenue shall be paid to the state. (c) Place a tax upon gasoline fo» providing state aid road funds. 8. Study tax systems and all tax proposals in order to prevent a further shifting of the tax burden upon agriculture, and to provide for an equalizing of the burden which bears down more heavily upon agriculture than upon the people in any other occupation. Mr. B. Wolph, Nehawka — One thought has come to me. The ques - tion of the tax-exempt properties in this country is a question which we have been considering in a small way for several years. I am not one of those who think that the man who puts his money into those tax-exempt properties is a traitor to his country or trying to get out of paying his taxes. The government and the state and municipalities have been opening the way for him to do that and we can't blame him for doing it. I think, however, that the time has come when the issuance of tax-free securities should end. In justice to all former ways of doing business we can't shut a man out from enjoying his former investments, but through Congress and the different legislatures we can put an end to the issuance of securities the income from which is tax-exempt. I think it would be better for us as taxpayers when we, as a state or as a government, want to borrow money to go on the strength of our integrity and honesty and our assets and borrow it as the business men do from the people who have It to loan. In the end I believe it would be better and cheaper for us. And another thing, the man who is putting millions into tax-free bonds is not putting in his dally living, but a big surplus. I would give him the surplus. </seg>

Today is the day we are considering. We are beginning to aec the fruitage of this thing today. When we start a thing we must remember that some day it is coming to a larger growth and may develop a tendency that is praiseworthy or it may develop a great deal of trouble. And that is one thing that has come to pass from that which the government inaugurated a number of years ago. In the old country this has been the source of a great deal of feeling between the classes, the very rich and the very poor people. And there will be very hard feelings and it may develop anarchism or socialism, things that mean war or trouble to this whole country. I believe from my own investigation and conviction that every man here, whether he stands on the ground or is 'way up in the air with his millions, should put his shoulder to the wheel, according to his ability, and support the government, and should assist in working out a system of taxation where each will bear his fair share of his expensse of that government. I. D. Evans — In view «f the figures given by Mr. Pilley, showing the proportion of the state tax paid by farmers, I wonder how that can be made to tally with the decision of the Supreme Court the other day by which it determined that the farm lands were under-valued and the railroads were 1 over-valued. I would like to have Mr. Filley explain, if he can, how these two questions can be successfully ex - plained. Mr. Filley — I do not think that these figures affect the logic of that decision of the Supreme Court. We raise no part of our state revenue from a tax on incomes. It nearly all comes from the tax on real property. For example, a man living in Lincoln may have an income of $5,000 a year and live in an apartment house. Let us sup - pose that he owns no taxable property except an automobile and his household furniture. He may save money and invest it in tax-free bonds. He, therefore, really pays but very little to the support of the state government, even admitting that the tax on the portion of the house he occupies is included in his rent. We are raising our revenues largely from farm lands, and some from personal property and a small proportion from the railroad. A Member — I do not understand the logic. The taxes must be paid from income or they must be levied on capital. I understand our farm lands are valued below other groups. We must take into con - sideration the income that those lands produce. And that should be placed as the income value of the farm. Mr. Filley — The trouble is that It ia not possible to tax all capital or to tax it equally, and that income It not considered. </seg>
            <seg id="p243">KKPOKT OF XKBRAKKA STATE BOARD OT A0BI01LTURK 243 Mr. Aye — I would like for Mr. Fill»y to tell us what is the single tax. Mr. Filley — A single tax is a tax raised upon any one article or in any one way. The single tax as generally advocated is a tax on land value; that is, it is proposed that we raise all our revenue, local, state and national, by taxing land values. The general theory is that if such a system had been started when land was relatively low in price we would keep increasing the tax as the productive power of the land increased so the land would have very little sale value. In other words, taxes would consume all or practically all of the economic rent of the land. Let us suppose that a lot on O street is leased under our present system for (1,000 a month. Under the single tax system the tax on the land would take practically all of the $1,000 so that there would be little object in owning land. It would produce little, if any, net revenue and might become a distinct liability as the taxes could easily amount to more than the revenue produced by the land. In fact, where a modified single tax program was put in effect in some of the Canadian provinces a few years ago, many lots in some of the cities were abandoned by their owners because the taxes were larger than the site value. To put the single tax in force at this time and raise all our revenues from land would mean that we would confiscate the value of the land. An argument for inaugurating a single tax on land at the present time is essentially an argument for the confiscation of land values. President — We are to have the pleasure this afternoon of listening to a man from another institution. A man who was appointed last July by Secretary Wallace on the Agricultural Outlook Committee for the purpose of investigating the supply of corn, hogs and wheat; he being appointed on the wheat committee. Professor Grimes is from the Kansas Agricultural College at Manhattan, Kansas, and it gives me great pleasure to introduce him to you this afternoon. THE WHEAT PROBLEM Professor W. E. Grimes, Manhattan, Kansas Kansas State Agricultural College I have been sitting through your meetings listening with a great deal of interest to what is said and the things you are thinking about and the ways in which you are approaching the problems that con - front you, and I want to say that our problems in Kansas are similar to your problems and our approach is similar to your approach. I was interested in the tax problem which Professor Filley presented here </seg>
            <seg id="p244">244 RKPOBT OF NEBRASKA .STATE BOARD OF AURICIJ.TI Rfc and we have a similar program. We also have the problem of getting taxes assessed according to ability to pay. In Kansas we hav« the problem of the Incomes on gas, coal and some such things, and our problem is to get the incomes from those commodities up to where they will bear their fair share of the tax burden. We perhaps have gone one step further than you have gone in that; we have worked out a program which will tend to shift all state taxes off of general property and on to other sources, and that program has been adopted by our state organization. The State Farm Bureau requested that we present that program and we did so and it was adopted and they are actively pushing it as part of their work during the coming year. When I heard you discussing tax problems you hit a responsive cord with me and I wish you well id following it and it will come, as Mr. Keefe brought out this morning, through studying and letting the tax payers know what they are doing. And that is just what such a meeting as you have here will do. But in my remarks I am to break the program somewhat and go into another problem, one that to Kansas farmers is very vital, the wheat problem, but it is vital to perhaps a fewer Wheat Farmer In Difflcultiew The financial difficulties of farmers in the wheat belt have been steadily increasing during the last three years. Beginning in 1920 the price of wheat and many other products fell precipitously. This in itself was a serious problem since it meant paying off debts with products worth much less than when the debts were contracted. But this was not all for the wheat farmer. His difficulties were further increased by the fact that the price of wheat fell further and longer than the prices of many other commodities. Falling further than other commodities, the ability of wheat to purchase other commodities 2. was less than before. A bushel of wheat purcnased less labor, twine' and other materials and paid less on threshing bills, taxes, and grocery bills. At present approximately 150 bushels of wheat are required to purchase the same commodities that 100 bushels would buy in the period from 1910 to 1914. In 1913 the farmer in the winter wheat belt could buy a suit of clothes with about 20 bushtls of wheat. In 1923 more than 30 bushels of wheat were required to buy the same suit of clothee. A wagon that would have been bought for 125 bushels of wheat in 1913 now costs more than 175 bushels. This means that the wheat farmers' income has not only declined in terms of money but that it has declined in its ability to buy commodities produced by others. With these changes in Income came greater difficulties in meeting interest payments, taxes and other fixed expenses. The debts of the wheat farmer have tended to increase. Taxes on farm real estate and other farm property have become delinquent to a greater degrer </seg>
            <seg id="p245">BEPOBT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOABO OF AGBICULTUB.I: 245 than in recent years and the standards of living on the farm* of the wheat belt have been lowered. Such is the situation that faces the wheat grower at the beginning of 1924. As he looks into the future he is concerned to know if the distress of the last few years is to continue or if changes are to be expected which will result in improvement in the situation. For - tunately there is information available which, if correctly understood and properly interpreted, will indicate the probable future trend in wheat production i«.nd the ways in which we can most reasonably expect to secure improvement. With this information available and utilized it is not necessary that we produce blindly hoping that conditions will change without our taking any steps which will tend to influence these conditions. Wheat a World Crop Wheat is produced and consumed in practically every country in the world. This fact is of particular significance to the wheat grower of the wheat belt since we are producing more wheat than we consume in this country. Our surplus goes into the world market and sells on that market at whatever price it will bring. The effect of this Is to make the selling price in the world market the price which the entire crop of the United States tends to bring. Any constructive measures designed to help the wheat farmer must take into account the world supply of and the demand for wheat. This must be done so long as we remain a wheat exporting nation and the indications are that we shall probably continue to be a factor in the world market for many years. The soil and climate of the middle west are particularly adapted to the growth of wheat and it usually pays better than most other com - modities which can be grown in this region. World Supply and Demand Since the United States is a factor in the world market for wheat and our prices are largely determined by prices in the world market, it behooves us to consider the world situation both from the standpoint of supply and of demand. The world supply of wheat may be considered under two heads, first, the production in the principal exporting countries of the world. These are the countries with which the United States is competing. Canada, Argentina, Australia, and India are our most important com - petitors in the world wheat market. The second phase of the world supply of wheat deals with the production in those countries where our wheat is marketed, in other words the principal importing coun - tries. The principal importing countries are the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands. </seg>
            <seg id="p246">246 1— I Or NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGBJCl 1.TIRE Looking at the supply in the principal exporting countries (United States, Canada, Argentina, Australia, and India), we find that the acreage of wheat has been materially increased since 1909. In 1909 these countries were producing slightly more than 98 million acres of wheat. In 1923 they were producing just a little less than 137 million acres, an increase of more than 38 million acres. This increase in wheat acreage has increased the competition in the world wheat market. Fig. 6 — Farmers on High Priced Corn Belt Land Must Compete with Wheat Fanners on Cheap Western and Northern Land Where Large Acreages May Be Handled. Wheat Production in North America The United States' acreage has increased from about 44 million acres to 58 million acres during this period. In Canada, the area has increased from seven and three-fourths million acres to more than 22 million acres or nearly three times as much in 1923 as in 1909. Can - ada is developing new lands in the three prairie provinces of Mani - toba, Alberta, and Saskatchewan. These three provinces grow more than 90% of all the wheat produced in Canada and the 10-year, 1913-1922 average yields are more than 15 bushels for each of these provinces. With their high yields, cheap lands and high quality of wheat, the wheat producers of Canada have decided advantages over the wheat farmer of the United States. They can profitably sell on a lower market since their costs are less than ours. Also, it should be remembered, that Canadian wheat is usually hard spring wheat and this grade of wheat is more in demand for milling purposes than the hard winter wheats of Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p247">BCTOBT Or ifEBBASKA 8TATE BOARD OF A6KICULTURE 247 Foreign Wheat Production Argentina, Australia, and India have all increased their wheat production since the close of the war. Production in these three coun - tries was not stimulated by the war to any material extent. They are far from England and France and ships were not available to send to these countries to secure their supply of wheat. Australia was a notable sufferer in this regard and it was said that at the end of the war she had huge supplies of wheat which she had been unable to sell since none of the Allies had sufficient ships to spare to make so long a journey. These three countries are now competing with us and competing under conditions where their costs of production are lower than ours. Russia was not mentioned as one of the principal exporting coun - tries. In pre-war times Russia was one of the most important wheat producing and exporting countries. With the Russian revolution in 1917 and the subsequent reign of Bolshevism, Russia dropped out of all world markets. She did not return to the world wheat market until late in 1922 and early in 1923 when limited quantities of bread grains (wheat and rye) were exported from Russia. Conditions in Russia have been improving and she has exported more wheat since the harvest of her 1923 crop than she bad exported during the entire previous year. Since August 1st the Russian exports of wheat have totaled considerably more than 10 million bushels. It is to be expected that these exports will continue even though some of the people of Russia do not have a sufficient supply of wheat. The Russian govern - ment feels the need of establishing contacts with the rest of the world and this is best done through International trade. Wheat is one of the few products which she can place on the world market. Con - sequently, Russia is quite anxious to export wheat. Roumania and Bulgaria are also countries to be considered in the export market and they are slowly but surely coming back in wheat production. Keen Competition in Wheat Exports Competition in the exporting countries of the world is more severe than it has been for many years. While the United States has been contracting her wheat acreage since 1919 the other exporting countries have been increasing theirs and their increase has practically equaled the decrease in our acreage. Furthermore, these exporting countries are producing under conditions more favorable to the individual farmer than is the case with the farmer of the United States. For example, the farm lands of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta were valued at $32, (24, and $21 per acre respectively in 1914. In 1922 the land values of the same provinces were $32, $28, and $24 per acre re - spectively. In Manitoba land values were the same in 1922 as in </seg>
            <seg id="p248">248 BEFOBT Or IfnBASKA STATE BOARD OF AGEICULTTBX 1914 and in the other provinces the increase was slight. During this same time the value of farm land in Nebraska increased from $74 to $90 an acre and in 1920 was valued at $135 an acre. It should be remembered that many debts were contracted on the basis of land at the higher valuations and these debts present a serious problem to the farmer who hopes to be able to pay them off. Lower land values and other advantages make it possible for the farmers in these other countries to produce more economically and sell at a better advantage on a lower world wheat market than can the farmer of the winter wheat belt. These are facts to which we must give careful considera - tion if the United States is to continue to produce more wheat than can be consumed within this country. What Is the Demand for Wheat? I The other side of the supply question deals with the. production the principal countries buying our wheat. The more wheat they produce within their own borders, the less wheat we can sell them. At the close of the war the principal importing nations were sadly in need of our wheat since their own production had declined con - siderably. The five principal importing countries are the United King - dom, Italy, Germany, France, and the Netherlands. With the excep - tion of the Netherlands, all of the countries were participants in the world war and their agriculture was very seriously deranged by it. In the period from 1909 up to the outbreak of the war. these coun - tries were uniformly producing about 34 &gt;/4 million acres of wheat. The war reduced their wheat production and in 1917 they were producing less than 27 million acres. Since then, however, they have been bring - ing land slowly back into wheat production and increasing their domes - tically produced supply of wheat. The wheat acreage was decreased nearly 8 million acres in these five countries, but by 1923 about 5 million acres of the decreased acreage had been brought back into wheat production so that the total acreage in 1923 was near 31 millions of acres. In other words, we are not only meeting more severe com - petition from our competitors among exporting nations, but the im - porting nations, who are our principal wheat customers, are growing more of their own supplies and consequently buying less of our wheat. From the standpoint of the supply of wheat we find that world production has been increased and increased materially. Competition to sell wheat in the world market is keener than for many years. This is well illustrated by our own experiences in the last four or five months when our wheat exports have materially decreased and the exports from some of the other wheat exporting countries have increased by approximately the amount of the decrease in our exports. The situation is further emphasized by the fact that the world wheat crop produced in 1923 was the largest produced in the last eight years. </seg>
            <seg id="p249">249 On the demand side the problem may be divided into two parti. First, that of the demand for wheat within the United States, and second, the demand in the importing countries which are our customers in the wheat market. Domestic Demand For Wheat Looking at the demand within the United States, we find that the American people have been consuming as large quantities of food products as at any time in their history. In the industries unemploy - ment has been very low. Most people have been employed and have been in a position to buy all of the food which they wanted. The situation is well illustrated by the fact that in the six months period ending September 15, 1923, there were 953 wage increases among skilled laborers in the United States and but three decreases in wages during the same time. In other words the demand for skilled labor was intense and all who wanted to work were employed at wages which tended to increase. Such a condition Is conducive to maximum con - sumption and all of the facts available indicate that the consumption of food products has been at a maximum. The present outlook does not indicate that this consumption can be expected to increase. As a matter of fact all that can be hoped for is that it will continue at the high level attained during 1923. However, any slackening in industry with increased unemployment will probably reduce the immediate demands for farm products. On the other hand, this is not necessarily a bad omen to agriculture. It may be the beginning of a readjust - ment tending to place the farmer in a more favorable position. Foreign Demand for Wheat From the standpoint of foreign demand or the demand in the principal importing countries, we find the situation quite different from that prevailing in the United States and it is this foreign situation that \f dominating our wheat market. Germany has virtually collapsed. The situation in the Ruhr and the Rhine is still an unsettled quantity and one which makes the entire economic situation unsettled. Most of the nations of Europe came out of the war with depleted man power, large debts, crippled industries and depreciated currencies. All of these factors have decreased their ability to purchase commodities in the world market. Consequently, they have been reluctant cus - tomers and have bought as cheaply as possible and only such supplies as were most essential. The Tariff on Wheat Our tariff situation has further accentuated the difficulty which they have in purchasing wheat from the United States. It is always unsafe to generalize on the effect of the tariff on wheat or any other </seg>
            <seg id="p250">250 BEPOBT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD Or AGRICULTURE commodity. This is due to the fact that any bushel of wheat may not be as desirable as another bushel of wheat. There are difference, in quality and kind which materially affect the various grades of wheat This is well illustrated by the difference in the effect of the present tariff on hard spring wheat and hard winter wheat. Hard spring wheat » always much in demand for milling purposes. It is needed for blend - ing purposes and during the past year we have had too little of this grade of wheat. As a result wheat has been imported from Canada paying the thirty cents duty and thus tending to raise the price to the grower of hard spring wheat in the United States. This has been an advantage to the northern wheat growers which can be attributed directly to the operation of the tariff. But let us look at the situation with reference to the hard winter wheat which is most commonly produced in Nebraska Kansas and adjoining states. A considerable portion of this wheai is exported There is more of it available than is needed for milling purposes in the United States, and consequently no premium is paid for wheat of this kind as is the case with hard spring wheat. Consequently the tariff on wheat has not operated to increase the price as has been the case with the spring wheats. On the other hand, there is yet another influence which the tariff has on the demand for wheat which must not be overlooked The winter wheat producer sells his wheat in the world market where protection by means of a tariff does not affect the price of the wheat but many of the products which he buys are sold in a market that is protected. This protection is for the avowed purpose of increasing the price of these products by protecting them from the competition of foreign countries. This is true of farm mac*inery, of clothing and of many other commodities which the farmer purchases. This makes him pay higher prices for these products than would be the case if they were unprotected by the tariff while the price of hard winter wheat is not increased by the tariff. Effect of Tariff on Foreign Trade. Still another evidence of the effect of the tariff is found in the ability of foreign nations to purchase our commodities If they pur - chase our wheat, it must be paid for with goods which they produce The goods which they wish to exchange for wheat must be sold at a Price that is far enough below the American price to equal the amount of the tariff on those commodities. If they do not sell at a price that is low, it would be unprofitable to bring them into the United States pay the tariff on them and sell at a price that would not equal the cost of the goods plus the tariff. This makes it more difficult for European nations to purchase United States wheat since our tariff tends to depress the price of things they have to sell, making them five more of their products for a bushel of wheat. Consequently, </seg>
            <seg id="p251">251 REPORT OF NKBBASKA STATE BOARD OF AORICVI.TVBE they buy fewer bushels from us and possibly turn to some other source of wheat. Such is the situation so far as it relates to foreign demand. It ia to be expected that conditions in Europe will slowly improve, but pronounced improvement in the next year or two is not to be expected. Europe is recovering from a serious disarrangement of her economic regime which may be likened unto a serious illness of a person. Re - covery is slow and painful and requires a considerable time. These nations of Europe have attempted to hasten recovery by means of artificial stimulii such as depreciated currencies and price fixing. The net rseult of most of these measures has been to retard recovery and accentuate the difficulties which it was hoped these measures would remove. From the standpoint of demand we cannot hope for an aggregate demand materially greater than that existing at present. The ques - tion of the demand for wheat is one which is beyond the control of the individual farmer or the farmers of any one region. The farmers' situation may be improved chiefly through changes in supply which at the present time should be in the nature of reduced production, and secondly, by improving the conditions under which American farmers are producing, thus permitting (hem to produce more economically. What Is the Solution of Wheat Problem? Various solutions of the situation have been offered. Programs for the reduction of acreage have been advocated. It has been sug - gested that farmers secure a monopoly of their product and thus con - trol price. Still a further suggestion has been price fixing which occa - sionally is presented in its more subtle form of control of the ex - portable surplus through an export commission. The tariff has also been suggested but the preceding discussion of the effect of the tariff on winter wheat shows the futility of hoping for improvement from this source. Price Fixing Attempts at price fixing date back more than 3,000 years and the almost uniform experience has been that they have ended disastrously for the people whom they were designed to help. Where an increased price was secured production increased and accentuated the situation which was causing the low price, i. e., production in excess of the demands of the market. Price fixing in any form cannot be expected to help in the present dffficulty. Cooperative Marketing Cooperative marketing offers opportunities for improvement. This is particularly true if it is conducted along sound business lines with - out undue hopes of controlling price through a monopoly. A true </seg>
            <seg id="p252">252 befobt or Nebraska state boabd or agbict'lti'be monopoly must control the present and immediate future supply of a commodity. This is impossible in wheat so that it is imposaible to secure more than a temporary monopoly. On the other hand co - operative marketing of wheat which will eliminate some of the present inefficiency of the marketing system and give the growers some of the compensation for services now performed by others will help the farmer. On the other hand it must be remembered that wheat is about as efficiently marketed as any of our farm products. Freight Ra&lt;«a Reduced freight rates on wheat will help and permit the farmer to market his products more advantageously. At the present time freight rates on wheat are somewhat higher than rates on other com - modities and this tends to accentuate the difficulties of the wheat farmer. Adjustment of Taxes A more equitable distribution of the tax burden with less of it falling on farm real estate and more of the burden being borne accord - ing to relative ability to pay will further improve conditions. Farmers should be much interested in programs for tax reforms since they are now bearing more than their share of the tax burden. Acreage Adjustment Still further improvement in the situation may be secured by changes in conditions on the farms growing wheat. This is probably the most important from the standpoint of the individual farmer Fw. 7— A Combine at Work in Kimball County In Western Nebraska </seg>
            <seg id="p253">Bcrorr or nebbaska state boabd or aobicultvee 253 since it is the means of improvement which is most completely under control. A farm business is a combination of enterprises such as wheat, corn, alfalfa, and the various classes of livestock. That combination is most desirable which will give the greater return for the farmer's resources. Too many of our farms have been depending on wheat to too great an extent. By combining feed crops and livestock with wheat it is possible to utilize farm resources, such as labor, work horses and machines at times when they are not employed in wheat production. A return for these resources from crops and livestock which do not seriously interfere with wheat production will increase the net income from these farms. Another way of expressing it, is that the cost of production is lowered because the fixed expenses of maintaining work horses, machinery and other farm equipment is distributed over a greater quantity of products, thus resulting In a lower cost to each product. These lower costs afford opportunity for increased profits. Still another possible way of meeting the situation is through the adoption of better practices, better seed and better livestock wherever it is possible to do so. Improved seed usually brings in far greater returns than the increased cost of the better seed. Those practices which increase yields do not usually increase costs so much as the increased yield is worth. These questions, such as better organizations of the farm business, better utilization of farm labor, work horses and machinery, and the use of better methods, and practices are within the control of the individual farmer and are the things that are most important in improving the situation. However, we should not belittle the im - portance of cooperative marketing, of cheaper transportation, of better foreign markets, or of reduced taxation. These are matters that can be accomplished through group action and matters that should be given attention. But at the same time we must not neglect the other side which is the personal responsibility of the individual farmer in organizing and operating his farm business as efficiently and econom - ically as he can. A Member — You speak of a man who had 450 acres of dry land in western Kansas and the boys and the teams with which to operate it. You said if he got 90 cents for his wheat he would come out all right. I would like to know if there is one year in ten in western Kansas when wheat will bring 90 cents. Mr. Grime* — Our farmers in western Kansas have been getting 90 cents right along for several years, and he figured if he could get 90 cents he would be all right. If he got something less than that and had a good yield he would probably come out all right anyhow. It was not the question of whether wheat was worth that or would be worth that, but that is the amount he had in mind. </seg>
            <seg id="p254">254 A Member — How much do you expect to increase the price of wheat by cooperative marketing? Mr. Grimes — That is a very difficult question to answer, and a question which other speakers on your program will discuss. I can only give you my own opinion. I think we perhaps can effect the price in several ways. In the first place we can increase the efficiency with which services are performed. Ownership of wheat while it is being transported from one place to another ought to be cooperative and we should make a saving there. Then we can plan on changing the grade and that will give an opportunity for an increased income to the farmers. The question of cooperative marketing is one that is difficult to talk about because we usually begin at fhe wrong end. Orderly marketing of wheat begins with its moving into consumptive channels. Now the Nebraska and Kansas farmers market about 60 per cent of their wheat in the three months following harvest, but as a matter of fact we are throwing this wheat in the market at a time when the world needs it. That is not entirely true but the oppor - tunities for cooperative marketing are not as great there as they seem at first thought. I have not much faith in our being able to increase the general price level of wheat through cooperative marketing. I think it will be through savings made between the final price and the price the farmer gets. A Member — Has not the cost of cooperative marketing been greater than any other method of marketing wheat? Professor Grimes — I think not. We have had many experiments in that direction but if we take the cooperative marketing through the elevators it is an economic way of doing it. I believe you have had in mind the immense problems that we have in the D. S. Grain Growers, Incorporated. That is a great experiment and I think there are possibilities in an organization of that kind; but in a small or - £Hniz&amp;tion for ro Ark£timr whp&amp; t it is bound to b© oxiw nsi vf* </seg>

Zook, North Platte Station The topic before us, upon which I am granted the privilege of opening the discussion is in the form of a question, "What crops shall we grow if we reduce our wheat acreage?" I do not promise that it will not remain a question when I have finished. The first part of the question is in a measure already answered. The wheat acreage in Nebraska is to some extent, and for the present at least, reduced. The "if" might therefore have been left out and the question been made to read, "What crops shall we grow since our wheat acreage is re - duced?" Relative Acreage of Nebraska Crops As a basis for the general consideration of the problem, it will be of interest to review briefly the relations of the acreages of the chief crop with which Nebraska agriculture is concerned. According to the statistics of the State Department of Agriculture and the Fed - eral Bureau of Crop Estimates the acreages of ten of the chief crops of the state for the 10-year period from 1912 to 1922 inclusive were as shown in Table 1. The per cent of the acreage of each crop to the total number of acres in cultivation is also shown.

            <seg id="p256">256 REPORT OF .NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICI I Tl RK Nebraska is fortunate, then, in having a number of crops which are adapted to her climate and soil conditions and among which she may choose in varying her cropping program, and diversifying her types and systems of farming. For the 10-year period shown in the table Nebraska maintained about a 50-50 balance in acreages between her row or intertilled crops and her small grain crops. In Kansas the ratio is about 1 to 2. In North Dakota it is about 1 to 8. It is well known that fertility is more easily maintained, crop pests and diseases are more easily controlled, and farm labor is more economically distributed, where several crops can be successfully grown and the grain crops can be alternated with intertilled crops in rotations. Ne - braska is fortunate in having conditions in much of its area which make such rotations possible. It is fortunate also in being able to grow crops which are recognized as standard, crops out of which balanced rations can be made for livestock, crops therefore which not only go well together in rotations but make possible the keeping of livestock which is the second necessary element in the maintenance of cheap fertility and the accomplishment of real diversification and permanence in agriculture. Peas, Pigs and Prosperity Out in a certain section of Colorado where field peas do well, and where the lesson in economy of harvesting the crop with livestock was learned, a slogan has been developed which runs, "Peas. Pigs, and Prosperity." Each of the words is spelled with a capital letter. They go well together, the phrase has an alluring sound and therefore a real advertising value. Down south peanuts are fed to pigs. I am not sure whether it would be proper to add the word "prosperity" to this couplet or not. We are quite certain, however, that neither of these systems make any more prosperous pork than Nebraska hogs fed on corn and alfalfa. If economic conditions make it necessary that we shall reduce, suspend, or discontinue our wheat growing program, we should take comfort in the fact that there are other lines to which we may turn, if not with full measure of profit, at least with the knowledge that our chances are as good or better than are those of the fellow somewhere else. From the figures before us (Table I) it appears that wheat is our second most important crop from the standpoint of acreages. First place is held by corn by a wide margin. Its average acreage for the 10-year period was a little more than double that of all cereal crops. This is not a mere accident, but is largely due to the fact that exper - ience has proven that corn is one of the most successful crops for practically the entire state. Yield variations arc greater in some than in other sections of the state, but these variations are no greater for corn than for other crops and corn may be classed among the state's surest and best crops. </seg>
            <seg id="p257">257 BEPOBT OF NKBKASKA 8TATB BOA El) OF AG«ICOT.TUm« Corn the Chief Crop Among the illustrations in a bulletin on Nebraska's Industries and Resources, published by the Bureau of Labor in 1902 is a picture which contains three objects. The object on the left is a sheaf of alfalfa, the one on the right is a sheaf of wheat. Between these is a very handsome child. Beneath is the legend, "Nebraska's three sure crops." No one would deny that alfalfa is one of Nebraska's surest crops and great assets. No one would reprove the tribute paid to Nebraska's children. And while the position of wheat is a little shaky just now, it must be admitted also that this crop has had a very important place in Nebraska's development. The defect in the picture, in so far as it represents Nebraska conditions, is in the fact that corn is left out of consideration. In the report which I have Just mentioned there are 64 illustrations. These show landscapes, roads, irrigation ditches, orchards, grain fields, hay fields, and many industries. Not a single one, however, shows a field, a stalk, an ear or a crib of corn. It is as free from referring in illustration to this most important Ne - braska product, as some of the later programs of the now renamed Nebraska Corn Growers Association were free from the discussion of corn. Let us not in like manner overlook corn in our consideration of crops to grow on our reduced or to be reduced wheat acreage. Corn has in the past been the main crop to the rescue when the wheat acreage has been reduced by unfavorable conditions at planting time or poor winter survival. In the present crisis also it is likely that corn will be the chief replacement crop. </seg>

            <seg id="p260">260 UETOBT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD Of AGBICULTIBE Agricultural Districts In a state as large and of aa varied conditions as are found in Nebraska it is necessary to consider various regions separately. The Bureau of Crop Estimates divides the state into nine districts, as shown on the map. The district divisions follow county lines and do not. of course, sharply separate regions in which the crops grown are dif - ferent. As shown in the table below the map, however, each district varies distinctly from the others in the proportions of the various areas of crops grown. The figures given are for the year 1920, which was an average year in acreage proportions. Taking up the districts in the order named it may be noted that the northwest district is the lowest of any in the state, excepting No. 4, in proportion of corn grown. It has the highest proportion of spring wheat, rye and alfalfa. The 10 per cent of miscellaneous crops, or crops not listed, is chiefly potatoes. District 2, has the highest proportion of corn of any in the state, less proportional amounts of spring wheat and alfalfa and more of oats than District 1. District 3, to the northeast, while having a little less per cent of its cultivated area in corn than District 2, is one of the great corn growing districts of the state. In 1920 it had more acres of corn in cultivation than Districts 1, 2, 4, and 5 combined. With this district eliminated Nebraska would be much less a corn state than the figures at the bottom of the table indicate. It also outranks all other districts in the number of acres and proportion of oats grown. The amounts of wheat, rye and barley grown are insignificant. District 4, in the west, has a low per cent of corn and a high per cent of wheat acreage. Alfalfa is well represented and the high per cent of miscellaneous crops is mostly potatoes and sugar beets. District 5, in the southwest, has more corn and less wheat than District 4, also less oats, rye, and alfalfa and more barley. The mis - cellaneous crops are chiefly sorghums. District 6, in the central part of the state, is high in corn, lower in wheat than the western districts, and higher in oats and alfalfa. District 7, in the east, has the largest amount of cultivated land of any district in the state. It had in 1920 about two acres of corn to one of wheat, about three-fourths as much oats as wheat and very little rye or barley. In Districts 8 and 9, the acreages of corn and of small grain are about equal. The proportion of wheat is higher in the south than in the southeast district and the reverse is true for oats. tThe two men who are to follow me in this discussion being both a the southeast district, we will expect some definite suggestions application there. </seg>

            <seg id="p262">262 BEPOBT Or ITEBKA8KA STATE BOARD OF AGBICULTUBE Having had a birdseye view of the distribution of major crops in the state by districts it may be of interest to examine a little farther the distribution of wheat. Figure 9 shows the number of thousands of acres of winter wheat in each county of the state in 1920. Fractions of thousands are counted as one if more than 500 acres, and as zero If less than 500 acres. Wheat Acreage Large In South Half of State Since the greater part of the wheat acreage is winter wheat it appears that the problem of reducing wheat acreages concerns chiefly the southern half of the state. The heavy acreages are nearly all in the region south of the Platte river. Some of the counties traversed by the Platte and some lying just north of it have fair acreages but wheat production in the northern half of the state is relatively in - significant. Conditions In Western Nebraska The remaining time at my disposal will be used for the discussion of conditions in Western Nebraska. As I am a resident of that part of the state and somewhat more familiar with conditions there. I think it was the intention of the program committee for me to give it my particular attention. In the 27 counties lying west of the 100th meridian, there is an area of 33,500 square miles, or something over 21 million acres. This is about 7/16 of the total land area of the state. About 1 acre in 7 is cultivated, so that this 7/16 of the state's area contains only about 1/5 of the cultivated area of the state. Briefly described, it is a region of wide horizons, of limited and variable rainfall, of extensive rather than intensive farm practices. In spite of its many tragic failures and disappointments it is nevertheless a land of many resources and great promise. Distribution of Crops The distribution of crop acreages in this section has already been given in a general way but these will bear somewhat more minute examination. Table 3 shows the ai.nual and average crop acreages for the 5 years from 1918 to 1922 inclusive, and the average percentage of each crop acreage to the total land in cultivation. Note that the com - bined acreages of winter and spring wheat slightly exceed that of corn. Note that the acreage of spring wheat in comparison with winter wheat dropped from over one-half to less than one-fifth from 1918 to 19X0. Note that the winter wheat acreage reached its highest point in 1921. The production peak was reached in 1920. Note that the corn acreage for 1922 is above that of 1921 in spite of the fact that the 1921 corn yields were very low. </seg>

The western district which was numbered 4 on the first map divides itself naturally into three subdivisions. The six counties on the east are almost wholly sand hills. This district is numbered 2 on the present map (Figure 10). As shown in the table below the map, it has a high percentage of corn, and the grain produced is chiefly rye. The district numbered 3 has a high percentage of irrigated land. Considerable corn and most of the wheat is dry farmed. The irrigated crops include alfalfa, beets, potatoes, corn, and oats. Any wheat re - duction program in this section means largely the growing of more corn or the abandonment of the land as the crops which are grown under irrigation cannot be grown successfully on dry land. District 4, is largely level table land and in this section wheat growing had, taring the war period and up to 1920, a series of re - markably successful years. Large scale operations were carried on, tractors were employed and large areas of raw land were broken out. As shown in the table, an average of 65 per cent of the cultivated area was used for wheat for the 5 years from 1918 to 1922. Similar de - velopment took place in the western counties of District 5. Beginning with 1921 the wheat industry in western Nebraska has run the full gauntlet of disasters. Crop failures are bad, price de - pressions are the same. When the two occur together the condition is worse. As indicated in table 3, the twelve counties of Districts 4 and 5 are those in which wheat growing Is of most importance.

Figures for 1923 are not available but estimates have been made and the curves extended as dotted lines. Recent Acreage and Price Fluctuations During this period the highest average acre yield of wheat was in 1919. This was 20 bushels per acre and for this an average price of $2.00 per bushel was received. This combination brought the value to the peak of $40.00 per acre. In 1920 more acres were planted. The average yield was a little less. The price broke this year but not until much of the crop was harvested. The average price received was about $1.60. The value per acre dropped somewhat but remained high. In 1920 the corn yields were high but the crop did not get onto the market In time to escape a smashing price deflation. The value per acre was therefore much below that of wheat. As a result of the 1920 experiences, more acres of wheat and less of corn were planted in 1921. This was a very disastrous year in all respects. The average yield of wheat dropped off to 12 bushels per acre. The price dropped to 85 cents. The corn yield dropped to 13 bushels and the price to 22 cents. Gross returns were much below cost of production. The following year the wheat acreage was reduced somewhat but not greatly. The fat returns of 1919 and 1920 were still fresh memories and there was high hope for their return. The corn acreage was increased somewhat. I suppose this was because the farmers did not know what else to do with the land not seeded to wheat. In 1922, corn, as we say of a sick patient, had a turn for the better. The average yield went up to 18 bushels and the price to 50 cents per bushel. Wheat on the other hand continued to grow weaker.

The value per acre was thus further depressed. The full measure of bitterness in the wheat cup was not tasted, however, until 1923. In the first place there were heavy losses from winter-killing. The crop got a weak start in the spring. Later mois - ture came In great abundance and with it the worst rust epidemic known in western Nebraska. Large percentages of that which sur - vived the winter and which promised fair yields, a few weeks before harvest was so severely hit by rust that it was not worth harvesting. The acreage harvested was low, the yield very low. Gross production was a mere fraction of that of 1920. The price continued low and the value per acre continued lower. Comeback of Corn in 1928 There is on the other hand a touch of remorse in the way corn came to the rescue of the western Nebraska farmer in 1923. Prom a sick patient in 1921, a convalescent in 1922, it became in 1923 the most robust member of the crop family. To begin with a large acreage was planted, much of the abandoned wheat acreage having been planted to corn. Nature smiled on the crop. Acre yields out-ran the highest hopes of the most optimistic promoter. The price so far has remained fair. The per acre values, while much under the wheat peak of 1919, are still sufficient to give a fair margin of profit. What of 1984? Thus do we find the stage set in western Nebraska for the season of 1924. Future courses in human events are charted out of the ex - periences of the past, but the most potent of past experiences are the most recent ones. The wheat disasters of recent years are fresh in our minds, the successes back around the corner are already dimming in memory. With wheat on the down grade no amount of argument would have kept western Nebraska farmers from planting less acreages last fall. With corn on the upgrade and a great vacancy in acreage left where, under different conditions, wheat would have been, it is inevitable that the corn acreage will be Immensely increased next spring. It is entirely possible that this will be overdone. Many farmers who a few years ago grew wheat almost exclusively are now proposing to turn entirely to corn. I have in mind a small western Nebraska town which in 1920 shipped out over a million bushels of wheat, and pro - duced scarcely enough corn for local demands. A few weeks ago I attended a corn show in that town. There was much enthusiasm over corn, and but little was being said about wheat. Some farmers and, I believe these are the wiser ones, have put in some wheat and will put in some corn In the spring. Others said they were through with wheat and were going in for corn and hogs. We wish them success, but </seg>

No one knows what future seasons hold in store. We can say with considerable assurance, however, that conditions will not remain as they were in 1923. Already we see signs which indicate a probable change. The wheat planted last fall is now In excellent condition. The supply of stored moisture is greater than in any year since 1915. With fair spring conditions a good acre yield will result. If summer condi - tions are also favorable for corn, something of a balance in wheat and corn acreages will probably be maintained in 1925. If, on the other hand, wheat yields well and corn faTls down, there will be a trend back toward the standards of earlier years. It Is not likely, however, that the parts of western Nebraska in which wheat was so extensively grown a few years ago will soon, if ever, return as ex - clusively to the growing of that crop. It is likely that the chief crop substituted will be corn.

The yields are the averages from a number of plats receiving various cultural treatments, and indicate the extent to which crops under average conditions are effected from year to year by climatic variations. The average corn yield of 21.3 bushels is made up from annual yields which range from 0 in 1913 to 47.3 bushels per acre in 1923. Yields of the other crops vary in similar proportions. The variations do not occur in .the same direction or in like degree for all crops, however. In some years such as 1915, 1919, and 1920, yields of all crops were good. In 1913, 1914, and 1917, yields of all crops were poor, although in 1913 barley and winter wheat did not fail as com- EY as did the other crops. In 1916 and 1921 grain yields were than the corn yields. In 1912, 1918, 1922, and 1923. corn was the lead. Corn ami Winter Wheat Good Combination For the 12-year period corn made the highest average yields of any crop. Its greatest gain was made in the last half of the period. Now it is necessary to use considerable caution in dealing with averages which are secured from figures in which wide variations occur. Are we justified in taking averages such as we have before as indexes of the adaptability of the various crops? When two crops have gone up and down together and one has kept ahead of the other continually, as winter wheat has kept ahead of spring wheat for this 12-year period, we are justified in saying that winter wheat is superior to spring wheat for this region and that its 12-year average gain is a pretty fair meas - ure of that superiority. In making comparisons between crops in which the yield variations do not occur together, such as happened with the yields of corn and winter wheat in this instance, the case is different. Even if the gain of corn over wheat were greater than it is, we would scarcely be justified in concluding that we should plant more corn and less wheat because of the end of this 12-year period corn stands ahead of wheat. Relative Crop Yield* in Pounds Just how illusive and misleading averages of crop yields may be even though they extend over several years, is illustrated in a study we have made of the progress of comparative average yields on two of the North Platte crop rotation fields. The comparisons are made in pounds rather than in bushels per acre. The results are shown in the next chart (Figure 12)). The upper part of the chart shows a comparison of corn, winter wheat, and oats grown in Field 49. The lower part of the chart shows a comparison of corn, barley, oats, and spring wheat grown in Field 41. Yearly variations in yields are not </seg>

The time covered in the chart for each field is the same, that is, from 1915 to 1923 inclusive. The work in Field 49 was begun 5 years later than that in Field 41, so that in 1915, the one field had completed 4 years and the other field 9 years of crop records. The points in the first line of the upper part of the chart therefore show the four year average yields of oats, corn, and winter wheat, in pounds of grain and shelled corn per acre. The numbers at the bottom of the vertical lines just above the year dates Indicate the number of years averaged. The average yield of winter wheat for the four years concluding with 1915 was 1030 pounds per acre. The next year, 1916, was a good year and the five-year average concluding with 1916 went up. The next two years, 1917 and 1918, were years of low yields and the averages were depressed. The line takes an upward curve through the better years of 1919, 1920, and 1921, then falls slightly in 1922 and 1923. The average yield of winter wheat for the 12-year period concluding with 1923 is 1100 pounds per acre. The line of continuing averages for the nine years shown remained between 1020 and 1170 pounds per acre. Oats start in with a 4-year average yield of 620 pounds per acre, went up to 800 pounds for the 5-year average ending in 1916. The 6-year and 7-year averages concluding with 1917 and 1918 dropped off considerably. The averages at the end of 8 years, 9 years, 10 years, and 11 years remained under 800 pounds per acre, but shot up and ended the 12-year period in 1923 with an average of 870 pounds per acre. The wheat and oats lines, up until the last year, had much the same shape. The wheat averages have remained rather con - sistently about 300 pounds per acre above the oats averages and it i probably that this is a pretty fair measure of the relative yielding jacities of the two crops of this section. Corn has, however, in the last six years put on a performance all its own. Its 4-year average yield concluding with 1915 was 660 pounds per acre, that is a little above oats, and 370 pounds per acre below the winter wheat average. Its 5-year and 6-year averages were about on a level with the 4-year average. Its 7-year average ending with 1918 shows a decided raise, with the oats and wheat lines going in the opposite direction. Then in 1919 and 1920 with all lines going up corn made the more rapid gains. This was set back some in 1921 and at the end of 10 years the average yield of corn was slightly under that of winter wheat. In 1922 and 1923 the corn averages continued up with wheat falling off. Corn has here performed the remarkable feat of ending a 12-year period with an average yield per acre just twice as great as the average at the end of the first six years. The results from Field 41 shown in the lower part of the chart arc much the same. At the end of 11 years concluding with 1917, the </seg>

During the following six years the three grain crops retained about the same relative standing, except that the oats and spring wheat lines drew apart somewhat, spring wheat dropped off slightly and oats gained somewhat on barley. Corn on the other hand parted company with oats and spring wheat, cut across the barley line as it cut across the winter wheat line in Field 49, and ended its 17-year period with an average yield of 1150 pounds per acre, or an average gain of nearly 50 per cent over its 11-year average concluding with 1917. Fifty Tears of Weather Records We can venture no forecast as to the probable future course to be taken by the line of corn averages in its relation to the other crops. It may remain above winter wheat or drop back below it. The two lines are more likely to criss-cross in Irregularly alternating periods until a sufficient number of years of record are secured so that a normal is established in each case. This is the semi-centennial year of the keeping of rainfall records at North Platte. The average annual rainfall for the 50-year period is 18.6 inches. This average has not changed much in the last 15 years. A normal has been established. Wide fluctuations occur, always have occurred, and probably always will occur in annual amounts, but these effect the normal or average only in insignificant amounts. The normal is now a comparatively straight line held in place by the weight of accumulated years of record. A line above and below which annual fluctuations occur, and from which the number of departures decrease as the distance from it increases. In 50 years the extreme departures have been 8 inches below and 12 Inches above the line. Only 15 departures have been above or below the line more than 4 inches. Records Are Valuable Continuous records of this kind are extremely valuable. We do not have a like background of crop records. The statistical records of which we have made use in this discussion extend back a compara - tively few years. Experimental data is meager and of recent accumu - lation. Both are as yet wholly inadequate for establishing lines of normal crop yields. If we had records of accurate crop yields from 10 farms in each western Nebraska county for 30, 40, or 50 years, the question of readjustment of crop acreages to meet the present wheat situation could be easily and accurately answered. If our present crop reporting service could be supplimented by having pre - cinct assessors gather statistics of yields as well as acreages, and the service could continue unhampered by political or other interference for 30 years, future generations would have a body of information out </seg>

This information would be accurate and reliable, and from it and by it a much straighter course in agricultural practices could be charted than is possible with but recent experiences and prejudices as a guide. I have reviewed for you in a general way the relative importance of various Nebraska crops from the standpoint of acreages. I have shown where the chief wheat producing areas in Nebraska lie, and with what other crops these areas are overlapped. I have attempted to show how the stage appears, to me, to be set in western Nebraska for a temporarily decreased acreage of wheat and a corresponding in - crease in the acreage of corn. I have hinted at the advantages of diversified farming and the dangers of single cropping or swinging from one extreme to the other. I have tried to emphasize the need of more accurate and extended statistical and experimental information. I have not attempted to project a specific program into the future. As I promised in the beginning I have not answered in any definite way the question we set out to discuss. I hope that those of you who have had the patience to follow me through, at least do not have a less clear understanding of the factors involved in the problem. CROPS TO RKPLACK WINTER WHKAT J. H. Claybaugh, Clay County When a group representing a community meets with their county agent to plan for a community extension program, one approved way of starting is to make a list of the causes of losses and lack of the profits in the different departments of the farm. When this is done it is quite easy to list the community needs and farm problems. Let us attack this problem of what crops to plant to replace the reduced wheat acreage in the same manner, and first of all survey some of the conditions which exist and which will help us determine the crop needs and crop problems of that part of Nebraska south of the Platte river which used to be considered the center of the winter wheat region of Nebraska. First — In the making of this survey of conditions we observed the following: There is some alfalfa hay shipped into this region in spite of the fact that alfalfa is grown in the region and is recognized during the past few years as the best paying crop. There is then a need for more forage crops and when we investigate the causes of why the alfalfa acreage is not increased we will find another farm problem. Second — We have observed that farmers have imported alfalfa seed and in spite of the good state laws protecting buyers they have im- </seg>
            <seg id="p274">274 BBPOBT OF 1TKHUBK* STATE BOAID OT AOWCT1.TUBE ported dodder with their alfalfa seed and have been compelled to plow this up. This condition brings out the need of a home grown seed supply and the problems preventing the setting on and harvesting of alfalfa seed. Third — We have heard reports about cattle dying when on sudan grass pasture but when conditions were investigated we have found the cause of the poisoning was the mixture of cane with sudan. As the farmers want to continue to use sudan as a supplementary pasture crop this condition brings out the need for a supply of pure seed, pre - ferably a home grown seed supply where the conditions of growth and threshing can be observed. Fourth — Because of the lack of grain feeds on so many farms we find that the growing hogs are many times shy of feed during the sum - mer. We all realize that the rapid growth is most often the cheapest §wth and as so many of our hog raisers are trying to get their hog 9 on the market during the early fall, this condition brings up the blem of an early maturing feed crop. Fifth — Still another condition which exists is that the habit of weather to so distribute our summer rains that one crop or an early or a late planting of one crop might yield well and the other crop or planting fall. The condition brings out the need for a variety of crops and profitable early and late varieties of the same crop. The sixth and last condition which involves a crop need or problem that we might wish to discuss here is the rather poor quality and high cost of the farm labor supply which involves the planting of those t'S which better distribute the labor of the farm over a longer work - season. LLet us now consider these six conditions and see what crops will fill the need. Under problem one we find that we can increase our winter forage supply by increasing our acreage of alfalfa or the non-protein forage crops. It is the protein crops needed, so let us consider alfalfa. In Clay County the average farm has 11 acres of alfalfa yielding from 1 to 2 tons per acre, which would mean when given an average value of $12.00 to J15.00 per acre. When this crop is divided between land - lord and renter both are pleased with their income. But increasing the alfalfa brings up the question of a seed supply. This problem must be solved by our seed growers in supplying more seed, at a cheaper cost, getting the stand of alfalfa and keeping the hoppers from eating both the newly sown stands and the seed crops. These problems are being solved by some but will probably keep many farmers from increasing their alfalfa acreage to what they would like to have. Problem three brings up a situation which can easily be solved if the Crop Growers' Association and the extension service can but develop </seg>
            <seg id="p275">BCPOBT OF NEBKA8KA STATE BOARD OT AOBlCULTUmE 275 the needed growers of pure seed and a system of field inspection and certification. However, an increased acreage of sudan for pasture and for seed purposes will not take up much of the wheat acreage even though the herds of cattle and sheep are increased. The crops answering problems four and five can be discussed to - gether. Rye as a feed crop, especially when the higher yields are secured as when the new Rosen variety is planted, has a place on the farm where diversification is practiced and early summer hog feed is desired. While the Clay county average yields of 12 to 15 bushels per acre shows poor cash incomes, yet the pasture value of the growing crops must be considered as of value to the man who owns his own land or is in partnership with the landlord. However, rye on a rented grain farm will not take up much, if any, of the acreage which has been planted to wheat in the past. Barley as a spring sown grain crop helps in the farm labor distribu - tion. As a summer hog feed, barley has recently gained many friends. Its yield per acre has, during the past 5 or 6 years, been more than two-thirds the acre yield of oats, thus giving a grain weight yield per acre more than oats. The price of barley is usually 50 per cent more than oats. This means that as a cash crop for the landlord barley is a better crop than oats. During the past few years unless one got a wheat yield above the average the rental income from barley has been about equal the rental income from wheat. We need higher yielding strains of barley as the acreage has been and will undoubtedly continue to increase. We have often wondered what the experiment stations are doing in barley breeding work. We have some who grow hulless barleys and find it excellent feed. Our attempts with winter barley in Clay county have proven that this is not yet winter hardy. There is another relatively new crop for the South Platte country which will help solve problems. I refer to the grain sorgos as repre - sented by the new and early maturing varieties of dwarf milos and kaffirs. From the statistical reports it would seem that Frontier, Red Willow and Pumas counties are the center of the kafflr corn region of Nebraska. These crops are giving large yields of forage per acre and any farmer who cuts corn for stover and many who fill silos in the South Platte region will find the kaffirs and milos easier to handle and probably heavier yielders of both grain and forage than is corn. These grains are drought registers and often make a crop when the corn fails. These crops are planted after and harvested before corn, thus helping to distribute the labor over different seasons. Even as a cash crop for the landlord or as a hog, cattle, or poultry feed the milos and kaffirs have a place upon the farms in that region of Nebraska most often touched by the hot winds. We look for a heavy increase in the acreage of these kaffirs and milos just as soon as the farmers learn how to get an even stand and </seg>
            <seg id="p276">276 cure the seed. From the results of our variety tests we have taken a fcial liking to those early, short growing, large seeded kaffirs repre - ted by the Hegaro and Dawn varieties, although we still have a lot faith in dwarf yellow milo. Besides the crops mentioned we must not forget the new utility type corn as the other crop which can be grown with the farmer's own labor and that the 90 day varieties are doing much to provide late summer hog feed and that these early varieties are often maturing ahead of the worst dry spells that ruin the late growing varieties. For these reasons 90 day corn will also have a place on the farm rsre diversification says that more kinds and varieties of crops must grown. SThus, to summarize we might say that more alfalfa can and should grown on many farms to the advantage of both landlord and tenant. That a few special men should be encouraged to grow the pure s«eds that are needed locally and that more summer feed crops can be grown such as barleys, early corn varieties, and the early kinds of kaffirs, or dwarf milos. By such diversifying a farmer can so arrange his field work as to hire less high priced labor and he will have his farm receipts scattered over more opportunities with less chance of a knock-out blow given by the total failure of one crop.

            <seg id="p277">277 RETOBT OF NEBKA8KA STATE BOARD OF AORICrLTlBE A Member — Have you had any experience with sweet clover? Mr. Claybaugh — We are Just a little too far west for the beat results with sweet clover. However, sweet clover has a place on any farm where they are diversifying and have livestock. I believe that every farmer with a large amount of livestock should have some sweet clover as well as some sudan grass. Our native pastures don't produce very much, especially when we compare them to the feed that can be produced per acre on sweet clover or sudan grass pasture. However, the cause of sweet clover not being absolutely dependable in our section is that we do not have the rainfall and it is harder to get a stand and we cannot use a nurse crop as you can further east. We cannot use sweet clover to take the place entirely of the native pasture, but it is a crop that our farmers should have. There should be some sweet clover and sudan grass on every farm. Professor Keim — How do you account for the fact that they don't have a greater alfalfa acreage. Mr. Claybaugh — From the high prices of the seed, the trouble in getting stands, and the grasshoppers. The farmers in our country have not been hit hard enough to realize that they have a grasshopper problem, but they are bad enough to keep off the seed buds from the alfalfa and to keep it from producing seed. It is a problem which is coming to the farmers to produce their own seed. We have a seeding and moisture problem in getting our stands of alfalfa and the grass - hopper problem is helping to keep the acreage down. Instead of eleven acres I believe we should have twenty acres per farm In our county, and our live stock men would be better off. A Member — Have you had any success in killing grasshoppers? Mr. Claybaugh — Yes, the poisoning of grasshoppers was proved y^ars ago. AH you have to do is to get someone to let you try it and you can prove that it is successful. The poison method is the most economical. The grasshopper problem is general over all the South Platte country but it is not as great as it is in the beet country or the Scotts Bluff country where they had to do something, but we will have to do something too, later on. The President — Mr. Zook and Mr. Grimes and Mr. Claybaugh have all made a good many suggestions as to what might be used in place of the wheat acreage, and that is one of the greatest problems we have right now. As soon as we begin to produce more grain that will be consumed by the hogs we will meet the problem of prices for live - stock. I was rather amused and not at all surprised at a remark a man made to me on the train last night. He is a big rancher in the western part of the state and he has been successfully raising a lot of barley and feeding it to hogs. I tried feeding barley to hogs but I turned them in a little bit later than he did and just when the beards began to soften and drop off they consumed the barley to a very good </seg>
            <seg id="p278">278 BEPOfcT W NEBKA8KA STATE BOA ED OF AGRICULTURE advantage. That is one thing that might be suggested. There are probably other crops that could be grown and consumed on the farm, at least changing the form on them so when we market them we will market them in a different form. tMr. Snodgrass — Suppose we take the proposition of raising livestock the farm by reducing the wheat and increasing the livestock. When raise livestock on the farm we are doing consolidated marketing, we pay less freight to ship the cream and poultry and meats than we do to ship the wheat. We can afford to take less for the hogs and cattle and thereby increase the yield on our farms than we could in raising only wheat. Another thing, the area in which we grow the corn and barley is so much less than the area of producing wheat. In the production of wheat we are competing with the entire world. There is wheat being harvested at this minute somewhere in the world, and wheat is being harvested every month in the year, and in a great many places in the country it is produced on land so much cheaper than ours and at a much less cost per bushel. Every farmer here will say I am telling the truth when I say there is not a man in this audience who made a dollar on wheat this year. The only man really benefited is the hired man who got $4.00 a day for shocking it. A Member — You are using your elevators the wrong way. You should be shipping in and you are shipping out. That is where Wis - consin is going ahead. We market it as grain instead of livestock in some form. The President — Here is a suggestion that was not brought out as well as it might have been, and that is that with the diversification of farm crops we may go into the dairy industry a little bit more. Dairy products have been at a pretty fair price, especially when com - pared with the price of other farm products, and possibly that might help out some. A Member — I have 500 bushels of the finest barley that anyone ever saw anywhere and I wish someone would tell me how to feed it in the best way. The President — I can't tell you the best way to feed it but I can tell you how we do it. We grind the barley up; I know it is contrary to some experimental data to grind barley, but we grind it enough to crush it and we put corn with It and grind the corn and barley together and feed it to our hogs or feed it to the cattle. We feed it in a self feeder and we have never thought we lost very much. A Member — The common practice in our neighborhood is to crack the barley to feed it to the hogs. One of the drawbacks against in - creasing our dairy products in this state more than anything else is the absence of a reliable summer pasture. If that question could be solved Nebraska would become a great dairy state. </seg>
            <seg id="p279">279 BKFOBT OF NEBKASKA STATE BOA ED OF AGBICtTLTUBK Mr. Claybaugh — Most of oar farmers like to combine tome other grain with barley for hog feed and grind them together. Mr. Snodgrass — Sudan grass is not a maker of fertility. Sudan grass is not a leguminous plant and it takes out the fertility of the soil. A Member — Sudan grass makes mighty good hay to feed and helps to get away from the high freight rates. Jack Koch. — They are raising sudan grass in the western part of the state and if a man in the spring time will prepare the soil that they want to put in sudan grass they will have a summer pasture. Such land will take up the moisture until after corn planting time and if they will use their other pastures and then rely on the sudan pasture in the dry time they will find it is of value. But you must not let the weeds take th£ moisture out. I believe sweet clover wherever you can get an early spring crop, is advisable, but during the dry season where you want a summer pasture, that will dry out and not give you much pasture except on the valley land and along the Platte River. On the high land sweet clover is not a success during the dry months. It is a two-year crop and it must reseed itself and you need two pastures. Don't get in a hurry in the spring to sow sudan grass. It is a warm weather crop. Wait until June when the weather is warm and you will get a good stand. We never had it hurt the cattle and we have turned cattle in on it in all kinds of weather and under all sorts of conditions. A Member — I think sudan grass is better and surer than alfalfa. We have had hogs and horses go into it and we could not keep them out after they once got into It. AGRIOIT/TVRAL OPPORTUNITIES IN NEW ENGLAND AS SEEN BT A XEBRASKAX F. D. Keim, Lincoln, Nebr. Most any student making a study of agriculture in the east and in the west will notice two general contrasts. In the east, the big subject is soils, and in the west most everybody talks climate, or in other words, the amount of available water present in the soil. This does not mean, of course, that the east has no climatic troubles, nor that the west has no fertility problems. Which one of these presents the greater problem is rather a difficult question to answer. I heard some - one make this remark, "You can always buy lime and fertilizers, but you cannot buy rain." That would seem to be a talking point against the west and its climatic troubles. On the other hand, in this day </seg>
            <seg id="p280">280 REPOBT &lt;W NEBRASKA STATE BOARD Or AGBICULTI'RK of low prices for farm products, one must consider that lime and fer - tilizers cost money. It is a real problem to supply these soil require - ments, which are so necessary in most places in the east, and still be able to make a profit. In discussing the subject of soils, I will divide it into five different headings: fertility, acidity, drainage, rockiness and un uniformity. Soil Fertility tit seemed to me that everybody in the east talked soil fertility. ry town has its fertilizer store or its fertiliser exchange, and every pany its fertilizer salesmen. The Soils Department of the New York State College of Agriculture, at Ithaca, realizing the high cost of complete commercial fertilizers, urges very strongly the keeping up of fertility by the use of barnyard manure,- green manure, lime. Fig. 14 — A Rather Typical New York Scene rotation, and the application of acid pnosphate. I saw a number of figures which indicated very strongly that on dairy farms fertility could be maintained along the line lust suggested without the use of very much complete commercial fertilizer. The barnyard manure and the green manure furnishes the nitrogen, and it is the nitrogen in complete commercial fertilizers that makes the cost so high. Wherever complete commercial fertilizers are recommended, they very strongly urged the farmers to use high analysis fertilizers. Instead of buying two units of nitrogen, four units of phosphorous, and two units of potassium, in other words a 2-4-2 in the fertilizer language, they rec - ommend a 4-8-4 or a 5-10-5. The advantage in this is the fact that the overhead expense of handling a ton of fertilizer of high analysis is no greater than that of one consisting of low analysis. </seg>
            <seg id="p281">281 REPORT Or NEBRASKA STATE BOARD Or AGRICULTURE Acidity It seemed to me that a very great many of the eastern soils were acid. Therefore, much lime was needed to reduce the acidity. There were, however, several lime-stone valleys that did not need the lime, but in many cases even though the lime-stone was directly underneath the soil, it was necessary to add a certain amount of lime. I saw illustrations of numerous pastures that had very little vegetation except paint brush and other weeds. When lime was added, bluegrass, white clover, red top, and other tame grasses would come in very readily. dtony Land Another thing that strikes the westerner with a good deal of force, especially one who has been farming on our loess soils was the Pig. 15 — A Rocky Pasture in Southern New York stone. I well recall my first experience in using the hoe among the rocks. It just seemed that I could make no headway at all. Every time the hoe struck what was supposed to be the earth and weeds, it struck a stone and glanced off. Of course, not all of the land is stony, but a good share of it is. Soil Drainage The drainage problem was also very important. In the Finger Lakes region which lies a little to the west of the central part of New York State, it Is very rolling, and in driving over the country one would not suspect drainage to be a problem at all. And yet, on rather gentle slopes, and even on some of the steep ones, water would seep out of the ground and delay the time of planting in the spring, and many times the time of cultivation during during the summer. </seg>
            <seg id="p282">282 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I recall particularly one instance over near Chautauqua, New York, where I ran across an old Nebraska student by the name of Albert Dean. His Nebraska farm experience was obtained on a farm up near Ashland and he attended the Nebraska College of Agriculture during the years of 1915 and 1916. His parents needing his help, ca«sed him to go back to New York State and settle down on the old farm. I found him plowing with three old horses hitched to an old walking plow and coming down a rather steep hillside very slowly. Every few steps they would stop and Albert was seen tugging at the plow handles and guiding it around something. When I got up to him, I found that he was dodging rocks with the plow and that it was a good thing that the horses stopped when they did or he would probably have been going out over their heads. It was also interesting to note that the land on this rather steep hillside was unusually wet along about f! middle of June. In fact, in many places it was entirely too wet plow. Land Ununiform It struck me also that the land was unusually ununiform. It varied very much in type. Some places it would be extremely sandy and only a few miles away, and even sometimes a few rods, one would run into the very stiffest clay. In some places the soil would be very deep, and in other places the rock would be very near the surface. Of course, we do not need to go to New York to find a great lot of un - uniform land. Anyone that is well acquainted with the edge of our sand hill country, or the region along a good many of our river bottoms in Nebraska, knows that we have some very ununiform land also, and some very fine types of land for eastern farmers to get soaked on. And it is not always the eastern farmer that gets soaked. Many times it is somebody that lives only a few miles distant, but who has not taken the pains to bore down and see what lies just underneath the surface soil. It is in places of this kind that a good county agent, with the help of an extension agronomist, comes in very handy. Any - £ buying land in a country where he is not familiar certainly should overlook this advantage that is offered at the present time by tically all State Colleges of Agriculture. Should Western Fanners Go East Now, how about the western farmer going east to buy cheap land? If I were contemplating on buying an eastern farm I certainly would buy with a great deal of caution. All of the soil factors that I men - tioned previously should be looked into very carefully. If one practices the "buy quick to obtain a good bargain" and with his eyes shut, he is almost sure to get soaked because a great deal of eastern land that is for sale is really very poor. </seg>
            <seg id="p283">283 EETOBT Or NEBRASKA STATE BOARD Or AGBICULTUK A man going east or a man coming west must change his type of farming. The east is generally an area of smaller farms and an area of a multitude of farms. Very few four horse teams abreast and mighty few riding gang plows are seen. In other words, the east is a land of intensive rather than extensive agriculture. It's a land of vegetables, hay and forage, fruits of all kinds, milk cows, chickens, honey and wax, small fields of corn, wheat, and oats, and a little barley. It is very interesting to contrast eastern agricultural methods with our extensive type of farming in the west where we deal with corn, hogs, and alfalfa, large acreages of wheat, and reasonably large acres of oats and barley. Some Advantages of the Ea«t The east, however, comes in for a certain share of advantages. In the first place the eastern farmer is protected by freight rates. He does not have so far to ship his products to the large cities, because these large cities are close at hand. The eastern farmer is also pro - tected by the products that he raises. He usually practices extreme diversification. He does not grow one type of vegetable but he grows a great many types of vegetables. He is favored, to a certain extent at the present time, because the laborer is making reasonably goofl wages, and like a great many other folks, he is not afraid to spend his money. He therefore buys the knick-knacks. He even buys ex - pensive and high class vegetables, fancy fruits, fancy milk and eggs, etc. The wide awake eastern farmer can cater to these wants if he knows how and can demand the very highest prices for his products.

With the use of a truck, he can take advantage of the bulge in price when marketing his products. Trucks going in and out of Newark, New Jersey, to the New York markets is a sight that one never forgets. There seems to be a mad rush nearly all night long bo as to get in on the early morning market. I heard Dr. Warren of the Farm Management Department at Cor - nell University, give these data. He said that New York products were fifty-four per cent higher than they were before the war during 1922 and 1923. On the other hand, the United States products in general were only 34 per cent higher than they were before the war. This gives, of course, a big advantage to the easterner. And lastly, the eastern farmer has some wonderful hard surfaced roads to travel over. Fig. 17 — Russian Women Weeding Onions in an Old Peat Bog in New England Ederstand also that a great many of these roads are state roads and built quite largely by state taxes which come chiefly from the e cities, so that a hard surfaced road in the east does not cost a farmer whose land adjoins it, anywhere like it would cost a western farmer under similar circumstances. Another thing that struck me was the fact that a farmer was able to do a certain amount of trucking, milk a certain number of cows, and during the slack time was able to obtain a job in some manufacturing concern that helped him to make his living. Of course, the New York farmer has somewhat the same difficulty as the old farmer that took his pig to town and let him run around a while, and then didn't know him. He had to pay more for a piece of him than he got for the whole pig. </seg>

It seems almost impossible to perfect the proper organization and make it stick, so that the farmer can demand a reasonable price for his product, and the consumer buy them at any reasonable cost. So it seems that it makes little it is in the east or in the west, advantages, the success that any difference wherever we go, whether each with its advantages and dis - man makes depends largely upon himself. He cannot always listen to the advice that is handed out in the various educational channels, because even men who are handing out the advice may not be acquainted with the conditions upon which this particular farmer is working. I heard a speaker from Wisconsin at the dedication of the new dairy building at Cornell University say that the wheat farmer deserved to fail. He said, "Why doesn't he diversify? Rotate his crops, raise more hogs, and milk more cows." Fig. 18 — A New England Milk Condensory He was referring largely to the farmer of North and South Dakota, and western Nebraska, eastern Montana, and eastern Wyoming. Speak - ing at the dedication of the new dairy building, he was talking quite largely to a dairy audience. He hinted rather strongly to specialize in dairying. At least he said, "Our Wisconsin farmers are not going broke, therefore, why should these farmers go broke? If they would farm as our Wisconsin farmers do, we would not hear of so many cases of farmer bankruptcy." I would very much like to have asked him just what crop he would use in a rotation in western North and South Dakota, and eastern Montana. This he did not tell them. I also wondered if he knew what would happen to the dairymen who would go out in that region and start up a specialized type of dairy farming. </seg>
            <seg id="p286">286 bdobt or irniiwi state boabo or ageicultuee I think we must admit that the rotation of crops and diversified farm - ing is of very great Importance, but the question of what to raise and what to use in rotation in that western country is one of the most perplexing problems that agriculturists have to deal with. Any thinking man would also agree that it is very important for a western farmer to keep a few cows, probably from six to eight, but he cannot resort to a specialized type of dairying in any sense of the word. Specialized dairying belongs to intensive agriculture and not to exten - sive agriculture. Wisconsin is close to market, it is close to con - centrated feed, it has a climate that is much better fitted for dairying than has our western plains. There is every reason to believe that the Wisconsin farmer should not go broke but there is a little more chance of the western farmer doing so. But it is not due to the fact that our western farmers are not specializing in dairying. I noticed a little editorial in the Nebraska State Journal which seems to fit in here very well. "When the wheat farmers come to adopt the advice which comes to them from counting rooms, railroad offices, political headquarters, and editors, just what form shall their crop diversifying take? 'Grow more livestock,' say these urban agricultural experts. Well, the farmers have already done that. The close of 1923 finds that nearly one-third more hogs were sent to market last year than in any previous year. Such a flood of them was not dreamed of. Chicago handled 86,000 in a single day. Four per cent more cattle were marketed than in 1922. Even the sheep came back. The farmers have produced so much live - stock that in the case of pork the output could be disposed of only by increasing our pork export by forty per cent in a year when exports in general were falling off. This was accomplished by reducing the price in dollars before the pre-war level. In real prioe, this was one - third below the pre-war level. The wheat growers can diversify all right by turning to livestock, but in the present state of the livestock market they would make as much money by sticking to wheat." HESSIAN FT.Y CONTROL IN NEBRASKA r Myron H. Swenk, Chairman of the Department of Entomology, University of Nebraska, State Entomologist^ of Nebraska, and Entomologist of the Agricultural Experiment Station The Hessian fly is, on the whole, the most important insect enemy of the wheat crop in Nebraska. It is not a native insect, but was imported from Europe at about the period of the Revolutionary War, having probably been brought over in wheat straw that was used as horse bedding by the Hessian troops that landed on Long Island in 1776. Its first injuries in America were noted in 1779 in the wheat </seg>
            <seg id="p287">EEPOKT OV KOUaU STATE BOARD OF AGEICLLTCBE 287 near the site of the encampment on Long Island. From that locality it spread rapidly westward. By 1786 it had crossed Pennsylvania, by 1844 it was present In Indiana and Illinois, and by 1860 it occurred in Iowa and Minnesota. About 1867 it crossed the Missouri River into Nebraska from Iowa and gained a footing in Case and Otoe counties. Distribution of Hessian Fly In Nebraska During the next few years the Hessian fly spread over the counties of southeastern Nebraska. Sarpy and Douglas Counties were invested by 1869, and by 1872 the fly had worked westward through Saunders, Lancaster and Seward Counties to York County. By 1874 it had reached the southern boundary of Nebraska in Richardson, Pawnee and Gage Counties, and two years later it was abundant enough In these counties to do some damage. Further injury was done by it in 1880, in 1885 and 1886, and in 1900, but the first real outbreak in Nebraska is one that began in the fall of 1903 and reached its greatest extent in the spring and fall of 1904. By {Bis time the insect had extended its range over the whole of the eastern part of Nebraska, west to Boyd, Holt, Wheeler, Greeley, Sherman, Buffalo, Dawson, Fron - tier and Red Willow Counties. It has not materially extended its range in Nebraska during the past twenty years. History of Outbreak in Nebraska Following the outbreak of 1904 the Hessian fly decreased greatly in abundance in the spring of 1905, and the next serious trouble with this pest was in the spring and fall of 1910. This 1910 outbreak was not so heavy as the 1904 outbreak had been. Four years of varying but not very serious abundance of the fly followed the 1910 outbreak, and then came the heavy outbreak of the spring and fall of 1914, which was the most severe that had as yet been encountered. The insect abruptly dropped back in abundance, largely because of parasitic control, in 1915, and remained at a low point of abundance during the making of the next five crops of winter wheat In Nebraska. But in the fall of 1920 it appeared quite noticeably in the wheat fields, and increased in the spring of 1921. The fall and spring broods of the fly, working on the winter wheat crop of 1921-22, gathered in - creased strength, and the fall brood of 1922, favored through its late - ness in finding plenty of wheat, developed a more widespread infesta - tion. Again favored in the spring of 1923 by the weather conditions and by no undue abundance of parasites, the flies of the spring brood became so abundant as to produce serious losses to the wheat crop of 1923 and to form a serious menace to the new crop to be seeded that fall. </seg>
            <seg id="p288">288 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Survey Showing 1923 Conditions ti survey of the situation in the spring of 1923 showed that the lian fly was present in the wheat in all of Nebraska south of Platte river and west to Frontier and Red Willow Counties, and that from this area it extended, north of the Platte, to Dakota, Wayne, Madison, Boone, Howard, Sherman, Buffalo and Dawson Counties. In all of this area it had done more or less injury locally here and there, but the niosL serious injury was present in the block of four counties bordering the Missouri river and south of the Platte river — Cass, Otoe, Netnaha and Richardson — with the adjacent counties of Johnson and Pawnee, and, in more limited areas, westward along the Platte river in Saunders, Dodge and Colfax Counties. Infestations in Seward and Fillmore Counties and a serious western infestation in Buffalo, Dawson. Gosper and Furnas Counties were also found to exist. Life History of Hessian Fly From our knowledge of the life-history of the Hessian fly, we knew that by harvest time the insects would have become fully grown maggots down near the roots of the wheat and would then soon change into the rather hard, dark brown objects of about the size and shape of a flax seed which frequently are called "flaxseeds" by farmers, but which are known to entomologists as puparia. We also knew that shortly after harvest inside these puparia either maggots or pupae were pres - ent, and that while during the summer the pupae would give forth adult flies, most of the maggots would remain as such until late August or early September, when they would change into pupae and the pupae to adult flies that would come out to lay their eggs on the early seeded winter wheat. The effect of the attack of the maggots hatching from these eggs would be to cause the young wheat to grow in a short-leaved, clumpy fashion, and later to turn yellowish and brownish as if dead, so that sometimes the entire field would appear to be destroyed. We also knew that, after they had injured the wheat in the fall, these maggots would again change into puparia for the winter, and that from these over-wintered puparia the next spring would come adult flies of the spring brood that would again lay eggs on the wheat. The maggots developing from these eggs laid in the spring would locate in the lower joints of the wheat, and would so interfere with the sap flow and weaken the straw that the heads would fail to fill, and, toward harvest, the straw would be apt to crinkle or break at the point of attack, so that the grain became badly lodged and often not L»te Seeding a Remedy Entomologists have also long known that probably the most gen - erally satisfactory of all of the known methods of combating the Hessian fly has been that of the late seeding of the winter wheat. This </seg>
            <seg id="p289">KEFOBT Or NEBRASKA STATE BOARD Or AGEICULTVBt 289 has been true largely because of the possibility of readily obtaining a considerable amount of cooperation among wheat growers in observ - ing this method during those years when the fly is a threatening pest. The plan involves merely the delaying of the seeding of the wheat until such a time -as the fall brood of the Hessian fly has emerged from the stubble and disappeared, or so nearly have disappeared that the flies will be gone by the time the wheat is up. The method involves no additional production costs, and the wheat saved from destruction by the fly through this method is practically all clear profit to the grower. For these reasons, since the outbreak of the Hessian fly in the wheat crops of 1913-14 and 1914-15, whenever this pest has appeared threateningly in Nebraska wheat fields, many of our farmers have practiced late seeding of their wheat. They have usually used as a guide the average dates of safe seeding to avoid the Hessian fly rec - ommended by the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, which dates were first given out in 1914 in the form of a map, and have since been repeatedly copied. The dates of safe seeding given on this map were averages based on the study of data gathered between the outbreak of the fly in the wheat crops of 1903-04 and 1904-05 and the outbreak ten years later. This data consisted of figures show - ing the amount of Hessian fly infestation that developed in a consider - able number of different wheat fields in southeastern Nebraska, the dates of seeding of which were exactly known. These average dates proved to be fairly satisfactory guides for the Nebraska wheat grower in seeding his wheat so as to avoid serious infestation by the Hessian fly until the fall of 1922, when they proved to be considerably too early. Kffert of Climatic Conditions on Fly The Hessian fly is an insect that is greatly affected in its develop - ment by varying conditions of moisture or dryneas. In very moist years, as for example during the period of the making of the wheat crop of 1914-15, it may go through as many as five or more or less complete generations, while in ordinary years it goes through only the normal two generations. Also, if the summer is abnormally dry, the emergence of the flies from the puparia is retarded by the drought considerably beyond the average dates of safe seeding in a normal year. These facts were correctly presented when the average dates of safe seeding were given out in 1914, but have not generally been taken into account by wheat growers. The summer and fall of 1922 was very dry and the emergence of the fall brood of flies was much delayed, so that the average dates of safe seeding, as announced in 1914, were ten to fourteen days too early in the fall of 1922. For example, in Burt County, Nebraska, the average date of safe seeding is September 24, but in the fall of 1922 just across the river, in Monona </seg>
            <seg id="p290">290 HNBI Or NEBKA8KA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE County, Iowa, on the 29th of September, 5,615 eggs were deposited on 100 wheat plants, followed on September 30 by 4,582 eggs on the same plants. Thus, farmers sowing their wheat at the average date of safe seeding in the fall of 1922 encountered an unusually heavy tail-end of the fall brood of adult flies, and consequently their fields were in many cases heavily stocked with eggs and became severely Infested with the maggots of the fall brood. Conference on 1928 Situation Realizing that the Hessian fly situation in the summer of 1923 was serious enough that large and unnecessary losses to the winter wheat crop of 1923-24 would result unless some effort was made to check the pest by successfully avoiding to a considerable extent the attack of the flies of the fall brood of 1923 in those counties where it was very abundant, a conference of county agents was called at Lincoln on August 13. Every county agent in a county in the infested district was invited to attend this conference, especially if the Hessian fly situation in his county was such as to make vigorous action desirable. At this conference. Cass, Otoe, Johnson, Richardson, Douglas, Saun - ders, Colfax, Seward, Fillmore, Buffalo and Furnas Counties were each represented by their county agents, and the Director and District Leaders of the Extension Service and the Extension Agronomists were also present. Each county agent gave a statement as to the situation in his county, and then for two hours the whole problem was dis - cussed in a general way. Establishment of Meld Observation Station As a result of this conference it was decided that the Department of Entomology of the Nebraska College of Agriculture should establish a field observation station in the heart of the heavily infested district along the Missouri river, where daily counts would be made by means of which the actual date of safe seeding in that chosen locality for the fall of 1923 could be discovered. From this date of safe seeding in the chosen locality the date of safe seeding for any other locality could be placed close enough for practical purposes by allowing for differ - ences in altitude, latitude and average annual rainfall between the two localities, and thus the dates of safe seeding would be decided not by the fixed average dates previously used as a basis, but on the basis of an exact date determined for the particular season of 1923. By this method nothing would be left to chance, and the date would not be established until actual field observation proved that the fall brood oT the fly had actually practically all emerged and disappeared. It was further decided that each evening the record of the daily counts at the field observation station would be sent to Lincoln, and the next morning a circular letter, giving these data, would be mailed to all of the cooperating county agents for the information of their wheat growers. </seg>
            <seg id="p291">bkpo«t or nebbaska state boabd or aoricii.tibe 291 When the date of safe seeding was established at the field observation station, that fact was to be sent at once to all of the cooperating county agents so that they could immediately get the word to all of their farmers to begin seeding at once. In the meantime the county agents agreed to get as many as possible of the farmers in their respec - tive counties to delay seeding their wheat until the actual date of safe seeding was determined, and to urge that the wheat ground be gotten into good shape and that every one be ready to drill in his wheat as rapidly as possible when the date of safe seeding was determined. Methods for Conducting Field Station Accordingly, on August 19, the Hessian fly field observation station was located on the farm of Mr. Glen Perry, 4 Vt miles southwest of Plattsmouth, in Cass County. The station was in charge of Mr. E. E. Wehr, Instructor in Entomology at the Nebraska College of Agriculture. Arrangements were made to make daily counts of emergence of the adult files, their movement in the field, their egg-laying and the decreasing presence of viable or living puparia in the stubble. These were made as follows: 1. Dally Fly Emergence Counts — A cage consisting of a tight, heavy, wooden box with the bottom taken out was placed over about three bushels of stubble known to be heavily infested with viable Hes - sian fly puparia. Two circular holes were cut in the top of the box and a lantern globe was inserted in each hole. Cheese cloth was tied over the top of each globe. The stubble and dirt in the box were moistened after each rain. Beginning September 1, the emerging flies and their parasites were removed and separately counted each day, as they collected in the globes. 2. Daily Migration Screen Counts — Two strips of ordinary wire screen measuring 3x5 feet were set up in a stubble field, one facing east and west and the other facing north and south, and each screen was painted with a thinned sticky "tree tanglefoot" preparation. The flies moving with the wind currents were caught on one or the other of these screens. Beginning September 1, each day the flies caught on these screens were removed and counted. 3. Daily Egg Counts — On August 20, a small plot of wheat was seeded so that the wheat plants would be up and large enough for the adult flies to lay eggs on them by September 1, or as soon as they began to issue from the stubble. One hundred wheat plants in this plot were selected at random and marked. Beginning September 1, each day the eggs were counted and removed from these plants. 4. Daily Puparium Counts — Each day one hundred old stubble plants were examined and the number of viable puparia, that is, those containing unemerged maggots or pupae, was counted. By these data the per cent of flies emerged and the percentage yet to emerge could </seg>

            <seg id="p293">RKPOBT Or XEBBA8KA STATE BOABO OT AGB1CII.TI BK 293 be computed, and any danger of a late or delayed wave of emergence could be with certainty avoided. By means of these counts it is clear that tae date of safe seeding would have arrived when (1) the daily fly emergence counts showed that the maximum of fly emergence was past and that emergence was rapidly on the decline, when (2) the daily migration screen counts showed that comparatively few flies were yet abroad, when (3) the daily egg counts showed the end of egg-laying by the fly was at hand, and when ( 4 ) the daily puparium counts showed but few viable pupae, that could shortly change into flies, remaining in the stubble. In operating this field observation station in Nebraska, the Department of Entomology cooperated with similar stations established by the Depart - ment of Entomology and Zoology of the Iowa State College in Monona and Mills Counties, Iowa. The field observation stations in both Ne - braska and Iowa were open at all times to any visitors who wished to stop and see how the work was being carried on. Result* of Observations The Nebraska field observation station wan maintained for 31 days, September 1 to October 1, inclusive, and counts were made each day except on September 16, when it rained continuously all day. The total number of puparia found in 3,000 stubble plants in the field where the station was located was 24,660, or an average of 8.22 puparia to the plant — surely a sufficiently general and high infestation for the purposes of the station. From the three bushels of stubble in the emergence boxes anywhere from none to 85 adult flies emerged on different days, an average of 16.5 flies per day, the total being 502 for the 30 days. On the migration screens anywhere from S to 423 adult flies were caught on different days, an average of 98 per day, the total being 2,941 for the 30 days. Eggs were deposited from September 6 to 15 inclusive, and from September 21 to October 1, inclusive. On these 21 days the smallest number of eggs deposited on the one hundred wheat plants was 25 and the largest number was 2,459. The total number of eggs deposited on these one hundred plants during the entire 21 days was 10,684, or an average of 106.84 eggs per plant — surely enough eggs to provide for a bountiful supply of maggots to work their injury on any early sown wheat in the vicinity! It may be of interest to outline briefly the general course of the emergence, field activity and egg laying of the flies during this period. The adult flies began to both emerge in our boxes and catch on our screens on September 1. The weather on September 2 and 3 was warm and very bright, bringing the flies out steadily and rapidly, so that by September 4 to 6 the first period of emergence was well under way. The first eggs were laid September 6. Emergence of flies increased September 7 to 9. with a wave of emergence on September 7. and heavy flights of flies in the fields occurred on September 8 and 9. </seg>

This brought a heavy increase in the egg-laying on September 9, 1,110 eggs being laid on one hundred plants on thiit day. Emergence fell on September 10, and with greatly increasitg cloudiness on September 10 and 11 the field activity of the flies greatly decreased on September 11, keeping the flies quiet and close to the ground but resulting in a second heavy deposition of eggs on that day, 1,680 being laid on the one hundred wheat plants. Increased sunshine and low wind velocity on September 13 to 14 brought renewed field activity and reduced egg-laying on the part of the flies. Then resumed heavy cloudiness and low temperatures on September 15, followed by rains on Septem - ber 16 resulted in a complete cessation of both field activity and egg - laying, and ended the first period of emergence of the flies. The rainy and cloudy period of September 17 to 20 was accom - panied by a low field activity, but a wave of emergence in the boxes on September 18 paved the way for a day of somewhat increased ac - tivity and for the day of heaviest egg-laying on September 21, when the weather became abruptly bright, 2.4E9 eggs having been laid on the one hundred wheat plants on that day. There was but little emergence from September 20 to 23, and, though the weather was bright on September 22 and 23, rather strong winds kept down field activity. On September 24 began the third and final wave of emergence of flies, which continued to September 30 and which on September 26 and 28 reached the maximum of emergence for the season with 85 and 74 flies, respectively, much greater than the emergences on September 7 and 18, when 22 and 44 flies had emerged, respectively. Cloudy weather and rain on September 24, followed by cloudy weather on September 25 and 26 and rains on September 27 to 30, especially heavy and accompanied by a stiff wind on the 28th, kept down field activity of the flies. The final wave of egg-laying took place on September 26 to 29 when 475, 571, 150 and 304 eggs, respectively, were laid on the one hundred wheat plants. Following September 29, both field activity and egg-laying fell away to very low figures. On October 1 only 25 eggs were laid on the one hundred wheat plants and only 4 flies were caught on the screens. While these data on the emergence, field activity and egg-laying of the fall brood of flies indicated the passing of the danger period, they did not indicate the exact date when one could be quite sure that no more flies would emerge from the stubble, and such delayed emergences are always to be feared. To check up on this point, each day one hundred plants were collected from the field and carefully examined for puparia. The number of such puparia containing living maggots or pupae was noted as well as the number of puparia from which the flies had emerged, and the percentage of such empty puparia as compared with the total number was determined. On September 1, of 762 puparia examined, only 39, or 5.1%, were empty. Flies continued to come out rapidly, </seg>
            <seg id="p296">REPORT OP NEBftASKA STATE BOA«b OF AUKICrl TIRK 296 showing about 13% empty on September 3 and 4. The increased emergence on September 4 brought the total of empty puparia to 30.3% on September 5. The emergence wave of September 7 in - creased the empty puparia to 4 6. 4 "7, on that date. Emergence then slowed up, the flies coming out but gradually. From September 7 to September 18 the counts varied, showing from 39.4% to 57-}% of empty puparia. Following the emergence wave of September 18 the counts from September 20 to 24 showed from 57.2% to 88% of empty puparia. Then came the final wave of fly emergence of September 24 to 30. The percentage of empty puparia jumped to 80.9% on Sep - tember 25. to 90.5% on September 57, and to 93.2%, 94.1% and 95.8% on September 28, 29 and 30, respectively. Evidently by Sep - tember 30 the stubble was almost exhausted by fly puparia containing living insects, for of 1004 puparia examined only 42 contained living insects and of these 42 only 8 were in the pupal stage ready to emerge as flies — the other 34 were still maggots, which meant that they would not come out as flies until the next spring. The count on October 1 was even more conclusive that the stubble was free of flies, for out of 404 puparia 386 were empty and of the 18 that contained living; insects only 2 were in the pupal stage. The date of safe seeding was then promptly announced for Cass County as October 1. because It was certain that by the time wheat sown on that date was up the flies then alive would all be dead and no more would be forthcoming to take their places. Applying Observations to State § Entomologists have previously discovered that if the actual date safe seeding is known for any locality, and the altitude, latitude and average annual rainfall are also known for that locality, the date of safe seeding for other localities, reasonably close, may be determined by adding one day for each 100 feet of lower altitude or subtracting one day for each 100 feet of higher altitude; by adding one day for tach one-fLjrth degre of latitude (about 15 miles) that the locality to be determined lies to the south of the locality for which the date &lt; f safe seeding is known, or subtracting one day for each one-fourth degree of latitude that it lies to the north; and finally by adding one day for each inch of average annual rainfall less or subtracting one day for each inch of average annual rainfall more, than the locality Tor which the date of safe seeding has been determined. To illustrate the general working of this law, which is known as the bio-climatic law, it was found, ai above stated, that in the fall of 1913 the actual date of safe seeding in eastern Cats County near Platttmouth was October 1. Plattimouth is at about 1,000 feet alti - re, lies on the 41st parallel, and its average annual rainfall is about Inches. Syracuse, Otoe County, with 50 feet higher elevation. </seg>
            <seg id="p297">BEPOBT OF NEBBA8KA STATE BOARD OF AGBICl'LTl'KC 297 about the same average rainfall and about one-third of a degree farther south, would be by altitude one-half day earlier and by latitude nearly one and one-half days later, averaging one day later, or October 2. Tecumseh, Johnson County, with 100 feet higher elevation, two-thirds of a degree of latitude farther south, and with about the same average rainfall would be one day earlier through altitude but nearly three days later through latitude, making It about two days later, or October 3. Falls City, Richardson County, which has an elevation of 900 feet with an average annual rainfall of 32 inches and lies practically one degree south of Plattsmouth would be one day later through altitude, four days later through latitude and one day earlier through rainfall, making it four days later, or October 5. Dates for Safe Seeding Based on this general rule, but with some minor adjustments, as the date of safe seeding in Cass County was noted to be almost at hand on September 29, the date of safe seeding for Douglas, Saunders, Dodge, Coif ax and Buffalo Counties was announced for that day; then when it was announced for Cass County on October 1 it was also announced for Seward and Fillmore Counties; for Otoe County the date of October 2 was announced; for Johnson and Furnas Counties, October 3; and for Richardson County, October 4. The cooperating county agents immediately notified the farmers in their counties that it was now safe to go ahead and seed the winter wheat as rapidly as possible without any fear of injury to it by the Hessian fly. Infestation of Fields Seeded at Different Date* The amount of infestation present in different parts of selected fields in four of the counties where the control campaign was carried on has been determined in some experiments conducted by the Bureau of Entomology of the U. 8. Department of Agriculture through its laboratory located at Wichita, Kansas, in cooperation with this Depart - ment. The different parts of the selected fields were seeded at dif - ferent dates in September and up to the middle of October. In Cass County, wheat seeded September 17 was 2 7% infested, that sown on September 24 was 24% infested, while that sown on October 1, 8, and 15 was absolutely free from infestation. In Richardson County, wheat seeded September 24 was 72% Infested, that sown October 1 was \t% infested, while that sown on October 6 and 10 was absolutely free from infestation. In Fillmore County, wheat seeded September 6 was 19% infested, that sown September 24 and 26 was 2% infested, while that sown on October 1 and 8 was absolutely free from infesta - tion.

Cass and Richardson Counties reported that at least 95 per cent of the farmers in these counties did not seed their wheat until on or after the determined date of safe seeding, and some of the other counties reported nearly equally good cooperation. As a result the Hessian fly damage in these counties during the fall of 1923 has been relatively unimportant, if the reports which have up to this time been received by the Department of Entomology are accurate. Practically all of the reports of injury that have been received by the Department have come from infested counties where, because of lack of a county agent or other good reason, it was not possible to put on such an organized campaign to await the date of safe seeding. Of course publicity was given the work of the field observation station, and many wheat growers in various parts of the state independently awaited the announcement of the date of safe seeding, but these results naturally lacked the solidarity of an organized county-wide effort carried on through the efforts of the county agent. At the present time the heaviest Hessian fly Infestation seems to be in Sarpy. Gage. Jefferson, Saline, Webster, Phelps, Dawson and Red Willow Counties. In other words, the geography of the Hessian fly infestation in the fall of 1923 has completely shifted, so that the eleven counties that were so badly injured in the fall of 1922 and spring of 1922 that they freely cooperated in this late seeding campaign are now the comparatively lightly infested counties, while the counties that were not badly enough injured in the fall of 1922 and spring of 1923 to be interested in this campaign, or that were not so organized as to be tto take part in it, are now apparently the more heavily infested ties. MAINTAINING SOIL. FERTILITY IN NEBRASKA By J. C. Russel I do not want to be considered an alarmist on the subject of our soil fertility, and I do not want to challenge your pride in our soil, the greatest of all our Nebraska resources. I propose to state, later on, that the fertility of our soil is decreasing, but I want to preface this with the statement that no other state can boast of 50,000 square miles of finer soil than lies in the regions designated on the soil map of Nebraska as Drift Hill, Loess, and High Plains. kMany states have glacial soil, but none has finer glacial soil than 6.

The soil is 20 to 200 feet deep and chemical analyses show its mineral composition to be practically the same from top to bottom. Our 15,000 square miles of High Plains is generally highly fertile and experiments have shown that when our western soil is put alongside our eastern soil and given the same amount of water, it is considerably more productive. In some respects our 6,000 square miles of bottom and bench lands is our greatest potential resource. This soil is eminently adapted to Irriga - tion farming and alfalfa and there is enough variety in kinds of soil to make possible the widest kind of diversification in field and truck crops. We should be proud of our soil, but no man should say that its fertility is inexhaustible. All experience and history tells us that fertility can be depleted and has been depleted in many sections, if by the term fertility we mean the capacity of a soil to produce. Fer - tility is depleted when the supply of chemicals is drained or when the physical make up is unfavorably distributed or when biological con - ditions get out of order. Nebraska Soils Are Being Depleted of Their Fertility It is hard to prove by figures that soil fertility is being reduced. Statistics of crop yields over a long period of years do not show a serious decline. But there are many factors that enter into the pro - duction of crops. Better farmers, better prices, better seed, better methods, better machinery, all go to increase yields, and if fertility were inexhaustible we might naturally expect yields to increase.

However, your own experiences on the farms of Nebraska are suf - ficient proof in the majority of cases that the productivity of the soil is not what it once was. This fall, I stood in a field in Southeastern Nebraska that had been under cultivation since 1863. In all thfs time it had never had a load of manure or any clover or alfalfa. In 1887. we were told, a big rain took all the soil off the hillside. Today, a good farmer rents this farm. He had as good a stand of corn on this field as one ever sees, and had kept the field almost perfectly clean of weeds. Yet we estimated the corn on the level land at 18 bushels, and on the hillside at 8 bushels per acre. From all over the state we 'get reports that soil fertility has decreased; that crops do not yield satisfactorily and that more work must be done to get crops to yield as they should. What Is the Cause of Our Depleted Soil Fertility? k Before we attempt to answer this question let us state some things t we believe are not responsible for the condition. We have not austed our supply of mineral elements. Phosphorous is not an abundant element in our soils, but it seems to be highly available. Phosphorous fertilizers, at the Experiment Station at Lincoln and in Gage. Washington, Hall, and Buffalo Counties, and in all other places where we have tested them, have not given any consistent increases in crop yields. The same statement holds for potash fertilizers. We have just completed a study of soil acidity in this state and we do not feel that at this time lime would contribute to our production. The question of gypsum and sulphur has been popular the last few years since it was found that sulphur was deficient in certain sections of Oregon, but we are convinced that our soils are not deficient in that respect. Depleted Fertility Due to Loss of Organic Matter and Nitrogen Organic matter is important for a number of reasons. It is the carrier of all nitrogen in the soil, and is the food of countless bacteria that convert nitrogen into available forms for plant use. In its decay, it produces carbonic and other acids that dissolve the mineral elements in the soil. It is the most important factor in tilth. It improves granulation, makes soils scour easier on the plow, reduces cohesion and stiffness of soil, and makes it work easier. Because it increases porosity it makes soils take up water more readily. Because it reduces shrinkage it prevents baking and cracking, and promotes natural mulch- Ing. Hence soils in which organic matter has been maintained are better off in moisture than soils where this constituent is lacking. In sections where erosion is serious, organic matter helps in control of soil washing. </seg>
            <seg id="p301">RKPOKT OF \KBKASKA STATE BOABD Of AGRirri.TI'KK 301 Nitrogen is alto very important. It is one of the most essential plant food elements. Plants absolutely cannot grow without it. It takes 50 pounds of nitrogen to make a 30 bushel crop of wheat or corn or a 45 bushel crop of oats. The most important fact about nitrogen is that it must be converted into one special form before plants can use it, that is, it must be converted into the form of nitrates. Nitrates are produced in the soil by bacteria. You cannot raise 30 bushels of wheat without 50 pounds of nitrate nitrogen and you cannot have 50 pounds of nitrate without conditions favorable for the activities of these bacteria. Fig. 22 — An Oat Field Adjoining the One in Fig. 21, But on a Different Farm. It Will Yield More Than Twice as Much, Due to Higher Soil Fertility. Symptoms of Nitrogen Depletion The symptoms of nitrogen hunger are not hard to diagnose. When crops grow luxuriant and green, you may know that they are getting enough nitrates and when they grow spindling and yellow, as they do on eroded hillsides, depleted of their organic matter, you can set it down that they are suffering for nitrates. To what extent has organic matter and nitrogen been depleted in our soils? Fifteen years ago Dr. F. J. Alway, then Agricultural Chemist at Nebraska, secured through farmers over the state samples of their cultivated soil, as well as samples of comparable virgin soil adjacent. His analyses were published in Nebraska Bulletin No. 111. A digest of his findings are given in Table 5 below. </seg>

Swanson. the Iobs of organic matter under grain farming without manure or legumes waa 1.04 per cent of total per year, and the loss of nitrogen was 88 per cent. Table 6 shows the depletion of nitrogen as indicated by studies now being made by the Agronomy Department. The loss of nitrogen on farms that have been cultivated for forty years or longer is about 30 per cent in level uneroded fields, and 56 per cent on eroded areas. In many cases almost three-fourths of the nitrogen has been lost Table 6 — Loss of Nitrogen In Nebraska Soils Through Cultivation and Erosion.

            <seg id="p303">BEPOBT Or ITWiHT* STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 303 horn of Organic Matter and Nitrogen Is Serious The loss of a third to a half of our organic matter and nitrogen is serious from two standpoints. First, our farm profits are reduced in a way we do not appreciate; it makes harder work for machinery, less effective work for moisture control, and reduces the amount of crop raised on a unit expenditure of labor. Second, the putting back of depleted organic matter and nitrogen in Nebraska is a complicated problem. Nature has spent centuries in building up the organic supply which we have depleted in a few score years. If we attempt to put this back in the space of a few years, the material is too often over stimulating to the crop and leads to disaster instead of profit. For example, alfalfa is a splendid crop to build up organic content and nitrogen but what it puts into the soil is so highly available that crops frequently burn up on alfalfa sod for several years after breaking. Crop Yields and Nitrogen Depleted organic matter considerably reduces the efficiency of our field operations. At Agronomy Farm is a field uniformly cropped, and uniformly prepared for wheat this past season. Table 7 shows the nitrate nitrogen in the soil at seeding time at various places in this field where the soil varies in richness on account of organic content. In the last column of the table is shown the bushels of wheat to which this nitrogen is equivalent, figuring 50 pounds of nitrogen to 30 bushels of wheat. Experiences on this field have shown that the old stack bottom spot is too rich and causes the wheat to lodge, but in the other places the yields vary in the same order and in about the same proportion as shown on the table. Obviously the labor involved in raising this wheat is much more effective on the better soil. Table 7 — Effect of Organic Matter on Nitrate Production at Agronomy Farm. Pounds Per Acre of Nitrate Nitrogen in Wheat Fields at Seeding Time, 1923.

            <seg id="p304">304 BETOKT Or NEBBA8KA STATE BOARD OF AOBICULTVBE In eastern states there is no question about the value of manure. The Ohio Station, for example, finds manure worth over $2.00 per ton. It may not have this high value in all sections of Nebraska, but in eastern Nebraska it is worth at least $1.00 per ton. In droughty - seasons in Nebraska, manure frequently works adversely, mainly, we believe, because it starts more growth than there is moisture to finish. How to solve this problem and advantageously make use of manure is a question that we have not settled. It seems that more frequent and smaller application may be the solution. In the eastern half of the state, every bit of manure should be well cared for and returned land, and on many farms, systems should be devised to produce re manure. It is the best fertilizer there is. However, there is one point that I wish to make, and that is. the state must not put its dependence entirely in manure when it comes to permanently maintaining its organic matter. An individual farmer who buys feed from his neighbors probably may do so if he is a heavy stock feeder. The reason for this statement is: When the crop is fed to animals, approximately half of the organic matter is retained by the animal and half is voided in manure. Of the half voided, a half is lost in the yard under average systems of handling. This means that only one-fourth of the organic matter produced is returned to the land and this is not sufficient. LCrop residues, if returned to the land, will usually maintain organic tent. What do we burn up when we set fire to a straw stack or a field of raked up corn stalks? The following table shows: Organic Matter Nitrogen Crop Pounds Pounds Straw from a 20 bu. per acre wheat crop... 1730 10 Stalks from a 40 bu. corn crop 2370 26.3 Material that should be put back annually 1000 33.7 lbs. in wheat 64.9 lbs In this table larger yields than state averages are used. If state averages are used, it would be apparent that the average farmer can not afford to burn up any crop residue. However, the good farmer in eastern Nebraska that raises 20 bushels of wheat and 40 bushels or more of corn can successfully maintain organic matter by crop residue. Green Manuring It has been conclusively shown, the country over, that growing crops for the specific purpose of turning them under as a green manure is not an economical system for maintaining organic matter, when the cost of production and rental on the land is balanced against the organic matter produced. However, green manuring may be justified on tome soils in western Nebraska which are used for the production of potatoes and beets. </seg>
            <seg id="p305">/ RKPOBT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOABfi OF AGalCULTUBE 305 Seeding Down One of the most efficient way* of increasing organic content is seeding the land to grass or legumes for meadow or pasture. Nature uses this method for mailing the organic content of our virgin soil. When we put soil under cultivation and sell, feed, or burn up all the plants produced the organic content runs down. If we put land back to nature it will build up — how fast we do not exactly know, though experiments are on record where 17,000 pounds of organic matter per acre have been accumulated in 21 years time. I do not doubt but that land seeded down to grass or legumes, and not too heavily pas - tured, will gain as much as 1,000 pounds of organic matter per acre per year the first few yean. Maintaining Nitrogen If you will look at Table 3 above, you will observe that only about one-third of the nitrogen removed by the grain crop is returnable in the straw or stover. The nitrogen in manure is only about one-third that in the crop. Hence the justification for our statement made above that the problem of maintaining nitrogen is distinct from that of maintaining organic matter. Nitrogen can be maintained in three ways: 1. Growing legumes. 2. Manures. 3. Commercial fertilizer. When bacteria living on the roots of legumes were discovered, we felt sure that a way had been found to maintain nitrogen against all time. We are not so secure in this belief today. It is generally agreed that the abilities of these bacteria have been over-emphasized. It is commonly taught today that legumes get from the air only about as much nitrogen as they contain in their tops, and if all the crop is removed there is no gain in nitrogen by the soil, unless provision is made to feed the crop and return it in that way. Even then we get back in manure only one-third of what the crop has gotten from the air. Today we teach that it is essential that a portion of the crop be turned under, if the soil is to be increased in nitrogen content. A four ton crop of alfalfa removes from the air about 200 pounds of nitrogen. If this is fed to animals, about seventy pounds of nitrogen can be put back in manure. If the last cutting of, say, one ton is turned under, 50 pounds are gained. It is plain that alfalfa and legumes should be fed or pastured off and the manure returned to the land if the farm is to gain in nitrogen. However, all farmers know how rich the soil is made by growing alfalfa, or clovers; almost too rich as a matter of fact. Why? Not so much because the total nitrogen in the soil is increased, as to the fact that the nitrogen is in a very highly available state. </seg>
            <seg id="p306">306 BEPOKT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOABD OF AGRICULTIEE Sweet Clover For Soil Improvement f Probably the best system to rebuild a piece of badly run-down land to put it into sweet clover and pasture it off, if practical, or otherwise turn it under. I know of a farm in a Northeastern Nebraska county for which they could not even find a tenant, rent free. It was sold to a far seeing banker who put it all into sweet clover. The next year after the sweet clover, it raised the biggest corn crop of any farm In that section. How much land should we have in legumes in Nebraska? This question cannot be answered from a theoretical standpoint, or from a consideration of the maintenance of soil fertility alone. We have got to make farming pay, and we cannot farm by theory to do it. There - fore we can not say that every farm should have 40 or 50 per cent Fig. 23 — The Growing of Alfalfa and the Clovers and the Keeping of Livestock Are Essential In Maintaining the Fertility of Nebraska Soils. legumes on it. We who have viewed the question from the practical standpoint of the present, as well agree that an ideal would be one as from the prosperity of the future, acre in every six in legumes. Do Nitrogen Fertilizers P»y? I shall pass over the question of maintaining the nitrogen of the soil by manure and consider briefly the use of nitrogen fertilizers. There are sections of the world where nitrogenous fertilizers are used on wheat, oats, barley, and corn with profit, but it cannot be done in Nebraska. At present prices, nitrogen fertilizers are no competitor of legumes. Fifty pounds of nitrogen in fertilizer would cost today about |X{. 00 and theoretically H should produce thirty bushels of wheat. </seg>
            <seg id="p307">Rcrorr or nkrbanka state boabo or aobicultube 307 Four tons of alfalfa fed to steers or cows will return in manure seventy pounds of nitrogen taken out of the air, which will cost about fifty cents to put back on the land. What Can We Do About It? In conclusion let us repeat that the fertility of our soil is running down, mainly because of depleted organic matter and nitrogen. We work harder, produce less, and get less for it, than ever before, and with respect to certain products we are over-supplying the market. There are three things we, as individuals, can do. We can cut our cost of production, we can reduce our hired labor bill, and do more of our work ourselves by rearranging our type of farming; and we can produce more crop for each labor unit. If we could have today the new soil we had a few score years ago we would not need to work as hard, and we would raise more per acre, and our problems would be much easier to solve. In these times the man who has kept up his soil has it working for him, while he who has let his soil run down has it working against him. I. D. Evans — How long should you keep alfalfa in a field before plowing it up? Professor Russell — Ordinarily I would say alfalfa should be kept 6 to 8 years. This will vary, however, with conditions. We all hate to plow up a good field of alfalfa. Seeding a new field is expensive and uncertain, so we often leave a field as long as it will produce satisfactorily. If we do that, however, we need alfalfa or red clover to assist us in covering the farm for the sake of soil fertility. Often bluegrass takes the alfalfa and we have to plow it up. A Member — Why is sweet clover so much better than alfalfa for restoring the soil? Professor Russell — Sweet clover is perhaps somewhat easier to get established on poor soils and often will grow where alfalfa will not. It takes hold rapidly and can be established in a short period of time. Being a good pasture plant, which alfalfa is not, at least for cattle, it can be pastured off, and the soil built up more rapidly as we have just explained. Its roots rot very quickly leaving the soil loose, open and in a fine physical condition. Sweet clover is our best crop for badly run down fields. It does not make as good hay and it takes less will-power to plow it under as a green manure crop. A Member — Would sweet clover enrich the soil more to turn under the second year growth or would you leave It untit it goes to seed? Professor Russell — In eastern Nebraska two years for sweet clover ordinarily is enough. It may then be put to corn. It is a good system to pasture it off. If seeded in small grain in the spring let it go until late April or early May of the next year, then plow it, pack it well and put the land to corn. The results will be surprising. </seg>

Magee, Bennington, Douglas County, Nebraska For the past four or five years it has been our practice to keep from 50 to 70 grade shorthorn cows on our farm in Douglas County. These cows are not purebred but we have been breeding them up by using good, high grade bulls, two of which we have purchased from the Animal Husbandry Department of the University of Nebraska. We have found the raising of cattle to be good practice for our conditions and a necessary part of our farm operations. Livestock and Soil* II realize, however, that Nebraska and even eastern Nebraska varies great deal in regard to soil and other local conditions. There are good and bad locations. However, in our section of the state, we are sure of raising at least two things, corn and gullies. While our soil does not wash as much as it does in some parts of Nebraska, the soil washing problem is an important one with us as is also (he fertility problem. We have found that by keeping livestock and a reasonable amount of alfalfa and other feed crops, it helped to solve the fertility and the soil washing problems. Personally, I prefer the beef cattle over the dairy cattle, and therefore I have been raising the Shorthorns. Young Cattle on Poorest Land In a general way I have worked out a slogan which might be stated "The best young cattle on the poorest old land." meaning by this that I have tried to seed down the poorest part of the land and raise the cattle under those conditions and on such land, in order to build it up to be equally as fertile as the other land. Ten Reasons For Marketing Young Cattle I have worked out ten points which I consider to be reasons for growing beef cattle on eastern Nebraska land. Some of you may not agree with these points but I think that for our conditions they are fairly sound. They Bum up the whole proposition and I will give them to you just as I have jotted them down. I might say, however, that I believe in feeding out young stock rather than keeping the older cattle for feeding. I want to call your attention to the work which the Animal Husbandry department of the University of Nebraska has conducted for the past three years, in which they have shown that calves are much more economical to feed than are the two-year-old or three-year-old steers. I believe there is no question but what w« will come to the raising and feeding out of younger cattle. </seg>
            <seg id="p309">KEPOKT Or .NEBBAKKA STATE BOARD or AGEICL I.T1EK 309 My ten points in favor of cattle on the farm, and particularly young cattle, are as follows: 1.

The young heifers sell as well as steers at 900 pounds. 5. A better market for the baby beefs with a longer time in which to select this market — if conditions demand 6 They eat all the roughage and turn it into marketable form. 7. They help to maintain the soil fertility. 8. Their short life on the farm cuts the risk of death, drought and hail, and pays the interest on the mortgage.

            <seg id="p310">310 EEPOBT Or NEBRASKA 8TATB BOARD OF AGRICULTURE help me in working out gome figures. I found a Farmers' Bulletin 1218. of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, written by W. H. Black of the Animal Husbandry Division. His investigations show that 69 per cent of the gross cost of keeping a cow is represented by feed, while the other 31 per cent includes interest, labor, equipment and incidentals, the depreciation being taken care of by an advance in weight. The per cent of calves raised from the 23,258 cows included in the investigation which he made was practically 85 per cent. The average quantities of feed and pasture consumed by one cow during a winter feeding period of five and a half months based on figures taken from 354 farms where cows were kept stricfly for raising stockers and feeders are given by Mr. Black as follows: Grain, 122 pounds; hay. 1,900 pounds; silage, 700 pounds; straw, 600 pounds; corn fodder. 0.1S acre; cornstalks, 1.6 acres; corn stover, 0.24 acre; and winter pasture, 4 days. Add to this the summer pasture for 6 Vt months. To find the cost of raising the calf to weaning age when an 85 per cent calf crop is expected, divide the cost of keeping a cow by 0.85. To this result add the cost of keeping a bull (50 per cent higher than that of keeping a cow), obtained by dividing the cost of keeping a bull by the number of cows per bull. If the calves are fed grain before weaning, allowance should be made for approximately 150 pounds per head. By sum - marizing these costs the final result will be the cost of raising a wean - ling calf. A great many of our farmers instead of trying to raise cattle, make it a practice to buy them on the market. I am not sure but what it probably costs more to raise a calf than to buy it on the market, but the fact that a whole lot of roughage is consumed must be taken into consideration, as well as the fertility side of the busi - ness. Where the calves are raised on the farm, it gives a market for a lot of roughage and the fertility of the land is no doubt kept up in better shape by such a practice. If the calves cost a little more when raised we make it up on our crop yields in fields pastured or manured. Question — Do you favor any special breed of' cattle? Mr. Magee — We handle Shorthorn cattle. Mr. Oramlich — How many calves do you raise? Mr. Magee — Last year we had fifty-two calves dropped out of a possible fifty-four. The bull did not run with that bunch. Question — Are you able to keep these breeding cows without grain? Mr. Magee — We don't give them any grain at all. That may not be quite true because last week when we had a blizzard we fed the hogs on the feeding platform and run the cows in there. But we don't plan to feed the cows any grain except when they are turned in the cornstalks. Usually there Is a good deal of corn in the stalks </seg>

The President — Senator Warner is here. I remember that he made a talk on this subject a few years ago and I would like to hear from him. Mr. Warner — That was before the war. I figured that it cost $25.00 to raise a weanling calf but I attributed that cost to the fact that the alfalfa land improved in fertility so the increased yield of corn and other grain crops must be considered. Question — Do you have plenty of cornstalks to carry the cows through the winter? Mr. Magee. — Yes, especially If you have a little oat straw also. Question — How much grass do you figure for the yearlings? Mr. Magee — We have a very good old bluegrass pasture and that will carry a cow to every one and a half acres every year that we have been on the farm. That is a very good proposition. A safer figure would be two yearlings to an acre. Question — Do you have to increase the fertility of the pasture by fertilizers? Mr. Magee — It increases all the time. Question — Do you put any manure on them besides what the cattle leave there? Mr. Magee — I don't know how to handle farm property otherwise, when I don't know what else to do with the manure I put it on the pasture and we get a return for it without any question. Question — Isn't feeding cornstalks pretty expensive feed on account of the danger of cornstalk disease? Mr. Magee — Our experience is that we give the cattle a little hay with the cornstalks and give them plenty of salt. We don't have any trouble. Question — Do you run your cattle in the corn field before the corn is husked as we hog off corn? Mr. Magee — No, we never attempt to let tbe cattle harvest the corn. </seg>

Generally then, as -Is Mill too frequently the case, the pastures were either native grasses *•? very rarely bluegrass. Now and then one would find a small lot in which clover and timothy were used. I need not point out the drawbacks of this sort of grazing. They do fairly well when moisture and season are favorable, but fail to resist adverse conditions and rapidly deteriorate with constant use. Following the advice of Professor E. G. Montgomery, then Agron - omist at the Experiment Station, I 'began more than twenty years ago to use brome grass. Never was advice sounder. It has proved superior to all competitors and there has been no time since that I have not had more or less of it for pasture. It yields more grazing than either native grass or bluegrass and more important still, it furnishes feed and quite a lot of it under conditions that cause the others to curl up and quit. Also I have found it less liable to become weedy even when seriously overstocked. I am sure that my gains from this one piece of Experiment Station counsel far exceed all the taxes I have ever paid to support the station. In those days sweet clover was but a roadside weed, an object of contempt and aversion: sudan grass unknown save perhaps to botan - ists. Since these have been added to the list of pasture grasses it is possible with brome and timothy to arrange what, in my opinion, is a very satisfactory and profitable pasture scheme, and one that can be relied on for good yields even under severe drought conditions. I am now using all of them. Sweet clover is sown with special reference to its fertilizing value. Usually at the end of two years it is plowed under and the ground planted to corn. But where it is convenient or desirable to have grass for more than two years, brome and timothy are sown with the sweet clover. In this case the clover acts about as it does when sown alone, but at the end of the second year the other grasses are on hand and usually in the third year fully occupy the ground. They seem to benefit by the fertility stored by the clover and often their growth is very heavy. One field of 15 acres sown to this mixture carried in its first year after July 1, 12 head of two-year-old cattle the rest of the season and in addition was mowed twice to keep down the weeds. In the second year the sweet clover was enormous and It carried the equivalent of 20 head till late In the season. In the third year much sweet clover volunteered but the brome and timothy were by this time so well established that they smothered it, Seventeen head pastured it till E. P.

July 2nd this field yielded over twenty tons of choice hay. a mixture of timothy and brome. Later and until November 15th, seventeen head grazed on the aftergrowth. To be on the safe side and to insure plenty of pasture in event of dry weather, I sow a small lot of sudan. If needed for pasture it is so used, otherwise it is cut for hay and the aftergrowth pastured at the end of the summer. It is astonishing how much feed a few acres will furnish. The sudan grass is sown with a drill, 20 pounds to the acre, about June 1st, on spring plowed land. Sweet clover, either alone or in mixture, is sown broadcast with a. narrow track force feed seeder covering ten feet, on cornstalk ground. Fig. 25 — Many Nebraska Pastures Are Weedy Because of Being Overstocked and Too Closely Grazed The stalks are cut, and the ground double disced, and the seed sown about the middle of March or early in April. Sweet clover alone is sown at the rate of 15 pounds per acre. When in mixture the rates are about as follows: Sweet clover, 10 pounds; timothy, 5 pounds; brome, 10 pounds; and oats, 3 pecks. This is all mixed together and stirred occasionally in the seeder; it feeds evenly. Brome is a light, chaffy seed and is usually seeded by hand, but in this way I have been able to avoid the labor of hand seeding and get a good, even stand. Seed is covered with the harrow. It is usually necessary to mow high for weeds once or twice later in the summer. From June 15 on, such seeding will afford a lot of grazing the first year and much more the whole of the second year with normal rainfall. </seg>
            <seg id="p314">314 REPOKT Or NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRKTLTl EK It will be understood, of course, that I speak of conditions as they exist in the north-central Lancaster County on good fairly level second bottom land. Under these conditions I regard the pasture problem as solved. With Sudan for annual pasture, sweet clover for biennial rota - tion, and the mixture for semi-permanent pasture there need be no shortage of pasture save perhaps in the very worst conditions of drought. This permits the keeping of more stock, reduces the acreage of grains, builds up fertility and subsequently increases the yields from the tilled fields. The farm is thus operated with larger returns, with surer returns and with less labor. Professor Burr — I might start the discussion with just a few words. We have for a long time considered the pasture problem as one of the most important problems in the eastern part of the state, especially where a lot of the land is getting thin and where the organic matter is run down. We have not had the land at the Experiment Station to do the careful experimental work with pastures that we would like to. but our observation and study with wild and tame grasses has been such that we know something of their behavior. We find that some grasses are better adapted to certain conditions than other grasses. One grass stands drought better, another stands a heavy soil and another excess moisture. Another thing that makes pasturing dif - flcuit in Nebraska is the period of dry, hot weather that we have and. therefore, we recommend a mixture with grasses. Our observations would lead us to believe that if one-quarter of the cultivated land in eastern Nebraska was sown to pasture and legumes, and rotated, within a few years the increased yield of grain would probably make up for all the shortage we would have in acreage. There is probably no more Important problem than the pasture problem of Nebraska. Mr. Evans — This question, of course, refers to eastern Nebraska, but central and western Nebraska have a still harder proposition to face. Professor Burr — You face a hard problem now. Before they broke up the land and put in wheat, they had good pasture. In the western half of the state I don't know of anything better than the native grass. Around Kenesaw I think the problem of the temporary pasture will be solved, also with sudan and sweet clover, your permanent pasture I think will have brome grass as a basin. In 1906 we seeded the highest ground we had at the North Platte Station to brome grass and it is there today. I think there is no other grass so satisfactory for western Nebraska. 1 Question — Can you get as good a stand in the fall as in the spring summer? Professor Burr — I would seed any time after the first of August to the tenth of September in eastern Nebraska. In western Nebraska </seg>
            <seg id="p315">REPOBT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICri.TlRE 315 the fields are apt to be too dry. Spring seeding is to be preferred in at least the western half of the state. Question — We have had our best rains in the last two or three years in the fall in Clay County. Can we seed it after that? Professor Burr — If it gets fairly well established in the fall it will grow through the winter all right, but year in and year out the fairly early spring seeding is more satisfactory. President — Isn't it possible that oftentimes when we fail to get a stand of brome grass the germination of the seed is responsible? Professor Burr — Yes, I think it is most difficult to get viable brome grass seed as it is of anything you can feink of. About the only satis - factory method of seeding it alone that I have ever found is by hand. Question — How much per acre? Professor Burr — The general recommendation is 20 pounds of seed that will germinate well on well prepared land. Question— What about sweet clover for dairy pasture in Custer County? Professor Burr — A lot of dairymen use sweet clover. I would rec - ommend some brome grass with it unless you rotate your pasture. The President — This is quite a popular subject with us now be - cause of the decreasing of our wheat acreage and the increasing of the corn acreage, and it is a question as to how far we can increase the corn acreage and make a profit and the pasture crop looks as though it would be a pretty good thing to use to take part of this ground. SOYBEANS IN CORN H. D. Hughes, Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station Soybeans have been in tests and under observation at the Iowa Station for the past 13 years, the first plantings having been made in 1910. As the value of soybeans to Iowa farmers became apparent, more and more attention was given to investigations with the crop until the present, when this work may be considered quite compre - hensive. While the soybean acreage in Iowa is not large, when considered in comparison with that of some better known crops, the fact that the acreage of beans has more than doubled annually through a series of years may be regarded as significant. </seg>

Soybeans may be fed to advantage to dairy and beef cattle, sheep, hogs, and chickens to take the place of such feeds as oilmeal and tankage.

The soybean plant is as high in feeding value as alfalfa and may tused in the form of hay, pasture, silage, soilage, or as a protein centrate. Well Suited to Climate and Soils The planting of soybeans offers more certain returns than any other legume that may be grown in Iowa. Climatic requirements for soy - beans are practically the same as for corn, and the fact that the climate </seg>
            <seg id="p317">EEPOBT OF NEEBA8KA STATE BOABO OP AGRICULTURE 317 in eastern Nebraska is almost ideal for corn is well recognized. Soil conditions for maximum production are practically the same as for corn, but the beans will make relatively greater yields than the corn on poor soils. Soybeans can be grown successfully on almost any soil found in the state: rich or poor; high or low; light or dark; acid or alkalin; sand, loam, clay, or gumbo. Soybeans grow well on distinctly acid soils where many of the clovers are not successful. On some of the more acid soils, the use of lime has resulted in increased yields, but even on such soils the crop can be seeded without liming with the expectation of satisfactory results. As a legume crop which may be included to advantage in the rotation, and in view of the increasingly large acreage of acid soil in the state, the importance of this fact is readily apparent. Safe and Dependable Crop Moreover, it is a safe and dependable crop, even inexperienced growers rarely reporting failure. The Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station has grown a number of different varieties of soybeans each year since 1910 and has never failed to secure a satisfactory crop except in one case of severe hail injury in 1918. The best varieties have produced not less than 16 bushels of seed or 2 tons of hay per acre. The varieties best suited for the production of seed have given a yield of over 20 bushels per acre as an average since 1916 despite the hail injury of 1918, while the best varieties for hay have produced over 2.5 tons per acre as an average since 1915. On the station farm, with soil of average fertility, yields as high as 37.5 bushels of seed and 4.75 tons of hay per acre have been secured. Rapid Increase In Acreage The rapid increase in the acreage of soybeans throughout the corn belt is remarkable. The production of soybeans for seed has been exceedingly profitable and conditions indicate it will continue so for some time. The cost of growing beans is below that of corn whenever the acreage of beans is sufficient to permit economical threshing. The acreage is increasing rapidly, particularly in corn, and farmers are willing to pay a premium for home grown seed. Beans Planted With Corn But it is my purpose today to limit my discussion to the growing of soybeans in corn. The Iowa station finds that slightly larger yields of silage are secured when soybeans are planted in the corn. A large number of definite field trials carried through a series of years also indicate that the planting of beans in corn for hogging down may be regarded as a desirable practice when it is considered that of those who plant soybeans with corn the great majority would not buy concen- </seg>

These conclusions are reached after obtaining yields on ap - proximately 1,000 experimental plantings in five different section* of the state during the last nine years. In these tests nine different rates or methods of planting corn and beans were compared. Several dif - ferent kinds of soil, rich and poor, and extremes in amount of rainfall during the growing season are represented. While our results show but little advantage in favor of soybeans in corn either for silage or hogging down, we believe the practice for the farmers of Iowa as a whole is worth while— and your conditions in eastern Nebraska are very similar — largely because nine out of every ten of those who plant beans with their corn believe that it is profitable. It has been our observation that when a large group of farmers believe a practice is good, with a small per cent dissenting, the chances are highly probable that it is good. Tests to determine yield of corn alone as compared with corn and beans planted together and the most desir - able manner and rates of planting were begun in 1915. Tests were conducted in two series, one termed "silage" and the other "hogging down." In the "silage" series, corn was cut and shocked when in the late silage stage, at which time the green beans were harvested. Yields were determined in tons per acre for fodder, stover, and beans, and bushels per acre for shelled corn. Silage yields are on the basis of 73 per cent moisture and shelled corn on the basis of 12 per cent moisture. In the "hogging down" series, corn and beans were harvested when mature, and yields of grain computed on the basis of 12 per cent moisture. Corn or beans were planted in ten different ways or combinations. Every sixth row of all fields was planted to corn without beans. Other plantings had two, three, four, and five beans respectively per three - stalk hill of corn, and another group with beans drilled at the rate of four, seven, and fourteen inches apart respectively, along the same row. For Silage That the total yield of silage with corn and beans planted together may be expected to be greater than with corn planted alone Is Indicated by tests covering a seven-year period conducted on experimental fields in which a total of 413 plots were harvested. An average of all plant - ings shows a difference of 5.67 per cent In yield in favor of the soybean in corn mixture over cm without beans, while the most favorable manner and rate of planting shows a difference of 11.11 per cent in favor of the corn and bean mixture. (Table 8). There are not sufficient plots in each treatment, however, to war - rant selecting one method or rate of planting corn and beans over an - other from the standpoint of yield. Feeding tests indicate that a mixture of corn and bean silage it at least as nutritious as straight corn silage, and possibly more so. </seg>

The beans reduced the yield of shelled corn in proportion to the thickness of the bean plants. While, as just stated, it is impossible from the data at hand to select one method or rate of planting corn and beans as being superior to all others from the standpoint of yield, a study of the data as we have them before us where in four cases out of five drilled plantings gave a comparatively high percentage of increases, while hilled plant - ings gave small increases, which is particularly noticeable with five beans per three-stalk hill of corn, would seem strongly to suggest that drilling the beans might be expected to yield more than dropping them in the hill with the corn. It should be noticed also, that where both the corn and beans are drilled, the percentage of increase in total yield is over 7 per cent for beans drilled fourteen inches apart and also for beans drilled seven inches apart. For Hogging Down That planting soybeans in corn for hogging down is profitable under average conditions is suggested when results of latest forage lot feed - ing experiments are combined with current prices and applied to average yields secured by this station with Manchu beans planted with' corn under several different soil and climatic conditions. In the Iowa tests a yield of 54.55 bushels of corn per acre was secured where corn was planted alone. (Table 2). The yield of corn was decreased from 6.76 per cent for two beans planted per hill of corn to 25.15 per cent where beans were drilled thickly along the row. The threshed beans secured weighed practically half as much as the amount they reduced the yield of corn, and at current Iowa country values are worth twice as much as corn as feed on the basis of dry lot feeding tests at the Indiana and Ohio Stations. It is indicated by dry lot feeding experiments at the Indiana station that soybeans are worth $1.27 a bushel as a supplement for corn in feeding hogs when tankage costs $60.00 a ton and corn can be sold for 56 cents a bushel. The latter are current, December 1, 1923, prices in Iowa country markets. The value of the beans is derived from a comparison of tankage and soybeans as supplements for corn when hogs are given access to a mineral mixture, which raised the value of soybeans from $1.10 to $1.27 a bushel. The most profitable min - eral mixture consisted of wood ashes ten parts, 16 per cent acid phos - phate ten parts, and common salt one part, by weight. The value of the beans fluctuates greatly with the change in the values of corn and tankage. </seg>

When soybeans were fed with corn only 342.4 pounds of corn and 85.6 pounds of beans were required for each 100 pounds of gain. Thus 85.6 pounds of soybeans saved 275.3 pounds of corn and in addition hogs fed soybeans and corn gained at the rate of 1.1 pounds daily, while those fed corn alone gained only .6 pounds daily or slightly more than half as fast. When corn saved and rapidity of gain are both considered the soybeans have a value of $2.46 a bushel when corn can be sold for 56 cents a bushel, the December 1, 192 3 price in Iowa country markets. The corn saved alone gives the beans a value of S2.00 a bushel, and the two and one - half months in time saved in getting the 100 pounds of gain gives the beans an additional value of 46 cents a bushel. This figure Is derived from a survey conducted by the Agricultural Economics Section of the Iowa station and the United States Department of Agriculture co - operating, in Marshall county, Iowa, among 4 3 hog raisers. In this survey it was found that the cost of growing 100 pounds of pork, in addition to feed, was one cent per day. Items considered included labor, depreciation of equipment, risk, housing cost, interest and miscellaneous expense. While we have no statistics available in Iowa, we are of the opinion that not more than 10 to 25 per cent of our farmers who plant soy - beans with their corn would buy concentrated supplements to feed in conjunction with corn while hogging down. Accordingly, a comparison should be made between corn and soybeans vs. corn grown alone. Values of soybeans as given above are on the basis that the hogs get all of the beans they need in each case. As a matter of fact, our heaviest rate of seeding which gave an average of 5.7 bean plants per hill at the end of the season, which is abnormally thick, yielded beans in proportion to corn as one is to 5.6 while an average of Professor Robinson's results at Ohio shows that hogs naturally need beans as one is to 6. It should be borne in mind, also, when considering these hogging down values and yields of silage that allowance has not been made for the cost of seeding the beans, which roughly is somewhere between 10 and 50 cents an acre, depending upon the size of the beans, rate of planting and cost per bushel. Ordinarily about one and one-half times as many bean seeds as plants desired should be dropped. Accordingly, with Manchu beans at $2.50 per bushel the cost per acre to secure four plants per hill by dropping six seeds per hill would be about 32 cents. Peking beans at the same rate would cost less than half as much. Since the beans are planted at the same time as the corn with a special attachment, the cost of which is small, factors other than seed cost are negligible. </seg>
            <seg id="p324">324 In the hogging down series of tests, no method or rate of planting can be selected from the data at hand as being superior over another, as was found to be true in the silage series. It may be observed that where corn and beans were both drilled, the values are the highest »&gt; same as they were in the silage series. However, the difference not great enough to be significant. I As shown by the tables, our results indicate that the difference reen profit and loss when soybeans are planted with corn versus i alone, either for silage or hogging down, is small. I Our investigations are necessarily limited to growing trials. You interested in definite feeding tests as well. Much more comprehen - trials are necessary before definite conclusions can be drawn. My own interpretation of a review of the feeding work at the Ohio, Indiana, Missouri, and Iowa stations together with the data here presented would indicate that soybeans can profitably be planted with beans but that the advantages secured by growing these two crops together are not as great as many have been led to believe. Professor Robinson of the Ohio Station has carried on considerable work in comparing soybeans and corn with other feeds. He sum - marizes this work at Ohio, Indiana. Iowa, and Missouri as follows: (1) Pigs on standing corn containing soybeans usually gain more rapidly and produce more gain per bushel of corn consumed than similar pigs on standing corn alone. (2) Soybeans grown in the corn should not be depended upon to completely take the place of tankage or some similar fed. (3) It is questionable whether standing corn containing soybeans plus tankage will ordinarily result in as large returns per acre as standing corn plus tankage. Slightly more gain per bushel of corn is produced, as a rule, but this is often more than offset by the reduction in the yield of corn. (4) The combination of standing corn containing soybeans is greatly improved by the addition of suitable minerals and makes a fairly efficient ration when minerals are supplied. From the experi- Etal evidence available, however, it seems doubtful whether this bination will quite equal standing corn and tankage, especially if srals are supplied with the tankage as well as with the soybeans. </seg>

Lincoln, Nebraska What is the place of sudan grass in the state of Nebraska? Are the farmers who are growing the crop satisfied with its performance and how are they handling the crop? These are questions which I be - lieve you will be interested in. In order that we might gain all possible information along these lines, question sheets covering many phases of the crop were sent to the growers. The answers came In from 17 counties, representing nearly every part of the state, and I believe the substance of the replies affords considerable information that is well worth considering. The replies showed that some of the growers have been growing sudan grass for six years, and others only for one or two years. It was being used both as hay and pasture, mostly for dairy cows but also for beef cattle, horses and sheep. It was plainly evident from the replies that most of the growers were very well pleased with it, especially as a supplementary pasture during the hot, dry part of the summer when other pastures were short. They reported they could get all the way from as much to six times the amount of pasture from the sudan as from other pastures, this being especially true during July and August. Culture of the Crop In planting sudan most of the growers preferred to use the drill rather than the broadcast seeder, and emphasized the importance of having a well prepared seed bed. They recommended the plowing of the ground after which it is thoroughly worked down before seeding. The reports on the rate of seeding varied considerably. One grower recommended 2 bushels per acre and another 10 pounds. In general, however, the replies indicated that from 15 to 25 pounds of seed per acre was about the proper amount. Pasture In comparing sudan to sweet clover as a pasture crop the replies indicated that each crop has its place to fill and one may be used to supplement the other. A few reported that they liked one better than the other but most of them thought it unfair to compare the two since they served different purposes, and were available for pasture at dif - ferent times of the year. It is interesting to note that in answer to the question, "Have you had any deaths of cattle from eating sudan grass?" not a single person reported any losses from this source. How - ever, we have since had a report of trouble in Clay County. The fact that a great number of farmers in Nebraska have been pasturing sudan grass without loss, this being the only authentic case which we have </seg>

However, like bloat in sweet clover, it is not possible to say that «ne never will have trouble because occasionally cases do appear. H«y A rather wide range of answers was received in reply to the ques - tion as to when is the best time to cut sudan grass for hay. The replies showed that the time varied from before the Sudan grass starts to bloom, until the seed begins to harden. Most of the replies indicated, however, that cutting about the blooming period was the preferred time. Some of the growers cut the grass once during a season, some twice, some three times and some four times. Most of the growers reported two crops, however. A grower in Kimball County reported Fig. 28— Summer Fed Steers on Sudan Pasture Made Very Satisfactory Gains at the Nebraska Experiment Station that his plan was to grow a crop ot hay and then use the second crop for pasture. The prevailing opinion seemed to be that the best way to sow sudan for the production of hay was to drill or broadcast it. One grower reported that he seeded it in rows for hay production. As to the preference between sudan grass and cane most of the growers seemed to prefer the sudan. stating that it gave better pasture without the danger of poisoning and that the hay seemed to be more palatable and was eaten with less waste. All the growers reported that the feeding value of sudan was very good. Some reported that sudan gave a greater yield of hay than cane. A number of tests con - ducted at the experiment stations, however, show that sudan grass will yield somewhat less than cane, depending on the season. Figures show that in the average season sudan will yield a total tonnage of only </seg>
            <seg id="p327">REPOBT OF NEBRASKA 8TATE BOARD OF AGBICULTl'BIC 327 about 60 to 75 per cent of that of cane. Owing to the heavy growth i liar sudan makes most of the growers find that they have considerable trouble in curing the hay if the weather is damp. Most of the growers believed that in growing sudan for seed pro - duction the best plan was to plant it in rows and cultivate it like any other row crop. In the western part of the state listing seemed to be the most favored practice. In cutting for seed most all of them used the corn binder. Eighty per cent said that sudan grass seed would keep as well or better than cane seed. The average seed production per acre is rather hard to determine on account of the fact that Sudan is rather a new crop and most of it is used for hay or pasture rather than let go to seed. From reports that we have received, however, it would seem that the average would be somewhere in the neighbor - hood of 10 to 15 bushels per acre. Mr. S. L. Duncan of Arapahoe in Furnas County, who put in 120 acres of sudan grass this past year told me he got 150,000 pounds of seed, or about 25 bushels per acre, and sold it to a seed company for 5 cents a pound. This gave him a return of $82.50 per acre. The county agent out there says no other county in the state could do that, but I think most any county could do it. Of course, we are not especially recommending the grow - ing of sudan grass for seed, but it might be a good side line for a few farmers. Is sudan grass hard on the land? This is a disputed question. The general opinion of many farmers seems to be that sudan grass is hard on the land. In replying to this question the sentiments were some - what equally divided, or about nine claiming it was hard on the land and eight stating that it was not. It is my opinion that sudan is not any harder on the land than any other crop which makes an equally heavy growth. The main fact to keep in mind is that it produces a heavy growth and in doing so takes a good deal of moisture out of the soil and so the following crop usually suffers from lack of moisture. In proportion to the actual amount produced, I believe that it does not draw any heavier on the soil fertility and moisture- than any other crop. K|&gt;eoial PrerautionN A number of the growers thought it very important to be careful about the depth of planting and the time of seeding, stating that a good stand could not be secured unless these precautions were observed. The seed should not be planted more than about % inch deep and should not be seeded until the weather has warmed up considerably. From the 2 5th of May in the eastern part of the state, to about June 15th or 20th in the western part seemed to be about the safest time to plant. It was urged that the sudan be given plenty of chance to Kffect mi the I &lt;an&lt;l </seg>

One farmer reported that sudan was a very good crop to follow alfalfa because if this ground is put to corn or small grain re crops are likely to grow too rank and lodge or be injured by weather. L Question — Is there any difference in the feeding value of the first second cutting of hay? K Answer — I could not answer that question. Professor Kiesselbach here and can probably answer it for us. t Professor Kiesselbach — So far as I know, there is no actual data paring the first and second cutting. The first cutting will probably permitted to become more mature than the second and for that Fici. 29 — Sudan Makes an Excellent Hog and Cattle Pasture on Farms Where an Annual Pasture is Needed reason will have more feeding value. Regarding the yields here at the Station, sudan yielded only 65 per cent of the yield of cane. The government report from over twenty-three stations shows that cane outyielded sudan consistently, sudan yielding only 6&lt;T.9 per cent as much on the average. It is a little deceiving. It makes a good growth, but it does not come across with the crop. It does not seem to make much difference whether we harvest two cuttings or one. Question — Does sudan grass decrease the fertility of the soil any more than some of these other crops? yiwer — No, the only thing is that it uses lots of moisture and the soil pretty dry. Perhaps another grass that makes as heavy th would do the same thing. </seg>
            <seg id="p329">BEPOBT Or XEBBASKA STATE BOABD OF AGEICULTUBE 329 Mr. Aye — In certain parts of Kansas they raise alfalfa and some - times sudan, but I don't think they feed corn, and where alfalfa and siidan grass are fed together, they get as much gain as they do with alfalfa alone. Mr. Gramlich — A good deal of work was done in western Kansas where they found that the sudan shows up very well, especially in replacing part of the alfalfa. Part alfalfa and part sudan gave very good results. Here at the station three acres of sudan grass carried ten steers and nine hogs which were on full feed of corn and alfalfa, for about 100 days. The steers showed up very well compared to steers fed in the dry lot. They gave a return on the sudan grass, I think, of about $14.00 an acre. Mr. Gross — My opinion would be that sudan is not as good as alfalfa. I would say generally it was just about 50 per cent as valuable as alfalfa for hay. Mr. McKelvie — We found that the season has a good deal to do with the matter. Last year it was quite dry in our section of Nebraska and we got excellent results from pasturing sudan with hogs, and my eldest son had hogs enough on sudan that it never grew up high enough to be cut and harvested and it certainly was a very excellent pasture. At our home place after it grew up we cut it for hay then the hogs got some very excellent pasturage. This year we didn't get as good results from pasturing, as we have had more moisture and it grew ranker and we found the hay didn't seem to have as much feeding value for the cattle as that of last year; there seemed to be more sugar or something in it last year. This year we let it get a little too ripe and the cattle would eat the head and not much of the stalk, but I think it is a very excellent grazing crop on our farms, espe - cially if we have considerable dry weather. If we can cut down this over - head expense jn growing hogs in the summer, anything we can grow when grain and corn is high is quite a consideration. SWEET CIvOVER IX OUR CX&gt;t'NTY R. A. Stewart, County Agricultural Agent, Madison County, Nebraska In talking about sweet clover I hardly know where to begin or how to say it. However, I have come to some conclusions after watch - ing the results, secured by many men in Madison County who are growing sweet clover. I would like to say that we think sweet clover is a great crop from the standpoint of soil fertility, and from the stand - point of pasture. It is from these two standpoints that I will talk. We know it is a good pasture crop and also valuable as a soil fertilizer. As a pasture crop sweet clover is being used more and more, but only </seg>
            <seg id="p330">330 incidentally, because it, as a soil builder, is being grown so generally, that we do not have enough cattle to pasture it down. Sweet Clover As it Soil Hull. lei I was recently in a crowd where there were forty-three farmers present. I asked how many of them knew that their farm had been systematically covered with manure since they had been on it. I think only one said that his place had been systematically covered. The next question asked was as to how many were now attempting to cover their place systematically with manure and I think less than half a dozen said they were doing that. One man who moved onto a farm that was in a run-down condition said that in five years time he would cover the place with sweet clover. He had had an opportunity to make comparisons of corn, growing on sweet clover ground and on Fig. 30 — Sweet Clover is Rapidly Taking Its Place as a Pasture and Soil Building Crop land that had not been seeded down. He told me not long ago when I asked him to give figures on the difference in yield that he believed he was safe in saying that he was getting 15 bushels more of corn to the acre than he did before he used the sweet clover. Mr. Sunderman, who was to have talked on sweet clover today, told me he had been renting an eighty for a long time and the moat he ever got off it was 35 bushels of corn per acre. He put it in sweel clover for two years, during one of which the crop was not touched. He says it paid him well at that as a soil builder. He now tells me that he has not gotten less than 50 bushels to the acre of corn since it was seeded down. </seg>
            <seg id="p331">RKFO*T OF NKBBANKA 8TATE BOABD OP ACIiniTlHI 331 Of course, climatic conditions may make some difference in certain years. Sometimes when a man makes a statement about sweet clover I ask him if that is a conservative statement or if he is just enthusiastic about it. But the increases in yield usually go from about 10 to 20 bushels to the acre except on the light, sandy soil where I have been told they have actually doubled their corn yield. That means that they probably get 30 or 40 bushels to the acre and of course doubling didn't mean so very much in the total bushels of increase, but at that it is a great thing. In another case a man bought a place three years ago and sys - tematically covered it with sweet clover. His conclusions are that it will make 15 to 20 bushels more of corn than before it was seeded down. Varieties As to varieties, we have the white biennial and the large and small yellow biennial plant. The small yellow biennial wort seems to have been developed from an importation from a seed house in 1914. It was bought through a local dealer and when the two purchasers found that it was a yellow sweet clover they thought very seriously of prose - ruling the dealer for bringing it in. Since then, that small yellow biennial variety has become very popular and many farmers are now beginning to make a systematic effort to cover their farms in a rotation including this sweet clover. There is considerable difference between the white biennial clover and the small biennial sort of the switzer variety, as we call it. The white blossom is a little later plant and will stay green a little longer. The yellow is smaller, not so coarse, and many like it better as a pasture. It seems to do equally as well as the white as a soil builder. But it is just like the different varieties of livestock, each has its boosters, and I don't know as it makes very much difference which a person uses. Sweet (lover as a Hay Crop As a hay crop it is coming into use also. This year one man sowed sweet clover with oats and his yield compared quite favorably with fne yield around him. I think he got about 40 bushels to the acre off of 30 acres. Late in September he cut the sweet clover for hay. He intends to let the sweet clover go next spring until about the first week in May, then put it into corn. Sweet Clover in Small Grain We have a number of men who have adopted the policy of sowing either red or sweet clover with at least a part of their small grain each year. The practice seems to be successful and is increasing. One man has been using sweet clover hay in feeding. He was short on alfalfa and so he cut a little sweet clover hay as an experiment. </seg>
            <seg id="p332">332 RKPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRKTI.TI'RK rh to his surprise the cattle ate it as well as they did the alfalfa I asked him if he would just as soon use sweet clover as alfalfa II he said he saw no difference between the way the cattle ate it. was not his intention, however, to say that sweet clover was equal alfalfa hay in every way. Another man on very light, sandy ground rs sweet clover with his alfalfa with the idea that if he doesn't : alfalfa he will have the sweet clover. He sold alfalfa and sweet ver half and half last year .for $10.00 a ton and the neighbors o bought it didn't complain in any way. He had been using it that y for a number of years. I do not want to convey the impression it sweet clover is to be in any way compared to alfalfa hay, nor 1 it replace it, but I think it will be used more and more. MetlKMlH of Seeding. As to methods of sowing I might say there are many different ways used by different men. There are hardly two who use the same method. I think 15 pounds to the acre is usually the amount sown and to be recommended, but I find variations of anywhere from 20 pounds to 6 or 8 pounds being used, depending on where it is and on the individual. On the sandy soil some people make the mistake of getting sweet clover too deep. It is very common to sow sweet clover broadcast. Many sow it when the oats are being drilled in. Sometimes the oats are sown and then the clover is sown and harrowed in. The general tendency, however, seems to be to get the clover in Sc«rifle&lt;l Seed t There has been a little agitation about scarifying seed. Some insist scarifying the seed and others sow a great deal of seed in the hull, ticularly during late winter. The freezing and thawing seem to e care of the hard seed. Some insist on having scarified seed at times. One of our men has a scarifier which he built himself. It now been in use for four years. He insists that all his seed be rifled. Many of you men know how to set a threshing machine to in the sweet clover seed. There is a way of cleaning it so that a purity test it will run 99 per cent or better. That seems almost lossible but we have had such tests as that several times. It has been quite interesting to observe that the germination test on this seed that comes through very clean is very appreciably higher than the germination test on the general run of sweet clover seed run out by the ordinary run of machines, where probably 40 per cent of the hulls are left on it. I don't know why, but it seems that the germination test of such well cleaned seed is much higher. It may be that in handling the seed to clean it the seed is scarified or scratched more or less. Sow plenty of seed, but if you get good, clean seed of </seg>
            <seg id="p333">333 BEPOKT Of NKHKASKA STATE HOARII OF AtiKHTl.Tt BE high germination you can get along with relatively much less seed per acre. Question — How about innoculation? Mr. Stewart — Nothing whatever has been done with innoculation or sweet clover in our county. We have tried it on soy beans but not with sweet clover. Question — What is a good time to sow sweet clover in the wheat field? Mr. Stewart — Our farmers are sowing some of the wheat fields this week. Many of them scatter the seed and let it go at that. It does not look to me like it is the right way to do it, as I think you should cover the seed, but men who have tried it each year say it is a good way to seed. More is being sown with rye than with wheat because we don't have much wheat, but the process is the same. Question — Will sweet clover make pasture after it is cut for hay? Mr. Stewart — If cut for hay the first season it will not make much pasture afterward unless it is a field that was sown very early in the spring. Then it may make growth enough to be pastured after being cut for hay. The second year if cut for hay it will come on again and make a growth which is largely for seed production, being coarse and woody. There is also some danger of killing the crop when the hay crop is cut the second year. This is particularly true if cut short rather late, say when the flower buds are showing, and if the weather happens to be dry and hot just then. The President — Professor Hughes of Ames has been doing some work with Hubam clover and I would like to hear a few words from him at this time. Mr. Hughes — Sweet clover is really my first and only love. I think your experience in Nebraska and the experience of the Iowa farmers is very similar. In western Iowa particularly we find that red clover is being replaced almost entirely by the sweet clover. But the big reason for the enormous increase in the acreage in western Iowa has been its big value for pasture purposes combined with its value for soil improvement the same as in Nebraska. I remember a year ago a man just across the river in Iowa said a man was a fool who would plant sweet clover when he could grow alfalfa as they could there. He finally put in 14 acres and he now says that as long as he farms he never expects to seed another acre of small grain that he doesn't put sweet clover with it. He could pasture it before he could his bluegrass pasture and in August he had the best pasture you could possibly get. The experience of the Iowa farmers with regard to sweet clover for soil fertility has been much, as we have heard here today. The best sections of Iowa are the ones where they are using sweet clover successfully. Every man says it increases the yield of corn from 20 to 30 bushels, even on the best soil. </seg>
            <seg id="p334">334 BKPORT OF NKIIRASKA STATE BOARD OT AGRICri.TfRK [The scarifying machine which is now being used by most seed com - ies and many farmers was developed about ten years ago. We e been very much interested in the scarifying of sweet clover seed ticularly. I remember several years ago, visiting a man in northern itucky who had built up a big sweet clover seed business. He went land in Kentucky that had been abandoned for farming purposes luse in raising corn and tobacco they had run down the land and abandoned it. The owner could not afford to farm it, and that I has now come back, solely from the introduction of sweet clover. 9 man built up a big seed business but he had so many complaints ling back on the seed that he said he was about to throw up his I business. The complaints were that the seed was no good. It just then that the scarifying machine came out and he bought F. He said that the machine coming out just when it did prevented from throwing away his seed business entirely. And they have had trouble since. It is true that nature drops sweet clover in the fall instead of the spring but nature is willing to put on 10 bushels of seed instead of 10 pounds. Sweet clover well scarified will give a good stand, usually from 10 to 12 pounds per acre. We have a great many farmers in Iowa who are carrying on a system of rotation in which they want to plow at least a part of their corn land in the fall. When these men put in the biennial sweet clover with the small grain in the spring and plow this under in the fall, they find that it is necessary to plow this land again in the spring. We have repeatedly found cases where the biennial sweet clover was plowed under 8 inches deep in the fall, it came up the next spring and made perfectly satisfactory stands. We have found, therefore, that where we use the biennial sweet clover that it is almost imperative to wait to plow it in the spring. This piles up a lot in the spring plowing. We have many farmers who plant red clover in the small grain and who plow this under in the fall, but I never have believed a man could afford to do that. We recommend the Hubam sweet clover, the annual sort, as a crop So seed with small grain, to be plowed under in the fall. We do not recommend it as a crop to replace the biennial sweet clover, as it is not equal to it where one can wait until spring to plow. Hubam clover seed would have been cheaper than any other seed this season, but un - trtunately we had a bad season and most of the Hubam clover did t mature. The fields under central Illinois conditions as we had em this year, in field after field, which I visited in two days, had all made wonderful growths and in most cases it stood three and a El to four and a half feet in height. That means that we are going have hundreds of thousands of acres where this heavy growth is wed under to be put in corn this year. Much of it has been cut hay. Every man does not appreciate the value of the green crop wed under for soil building purposes. </seg>

The Nebraska State Board of Agriculture again allowed a sum of $400.00 to prepare and put up the educational exhibit. The exhibit, a picture of which is found as frontispiece, dealt with the idea that Nebraska produces large amounts of corn and alfalfa and these two crops make up a very efficient ration for the production of beef. The central part of the exhibit showed the composition of corn, alfalfa and timothy. It brought out the idea that alfalfa and corn make up a balanced feed but that timothy was not equal to alfalfa as a feed to balance corn, due to its lower protein content. That part of the exhibit to the left showed the cost and rate of gain of calves, yearlings, two-year-olds, and three-year-old steers in the feed lot on a ration of corn and alfalfa. The calves were shown to have made a much more economical gain per 100 pounds of feed consumed than had the other lots. . This phase of the exhibit attracted much attention among the livestock men at Chicago.

Life membership in t h»- or - ganisation costs $1.00. Area and Shape of Field 2. The 10 acre field must be in one piece with regular sides so that it may be easily and accurately measured. It may be a part of a larger field, but if so, that portion entered in the contest must be definitely specified at planting time. Time of Determining Yield 3. Yields of corn must be determined sometime between October 20 and December 1. It is recommended that husking be delayed suf - ficiently long to insure satisfactory keeping qualities of the sample. Method of Determining Yield 4. Yields are to be determined as follows: Six or more rows distributed throughout the field, which are truly representative and comprising not less than one half acre in all, are to be husked and weighed in the presence of a local committee of two, appointed co - operatively by the County Agricultural Agent and the Secretary of the Crop Growers Association. This committee must certify to the record blank of the contestant. Detailed methods for determining yield will be furnished. Method of Scoring Contest S. The scoring of the contestants will be on the following basis: Yield per acre 65%, cost per bushel 20%, quality 10%, reports 5Vr.

            <seg id="p343">343 6. The committee when determining the yield shall secure a rep - resentative unselected lot of ear corn weighing exactly 30 lbs. net. This must be shipped at once to the College of Agriculture where the moisture and shelling per cent will be determined. AH yields will be figured on the basis of shelled corn calculated to a uniform mois - ture content of \5 r /, . These samples will also be used in determining quality. 7. The state shall be divided for this contest into three regions with Koals as given in the following outline map or the state. The goal for irrigated fields will be 20 bushels above that of unirrigated fields of each region. Memherahip in Nebraska Maximum Yield &lt; lub 8. Any contestant who equals or exceeds the goal for his section shall be entitled to membership in the "Nebraska Maximum Corn Yield Club." A "recognition of achievement" certificate will be conferred on all Buch successful contestants at the Annual Session of the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association at Lincoln, in January. 9. Each county may have its own contest directed by the County Agent and Farm Bureau, with contestants scored on the same basis as in the state contest. The highest scoring contestant in each county contest having an entry of five or more contestants will be awarded a medal by the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association. Other county premiums may also be awarded by local organizations. M«mI«U for State &lt; humpi.ms 10. The contestants ranking highest in their respective regions shall be awarded medals by the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association. Other state premiums will be awarded. I :«-|m&gt;i « ~ to Association 11. Contestants must mail to the Secretary of the Nebraska Crop Growers Association, not later than December 1, an official blank furnished by the Association, giving a brief history of the cultural methods used, figures on cost of production, and yield per acre in pounds. This must be certified to by the committee referred to in Rules 4 and 5. 12. For further Information, see your county Agricultural Agent or write to P. H.

The number of exhibits was considerably more than in 1923. This corn show, while not large, is proving to be valuable as a medium for displaying the various types of corn that are selected for seed purposes and for emphasizing the correct type for Nebraska; the smooth dimple dented solid ears. Corn shows at Lincoln and over the state offer an opportunity to display and demonstrate the type of corn which has proved to be the best for Nebraska conditions. Com- Fig. 32 — The Grand Champion 10 Ear Exhibit at the 1924 Corn Show parisons and discussions may be made which will show why such a type of corn is best in this state. Charles Grau of Bennington judged the show to the satisfaction of all concerned. He favored and selected for winners the exhibits of dimple dented solid ears with kernels not too deep and starchy. Due to injury to corn by frost there were more ears of poor germination than usual. This eliminated a number of good samples which other - wise were good ones.

            <seg id="p376">376 REPOBT OF NEBKA8KA STATE BOA El) OF AGBICUI.TUBE WEDNESDAY MORNING SESSION January 0, 19JM The Thirty-ninth Annual Convention of the Nebraska Dairymen's Association met in the Dairy Building at the State College of Agri - culture, Lincoln. Nebraska, on Wednesday, January 9, and was called to order at 10:15 A. M. by the President, Mr. E. W. Frost, of Lincoln The President — I am not much of a talker, and am not going to do much talking. I will let the other fellow do the talking. The first speaker on our program I introduce with pleasure — Professor H. P. Davis of the College here. ADIUtKSS OK WELCOME Professor H. P. Davis, Professor of Dairy Husbandry, University of Nebraska Mr. President and Fellow Dairymen: I think Mr. Frost has played a sort of bad trick on all of us. He gets out of the address of welcome and leaves it to me. I want to welcome you here on behalf of the Nebraska Dairymen's Association. We are glad you came out and hope you will stay for all our meetings. I can say on behalf of our Program Committee that they have provided a good lot of talks for you — talks that will be of help to you in your business, and that is what I believe you want. Our Association represents perhaps more than anything else the dairy industry of the state. That is as it should be. It is not out of place at this time that we should take just a little glimpse of how dairying has progressed the last year in Nebraska. You all know that we have been through a period of agricultural depression, a little hard times for a lot of farmers. We are now beginning to see daylight. Now these hard times sometimes react to the benefit of agriculture in general, because they point out better farm arrangement, better organization. In this state it has pointed out particularly the need of more and better dairying. We have got to have in a state as rich as this agriculturally, and in a state that depends as much on agriculture for its prosperity, the right sort of agriculture — a permanent arrangement that is profitable for everyone. And that means a few more dairy cows on every farm. Not that everyone should go into the dairy business on a large scale, but every farm should have a few more dairy cows. </seg>
            <seg id="p377">BEPOBT OV XHlili STATE BOARD OF AOBICVI.TVBK 377 It has been my privilege to meet with several groups of men re - cently that are interested in dairying, not producers perhaps, but some interested in dairying because it would increase the prosperity of the state. I don't know how much you realize that the business men are boosting more and better dairying, — the bankers, for instance. I have had the privilege of meeting with the State Bankers' Association and discussing "What Can We Do to Boost Dairy Interests." There is a reason for this interest. The banker is interested in the prosperity of his patrons because that means prosperity for his bank, and we know from experience that there are too many bankers that have failed because the community was not prosperous. The Bankers' Association met in Omaha and down here, and one of their slogans is "More and Better Dairying." The railroad men met recently in Omaha, and they got behind the same program. These things are significant, and when we think of this in connection with what the business men are doing, you can see that business men appreciate that dairying is the right sort of an industry. And this Association of ours is the leader in the movement for more and better dairying. I would like to give you an illustration of what business men in - terested in dairying are doing. These men- are not people who throw money away in useless advertising. Here is an ad in the Omaha World-Herald, paid for by the Omaha Real Estate Board. This ad is significant. They are paying for this because it will Increase the prosperity of this state, and if that is increased, Omaha will be a better place to live in. It is a matter of hard dollars and cents, and they look to us for a program. This slogan appears in the ad: "1,000,000 Dairy Cows in 1925." I am a little more conservative than this. I would like to see it be true, but am afraid if we do it by 1925 our men and women will not take the right kind of care of their cows. I should like to change this slogan just a little, and have as our goal a million better dairy cows that produce more than those we have today. Nebraska is not a leader in the production of our cows. Our cows produce on an average of 2,528 pounds of milk and 102 pounds of butterfat. When you think that there are many cows that produce in one or two months this much milk and fat, you wonder why these cows are fed for twelve months to produce this amount. Let us change the slogan to "Better Dairy Cows." That means in the first place, cow testing associations to pick out the ones that are particularly efficient. The second thing is better bulls. Nebraska is unfortunately far behind in the use of good sires, and the one greatest single thing we can do is the use of better sires. We can effect im - provement in this way more quickly, more cheaply and more per - manently. </seg>
            <seg id="p378">378 report or nebkaska state board or agriculture I From dairy statistics there is only one good bull for every 200 y cows in the state. This is a blot on our agriculture. We cannot act to make improvement if you follow that practice. If the bull is half the herd (and in most cases he is three-fourths of the herd). It is important that he is good. So I believe that better bulls should accom - pany better cows. The third factor is better care and feeding. Gentlemen, it is quite discouraging to see a man with good cows letting them stand out in this little spell of zero weather in the cornstalks. If he thinks they will get any nourishment, he will be mistaken. My experience is that they decrease 25 to 50 per cent in their production under such con - ditions. If the cow is uncomfortable, and she is uncomfortable out in the wind and cold, she will not produce so well. Do net stint the feed you give your cows. Some people think it Is a waste to feed much grain to dairy cows. I have found that within a reasonable limit, the more feed you give the cow, the more milk you get. If you feed all the roughage she will eat and grain in propor - tion to milk production, you will get good results. I know of one ordinary dairyman who fed grain on pasture. His neighbors thought he was crazy, but he told me that from 24 flrst-calf heifers he will make a net profit of $2,400. I don't know if that paid, or not. Then he cares for his cows, too. He follows this rule: "When the thermometer is below freezing, I keep my cows in; when the thermometer 1b above, I turn them out." Now that is what can be done right here in Nebraska. I think I am not going too far in saying that we can increase production 25 per cent by better care and feeding. The third part of our program is to stimulate more interest among the boys and girls for better dairying. Most of us are familiar with this work in the rural schools. I wonder if you understand that this is building up proper principles for agriculture, for livestock, for dairy - ing. I think we can do nothing better than to stimulate the interests of the boys and girls in this work. It keeps them home and makes them happy, and more than that, the mother and father often get ideas from them. I know one boy in the western part of the state whose father raised hogs — just hogs, that was all. The boy got a good purebred pig in the Pi« Club and learned how to feed it. The first thing you know his pig was growing faster than father's hogs. You know what hap - pened. The father did not want son's pig to get ahead of his, so he began to feed his own pigs better. The Dairymen's Association should be broad. It should represent the producer, the manufacturer, and the consumer. If we can step out and behind our program, we will get results. Let's everybody tout and boost for dairying, and do not let it be said that dairymen behind }n boosting their own industry. </seg>
            <seg id="p379">■w or irntASKA state board or agbicultttre 379 President Frost — Our next speaker, the Hon. A. N. Mathers of fierlng, is unable to be here, but Professor Frandsen has kindly prom - ised to read his message for him. Professor Frandsen — I have this letter from Mr. Mathers, which came by special delivery yesterday: "Dear Mr. Frandsen: This address inclosed, I fully intended to give Wednesday morning at nine o'clock at the Dairymen's meeting. "As you know, we have been in the grip of a severe cold spell which caught me ten days ago in the process of loading several cars of potatoes. With these cars partly loaded and the thermometer down to as low as 30 below zero, you can imagine what a struggle I have had to save those cars. "The weather has moderated today, and we are compelled to con - tinue loading and get these cars moving not later than Wednesday. As this crop moving runs into several thousand dollars, I simply could not get away and come down to the meeting. Had I gotten these potatoes moving ten days ago as I started to do, my plans would have worked out perfectly. "I am deeply grateful to the committee for the invitation to appear on the program and have carefully written the inclosed address, and at the request of Mr. Skinner I have mailed a copy of the address to the Associated Press for publication. "I am sure, Mr. Frandsen, you will do me the favor of reading this address of mine at the Dairymen's meeting in the forenoon of Wednesday." (Signed) A. N. MATHERS. It is bad business to read one's own paper, but I think it is worse to read someone else's paper. But I am sure that you will all want to hear from Mr. Mathers, so I am very glad to accommodate him by attempting to read his message this morning. ADDRKHS OF Mil. A. N. MATHERS BEFORE THE NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION MEETING Ladies and Gentlemen: I deeply appreciate the invitation to ad - dress this Association at this time. The agricultural interest of Nebraska coverB many diversified activi - ties. One of the most important and far-reaching is the dairy business. Certainly all must agree that Nebraska is the home of the dairy cow. Throughout the state there has been great dairy development. This development and growth must continue. The per capita consumption of dairy products throughout the nation is very, very low as compared </seg>
            <seg id="p380">380 BEPOftT Or NEBBA8KA STATE BOARD Or AGUri'I.Tl'BE with other nations. This per capita consumption is increasing rapidly which means a constant future market. The Dairymen's organizations, — those of you and the men and women throughout the state in every capacity that are assisting in the growth and development of Nebraska's dairy business, are indeed rendering the great state of Nebraska a priceless service. return, the state of Nebraska must, through its legislative acity, render every safeguard possible. The greatest assistance is honest tubercular eradication program, ample and in keeping with the needs of the state. Nebraska's dairy development and the health of her people, demand a most prompt and serious tubercular eradica - tion program, the same to be amply financed and properly administered and those that would throw political obstruction against such a program are a hindrance to the state and a menace to the health of the r Bands of boys and girls who must soon represent Nebraska's inship. Personally I have always been a dairy enthusiast. I am given the credit of having purchased and taken to Scotts Bluff County, the first large dairy herd. That was a number of years ago, and always have I, as a member of our County Dairy Association, in every way boosted and worked for the growth of the dairy business in our section. I am fully convinced that the cream can will pay vastly more debts than the gasoline can. Nebraska's greatest agricultural opportunity is the dairy business. The dairy cow is the most potent of all single influences in the building of this, the mightiest nation in all history. Her sons drew the plows which first turned the sod of the new world, hauled to market the products of the field and, with slow energy, moved the chattels and household goods beyond the mountains to new homes farther west. tThey supplied the beef, which is the food of the Anglo-Saxon, a ! that was never conquered since history began. They furnished shoes of the pioneers who trod the unknown wilds and made of them the farmsteads and cities of our present enlightenment. They gave the clothes and robes to protect the pioneer against the destroying blasts of winter and made commerce possible before the railroad was. They covered the chair upon which he sat, filled the mattress upon which he slept and glued together the furniture he used. I The old cow is mother of the whole bovine race and foster mother half the human race. From the roadside weed she manufactures most nourishing of human foods. She is the ready aid of the mer, the pet of the rich man and the ever-present help of the poor. She is the economist of the people and the conservator of their re- Erces. She partakes of the grass of the field and leaves the farmer ler for her presence. </seg>

In all our history the cow has been man's closest benefactor and friend. Upon her products are built the great business interests which center in the stockyards, the creameries, the shoe factories, the harness shops and the mills. Take away the cow and business stops, our graveyards yawn and the wheels of commerce would cease to turn. Foster and care for her and business flourishes, the fertility of the soil is conserved and she becomes the custodian of the nation's prosperity. The shell shock of the world's war has created problems, vastly too intricate for analysis on this occasion. We are, however, so much a part of national and state affairs that we can, for a moment safely consider them. I want first to establish this thought. The crowning achievement of creation was life. Then, must logically follow, that the sustaining of life, is the greatest purpose of human conduct. Then must follow, that those human activities that most directly contribute to the sustaining of life are of greatest fundamental im - portance in our scheme of civilization. We must, therefore, recognize that those that labor in shop or factory, along with those that till the soil, must receive fair and equitable consideration, at the hands of organized society, if all progress and prosperity are to be well founded. Just as the two great granite monuments suspend the massive web - work of the Brooklyn bridge, so too, must the church and school sup - port the frame-work of organized government. At the close of the war, all governments were unsteady. Civiliza - tion was broken. In our own national affairs, the rebuilding of our own national structure was undertaken. There were five fundamental elements that seemed to stand out for consideration. We mention them as foundation stones of our national well-being: Labor, agri - culture, finance, industry and railroads. I want to refer to this great structure of government as the national economic wheelbarrow. The work of reconstruction was begun in 1920. The frame-work of this national economic wheelbarrow, representing finance, was repaired under the guiding influence of the moneyed interests of America, and made exceptionally strong and heavy. Industry may well represent the box of this national wheelbarrow. Under the influence of a high protective tariff, the sides were made high, offering the greatest possible protection to industry. The handles of this economic wheelbarrow may well represent rail - roads. They, too, were given consideration, and under the influence </seg>
            <seg id="p382">382 EEPOBT Or NKBRASKA STATE BOAKD OF ACHCIITIBK of railroad bond holders, the handles were made extra strong and heavy. Thus far we have the national wheelbarrow rebuilt, through gov - ernmental consideration. Made larger and heavier in every particular. I Labor undertakes to lift the load. A load that has increased out proportion to the wages and returns for labor. The wheel of this national economic wheelbarrow representing agriculture, was by governmental agencies neglected. It remains yet today broken and unrepaired. Farmers find themselves paying war - time prices for things they buy, and receiving less than pre-war prices for the commodities they have to sell. tNot only is this a dishonest and unfair position, it is likewise a gerous one. The national economic wheelbarrow will not move unusually heavy load, made heavier by government favoritism, with wheel Agriculture, unrepaired. Our national government must give fair and equitable considera - tion to all the fundamental elements of our business structure, includ - ing finance, industry and railroads, and not the least of these are. labor and agriculture. Our agricultural ills are not alone legislative, neither are these ills alone economic, they are both. Agriculture will prosper again when it receives fair and equitable consideration at the hands of legislature and congress and when agriculture adopts scientific and business-like methods of production and co-operative marketing. Selling wheat at seventy cents per bushel and paying $265.00 for a binder is ruinous to the wheat raiser. In almost every instance the spread between what the farmer receives for what he sells and the price he pays for what he buys, is disastrous, and agriculture can not permanently prosper under these conditions. Until the farmer prospers the state and nation can not permanently prosper. This discrimination against agriculture rt be eliminated and I trust in a large measure it will be done by farmer receiving more for his labor and products. need not a revolution in our national and state governments, need a revolution in statesmanship. In our political life we need exchange self-perpetuating demagogues for sober, sincere statesmen. We need to eliminate from our political affairs, selfish and unscrupulous politicians, who in campaigns travel across the prairies of Nebraska, spreading rank deception and vicious falsehoods faster than truth and honesty can overtake them. tWe need not super men and giants of intellect, but men with the rage of a Roosevelt, the honesty and sincerity of a Lincoln, to put &gt; rigid application our laws and constitution.

But alas, behold now we have government of the people, by the spoilsmen, for the politicians. It is important that we have great political parties, upon which to place responsibility. But political parties must serve the people and not the people serve the parties. There may be undesirables in each party, though we know there are splendid men and women in both. The responsibility of citizenship demands that men and women of whatever political affiliation give serious and thoughtful attention to the political life of state and nation. The great class of average citizens can make their government what they will. The ballot is within their hands. The inevitable question must follow. Will Ne - braska have representative government, with the blessings of efficiency in state affairs, resulting in co-operation and economy, or shall Ne - braska continue to be menaced by the "Spoil System," the last word in political hypocrisy, machine building politics, inefficiency and ex - travagance in government. Permit this personal observation. Only a year ago I was elected by the republicans, endorsed by democrats and progressives, to serve my district in the legislature. Although my first term, I was selected by the republicans, and by the democrats, made the unanimous choice for the speaker of the house. Born and raised in eastern Nebraska, living for the past fourteen years in western Nebraska, I am proud of this state. Just as you are. I have been in nearly every county, know Nebraska, her people and their problems. I have traveled through thirty-six states of the Union, and believe Nebraska and her people, all things considered, superior to any of them. As speaker of the house, I had but one ambition, that was to serve courageously, intelli - gently, and give every man, regardless of creed or political party, a "Square Deal." I have the assurance from over Nebraska that I did that. Because of my position, I have been told, that possibly I possessed common sense, but was void of political sense. Be that as it may, I proclaim my honest convictions. . Some believe in the century old theory, "To the victor belongs the spoils." That is to say, where one political party succeeds another, then forthwith several hundred state employes must be discharged and a new army of inexperienced employes ushered in to make a pretense of learning the state business. The average citizen, the sober minded tax paying public, if perchance he should have need to visit the executive chambers, following a change of administration, is horrified and alarmed, as he sees the reception </seg>

The "Spoil System" is absolutely void of efficiency and totally un - heard of In business. A system succeeding itself, bi-annum after bi - annum in state affairs. A system that rewards, not the competent, efficient and faithful state employes, but instead the professional politicians. We, as tax payers, cry out for relief, while self-seeking demagogues campaign our fair state promising millions in tax reduction, promising every relief from childhood to old age, arousing prejudice and feelings among people, broadcasting falsehoods and mis-statements of fact. Professional &lt; ffice seekers, strong for the people before election and strong for tl.i rnselve* after election. There can be no efficiency, economy and tax reduction, in Nebraska's administrative affairs, until the "Spoil System" is eliminated from state government. Let us remember that in state government, the Constitution pro - vides three distinct departments. The legislative, the executive, the fdicial. Nowhere does it provide for a dictatorship; nowhere does authorize the usurpation of one branch of state government by an- MT. The duties of each are well defined. Nebraska will have honest. Icient. economic and representative state government, when the pro - visions of the constitution are adhered to. When state administrative officers cease the "spectacular," using the nefarious "Spoil System" in t building of self-perpetuating political machines, in the seeking of er and greater political honors. Let us remember also, the significance of those words, first written upon the great seal of the state of Nebraska, "Equality Before the Law." Those that labor by day or month, those that till the soil, those engaged in legitimate enterprises, all are entitled to equal privi - leges under the laws and constitution of our state. May we have co - operation throughout Nebraska — a "Square Deal" to all. Public opinion will go far in righting our problems. The Nebraska prpBs. the newspapers throughout the state, with but few exceptions, are builders of safe and constructive public opinion. May they always appreciate their great responsibility. Let us be ever grateful for their constant and valuable service. Because of thoughtful diligence on the part of women and men everywhere, an increasing interest in public affairs, our political prob - lems, both state and nation, will be as surely solved and solved rightly, as surely as the rays of the summer sun disappear the dew.

Lincoln, Nebraska Mr. President and Members of the Nebraska Dairymen's Associa - tion: In making my annual report it is not as extensive as I would like. Circumstances have been such that I have been compelled to be away from home this summer. However, with our good president and the board of directors, the Association has been well taken care of. Your Legislative Committee did noble work this past year. We were successful in defeating bills that were not for the best interests of the farmer and dairyman, and we were successful in getting the laws passed that were beneficial, such as the Pilled Milk bill, the false advertising of dairy products, etc. The Bovine Tubercular bill that passed was not as liberal as we would have liked; however, it was better than none at all. We had our usual display at the State Pair, and I feel that we reached more people than ever before. The mechanical cow is still working for the Dairy Association, the l»mand keeping up for her all the time. This year we, as usual, helped defray the expenses of the various tudent judging teams. I would like to see more farmers and dairymen members of our Association, for in numbers there is strength. I wish also that you would tell your officers and directors what you would like to have done, for it is difficult for them to do all that they would like to, for when it narrows down to a few to do the thinking and work, it is rather difficult. When you go home, try and get a new member, and help the Association. There are a great many cows shipped into Nebraska, and it is certainly making more dairymen. You can do your part by sending the name of the new dairyman to the Secretary with a dollar and have him become a member. </seg>

I will not take any more of your time, as I know that you are anxious to hear the good talks that are awaiting you. LMr. F. E. Haeger, Beatrice — I move the report of the Secretary be ;pted as read. The motion was seconded and carried WHY THK PI REBRKD Mr. Peder Pedersen, Iowa Farm Bureau liecturer. Cedar Palls, Iowa Ladies and Gentlemen: The question. "Why the Purebred"? really can be answered in one short sentence, and that is "because it is the only way in which you can improve your herd." It is. You can not improve it in any other way. You can go to work, as a good many men have done, buy a few good females with one or two really good cows for foundation stock, and pay good money for them. They they have taken no care in choosing the herd-sire, and the money is thrown out, and they might just as well have buried it. A good herd-sire is at least half the herd. A poor sire is the whole herd, because you breed in through one bull something that you cannot breed out In a lifetime. That is the whole thing in a nut-shell. Being an Iowa farmer I want to warn you: do not waste your money by the hundreds of thousands, as hundreds of Iowa farmers have done. They have gone into Wisconsin and bought cattle by the carload. The men who have bought them, many of them have brought them in to make money off them. They have selected cattle from the best herds, but when it comes to milking, they have bought the worst and cheapest scrubs money can buy. When it comes to females, take the best in your own bunch, and spend your money on good herd-sires. Right over in Iowa we decided to have an experiment, a trial as to what can be done by using good sires. We sent Professor Kildee out to buy three or four very poor cows in Iowa, but he thought he would not find any poor enough for our purpose, so he went down to Arkansas and bought his cows. If you have ever seen any poorer scare-crows than those cows, you have seen something. Then on these cows we used a purebred bull from Wisconsin and nearly doubled the production of the daughter over her dam. In the second cross the increase was nearly more again than in the first cross. </seg>
            <seg id="p387">REPORT Or NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 387 They ran across a purebred Holstein over in New York some year* ago that was just the poorest excuse for a cow they had ever run across. They bought her just to see what could be done. Her name was Olista. and she was the foundation cow of the big family that is one of the best producing families of the breed today. After they got her to Cornell, they gave the best of care and got her to produce 91.4 pounds of fat in one year — this with the best of care and feed. That is not very much. They bred her to a purebred Holstein sire. She had three daugh - ters. For experiment, they took two of them and bred them back to their sire; the third was bred to another sire. It was found that the ones they had bred back to their own sire had done the best. In the fourth cross from old G list a, there was not one cow that has not averaged above 500 pounds of fat. In the sixth cross none less than 600 pounds. I will give you an instance from my own experience. You can not only increase production, but you can increase size. In 1912 when we went into the first cow-testing association, we thought we had some herd. The average weight of our cows was 1,200 to 1,300 pounds, for animals live years old and over. In regard to size today, our herd averages over 1,600 pounds, and this was brought about in ten years. Three of our cows are between 1,800 and 1,900 pounds. Now in regard to production: When we had been in the cow-testing association the first year we found we had a net profit from our cows of $22.23 over cost of feed, and that was all. Six years later we had an average net profit per cow of a little over $103. Since then we have gone up, and during the last years we have been making average net profits of $110 to $129 per year from the herd, including all animals two years old and over. We bought one real good foundation cow — real good. But not to begin with, for we were too poor. For the rest we used all our money in getting good herd-sires. Our best record at first was a little over fourteen pounds of butter for a two-year-old in a week. For a full-aged cow the best record we had was a little over 10,000 pounds of milk. This was in 1912. Last fall through the use of good herd-sires we had a cow that in October broke the state record for milk by producing 29.410.4 pounds of milk. It was the herd-sires that have done it. / That is where people make their worst mistake. They think if they can shave $25 to $50 off the price of a sire, they have saved themselves money. That is where money has been lost. It does not take very much of a sire to increase production five pounds per day. Taken for 300 days, that is 1,500 pounds of milk; and if you keep that cow for ten years, that is some $300 for that cow alone. Can you afford to invest money in scrub bulls? </seg>
            <seg id="p388">388 MTCBT Or If DB ASK A STATE BOARD Or AOIlflLTlTir I cannot give you a better illustration than former Governor Hoard of Wisconsin used at the first meeting he ever addressed in Iowa. This is probably just as true in Nebraska aa in Iowa. He started in by saying, "I have been in the dairy business so long that I understand the dairy cow. On my way here we stopped at a little station, and I saw two herds of cattle, one on one side of the fence, the other on the other side, standing out in the snow. They were having a dis - cussion, and one old bull said. 'This meeting is called in order to talk over what can be done to get a better breed of dairymen.' " I think that what we need more of in Iowa, and what we need more of in Nebraska is a better breed of dairymen. Then we will get better dairy cows. (Applause). fWell. I think I have talked long enough. I will only say this: you must start in slowly, start a bull association. It is necessary to have a good sire every two years. If you go in with four other men. you can afford to get a real good sire. Then *do this: Go into the same herd and buy three or four half-brothers. Take and breed them right down on your herd, and you will breed that into your cows that you can never breed out of them again. Line-breeding is safe breeding. Join a bull association if you are not well enough off that you can afford to buy good sires yourself; get together with four or live others, and buy them in company. (Applause). I'ARK OF MHJi AND CREAM ON THK FARM P. A. Downs, A Militant Professor of Dairy Husbandry, University of Nebraska Mr. President and Members of the Nebraska Dairymen's Associa - tion: It is a great pleasure to me to have the opportunity to talk to you today on the care of milk and cream on the farm. As most of you know, I am a little green in Nebraska, only being out here four months; but possibly with the advantage of coming from a section where we have had these dairy problems for a considerable length of time, I may be able to give you some pointer*. The question of taking care of milk and cream on the farm is one of much importance to us in the dairy industry. One of the reasons why Nebraska dairymen should be interested in this is that Nebraska is a growing dairy state. In the first place, Nebraska is young in the dairy business. Dairy cows are few and far between, comparatively speaking; i. e., it would be rather hard for a creamery of any size to go into this country and accumulate within drawing distance 100,000 pounds of milk a day. That is common in the east. Plant after plant is handling 75.000 to 125.000 pounds of milk daily. For that reason I say that Nebraska is young in the dairy indnstry </seg>
            <seg id="p389">BXPOBT Or NEBBA8KA STATK BOARD OF Ar.Birrl.TI BK 389 In the east it has taken a long time for farmers to get to their present condition, where they reaiixe that quality of the product de - pends upon the care of the milk and cream on the farm. For that reason it seems to me that the dairy farmer here in Nebraska has got 10 pass through several steps or several types of dairy farming before he will get to the type of dairy farming common in Wisconsin and farther east. For instance, here at the present time practically all of your milk goes into butter. A little fluid milk is used around the larger cities. The centralizers get considerable milk, but its quality is not the best. The natural tendency in Nebraska, as the number of cows increase, will be for a smaller creamery nearer the source of supply; but that is not possible until there are more cows to support them. As the number of cows increase, the number of companies in other states looking to this country for opportunity to come out and build plants will increase. The general trend of dairy manufacturing is westward. Tou will find that through all the states where milk is available the larger companies are building plants; they will not come to a country where they cannot get a good quality of milk to work on. So in my estimation it is very advisable that the Nebraska farmers have in mind how to produce a high-grade article by taking care of it on the farm. Another reason why it is important that milk be taken well care of is that the products made from milk are shipped farther than any other perishable material. We ship lemons, oranges, and such things Trom the west coast to the east and to other countries, but I am skeptical if any perishable products are shipped farther than dairy products It was a surprise to me, and I think it will be a surprise to you to find the amount of dairy products exported out of this country every year. I have put the amounts on this chart here. Now exported pro - ducts have to be good. You cannot export poor quality condensed milk or butter, and the quality of these products depends primarily upon the quality of product the farmer delivers to his plant. These figures cover the time from January first to November first of last year: Estimated Pounds Lbs. Exported Milk Required We are competing in the world market for the sale of dairy pro - ducts. Denmark, New Zealand, and the Argentine are sending butter into this country, and we are sending butter out. You will note the amount of powdered milk shipped out this year is low. At a matter lutter 5,422.768 Iheene 8.010.373 'ondensed milk 52,239,083 :vaporated milk 112,855,292 'owdered milk 2,233,277 112.976,52 80.103.73 130,597.70 225,710.58 20.332.77 </seg>
            <seg id="p390">390 BZPOBT OV NEBBA8KA STATE BOABD OF AnBiri'I.Tt'BK of fact, we have imported a good amount of powdered milk this year. Now if we are going to compete with the other markets in this trade, we have got to produce the beat we can. tWe also have competition right here at home. Minnesota, Wisconsin Iowa are farther along in the game than we are in Nebraska. ire is a great deal of difference between the butter made in this state and that made in northern Iowa. North Dakota, they tell me. is coming along very rapidly in the dairy game; South Dakota also. In other words, we have got to keep going if we are going to dispose advantageously of our product. Now let us consider shipping. What are the possibilities of the buyers In Chicago and New York City (if there was a good supply of milk and cream out here) coming out here and shipping our product east? For instance, last winter buyers came into Wisconsin and north - ern Iowa and bought 40 per cent cream and shipped it into New York. At the present time unless the strike is ended, much of the Chicago supply is shipped in from long distances. But, you cannot take ad - vantage of that demand unless you have the quality to supply the demand. And butter from Nebraska does not score highest in the eastern markets. That is partly because most of it has to be shipped long distances. It can, however, be improved by better care on the farm. For example, most of the butter made in this state, especially in the warm months, scores 90 or less. On the average this butter sells for about three to four cents less than 92 score butter. If the quality of the cream was such that butter of 92 score or above could be ob - tained instead of the lower score butter, it would mean an increase of some three million dollars in the value of the butter made in Nebraska. That cannot be done at once, but there is no reason why it cannot be improved. The care of milk and cream on the farm is not a very complicated matter. In the first place, the quality milk that you deliver to your plant will be reflected in the dairy product you manufacture it into. The manufacturing of sweet condensed milk is not all profit. I have seen carloads of it go to the dump because of the combination of poor operation and poor quality milk. I have seen factories where there were piles after piles of empty cans. The poor quality of products are due largely to bacteria and yeast in the milk. If you could take the milk from the cow and put it into a sterile receptacle, it would keep for a long time. Milk as it comes from the cow is the very best product nature can produce, but it is up to us if it goes bad or has off flavors. You must keep bacteria and dirt and molds out of the milk. If you do this, combined with one other simple practice, you will have a very good quality product. The creameryman has to have a method whereby he can judge milk, whether it is clean or dirty; and I thought you would be interested </seg>
            <seg id="p391">REPORT OF REBKA8KA STATE BOARD Or AGRICULTURE 391 in seeing the results of tests on cream here. We buy a little milk, and it is pretty good as a whole. We take one pint of milk and pass it through a cotton filter, thus straining out the dirt. This is simply an indication of the amount of dirt that is in the milk. Whatever dirt is there must have gotten into the milk after milking because the cow did not give it. Here are the disks. (Exhibits chart with samples of cotton through which milk has been filtered). You see it varies from day to day, and most milk contains some dirt. Every bit of dirt that goes into the milk carries with it bacteria, molds and yeasts, and these are responsible for souring, or other defects. If you get dirt into the milk, you can get some out, but not all because all is not solid. Now that manure is more valuable to you on the land than in the milk, perhaps that is one reason why the pastern farmer is cleaner than the western farmer; he needs the manure on his land — you don't as yet. Another source of bacteria are the utensils. But first, how are you going to keep infection out of the milk? The easiest way to keep it out is to see that the cow does not have too much manure hangin* on her flanks, and that her udder is not dirty. In the east they use the same system in the ordinary dairy that they use out here in Robert's Certified Dairy. The udders and tails are washed, the udders are clipped, and the first streams of milk drawn are discarded. That is not practical for you. If you want to go a little farther than just seeing the cow is reasonably clean, you can use a damp cloth to wipe off the udder, and then milk into pails that are very clean. To clean milk utensils, first wash them off with cold water, then wash with a warm solution of some alkali, scald with boiling water, and then turn upside down to dry. Hot water if poured into a milk pan will coagulate the albumin on the tin so it will not come off without scrubbing. It does not make much difference what sort of alkali you use; all of the cleansers on the market are good. The reason I say turn the utensils bottom side up is that bacteria and yeasts have to have lots of moisture to grow. So if you turn the bottom side of the pail up, the water will drain out, and you will have no troub'e. Another thing that is very important is the care of the milking machine. Now the milking machine is an ideal machine, ideally ar - ranged. Theoretically it is perfect; practically, you may judge your - self. The idea is this: We want milk produced without outside con - tamination. So they figured that if they could run the milk through tubes, air would not get to it, and it would be clean. It is true that you can produce milk with a very low bacterial content. This has been demonstrated by certified dairies. If the tank is sterile, the tubes are clean and everything else is clean, it is very nice. The difficulty is to keep it clean. Theoretically the machine is ideal, but the tubes grow old. It doesn't look bad from the outside, but If </seg>

Every time bend it. it will make a few cracks that will hold a few bacteria the milk for them to grow on. This tube (exhibiting old tube) is Impossible to get clean. For that reason the milking machine has to hare new tubes periodically and must be taken care of and kept scrupulously clean. tThe tit-cups, you know, work back and forth. There is only way to keep them clean, and that is to wash them. Back east we e had more grief with milking machines than with any one thing as far as the production of good, clean milk is concerned.- Some sales - men would come along and tell the farmer that he would not have to wash his machine. This would appeal especially to the lady of the house who thought she would not have to wash any utensils. With what results? I can take you through sections where 50 per cent of the machines are hanging on the walls. Women would rather milk than wash the machines. Of course, many men use them and have perfect success. But It is like anything else — it depends upon the interest and experience of the person using them whether they got good results. \.e[ me give you an example of how they are used. I had the good fortune some years a?o of being on the road for one of the big firms looking after the milk on the farms. At times I have had to take a screw-driver to open up the tit-cups. Yes, the farmer was washing them — he dropped them into the water tank after using, and pulled them out when he wanted them. I hare seen youngsters milking, and they would pull off the head of the machine and carry it along down th&lt;&gt; gutter in back of the cows (with the tubes hanging on the ground) until they got to the cow they wanted. Do not get a milking machine and think you will save any time. How should one clean the milking machine? Don't take it all apart every day. The practice back east has been this: Take it apart once a week, and thoroughly clean it. After every milking take the tit - '•11 ps and drop them into a pail of cold water; rinse in that pail. Then (111 the pail with a solution of alkali, and finally draw hot water through the tubes while working the tit-cups up and down. To finish up, draw a pail of clean water containing a disinfectant through the tubes — any kind of disinfectant is all right if you use it according to directions. Does anyone here have a milking machine? What do you rfr. Slocumb, (South Dakota) — We use B-K, and keep our tubes in solution when not in use. LProf. Downs— Yes, that's a good method. Some drop them into water tank; others soak them in a water solution; others use salt; other chlorine of lime alone. All are good, provided you use them as (hey should be. It used to be my Job to look into the farmers' barn and tip over the crock of solution every so often. Some would put in </seg>

After using once, you have usually used up all the disinfecting power. These solutions are built on the principle of free chlorine, and after you have added an organic substance to it, you break down that compound, and the disinfecting power is used up. Some people do as Mr. Slocumb does, keep the tubes in pickle all the time. Others hang them up on the wall to dry. Others keep clean, cold water flowing through the tubes. I believe that if I had a machine, I would hang it up on the wall to dry. When the farmer keeps them in a pickle bath, he will sometimes forget in hot weather, and the pickle becomes a source of untold infection. Then the farmer is making matters worse by using that kind of material. If you do use a pickle tank, Just be sure to change it every other day at least. Member — When you use a pickle, you should first rinse out the lubes, should you not? Prof. Downs — Yes, they should first be rinsed and cleaned before being put into the pickle. Mr. Slocumb — If the rubbers are kept in pickle or in water, they are kept in better shape. Professor Downs — Yes, that is true; they don't get dry so fast. But they may freeze in winter. Your barns out here are not as warm as a rule as those back east. Voice — Yes, we're death on fresh air out here. (Laughter). Prof. Downs — To use a milking machine successfully a man must have a few brains up above. I have seen machines used for years and years — just cheap machines — that give perfectly good satisfaction. Milk run through some of these would be the best that came into the plant. Mr. Slocumb: Is it possible to milk by hand as clean milk as by machine? Prof. Downs: Theoretically no, practically yes. Here is what we must remember. Everything we have around us, everything we have on our hands, everything we touch is covered wtih bacteria or molds. Whatever goes into the milk carries bacteria and mold with it. If you milk into a machine and have it absolutley clean, you have not carried in any outside infection. Hand-milking means practically sure contamination to some extent. The same thing applies to cream. Milk separated through a dirty separator will never be good. The separator must be washed the same as the milking machine If it cannot be washed out twice a day, be sure to rinse out with clean, cold water. The same with the pails. If they cannot be washed out twice dally, at least rinse them with cold water and turn upside down. Another thing I have not spoken of is open-seam pails. Do you use any ordinary pail or a good quality milk pail? The ordinary pail </seg>
            <seg id="p394">394 REPORT Of ■ ■■111 I STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE riter bucket has open seams; the good milk pail does not have seams. Cooling is another very important subject. No matter how much care you take in producing the milk, if you do not take care in cooling it. your work is wasted. A running water tank is the most satisfac - tory for the ordinary farm, and one that every farm can have. The surface coolers some of you may have used. These are little con - trivances that are more bother than they are worth. They have been the source of much trouble back east, for they only areate (take away the odors) and do not cool the milk. But, be sure not to freeze your milk. Milk does not want to stand outside in cold weather any more than your cows do. Another practice that causes much poor quality cream and milk is the mixing of warm and cold milk or cream together. For in - stance, a farmer is separating and cools his cream or keeps his cream can in the water-tank. When he separates a fresh batch, he pours the warm cream in with the cold. This raises the temperature of the old cream to a point where the bacteria can grow, and a poor quality ruct results. If this warm cream had been cooled before mixing the cream in the can, this could have been avoided. tThe quality of your product may be affected by other things too. It y have an oily flavor. Keep your machine oil out of the milk: it good for the machine, but not for the milk. Minnesota farmers market much sweet cream. Many a farmer brings in his cream daily, the night's and the morning's cream in separate cans. And they have only water for cooling their cream. Every farmer who has water can cool his cream if he will take a little care. Ice is a convenience, but is not absolutely necessary. »The question of delivery is also very important. As the number cows in the state increase, this will be made easier. The oftener cream is delivered or shipped, the better it will be. If we cannot, like the Minnesota dairymen, market daily, we can do so twice or three times a week. And we can see that the cream is not allowed to stand where it will get warm. Unfortunately the bacteria or yeasts that grow in cream when warm produce products that cannot be taken out, rfor that reason it is important that cream be kept sweet and free objectionable odors. Mr. Slocumb — In Minnesota they pay ten cents per pound more for sweet cream than for sour. Prof. Downs — In some localities perhaps. In four months while I was making butter in Minnesota, I don't believe I saw more than a dozen batches of sour cream — and that was during the hot months, from May to September. In some sections they pay a bonus for sweet cream; in others, not. The farmer may say, what's the use of taking care of the cream if you don't get more money for it? Well you </seg>
            <seg id="p395">395 ■WT Or NEBBA8KA STATE BOABO Of AliUJCll.TIRE surely will not get more money unless you have a good grade product. When a community can send out word to different channels to the effect that it has 500 cans of sweet cream daily in the community, there will be somebody there to buy it. Here is the way I look at it: The companies realize the necessity of having a high-grade product, and they say to the farmer who brings in sour cream, "You get ten cents less for your cream." Member — What is the difference in the keeping qualities of sweet cream butter and sour cream butter? Prof. Downs The peculiarity of sour cream as it comes from the fanner is not all due to the acid produced. It is not all due to bacteria. One thing we have to contend with is off flavors. If the cream is simply soured from lactic acid, it does not matter much in the butter; but if it is sour and has off flavors, it is hard to handle. But to answer your question directly: Sweet cream butter keeps much longer than butter made from sour cream. For instance, the butter imported from Denmark and the butter that we export to Africa and South America is all probably sweet cream butter. Prof. A. L. Haecker, (Lincoln) — I don't exactly agree with you that all the good butter is sent out. It is often poor butter, and we buy good butter. The balance of trade is against us, and it Is well for us to know that the tariff should be from 8 to 10 cents more than it is today, because they are bringing in butter from New Zealand, Africa and Denmark by several millions of pounds. Nebraska doe's not make the best butter, but we make butter that sells as high as any because we know how to put it on the market. We make the best butter in the world from about the poorest grade of cream; and we get it on the market in the best way. Prof. Downs — You farmers are more than lucky that you have the organizations out here that you have. A farmer in the east who produced as poor quality cream as you do would be out of luck. He would not have a way to get rid of it. The quality of the milk or cream produced may be good, but the quality of the cream as manu - factured, I know is bad. Member — Just let me cite one incident along that line. I got off at a little town out state one day and saw a bunch of cream cans standing on the station truck. I looked into them, and do you know, those cans had been in transit so long that rats were swimming around in them. Prof. Downs — Daily delivery is impossible in sparsely settled sec - tions. You cannot deliver two cans of cream 15 to 20 miles every day. Out here 89 or 90 is the average score of butter. If you use your own cream that comes from your own separators, you may get a butter that scored 92. The advantage of the factory where they can get a lot of cream is this: they can grade or sort. In Kansas, for Instance, </seg>

About four states are doing that, and paying different prices for the different grades of cream. Money makes a difference, and the increased price for better grades will make the farmer take better care of his milk and cream and produce less poor stuff. ANNOUNCEMENT r. H. P. Davis, Department of Dairy Husbandry, University of Nebraska As you know, it has always been the custom for the Dairymen's Association for a number of years to have a judging contest as part of the meetings. This custom will be continued, and the contest will be held Friday morning in the dairy barn. Rewards have in the fast been ribbons and cash prizes. This year we have medals. There are C classes, one for students, and one for breeders. These classes ge the same stock, but they do not compete against each other. We want you to try judging. We feel that we are particularly fortunate in being able to say that Professor Fitch of the Kansas Agricultural College will act as official judge of the contest. Tomorrow night is the joint banquet of the dairy and live stock breeders, to be held at the Lincoln Hotel. Let me urge upon you that if you want to have a good time, you go to that banquet. Secretary Palm — I am here now ready to take the dues for this year, and would be glad to have all of you come up and b««MM members for the coming year. Resolved: 1. That the Association express its appreciation to the officers of the Nebraska Dairymen's Association and to the Dairy Husbandry De - partment for their helpful service. 2. That the Association express its appreciation for the adequate and commodious accommodations provided for this year's meeting to the committee of organized agriculture. 3. That the Association express its thanks to the speakers and those taking part on the program, especially the children and teachers of the Clinton school. rkport of &lt;x&gt;mmittki&lt;: ox rbsolitioxs </seg>

Success in dairy farming depends largely upon three factors— the man, the feed and the cow. As a dairyman, the man must have a keen interest in the business and must strive to keep himself informed as to the factors that will influence his profit. A dairyman may be likened to a factory manager and it is just as necessary that he watch the details of his factory or plant as it is for the manager of an automobile factory or coal mine or creamery. He must know the conditions under which he is operating and must have an accurate knowledge of his workers so that he can eliminate or discharge those that are not efficient. His is a big job and it is one that cannot be mastered in a year or two. As a grower and buyer of feeds he must provide suitable rations which will furnish proper food nutrient for his cows at a low cost. While both of these points are important, it is probable that success will come only in proportion to the kind of cows a man keeps. I am not referring to the breed of cows but to the ability of those animals to produce. I have often been asked in my work as to which is the best breed of dairy cattle. That is a difficult question to answer from a general point of view, because one might just as well attempt to say which is the best automobile, tractor, binder or header. There are several breeds of dairy cattle that have been developed along par - ticular lines for many years and they have been found entirely satis - factory from a breed standpoint. Some of these breeds in view of their characteristics, are suited for particular purposes and conditions. They are all satisfactory if properly handled. In choosing a breed or a purebred bull to grade up a herd, one should study the conditions and opportunities for a particular breed in his locality. Dairy cattle have been developed for one particular purpose — a purpose which I think we often lose sight of and which should have more consideration. What is the dairy cow for and what is our purpose in feeding and milking her? Some of you will, no doubt, say because of the milk she gives. This is true, but it is not the fundamental principle which I want to get before you as the one big reason why we need better dairy cows. Cows, like hogs, chickens, sheep, etc., are feed markets. Some of you grow corn, and buy tankage and shorts to feed your hogs. If you have good foundation stock of hogs that will grow and mature quickly on a minimum quantity of feed, you have no doubt found the hog to be a profitable feed market. The same thing holds true for beef cattle and poultry or other livestock. Some of you raise wheat. If your land is properly plowed or disked and good seed are planted and conditions are favorable, you have no doubt found wheat a fair </seg>
            <seg id="p399">399 BXPOBT OF NEBBASKA STATE BOARD OF AGMCT7LTUBK market for your labor and investment. After your hogs, or your steers, or your wheat has been finished for market or harvested, you spend considerable time and worry about the best place to market these crops. If Jones offers you 7 cents a pound r'or your hogs and Smith offers 8 cents, there is not much question as to who gets your hogs. If one buyer offers 70 cents per bushel for your wheat and another bids 72 cents, the latter will undoubtedly get your wheat. I wonder how many of us really look at and size up our cows in this manner. They are market for our alfalfa and silage, our corn, bran and cottonseed meal. It has been definitely proved beyond a doubt that some cows will return a higher yield of milk for the feed that they consume and labor that is expended upon them than others. In other words, some cows are good feed markets, while others are poor ones. If one cow will return $2 from a dollar's worth of feed and another only $l,we scarcely notice it. Here is a difference of a dollar every time each of these cows eat a dollar's worth of feed, and frequently within a year, this dif - ference is enough to buy something of considerable value. I believe much more attention would be given to the kind of cows that are kept if we thought of them as markets for our labor, silage, alfalfa, and other feeds. Here is one place where the farmer may have the market largely under his control. The Agricultural Colleges and dairy specialists are often criticised because they are trying to increase the production of cows and are losing sight of, or not paying enough attention to the marketing or selling of the milk or cream. That may be true in certain cases, but it must be remembered that the keeping of dairy cows or any class of livestock is a marketing proposition, because this livestock is the market for a large portion of our farm crops. By keeping more efficient animals we are marketing these crops to better advantage. According to Professor Davis of your Dairy Department, dairymen of Nebraska are furnishing care and feed for 500,000 milk cows. He has informed me further that the average butterfat production of these cows is only 102 pounds per year. Under most conditions this production is entirely too low for profit. It indicates that a large quantity of good feed is being wasted, because giving expensive feeds to infficient dairy cows is like shoveling coal into the fire-box of a leaky boiler. It is a well known fact with dairymen, that profitable production of butterfat or. in other words, an efficient dairy herd must be made up of high producing cows. Suppose, for example, that you have two cows in your barn at home standing side by side. You have kept feed and milk records for the last year. One of these cows produced 100 pounds of butterfat (about the average for the cow in Nebraska), while the other produced 300 pounds of butterfat. The low producing cow has taken up just as much of your time and labor as the higher </seg>
            <seg id="p400">400 producing cow and has also occupied just as much room in your barn. In other words, the overhead on the two animals has been the same. You have no doubt fed these cows in the same manner — each one getting a big fork full of hay and a small measure of grain a day, in the winter, and pasture during the summer. If it costs $100 a year to feed and care for each one of these cows, including interest on the investment, overhead expense and labor, and butterfat sold for an average of 50 cents per pound, the higher producing cow has re - turned a profit of $50 while the 100-pound cow has been kept at a loss of $50, or in other words, you have practically paid $50 for the privilege of milking and feeding the lower producer. If your herd was made up of ten cows and half of them were of the kind that produced only 100 pounds of butterfat and the other five produced 300 pounds each, you would be far better off to get rid of the five lower producing ones. It is true you would not have as much cream or milk to sell but your profits would be greater. As it is, you are spending valuable time and feed on five low producing cows and they are eating up the profit of the five good producers. This is not a far fetched idea or example but is an illustration of what is taking place in thousands of herds in the United States. Considering the fact that the average cow in Nebraska produces only 102 pounds of butterfat per year, I think it is a good example of exactly the condition of the majority of the dairy cows. You have 500,000 milk cows. Probably fully one-half of them are such low producers that they are unprofitable and bring down your average. and eat up the profits of the other half. I do not mean to convey the idea that you should immediately sell or slaughter half the milk cows in your state, but I do want to bring out the fact that it would be easily possible for you to double the average production of your cows in a few years if you every one would start breeding up and selecting individuals for your herds. During the last five or six years I have been in position to come in contact with a great many dairymen in different parts of the east and middle west. I have visited their farms, bought their cattle and dis - cussed with them their problems. I have come to the conclusion that the production of milk or butterfat is just like any other business; there is keen competition, but plenty of opportunity for those who go at it in the right way. Those men who are keeping low producing cows as a basis for their business are not making a success and they become discouraged and take up some other line of work. It is those that are building up their herds to high and economical production that are doing well in the dairy business because they have more efficient cows for marketing their feed. The Dairy Division of the U. S. Department of Agriculture has recently made a study of the feed and production records of several thousand cows in cow testing associations in the United States. So tar more than 18,000 of these records have been tabulated and studied. </seg>
            <seg id="p401">BKFOftT Or NKRBANKA STATE BOARD OF AGBK'ri.TCRK 401 These records showed that the cows giving 100 pounds of butterfat a year produced an average income above feed cost of about $10; at 200 pounds of butterfat a year the income above feed cost averaged about $42; at 300 pounds a year the income averaged $72 and at 400 pounds of butterfat the average income was about $106 per year per cow. While the cows in the 400 pound class averaged four times as much in production as those in the 100 pound class, they gave an income over feed cost that was more than ten times as great. These figures represent actual facts and can not be disputed. Bach one of the 18,000 records represent the amount of butterfat given in a year's time and the amount of feed consumed. Some of these records were obtained from cows in your own and neighboring states. According to these figures, if the cows in Nebraska, by better feed - ing, breeding and handling, could be gotten to the point where they would produce twice as much as they produce now, the income above feed cost would be four times as great as it is at the present time. Before leaving Washington I was interested in examining some records we have, showing the relation between production and income over feed cost of 302 cows in Nebraska herds. These records were (ibtained during 1916 and 1917 and are as follows: (practically doubled) the income above feed cost jumped from $13.98 to $48.10, or about 3H times as great. It must be remembered that these cows were in herds of cow testing association members and not one of them produced as low as the average given for the state. The average cow in the United States is estimated to produce 160 pounds of butterfat a year, and you can see that you dairymen in Nebraska are in position to make a mighty big improvement. The building up of your Nebraska herds to higher production should not be a difficult job, because you are starting at a comparatively low plane of production. It is a comparatively easy matter to build up a herd of cows from a low average of 102 pounds of butterfat to 175 or Range of Pounds Pounds Income . F. Production Number of Milk of B. F.

It is a real proposition but not impossible to get a herd up to and maintain an average of 400 pounds or butterfat. It is the dairyman that has his herd on such a high producing basis that has the big job, because he will find it difficult to maintain his high production of from 400 to 500 pounds of fat. There are. no doubt, some herds in Nebraska that are getting high average production, but there are entirely too many that are producing below the profitable point. I am not pointing out these things in a spirit of criticism but for the purpose of getting before you the great need in your state as well as most other states, and in your herds at home — the necessity of better cows if dairying is to be more profitable. It is not, in my opinion, a question of more cows, but a matter of better or more efficient cows in order that you may have a more profitable market for your feed. It must be remembered that as a state you must com - pete with other states that have better cows than Nebraska, and thai as individual farmers you must compete with other dairymen that have more economical producing herds. It is a well established principle of big business that in order to meet competition and have big sales, an article or product should be produced at the cheapest cost consistent with good quality. Any num - ber of business enterprises make this their golden rule. Can we, as dairymen, make the same claim for our dairy cows as a whole? If we are getting 50 cents per pound for butterfat produced with 100 pound cows, and it costs us 4 8 cents a pound to produce it, our profit is two cents. If we can produce the same amount with a less number of 175 or 200 pound cows at a cost of only 30 or 35 cents per pound, that is good business and is one way of making more money. Let us take it as an established fact then, that the farms of Nebraska need better milk cows in order that a better market will be had for your feed. It would be poor judgment on my part to outline your problems and not offer some means or methods of solving them. The important question is how are better cows to be obtained. Should they be pur - chased outright or is it best to raise them yourselves? The amount of milk or butterfat a cow will give depends upon first, how good a cow she is and, second, upon how skillfully she is fed and managed. The two go hand in hand and can not be separated. The best feeder in the world with the best feeds can not induce a cow to give a large flow of milk if she was not born with the ability to give a large amount of milk. On the other hand, the most highly bred dairy cow can not produce heavily unless she is provided with proper feed and good care and management. Good breeding merely makes it possible to get high production. If every farmer in Nebraska were provided now with a herd of cows with ability to produce like Segis Pietertje Prospect, or Countess Prue, or any other world's record </seg>
            <seg id="p403">403 EKPOCT Or NKBEABKA STATE BOARD OK AUHK'l I.TIKK dairy cow, the average results would be somewhat better but still low, because the limiting factor in many herds is as often a lack of proper feeding as it is the ability of the animals to produce. It is not my intention to discuss feeding, but I am pointing it out as one essential basis for developing your cows. Feed them well, so that they can have a chance to show what their ability or breeding is — then if they do not come up to the proper standard of production — get rid of them. An example of what feeding will do is related of one of your Nebraska dairymen who was a member of a cow testing association. He owned a cow called "Prohibition," so named because she was dry so much of the time; at least it appeared so to the owner, because she would give milk for only five to six months and then go dry. Feed was quite expensive at the time. When her owner found out from the first year's record that she had been dry for six months and had produced only 3,351 pounds of milk, he decided that she should go to the stockyards at Omaha, when she went dry again. So, as soon as the cow freshened, the owner began to feed her a little grain to keep her in condition so that it would not take so long to fatten her for beef after she went dry. But "Prohibition" did not go dry. With that extra she kept milking month after month and at the end of the year she had 7,043 pounds of milk to her credit. The owner did not sell her but he changed her name. The dairymen in Nebraska have distinct feeding problems that are different from other sections of the country, but in my opinion you raise, and can raise, the kind of feeds that form the basis of economical production. Your College of Agriculture has solved and is solving these problems for you and you should keep in close contact with their work. Some of you, no doubt, are interested in going into the dairy busi - ness, as a means of obtaining some ready cash or money. As has been pointed out, proper feeding is important in this connection, but closely related to this is selection of the best cows in your herd today, and eliminating the poor ones. Professor C. H. Eckles of the University of Minnesota is quoted as saying that "Using any cow for dairy pur - poses, merely because she happens to be a female of the bovine species, is about as sensible as it would be to select a president by drawing a name from a box containing the names of all the men in the country." The importance of selecting cows is known by most dairymen but for various reasons a large number do not do it. You can all readily understand that the only basis for intelligent selection or feeding is a reliable system of record keeping. Experience has shown that but few dairy farmers will keep regular systematic records necessary in order to know what each cow is doing. The system need not be elab - orate or of such a nature that it will require a great deal of time. But it should be such that at the end of each day or week or month you can look at your record sheet and see what the cows are doing. Your agricultural college, no doubt, has sheets for the purpose of putting down daily or weekly weights of milk from each individual </seg>
            <seg id="p404">404 ■KFOBT OV ifOBASKA STATE BOARD OT AORICII.TIRK cow. It takes only a few seconds to weigh and record the quantity of milk from each cow and mark it on a sheet tacked up in the barn for that purpose. Once a month a fair sample of the milk should be tested for butterfat and that is used as a basis for figuring the amounts of butterfat produced by individual animals. The amount of feed eaten is recorded in the same way and the cows should be fed according to the old reliable rules of production. If you feed your grain in a half gallon measure, find out how much this measureful of grain weighs and use that as a basis for giving the cows the amount they should have. Weigh a fork full of silage and hay once a week and use this as a guide in feeding the roughage. A set of scales for weighing milk and feed will pay for themselves many times over if they are used. Knowing the amount of feed consumed and the amount of milk and butterfat given will then form the basis which will enable you to have the necessary information for selecting your better or profitable cows and culling out the unprofitable ones. Fortunately the cow testing association of which you are no doubt familiar, offers a practical way of getting the information at a comparatively small cost considering the value of the information. S There are several of these associations now operating in Nebraska the present time, but you need more of them. According to our records in the Dairy Division at Washington of five cow testing asso - ciations in your state with yearly feed and production records of ap - proximately 1,000 cows, the average production was 7.560 pounds of milk and 278 pounds of butterfat. The income above feed cost was $72.67. Compare this production with the 102 pounds of fat as given for the production of an average cow in the state. Has not then the cow testing association proved itself a practical scheme for the dairy - men to adopt as a means of better selection and feeding of his cows? I do not wish to convey the idea that the cow testing association is adaptable to every one milking cows, because many of you do not have a large enough herd to justify being in one. But your extension .de - partment of the university is no doubt attempting to solve this matter in a satisfactory way. The big thing is to get the necessary informa - tion relative to your cows, so as to be able to select those you should keep, and get rid of those that are requiring too high a board bill. Reference was made a few moments ago to the effect that the profitableness of cows depended not only upon the care and feed they receive, but also upon their ability to give large quantities. In other words a good cow must be born with the ability for high production. This fact forms the basis or background for all the breeding work that has been done, with dairy cattle, and the problem is uppermost in the minds of dairymen today. It is generally said that considering all our cows, we have to raise at present three in order to get two that are satisfactory. The big point of our breeding practice should be then to raise a higher percentage of big producers. Every farmer who has given careful thought to herd improvement realizes that the main </seg>
            <seg id="p405">BEPOKT OF NKBBAHKA STATE BOAKD OF AOBICULTUBE 405 chance for rapid improvement of a herd is in the use of better blood through the sire. No one recommends the purchase of a high class cow and an inferior bull as a means of Improving a herd. If you have ten cows in your herd, you will, theoretically, get ten calves a year by the bull and only one calf a year from each cow. In other word*, the blood of the sire will be piled up ten times greater than will the blood of any one cow. That is the fundamental reason why we should look upon the sire as offering the quickest and most practical means of getting good producing blood in our dairy herds. It is stated that less than 8 per cent of the milk cows in Nebraska are bred to purebred dairy bulls. With a total of 500,000 this means that only 40,000 of these cows are bred to bulls that we have the slightest reason to believe will sire calves that will be higher producers than their dams. If half the calves are heifers you have on that basis but 20.000 heifers sired by purebred bulls coming on each year to replace your milk cows. It is estimated that dairymen must raise three cows in order to get two that are profitable. It must be remembered that they are raised at great expense and that two years must elapse before any return can be expected. If we go to this expense of raising them, we should have some assurance that they will be profitable. The fact that they are sired by good purebred bulls should furnish this assurance in a large degree. Then instead of only two out of every three being profitable, we can get 4 out of 5 or 6 out of 7. It seems to me that this is your greatest problem in Nebraska so far as profitable dairying is concerned, to Increase the number of desirable purebred bulls to breed your cows to so that there will be more of these better heifers coming on each year to replace the 102 pound cows. The Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station demonstrated in a strik - ing manner the value of purebred bulls as a means of Increasing herd production. A number of native cows were brought to Iowa from an isolated section in Arkansas After they were brought to Ames, they were given good feed and care and milk and butterfat records were kept. The original cows averaged 3,991 pounds of milk and 187 pounds of fat. Thirteen daughters of these original cows sired by purebred bulls averaged 5,566 pounds of milk and 253 pounds of butterfat. Cows of the second generation or granddaughters of the old original Arkansas cows averaged 358 pounds of fat. The production of the granddaughters was almost double that of the original scrub cows due almost entirely to the purebred bulls used. The same result or even better can be gotten on a large number of farms in Nebraska. If herds are not large enough to warrant the keeping of a good purebred bull, it is often possible for a group of farmers to go together and form a bull association. This type of organization was designed to meet the needs of the farmer with a small number of cows, but It is by no means limited to him. It enables one to have the use of high class purebred bulls over a period of years at a small cost. There </seg>
            <seg id="p406">406 MNBT OF NKBBA8KA STATE BOARD OF AGBICl I.TIRE are over 200 of these in the United States at the present time. That they are getting results is shown by records of the daughters of these bulls as compared with the dams. So far 70 daughters of association bulls (all that are available for study), have produced 22 per cent more milk and 25 per cent more butterfat than their dams, on an average. Nebraska has two of these associations at the present time. I recently attended a meeting of farmers in an eastern state Incident to scrub bull eradication. This meeting was in the nature of a scrub bull trial. A scrub bull was led out before a jury composed of farmers and was tried, convicted and sentenced to death upon various charges, including larceny, highway robbery, and pauperism. The argument against the scrub bull brought out the fact that among other things he was a robber because he had robbed the owner of the profit of the dairy business in just as sure a manner as if he had held him up at the point of a gun. He was pronounced a pauper because he not only had a roving disposition himself, but caused his owner to rove from one type of farming to another and made a pauper out of him. The argument in favor of the scrub bull was to the effect that he was a harmless creature and required less feed and care than a purebred. Then, too, he was good to eat, and if all the scrub bulls tn the county were eliminated, the butcher that bought them would be compelled to take his family to the poor farm and the public taxes necessarily have to be increased to take care of them. I do not wish to be understood as saying that all purebred bulls are valuable in increasing production of a herd. Some of them are no better than scrubs, but in general, especially when used on ordinary herds, a purebred bull can be relied upon to better the production of that herd. If it is a purebred or high producing herd, there are other things to consider. In my opinion the cheapest and most practical plan for the average dairy farmer to follow is to feed and manage properly the cows he has now so as to find out what they will do. Select the better cows and breed them to good purebred bulls of the breed he desires. Select the best heifers from the best cows and build up your herd on this basis. It may appear somewhat slow but it is sure and one has an opportunity to learn as he builds up his business. It would be a good plan, no doubt, if circumstances warrant, to purchase one or several good pure - bred cows as a foundation and use these and their offspring as the basis for a purebred herd. The grade cows can be gradually gotten rid of as purebreds take their place. This method can be followed at a small outlay of capital and is sound. There is absolutely no question but that in general purebred cattle are more profitable than scrubs and grades, if they are properly handled. But too many farmers have bought purebreds without understanding that they must be given just as good if not better feed and care than scrubs if they are to be profit - able. Consequently, they were disappointed and have no use for pure - bred cattle. Purebred cattle represent years of breeding and effort </seg>
            <seg id="p407">■EPorr or Nebraska state boa an of agbicvlti'be 407 of breeders and they can be relied upon to yield more profitably than ordinary cowa if handled in the right manner. Good purebred cows can be bought at reasonable prices but it is probable that they can be raised as cheaply in Nebraska as anywhere. The main point is to get your foundation for starting. The grade cow is valuable from the stand - point of utility and her worth is quite largely based upon the amount of purebred blood she has in her breeding. Probably the majority of dairy farmers in Nebraska will find her sufficient for their purposes. It takes several years of hard work and worry to build up a herd of high producing dairy cows. It takes even more effort and thought to maintain high production after it is gotten. Dairy farming is a business that one must stay with over a period of years in order to get the greatest results. One cannot leave his cows in the pasture to suckle calves during the summer and expect heavy milk production from them during the winter. The dairy business is in favorable circumstances but at the same time there are many difficult problems to be overcome. But chief among these problems is the large number of low producing cows, the result of improper feeding, management and breeding. It makes no dif - ference whether we are concerned with one or all of them, the main thing we need to do is to create a better market for our feed through good cows. This can be done by finding out what our cows are doing and using this information as a basis for making them more efficient. Mr. Slocumb — What is the danger of getting tuberculosis in here by buying cows in Wisconsin and Minnesota? Mr. Dawson — I don't know, but I suppose that Nebraska is like other states — you have it here already, just as much as in other states. Member — One-half of one per cent. Mr. Dawson — Here is what I think. I don't know your situation, whether there is any accredited herd work being done at this present time. But if you go away, you will buy the cattle T. B. tested. Buy out of accredited herds as nearly as you can. Pay a little more if necessary. When you do get these tuberculosis-free cattle, it is prob - ably not a good policy to bring them in and put them in a herd that you know is not free from T. B. In some places it is practically impossible to get cattle under the T. B. test plan, but that is the basis we always used in Pennsylvania. We did not think it good policy to bring them in and put them in herds that are not tuberculin tested either. The best way to buy cattle is to go right out on the farm where they are raised. See what kind of feed they are getting, what con - ditions they are raised under, how the calves are coming on. I like to see them before I buy. I certainly would not buy cows from brokers. In this day and age you can go to sections where you can buy cattle out of tested herds. </seg>

Lawrltaon, (Lincoln) — Less than a year ago a certain man in this state bought eight cows and in less than a year seven reacted. Member — I know of a case where a big bunch of cows were shipped here from Wisconsin, and seventeen of them reacted. Mr. Dawson — But mighty few farmers are going to plug cows. Can you not get a 60-day re-test law? Lawritson — It is possible to buy them on the 60-day re-test irantee. As for the 17 head mentioned by the gentleman over there, is a case that the state veterinarian and secretary of agriculture of Wisconsin are tracing at the present time. It was found that the cattle had been bought on the market in St. Paul and furnished with ear tags by a crooked veterinarian. The veterinarian who tested the cattle declared they had been plugged. They tested O. K. in Wisconsin and reacted on 60-day re-test in Nebraska. The only way we have to avoid this is to stay away from crooked dealers. I had a similar experience the first time I went to Wisconsin to buy cattle. Then I went to the extension department at the University of Madison, and they put me in touch with reliable parties; and since then we have not had any trouble. Out of twenty carloads shipped in we have had only one reactor. AGRICU1/TURAL EXTENSION SERVICE M. N. Lftwritson, Extension Dairy Husbandman University of Nebraska Ladies and Gentlemen: I am not going to take a great deal of your time. But just following Mr. Dawson's remarks I want to explain to you the help that is available to you through the Agricultural Ex - tension Service of the University of Nebraska. He has suggested the problems that we have here — problems of better dairying, better feed - ing, breeding and weeding out poor cows. We are offering as a means of assistance in doing that, help in organizing cow-testing and cooperative bull associations in your com - munity, provided there is enough interest among the farmers to put it on a workable basis. tin addition to this we have been holding a series of Feeding Schools help the farmers learn proper feeding methods. In the last three or four months I have found that a surprisingly large number of farmers pay little attention to methods of feeding. Just last Friday I was out at a meeting some 75' miles from here.

The cattle stood out there in a bunch, huddled up with all four feet so close they could have been put in a bushel basket. I leave it to you If they were comfortable and could produce milk efficiently under such conditions. Farmers do not give enough attention to the care and feeding of their cows. They expect to buy good cows that have been in the hands of real dairymen, take them home and subject them to conditions such as 'I have described and get good results from them. We feel it is largely a matter of helping farmers in this matter and also in getting better sires, to improve dairying in Nebraska. In addition to this we are carrying on projects in boys' and girls' calf clubs, which goes back to what Mr. Pedersen said this morning — we must get more efficient dairymen. In the past year we have organized 20 calf clubs with 180 boys and girls enrolled. We try to get purebred calves for them if possible. We are getting some very good results from club work. We find that often the children have taught their fathers how to take better care of his cows, and that the parents are becoming more interested in dairying because of the interest shown by the boys and girls in club work. In addition, we have two cooperative bull associations and four cow testing associations in the state. We hope to double that number the coming year. If any of you men think there is a possibility of carrying out such a project in your community, we would be glad to have suggestions. In regard to foundation stock, as Mr. Dawson said, it is sometimes advisable to ship in good stock. It is not always a practical method for a farmer to use to develop his entire herd, but it is necessary to get good stock to start with. If not, then take the best you have and by the use of purebred bulls you can soon increase the production of your herd. If you have any questions, I will be glad to talk it over with yon personally, but will not take the time of the meeting for that. If you want to know more about these projects — boys' and girls' clubs, cow - testing associations, bull associations, etc. — I will be more than glad to explain them to you and help you in establishing such projects in your community.

            <seg id="p410">410 REPOBT (W NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGBICUI TV*E VALUE OF A PURE BRED SIRE H. P. Davis, Department of Dairy Husbandry, University of Nebraska tlfr. Chairman, Gentlemen: I am not going to give you one of le orations (you know the kind) on the value of everything in eral. But inasmuch as we have had some little experience h«re with the use of good sires and what they have been able to accomplish in 25 years or something like that, it occurred to me you might be just a little bit interested in what some of our bulls have done. You all realize that there is a difference between sires; some are good and some are poor, and as far as we know now there are no signs that are going to point out which is which. There is only one way that is certain, and that is to breed them and test out their daughters and see if they are better than their dams. That all brings up the point that you have to have records in order to determine the value of the sire. If you don't know what your cows are producing, how can you tell if you have made any improvement? Mr. Dawson brought up a very good illustration of a man in this state who has bred his herd to an average production of 9,000 pounds of milk per year. Some of you who have reached that stage or are trying to reach it, realize that that is a pretty high average to reach. I imagine that this man is beginning to wonder where he is going to get his sires. You can tell a little from the pedigree. If you have a Holstein bull, for instance, with females in his ancestry having 30 to 40 pound records, there is good reason to believe the animal will be a good transmitter. Jerseys, and other breeds in proportion. Unless, how - ever, you have records, you can not tell anything about the animal. We used to figure that the average bull is 99% of the herd- That is pretty high, but I can tell you this: A good bull is the making, a poor one the breaking of your herd. RYou may think some people can always pick out a good animal, is not humanly possible to do it. One of the most constructive breeders that I know of in this country picked only two good ones out of seven. So just because some of these bulls have daughters that pro - duce less than their dams, don't blame the man who selected them. Here we will discuss the Holsteins. I thought you might be in - terested in this list. Fifteen or twenty years ago the college had a bull that was called Prince Ormsby Mercedes De Kol. This bull only had three daughters, according to our records. These daughters were out of three cracking good cows: one was old La May, at one time state champion in her class; another was Katy Gerben, and the third was Allie Lincoln. The average production of the three dams was </seg>
            <seg id="p411">411 ■STOBT Or HDU8KA STATE BOARD OF AGRICII.TI BE 20,218 pounds of milk and 649 pounds of fat, equal to 811 pounds of 80&lt;&gt; butter. Now they were pretty good cows. Prince Ormsby was bred to these cows, and his daughters produced an average of 23,332 pounds of milk and 875 pounds of fat. This was an average increase per cow of 3,114 pounds of milk and 226 pounds of fat, or 282 pounds of 80% butter. I think that was a great bull. I only wish we had 25 daughters of that bull instead of three. I think that was a very good record. No, I can't tell you who selected this bull. What's that? You think Frandsen selected him? No? Mr. Frost says Mr. Haecker selected this bull, and Mr. Haecker admits it. Whoever did it ought to have the credit of doing a good job of selection. The next bull was King Segis Hengerveld De Vale, a son of old King Segis out of Hengerveld De Kol. You Holstein men realize that this is as good breeding as can be selected. He was also bred to good cows. They had an average production of over 15,000 pounds of milk containing 517 pounds of fat. His five daughters averaged 18,466 pounds of milk with 623 pounds of fat. This was an average milk increase of 3,458 pounds and fat 105 pounds. In other words the production of the daughters over their dams was increased as much as the average cow in this state produces. That bull was well worth while. Suppose the daughters had only three lactation periods; 105 times three times five would be something over 1,500 pounds of fat that you can just count came from that bull. There is no better way to get something cheap than just pulling it out of the atmosphere in that way. I think Mr. Frandsen selected him. King Segis Hengerveld De Vale was bred to a daughter of Prince Ormsby Mercedes De Kol, and from that cross resulted a bull that some have described as a cross between a camel and a kangaroo. At any rate he was not a very good-looking bull, but he was used in the herd, and there were nine daughters before he was sold. All of his daughters have not yet made their best records. The average of their young records is 17,839 pounds of milk containing 630 pounds of butterfat. Since that average was compiled, two others have made records, one with 805 pounds of fat and the other with 780 pounds of fat. Their dams averaged 426 pounds, making an average Increase per cow of 5,212 pounds of milk and 204 pounds of fat. That was a good bull, and yet you have to beg some men to buy them. I bought his full brother, and we have 14 daughters of this bull or his full brother. The brother is not particularly handsome, but he is a good transmitter. Another bull on the basis of his first eight daughters shows an increase of 204 pounds of fat in the first lactation period. Only two of his daughters have finished their second lactations, one making a record of 790 pounds fat, the other 682 pounds of fat. Daughters of </seg>

That briefly gives an idea of what luck we have had in using bulls here. We have been rather fortunate in this. With a herd such as we have here, where we are trying to eliminate from the Holstein herd all two-year-olds that do not make 400 pounds of fat the bull question is a problem. That is a high average, and we may make a mistake. But we are going to keep to our standard and we figure that some day we will have a herd that will average over 600 pounds fat. When you have a herd with as high records as we have here, it is a matter of hundreds of dollars if you use the wrong bull. But it shows— and I think mighty well— the value we can place on a good bull, on a proven sire. We ought to pay more attention to keeping records. I haven't any doubt that in this state there have been hundreds of bulls just as good as these, but if you have no records on the dams and on the daughters, how can you tell? There is only one way to Judge a bull, and that is on the basis of how his daughters compare with their dams. I should like to have the experience of some of you dairymen in picking out bulls. I have daughters of a bull that I am sure are poorer than their dams. Needless to say, the bull will be gone and the daughters will be gone before long. But if we can figure out some way of getting a sure bull, we will make the biggest step for - ward ever discovered. I think bull associations are proving wonderful helps because they can keep the bull longer after his value is proven. The average man does not like to keep a bull after he is two or three years old. He thinks he gets mean. But at that you cannot know much about his daughters. Most of us cannot keep two or three or four bulls around the place. But if we can join hands with our neighbors, we can solve this problem. Those, gentlemen, are some of the things that are going to make these things a success. Along with these better bulls Mr. Dawson mentioned one thing I have been very disturbed about, and that is the prevalence of the scrub, or grade, bull. We have enough scrub purebreds without scrubby grades. Some of you remember how we tried the scrub bull and condemned him to sausage, or something like that, last year. Just think: When you realize that in this state only about one dairy cow in some 200 is bred to a purebred bull, how can you expect much advances? Over in Illinois they are carrying on what they call an "Allied Dairy Campaign." They figure that the only way of cleaning up the dairy business is to get rid of the scrub bull. You might think a state as progressive as Illinois would not have any scrubs, but they have. Bankers and business men there have gotten together to get </seg>
            <seg id="p413">413 rid of the scrub bulls, either by shooting, condemning or in some way disposing of them. I wonder if that sort of a campaign would not work out in this state. We must not only declare war on the scrub bulls, but we must actually get rid of them. The bull gets 50% of his characteristics from his parents; he gets 50% from the rest of his ancestry. If he is a scrub, he has 100% scrub back of him; that he will sire a good cow is not likely. If he is a grade, he is only 50% good characteristics, and the scrub breeding will also come out. The best thing we can do is to breed up our cattle by the use of better sires. In buying cattle we have one thing to remember: that the indi - viduals that are for sale are the ones the other fellow does not care for. He is not selling you his best stuff. He would not stay in the business very long if he did. So when you buy his stuff, they may be better than yours, but they are not the best in his herd. I have an ambition that I don't know how soon it will be realized. But, I have an ambition that instead of our going outside of the state, others will be coming in here for good bulls. Member — What should a good bull for a bull association cost? Prof. Davis — I believe you can buy from $150 to $200 bulls that would help almost any ordinary herd, that would increase its produc - tion 25%. If you cannot get one for that, let us know and we will go out and see if we cannot arrange with the breeders of the state to get a bull for you at that price. You can buy a calf, of course, but many don't like to grow out a calf. Most men don't grow them out right. How much should a twelve-months'-old Holstein male weigh? 1,100 to 1,200 pounds? You don't see many that will weigh more than 500 to 600 pounds. Now I will tell you why it is difficult to get a bull association going. The average man — and I count myself among the average men — wants about 90% of all the benefits from everything. When you have a cooperative organization, everyone has to sacrifice a little something in convenience, etc. It is the same thing that prevents other co - operative organizations from being successful when they are not so.

To my certain knowledge I don't believe we have had 500 in the last three years. There seems to be a reason, and I believe the changes made in the by-laws three years ago were the reason. Ice cream men, milk dealers, and others were ruled out of the organization. They had given their time and money to make it a bigger organization for </seg>
            <seg id="p416">416 REPOBT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOABO OF AGEICULTVK bigger, better dairying in Nebraska. There had been no playing of politics, no playing for place, but just to build up the industry. I first became acquainted with the organization 27 years ago when I met Mr. E. F. Howe presiding as president of this association. Later my president was presented, and eight years ago I was president. Only a few years ago O. A. Severe of Palmyra was president, and a real president he was. The idea, as I understand it, is that the dairymen's Association is no different from the livestock, or egg associations, and others of similar nature. It is whatever cooperates together to make it a bigger, better part of agriculture, whatever it may be. Why or how or what can any man have to say why. after all these years of the growth and development and increase in size and im - portance of this organization, a by-law of that nature was put into the laws of the association, except to keep out a certain bunch of men to their detriment and to the advantage of a bunch of other men? S There is no man present this morning who does not, way down his heart, wish for the growth of this association. Why then should any one class, or any two or three classes of men, be cut out from being members when they are able to pay their dues and give time and speak a good word for it when they come? I cannot see but what that is playing narrow politics. That is why I am in favor of this amendment offered in the resolutions. I trust you will see the reason for the change, for widening the scope rather than narrow - ing it down. I trust you will see its wide scope and approve it. and put it on the laws where It may help make the Association bigger and better. Voice — Like Joe, I began to attend these meetings when I attended the university many years ago. Very few students we then had that took dairying, and very little equipment, too — we had an old battered tester in the basement of Experiment Station Hall. We all attended the meetings of the Association, and we met Mr. Glissman, former Governor Hoard of Wisconsin, A. J. Glover and all these other fellows who had been in the business before that time. For a time we paid just our annual dues. Then we took out life-memberships. Now what I want to say is this: At first I did not notice that I didn't receive notice of the meetings of this association. Then I began to make note of the fact and to think, "Am I a member of this Associa - tion, or am I not?" I began to inquire around. I had paid my dues. If I am to be voted out of the organization, I think I should have a rebate. (Laughter). Another Voice — They didn't know how long you would live, and so they didn't know how much to rebate. (More laughter). Chas. Schwager, (Omaha) — I want to talk a bit about a meeting to be held in Omaha. Tonight the Real Estate Board has a meeting </seg>
            <seg id="p417">BEPOBT Or XEBBA8KA STATE BOARD OT AOBKTI.TIBK 417 for the purpose of determining what they can do to boost dairying. Why should these men be interested in dairying? We recently heard a banker from Scottsbluff talk, and he said that grocers out there said they would not trust a man unless he had milk cows. The same way with bankers; the fellow milking cows had no trouble borrowing money. It seems to me that you want the business men behind you. Paul Hunter, (Lincoln) — I have not been acquainted with the Association so long. I first got in in 1906 when I came to the School of Agriculture. I milked cows then, and am still interested in cows. Yet most of my time is devoted to the Franklin Ice Cream Company where I am working. A few years ago we organized a Lancaster County Cow Testing Association. The men did not come in with enough money. Where did they go for help? To this Association? No, they went to the creameries. Why? Because they are just as interested in movements of this kind as any dairyman is. When that law went into effect, I had sold Mr. Schwanger, Mr. Stevenson of Seward, and numberless other ice cream men, wholesale creamery men, and others, life memberships in the Association. What of them? When you ruled out these men, you ruled out the best backing the dairy interests have in this state. Mr. Holcomb — The motion to amend Article six, Section one, of the by-laws is before the meeting. All in favor say aye. Contrary, the same. Motion is carried. We will now have the report of the Nominating Committee Report of Committee on Nominations Mr. Haeger: The Committee on Nominations offers the following names for your consideration: W. H. Swartsley.

If not, we will now have the pleasure of hearing Professor Kildee talk on "Building by Breeding." BUILDING BY BRKKDINU H. H. Kildee, Department of Animal Imlm.tr) , Iowa Mate College, Aims Mr. Chairman, Fellow Dairymen: I expected to follow my good friend, Peder Pederaen, on the program, and therefore was not en - tirely awake to the situation when your chairman called upon me, since I usually follow Mr. Pedersen, and have been doing so for quite a number of years. And my friends tell me that in doing so I am in a good track and on the right road. We have been on the road a good many times together, and this is the first time I have preceded him. Now you are saving the best for the last. bMr. Pedersen has always beat me by going on first, and then ng my stories and leaving me pretty well In a hole. One time, iking I would get ahead of him. I drove to a meeting and we stopped at a farm house near the creamery for lunch. While there the little daughter of the house started to talk about the nice fatherly man who had been ahead of me. (Laughter). Well, I thought I would get ahead of him anyway, so I gave the child 25 cents for the lunch. But she said, "Why, the other man gave me 75 cents." (Laughter). The little girl was about the size of my own little girl, so I picked her up and gave her a kiss. Then she looked up at me and said, "Why, the other man kissed mamma, too." (More laughter). I realize the situation I am in this morning. Most of the men who attend the meetings such as this are the men who are leaders in the dairy industry, in one way or another. So we find that what we say should be something that can be taken up not as advice to these par - ticular individuals, who sit in the seats, but something that they can take and carry on to others. So I want you to realize that I don't think that I am telling you a great deal new in the way of facts and figures, but I hope it can be spread out and help the dairy industry of the state. One of the preceding speakers mentioned Nebraska as a dairy state. I have thought much along this line. With your alfalfa it seems to me that Nebraska is destined to rank much higher among dairy states than she does at the present time. A certain man passed a field where some colored boys were playing baseball, and one of the colored chaps came out to get a ball. The man asked, "How la the game coming?" "Pretty good, sah." "What's </seg>
            <seg id="p419">betobt or nebkaska state board or agricultvbk 419 the score?" "26 to 0," the youth replied. "In your favor?" asked the man. "No. sah," replied the youth. "Why, that's too bad," the man rejoined. "Oh, no sah, you Be our sides hasn't come to bat yet." (Laughter). So I think it is with the dairy industry in Nebraska. You have in this state men who rank high in the whole United States. I can see here men whom I have seen exhibiting in the large shows: others who are leaders in other fields. Here in the University you have and have had men such as Haecker, Frandsen and Davis, who rank high in dairy circles. I have been around at many colleges and universities, too, and I want to Bay this is the best dairy building I have ever been in, and I believe many features of this building will be copied in many places. Mr. Pedersen said to me a little bit ago, "There is one thing here we should have at Ames." I said, "What is that?" Mr. Pedersen said, "The Dairy Building." And I certainly hope we will have one in the near future. In regard to the problem I will discuss, "Building Up the Dairy Herd." it is not necessary to take your time in discussing why the dairy industry is growing in popularity. From the standpoint of feed utility, from the standpoint of diversified agriculture, and from the point of furnishing regular income, the dairy industry leads all our industries. In the State of Iowa you have heard reports of conditions following the abnormal rise in farm land, and then the sudden depression when our state was the hardest hit. But it has come back at least 100% in the last 18 months. In communities where the dairy cow furnished the market for roughages and grain, bankers and farmers were in much better condition than elsewhere. Several things determine the profits derived from dairy farming: 1. The quality of milk produced. Butter fat and cleanliness are not the only factors to always emphasize. We must also pay much attention to 2. The health of the herd, giving much consideration to the valuable milk. Our mid-western this work. We find that most of our states are health of the herds that produce this states, however, are just getting into 3. The cost of production, here considerations. Also feed and management of the herd. Quantity of milk and butterfat are and methods employed in the care 4. The prices obtained for the dairy products. This depends upon the quality and upon the matter of cooperation in marketing. Someone referred to the matter of cooperation in the dairy industry. This is all-important. We don't want the cooperation that would result tf we had what the exact wording of a bill introduced into our neighbor- </seg>
            <seg id="p420">420 RKPOBT Or NKBIASKA STATE BOARD OF AGBICIXTUBE ing state of Kansas would indicate. It reads something like this: "When two trains meet at a railroad crossing or intersection, both must stop; but neither may proceed until the other has passed on." We don't want that kind of cooperation. (Laughter). To produce economically we must have the right kind of cows, the right kind of care, feed and management. The cows must be large r economical producers, free from tuberculosis and abortion. Then them a chance to produce milk and butterfat economically. Building up such a herd is not a matter of happenstance; it is not B thing that can take place instantaneously. Years ago there were ople who believed in spontaneous generation, and one of the old rhymes that I am sure practically all of us remember said, that if a reader would put into a bureau drawer some kernels of corn and then shut it a while, when you draw it out you would find it full of mice. (Laughter). Building up a dairy herd is a matter that takes some time, if we are going to have cows that continue to produce economically and profitably. Hen have often tried to buy a good herd, men who have not been in the dairy business before, who have not had training and practical knowledge to go ahead right; and they have been dis - appointed. Former Governor Hoard once said, "Don't go into the dairy busi - ness, but grow into it." The people who do this are doing the right thing; they are learning the business as they develop their herds. That does not mean that we should not buy for our herds good dairy cows. On the other hand, we find that grading up has possibilities, but for most of us it is rather a slow method. Most men prefer to buy a few good cows and then use good sires, and find that this is the best method. We have at present in the United States cows that average 4,000 pounds of milk, and 150 to 160 pounds of butterfat. Among 21,000 cows in cow-testing associations the average production was 6,077 pounds milk and 248 pounds fat. We find in these associations cows that are the result of better feeding and management, as well as of breeding — weeding out the poorer ones and using good sires. Even these are not producing as well as they could. In some herds we see well-bred cows that don't have a chance to produce as well as they can. The tester in one association gave this example: In one herd he argued with the owner to feed so as to get his cows to produce better (the man was feeding timothy hay and ear corn). The tester urged feeding a mixture of 400 pounds corn, 300 pounds ground oats, and 100 pounds oilmeal, to be fed at the rate of 1 pound to every 3% pounds of milk. In three months, by weeding out the poorest cow and following this feeding schedule, the financial statement of this herd changed from $1.58 profit per cow to a net profit of $14.04 per cow In a month. </seg>
            <seg id="p421">421 UTOBT Or NEBKASKA STATE BOARD OP ACBlril.TIRK I believe, speaking relative to conditions as I know them in Iowa, that one of the great reasons why we did not make more money from our cow on the farms is because the fanner feeds all cows alike regard - leu of production. Now, let us consider building up by a good sire. As one dairyman put it, you pay for a good sire whether you use him or not. If you use a cheap scrub, you are paying for the price of a good purebred in the annual loss of production of the cows in your herd. I think you are all familiar with the farm survey in Illinois, re - ported by Professor Clark in charge of extension work. A survey of 577 farms was made in 1912, and record was made of the effect of the type of bull upon fie labor income from the farm. Where purebred bulls were used for from one to five years, the labor income per farm was $799. Where purebreds had been used for from five to ten years, the income was $1,102 annually. Where grade sires were used from one to four years, the labor Income was $404; where used for five to ten years, the labor income was $108; and where scrubs had been used for from five to ten years, the labor income was a minus $243. In other words, $243 was paid out for the privilege of operating and milking cows from a scrub bull. Some years ago at the Iowa Experiment Station work was started to determine the value of purebred dairy sires. To serve as a founda - tion to this work, cows were brought in from Arkansas — not because we have no poor cows in Iowa, but because these cows coming from Arkansas were not of the same breeding as our cows in Iowa (more or less beef breeding ) ; they were as near the native stock as one could get. The cows were called family cows, because one would give enough milk for one family a short time after freshening. Then the cow is turned out to rough it again. J"his photograph shows the looks of one of the cows when she reached Ames. You see she has a pendulous udder, sloping rump, narrow chest, and a dejected appearance in general. She produced the first year about 2,750 pounds milk and some 130 pounds of fat. Here is the same cow after three years' work at the college (laughter), after being given a chance to build up her body by the feeding of silage, grain and good hay. She gave 5.556 pounds milk and 244 pounds fat, an increase of over 102% in milk and 86.8% fat. In other words, here is the same cow before and after taking — a practical course in humanity. Member — How old a cow was she at the start? Prof. Kildee — All the cows were supposed to be three years old when we began the experiment. The sires we used were purebreds of various breeds, but no attempt was made to compare the breeds. The experiment simply shows the results of using purebred sires. We used purebred Holsteins, Jerseys and Guernseys; no Ayrshires because we had no Ayrshires at the college at that time. </seg>
            <seg id="p422">422 EBPOKT or xebba.sk a state board or ai;bici i.ti bk Member — What was the early breeding of these cows years ago? Prof. Kildee — Some of them showed line-back characteristics. One shows white about the head and many of her descendants showed the white-face of the Hereford. No attention has been paid to selection, however. Here are some of the results we got. One scrub cow averaged for seven lactation periods 3,740 pounds milk and 160 pounds fat — a little below the average cow in this country in milk production and a little above in fat. Her daughter by a purebred Holstein bull produced 6.700 pounds milk and 282 pounds fat. an increase of 79% in milk and %%% in fat. The third generation was a typical Holstein and produced 9,400 pounds of milk and 347 pounds of fat, an increase of over 151', in milk and 100% in fat over the old scrub. The fourth generation produced 265% more milk and 192% more fat than did the scrub great granddam. To be perfectly honest and fair with you, we had one instance in the work where a heifer sired by a purebred bull did not produce as much as did her scrub dam. This shows clearly to us that selection must be practiced, that attention must be given to see that the sire is a good purebred and comes from a record cow. One of the scrub cows produced 4,382 pounds of milk and 383 pounds of fat. Her daughter by the purebred sire produced 3% teas milk and 2% less fat than did the dam. The third generation heifer, however, showed real Guernsey characteristics and produced 9,160 pounds milk and 4 35 pounds fat, more than enough to put her into the Advanced Registry, had she been eligible. We could go on and see the same thing happen in Jersey breeding. One of the scrub cows produced 5,200 pounds of milk and 233 pounds of fat. Her daughter by the purebred Jersey sire, you see show* a great improvement in conformation. She produced 9,650 pounds of milk containing 379 pounds of fat, enough to put her into the Register of Merit. The third generation heifer gave over 400 pounds of fat. We find that in the case of all breeds in this work, that the daughters of the scrub cows and purebred sires averaged 44% more milk and 40% more butterfat, while the granddaughters produced 101% more milk and 96% more fat. This work simply illustrates the possibility of grading up from a scrub foundation through the use of good sires. There are people who would say this is not necessary because we have many farmers in the country that give ample evidence of the same thing. That is true, but you find that when they start to improve their stock, they begin to give better care, better management and better feed. In this experiment we have the factors all the same, and it shows very well the possibility of building up a herd from a scrub foundation. </seg>
            <seg id="p423">423 REFOBT Or NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE There are other speakers on your program, but there is just one thing more I want to bring up. In the case of men who are breeding purebreds, this (act should be borne in mind: Purebred breeders could accomplish more in improving, the common stock on our farms if they would practice these points emphasized by most successful breeders: 1. Be honest in all transactions. This should be emphasized in all of the work. 2. Choose a breed and stay by it. We have in our state men who have started out with Holsteins, and changed to another breed. No progress has been made; they have just floundered around. 3. Breed with the correct type in mind. We are all familiar with the work the Holstein Association is doing in fixing breed type. The Guernseys are taking up the same work. The majority of our breeders are emphasizing type with performance in making selection of animals. 4. Study pedigrees in connection with the animal. Don't hold the pedigree so close that you cannot see the animal that goes with the pedigree. A man once took me to task for putting in second place a bull that had cost $5,000. He said the man who had the first-prize bull would sell him for only $100. Why? Well, he held the pedigree of the $5,000 bull so close to his face that he did not see the animal that went with It. 5. Develop calves and young stock properly. Grow them out in good shape. 6. Boost good livestock of all kinds in your community. If you will do this, you will be a winner by it, and your community will gain even more. 7. Advertise judiciously. 8. Exhibit at your county, state and larger shows. Make friends for your Nebraska cattle by exhibiting at the larger shows. County fairs, however, are considered just as important by many because with - out local support good results cannot be secured. 9. Play fair. If customers are satisfied with their purchases, you will make a much greater success of your enterprise. In looking over the crowd I see there is one thought uppermost in the minds of each of you. You are thinking as did a young lady who visited our farm recently with her escort. Evidently she did not know very much about milking. After watching the boys milk a while, she said to her escort, "I begin to see it's a simple process; I can see how it is done. But tell me how you stop it off." Laughter and applause). </seg>
            <seg id="p424">424 B0OBT V NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICVI Tl UK DAIRYING AS A FARMER'S BUSINESS Peder Pederaen, Iowa Farm Bureau Lecturer, Cedar Falls, Iowa Mr. Chairman, Gentlemen: I cannot help but think of a Terse that one of the pioneer dairymen in Iowa always used to commence with. It goes like this — and it was old Charley Nelson of Waverly who used it: What care I for town or cities, What care I for office grand? Give me a wife and a half-dozen children, A HoUtein cow and a piece of land. RI think when he said that, he said the whole thing. You know r a fact that a good many people have come to our farm and asked, "How have you done to get to where you are today?" I tell them, all the same: "I don't care how hard up you are. If you can't raise money enough to get started in big, there are three things to do, and then you are safe: (1) buy an ensilage cutter (2) buy a good Holstein cow, and (3) buy a manure spreader. Hitch the ensilage cutter in front and the manure spreader behind the cow, and you have a com - bination that will have the world. (Applause). I am going to touch somewhat on my own experience. Some think that in order to get into the business, you have to have a lot of money. I will tell you something here because I see that Professor Kildee is present. Ames has made one mistake. When they have gone out with the students on dairy trips and visited dairy farms, they have visited only the millionaire dairy farmers where they have everything money can buy. Then the youngsters in school have come back disgusted more than before because they say they can never have it all. What they should do is to take the young fellow out to some of the other places where men have made good without much money; go visit people that are making money and have started out with nothing, so that the youngsters can see that they can do the same thing. That will put the heart into them. But if you show them a place that is run by very wealthy men, where everything you see is top-notch, you give them an idea that nothing can be done unless there is money behind it. Now I will give you a few of my own experiences, and will try to give you a few ways we have followed and found wise. Not because they cannot be improved upon. They can. My boys are doing that right now. You have seen men, wheat-growers, who are raising grain and losing money every year and are kicking everybody but themselves. Well, someone ought to come along and give those fellows a good, swift kick, and get them into the right way of thinking. It is their own fault instead of anybody else's. A good many farmers understand </seg>
            <seg id="p425">REPOBT OF NEBKA8KA STATE HOARD OK AGBKTI.Tl BK 425 nothing about their own problems. They understand as little as the boy had about his first Sunday school lesson. The teacher told him about creation, how Adam went to sleep and God took one of his ribs and made it into a beautiful woman, and so he got his wife. Well, there was company for dinner that day, and so the little boy's mamma didn't look after him as much as she should and he had too many sweets. Soon he had a pain. His mother saw it and said, "Johnny, what is wrong? You look ready to cry." "Oh, mamma, I'm so sick: I'm afraid I'm going to have a wife." (Laughter). The average farmer has just as much understanding of his own problems as that. Well, we decided on one thing right away, that our children were to have a good education. I landed in Philadelphia in 1891 with $2.31 in my pocket. Someone stole most of it, and after I bought a little lunch, I had only 15 cents in money — not enough to pay for an - other meal. So I had to get to work or starve. The first work I got was to take a job as dish-washer in a Philadelphia hotel for $2 a week and board. That saved me from starving. Two weeks later I was on a farm. I had later the position as superintendent or manager of some of the biggest farms in the east, and I hold recommendations from the Pennsylvania Agricultural College and from the Department of Agriculture in Washington and from Professor Willard of the Normal School there. We had to have a fixed income in those days to get our boys through college. We spent all the money we had, and in fact when the last boy graduated, I was $342 in debt with no more security than our reputa - tion. Then we commenced to farm. The first farm we rented with sufficient stock and implements. I laid out a plan to cover 25 years of work and invited one of my sons to look it over. He asked me if I was not too old to plan so far ahead. I told him I ought to be good for fifty years of hard knocks yet. Well, he went in with me. In the meantime we had moved from Wisconsin to Iowa. In 1912 we owed $6,000, but we had security. If anyone asked me what banks I used, I would say I was not using the banks — they were using me. For the last three years we have owed no one one cent, and have had a little in the bank. Now I am going to tell you how we got into the business when we had nothing to start with. The first barn we had had plenty of ventilation. You could stand on one side and throw a hat through it. And it was dark. The first thing I did was to cut out spaces for light. We could not afford window glass, so we put laths over the spaces. Then we bought three rolls of tar paper and put it on all the cracks. The barn was light, well-ventilated but not draughty, and warm when we got through with it; and it cost me just about $30. If you can go faster than I am telling you we did, that is so much better for you. I am just telling you how you can get along without </seg>
            <seg id="p426">426 RKPOBT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AC.Biril T1RK money. You must let your dairy barn have plenty of light and plenty of ventilation. Now you may think it does not need cleaning, but do clean it good once a day anyway. It's better to clean it twice. Light, ventilation and cleanliness — it doesn't cost much to provide these things. And then you must get a silo. If anyone can get along without silage, well and good. I can't do it, but I will not say nobody can. For the ensilage I will say plant soybeans in the corn, using a double hopper. You will find that if you have a good stand of soybeans, your ensilage will have 2% more protein than if you have none. For feeds, attempt to raise all you can on your own farm, and figure on giving your cows all they can eat twice a day, and all the clover hay they will eat at any time. fNezt for the foundation of your feed. (This is just my experience: has worked well for us). Use ground corn-and-cob meal for the main feed, and then ground oats. We always figure on buying three tons of linseed meal and two of cottonseed meal each year. We buy a little bran sometimes, but we raise the soybeans right in the corn for protein. If you are spending all for feed, you will be in a bad fix; you cannot eat your cake and have it too. Try to raise all you can, and what you have to buy is only protein; and the more you can raise of that, the better you will be off financially. Now you say, I have no buildings. You have got to have them, but you can do very much with very little money, as I have told you before. But there is one thing you must have. You must get a good dairy sire, and that is the first money you spend for your stock. I don't care if you have got money, don't go and buy a herd. Raise the herd yourself. Put your money on your sire. Use the best males you have, or the best you can get in the neighborhood. If you have a little money left, buy a few good grade or purebred cows for foundation stock. If you are starting in as a green-horn, leave the purebreds alone except as sire. As you go into the business, let the herd carry you and not you carry the herd. That is the idea. Make improvements as fast as you can. Our first purebred we bought in 1911. In 1912 we bought another with her year-old daughter. In 1914 we bought a two-year-old heifer heavy with calf. In 1919 we sold the last three grades, and we sold them for more money than we paid for the three purebreds to start out with. We bought on the bargain counter because we did not have the money. What we have done, you can do. You may not be quite as strong as I was (because I used to be pretty strong); but you are just as strong to milk. You can climb just as much. But don't go into the business and think you can make money without working. You cannot do it. </seg>
            <seg id="p427">BCFOBT OF NKBBAHKA STATE HOARD Or AORICl I.TVBK 427 The folks that say they will not go and make a slave of themselves, nine times out of ten they will slave for someone else their whole life through. Which is better? Slave for yourself or for someone else? The dairy cow can do it. The dairy cow will do it. But you have to use your own brains. I cannot understand that some people will drown every year on God's earth, and not lift one finger to help themselves. The dairy business reminds me somewhat of a colored camp meeting. The preacher was trying to raise some money for a fence for improving the cemetery, but without much success. After - wards he visited Raatus, the richest man in the congregation, and asked why he did not give something toward the fence. Rastus replied, "Well. I don't see any sense in it. Those that are in there don't want to come out, and those that are out don't want to get in." It's the same way with dairying; those in don't want to get out, and those out. don't want to get in. (Laughter). Some say when the cows give no milk there is no use to feed the herd. That is where you are wrong. You lay the foundation for the cow's production while she is dry. Have your calves come in in the fall. In the winter you have plenty of time, and that is when butterfat brings money. Give plenty of feed. You get a far better calf, and a stronger calf, and your cow will do the best you can expect her to do. Some say feed according to the amount of milk given. Just try to feed a real cow 1 pound of grain to every 3 % pounds of milk she gives, and it will not be long before you have no cow. The best cow we have gives some 96 pounds of milk a day now. Feed her one pound to every three pounds, and she will not live. But feed her so much before freshening that she has sufficient flesh on her body that she can draw on her own fat when she needs. I see from the chart over there that Holstein calves should weigh from 90 to 100 pounds. I don't believe we ever had a calf that weighed less than 95 pounds. They averaged 116% pounds. The biggest we ever had weighed 143 pounds. Now I know I am going to catch it. When you commence to milk the cow, the first milk you draw, don't give the calf the milk. Feed it to the cow, and put just enough bran in to make a good thin swill. Why? Because in 99 cases out of 100 if the cow gets milk fever, she has also constipation of the bowels, and if you feed this bran and milk, you will never have constipation. The second reason is the calf. When you get the second milking, take two pounds off. The calf will be good and hungry. Have you ever tried to break a calf to drink? When you wait until the second milking, the calf will learn to drink readily. The calf will be better off. and you will be a great deal better Christian than you ever were in your life. (Laughter). More calves are killed by overfeeding during the first two weeks than from all other causes combined. The first thing to give the calf Is </seg>
            <seg id="p428">428 EETOBT Or 1TEBBA8KA STATE BOARD OF AGBICI'l.Tl'RK good, clean clover hay — or alfalfa. The next thing is whole oats. Give all they will eat; don't stint them. But don't leave anything laying about to get moldy. When the calf gets two months or six weeks old, give him a little bit of oilmeal in the milk — not too much. Give him plenty of roughage. If you have a spring calf, keep it in and feed it inside in the summer-time. Plenty of roughage will make the calf grow and give it a good capacity. Now I am not throwing any stones at any other diary breeds. All are good. It has happened that in my work I have been on places where we handled Milking Shorthorns, Brown Swiss, Jerseys, Guern - seys, and Holsteins. The moment I started farming for myself. I chose Holsteins, and here are the three reasons: 1. The Holstein cow gives the most milk. 2. She can eat the most roughage 3. Her calves are easiest to raise. I don't care which breed you use. But when you breed, line-breed. Don't oiitcroBs. Don't jump from one family to another. You may spend money on good sires, and keep outcrossing from one family to another; and you will get nowhere. If you use sires with 50% the same pedigree, you can figure out the results almost as easy as two times two are four. If you cannot buy a good sire as soon as you need him, join with your neighbor, or form a bull association and change the bulls around You can breed back to their own granddaughters if necessary. What is more, if you get half-brothers, you get good results from breeding — provided you have seen the individuals as well as the papers when you bought them. Using these half brothers will not hurt if you have good individuals. If you use a poor sire, you breed something into the animals you never in your life can breed out of them again. Here briefly is what I would advise: LI. Make the necessary changes in building to be successful. Light, tilation, cleanliness and a silo are essential. 2. Get your purebred sire, and line-breed. If later on you want to go into a different line of breeding, buy a bull carrying at least 50 r / r of the blood-lines you have been using, and the other 50% the blood-lines you would like to get into your herd. That way you can change your blood-lines, and still be safe; and it is the only way. 3. Then take care of your cows. If there is anything I would like to see passed, it Is that the man who buys a good dairy cow and then lets her go outside in bad weather — I would like to see a law passed making that a criminal offense punishable by one week in jail. breaking stone, and on bread and water. (Laughter). If you don't take care of your cow, she will be nothing but a bag of bones. 4. Feed them right, and feed them with your own feed. Go as fast as you can. I don't care if you can go faster than I did. I can </seg>
            <seg id="p429">429 start my boys faster than I started. That is all right. Only let me drive this point home: Use your head. If you make a mistake, don't blame anybody but yourself. This is your mistake. Correct it and don't make it again. Many a farmer has gone wrong because he did not use his brain. It reminds me of a young girl who went to a druggist and asked if he could mix up a dose of castor-oil so it wouldn't taste. Of course, he could, and he went in the back room to fix it up. Pretty soon he came out and asked the young lady if she didn't want to drink a glass of lemonade while waiting — it was pretty hot. "Yes," she said. Pretty soon, the druggist came out again and asked if she wanted anything else, as she had gotten the castor-oil in the lemonade. "Oh," she gasped, "I wanted that for my mother." (Laughter and applause). Mr. Young — How do you get your soybeans started in the corn? Mr. Pedersen — We always inoculate and always use a double hopper so we get an even stand. We have had more experiments with soy - beans on our farm than on any other farm in the state of Iowa, and we always make sure by inoculating the seed. Mr. Haeger — Do you feed bran? Mr. Pedersen — Only when we have cows on official test, because you get them to eat a little bit more. It is entirely too high in cost in comparison to what it contains, I think. Mr. Holcomb — Professor Fitch has not arrived yet, and the meet - ing is declared adjourned. </seg>

Pedrett, of Kimball, at 3:10 P. M. The President — I am glad to see so many of you here at this early date for the meeting. By the looks of the faces, if we have not the numbers. I think we have the quality. We have a lot of work to do at this time, so I do not want to take any of your time to explain about the organisation. The first speaker will be Mr. Arthur Bartlett, who will deliver the Address of Welcome. (Applause.) \M&gt;KKSN OK WKM'OMK TO DAWKS COUNTY Mr. Arthur Bartlett, President Dawes County Farm Bureau Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: I do not know why they should pick on an old farmer like me to give you the first rattle out of the box. I am just a ranchman and not used to talking before audiences. In giving you the welcome of the Farm Bureau to Dawes County, I want to say this: We are glad to have you with us here. The Farm Bureau members are glad to have you here, and we expect and hope to cooperate with you people, as our interests are mutual in this potato industry. The potato industry of northwestern Nebraska has become quite an industry. It seems like northwestern Nebraska grown potatoes meet with results in the south better than those from other localities in the United States. We wish to co-operate with you people from </seg>
            <seg id="p438">438 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE outside counties and outside states, and we hope you will cooperate with us. We hope we can learn something from each other's exper - ience in this potato business. The potato business is something that we did not know very much about, until recent years. We planted potatoes and thought they were just "spuds," and Just grew; and we could eat them if good, and if bad, we cast them aside. Of course when we made a study, we found there was a great deal to learn about the potato industry. I wish to say we have a good many things to contend with in diseases and the like. We hope this meeting will be beneficial to all and we can all co-operate and learn something and make it better for the potato growers, and also for the potato planters in the south In welcoming you to Dawes County, I wish to say we have quite a good many things here that are nice. You can look around and see that it is a nice country here in places. Take this beautiful Pine Ridge that runs through our county diagonally. On each side and on the ridge there is some nice potato land. The good flavor of the potatoes is due to the ozone from the pine trees which helps to make them grow as well as to flavor them. Maybe I am mistaken about that. We have great possibilities in Dawes County. The other day I had a letter from a man in one of the southern states to whom we had sent a sample of potatoes for a test. The potatoes tested 343 bushels per acre. There were some other potatoes sent in, and the next highest yield was 79 bushels per acre below the test of the 343 bushels. Those potatoes were grown east of Chadron by Bartlett and Taylor. We have with us this afternoon President Elliott of the State Normal. I was talking on the street the other day with Senator Good and President Elliott came along. He had been up against it for a football team to match the Normal team. He said, "I have been all over the state of Nebraska and I have challenged everything in it — even Jack Dempsey." We want our brightest boys, and a lot of them, here in the future. We have our County Agent, who is a mighty nice fellow, too. He has been over Sheridan County quite a good deal lately. I said, "What is the attraction there, Clem?" "I'll tell you. They have lots of bunko on that monster in the lake over there. I thought if I could catch it, we would have the advertisement in Dawes County." (Laughter). So we have that from Mr. Svoboda. We have another speaker, Allen G. Fisher — one of the biggest - hearted men you ever ran across. I have known him since he was a boy, although he has more grey hair than I have. He was slim like a toothpick when I first knew him. </seg>
            <seg id="p439">439 REPORT OF NEBKA8KA STATE BOARD OF AOtlCULTTBI I was reading an article about a witness on the stand. The lawyer said. "I want you should tell us wRat you know about this case." •Well, I think "I don't want to know what you think. I want to know what you know." "Well. I am not like a lawyer. I have to think before I know." ( Laughter, i I want you to feel that you are welcome. If there is anything you would like to have, please let the Farm Bureau people know it. I am glad to welcome you to Dawes County. I thank you. (Applause.) The President — The next will be an Address of Welcome to Chad ron. by Mr. Fisher. (Applause.) MtlHCKSs OF WELCOME TO OHADRON Mr. Allen G. Fisher, rtiadron, Nebraska Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: I suppose in view of the fact that Mr. Bartlett has started as he did, I am speaking on behalf of the municipality and its excellent things, which you can see for yourselves, and the various civic service societies. I believe that I am a member of one of them myself. So I do so address you and ask you to consider yourselves entirely at home, in the first place, — in our city. We have a city we are proud of having had a hand in making. We think we have all the most modern equipments for a city — the things that make it a delightful place to live. None of us intends to go away from here, now that we have an enjoyable place, as we have. We ask you to make yourselves at home, and enjoy not only the ozone, but enjoy the hospitality of our places of business and of our public places, and any of our homes you came to visit. I might say, addressing you as representatives of a most important industry, that we have learned in reference to potatoes and potato growers in different ways; but we have acquired a very tender, affec - tionate expression from the boys who came from France. I address you first in the mild form of endearment for the men's societies of the city, as "Warm Potatoes" — as warm as our hearts. I speak for the Ladies' Culture Club, and will address you as "Sweet Patooties." I want you to understand we are giving you just as warm and affec - tionate a welcome as possibly can be. Brother Bartlett was kind enough to speak about my large heart. I want to say that is true. He is one of the few men who recognize </seg>
            <seg id="p440">440 UPOBT Of NEBRASKA STATE BOARD Or ACBlrri TIHK that all this expanse of garment you see here covers only a heart. (Laughter). It is very kind for my friend, Mr. Bartlett, to speak as he has. He is a friend. I will testify to this: He has been a friend continually since the year of 1886, and he and I now are the sole survivors who conducted the first Dawes County Fair right out here in the fall of 1887, at which time the only thing that was bigger than the potatoes we sent back east to our friends, were the watermelons. (Applause). I raised the potatoes. t Seriously as may be, I am going to take a couple of minutes of ir time to talk about your industry. The potatoes which you ate I enjoyed today were raised by an equally illustrious son on our d in Sioux County. It is a most unfortunate thing that potatoes which are as wonder - ful, which are as perfect as they are — and none can excel those raised in the peculiarly adapted soil in our northwestern Nebraska — should re - ceive no more consideration than they do receive all over the United States, which is a potato-consuming country. Incidentally I will say potatoes are of importance not only commercially, but of tremendous importance in domestic economy. In 1543 — as far back as that — a pioneering Catholic priest carried home to Spain from Peru potatoes raised in that country. He pre - sented those specimens to the pope, and in an address which he made at that time he praised them in Latin. He said the potato plant was the most beneficent gift of God to man which had been discovered up to that time, and that it was "the bread of the poor." fA number of years ago it was my good fortune in a business way be in the vicinity of Mobile, Alabama. I was overtaken — being an outsider — by a real estate promoter, and surrounded and captured. The object of the attack made upon me in a friendly way was to sell to me some "Satsuma" orange land. I had never heard the name except with reference to Japan. I supposed it was a Japanese fruit They showed me specimens. To show this land was valuable and exclusive and important and limited in quantity, and therefore high in price, they demonstrated to me that a portion of the county in which Mobile is situated and one other county in that region were the only places in the United States where these oranges could be grown. The oranges were wrapped up in very attractive pieces of tissue paper. They were about as big as an ordinary persimmon and characterised by thicker skins, and only desirable to eat at all because when taken out of this tough skin there were little compartments which were tolerably sweet. Yet their State Agricultural Department and all the real estate agents were advertising Satsuma oranges, and these little runty specimens of dried-up fruit — aa they appeared to be because they wre affected by the frost — had be« n enclosed in the same kind of labels as the Sunkist oranges are sent to us. They claimed more for their quality than these loud-mouthed people on the coast </seg>
            <seg id="p441">REPOBT Of NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTUIE 441 do for the Sunkist oranges. It was all the result of advertising — of co-ordination. As I sat in the LaSalle hotel in Chicago and saw them bringing In potatoes on platters, advertising them on their menu cards as having come from Greeley, it occurred to me, from northwestern Nebraska, that I needed a megaphone and a car of potatoes to justify me in getting up and trying to shout as loud for northwestern Nebraska potatoes as these real estate agents in Mobile did for the Satsuma. You are too modest — if that can be said about anybody in north - western Nebraska but myself. If you are not too modest about your own qualifications, you are, about sounding the praises of these potatoes, because the potatoes grown in this section have few equals any place, and not their superior in the United States. I Insist upon that. One or the things the real estate agitators should do is to advertise north - western Nebraska as it deserves to be done at your hands, especially laying emphasis upon potatoes or potato growers. That reminds me of something else — a thing that makes me feel worse. I am challenging your attention to your own business because that which is of advantage to those gentlemen Interested in the in - dustry as you are in this section is of advantage to me as a resident and business man in another line. I noticed in the paper a couple of days ago the freight rate upon miscellaneous commodities from Peoria to the Gulf of Mexico is a certain rate. The distance is 942 miles. The distance from Superior, Nebraska, to the same point giving an outlet for the products of Nebraska is 938 miles. Yet the freight charge from Superior on these same articles is seventeen cents per hundredweight higher than from Peoria. Why do you tolerate that upon potatoes or meat or anything else? While you tolerate that upon potatoes, which potatoes being, as their character is, perishable to a certain extent and therefore of necessity should be moved quickly and reasonably, and because they could be moved with less expense with dock than any other way, why don't you have this Railway Commission of Nebraska set itself in motion, and not make a freight rate, because they can not do it any more; but do the only thing left for the Commission — make them appear before the Interstate Commerce Commission and get you an equal rate with the high priced potatoes raised in Peoria? It will make a difference of seventeen cents per hundredweight to you, and that is some difference. Another thing, just to show I have some little interest and a little bit of information. In 1911, Mr. A. W. Reikman, of the Citiiens State Bank was interested in promoting this particular industry. At his request, because I was interested with him in some degree, I wrote to the Ambassador at Berlin and got in German, which he could readily translate, plans and specifications and prices — all the </seg>
            <seg id="p442">442 BKTOBT Or NERRA8KA STATE BOARD OF AGRII'l'l Tt Rr formula necessary with reference to a thing they have there. In Germany they understand conservation of resources, and if potatoes are not sufficiently large, or if conditions are such they do not mature to suit them, they do not throw them away or shovel them to the live - stock to eat as refuse. On the contrary, they cause them to be con - verted into potato chips and dried and saved at a very small expense, which they feed to their cattle and hogs and use them for the very same purpose as we do corn in the United States. LThe war came on and interfered. For a number of years no com lication could be had. I have been told that one such factory has been set up in Wis - consin, with machinery imported from Germany and that it is pro - rslng economically and satisfactorily, with a much bigger outlet their output than they are able to supply. k Along the line of conservation of potatoes, if it were not for the ministration of the law in this part of the state — and it is extremely irously enforced — in other portions of the state potatoes are cooked and fed to hogs — refuse potatoes. Why can't these potatoes be wrapped in paper like the Sunkisi oranges and laid upon the table of the hotels in eastern cities and advertise Nebraska? Along this same line of conservation, the prohibition amendment was put across in the United States by the money furnished by the gasoline industry — principally John D. Rockefeller. One of the things included in it which ought not to have been, and that ablest man in the United States — Henry Ford — says so — one of the things forbidden by the law as it has generally been promulgated, was the distilling into motor spirits of the refuse farm products. In Germany, in France, in countries where they know what economy is and appreciate there is a limit to the resources and richness of the soil, they do distill — not for beverage purposes — all the weeds and all the refuse of their farm products. They convert them into motor spirits. Until that method is brought into the United States and farmers learn to be thrifty and learn there is no necessity for any waste upon the place, and can convince — as they readily can — the government in that regard and get a permit to make ethyl spirits as they can out of wild grass and out of potatoes and things of that kind, you will be at the mercy of John D. Rockefeller. I do not have a car and do not expect to. I am perfectly safe. Therefore my recommendation to you to engage in the manufacture of ethyl alcohol for motor spirits is entirely altruistic. I am urging you to do something for yourselves and not anything for me. Ladles and Gentlemen, after having told you how to handle your own business successfully — and the city of Chadron is full of men like </seg>
            <seg id="p443">BEPOBT OF NKMAKKA STATE BOARD OF AGBICULTUBE 443 myself who are able to tell you all about how to do that, and we are here for that purpose — I »ay again, we welcome you. I thank you. (Applause) The President — We have had a welcome from the President of the Dawes County Farm Bureau and from Mr. Fisher, and now we have with ua Mr. Elliott, President of the State Normal College, who will give us a welcome to the Normal College. (Applause). President R. I. Elliott, State Normal College, Chadron, Nebraska Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: I think about all has been said that could be said on this occasion. After listening to the two eloquent addresses we have just heard, I know you are about ready to proceed with the real business of the occasion. I think it was Professor Wilson who came to me about a year ago and asked if it would be practical, since the Potato Convention was to come to Chadron, to have the meetings in the State Normal College buildings. I told him I thought by all means it would be practical. I feel that an institution of this kind should not go upon a strict construction basis, but it should do everything within its power to benefit and to develop and to promote the industries of the vicinity and the territory in which it is located. I was very glad to tell him if they saw fit to bring this convention to Chadron, we would be more than glad to turn over the institution and its facilities to be used upon this occasion. And so I am very glad to have the opportunity, in addi - tion to turning over the institution, to be here to say a few words to this Potato Improvement Association Convention. I am not able to think of the right word and use it in the way Mr. Bartlett and Mr. Fisher can use their words. I am reminded of the story of the Irishman who was about to leave the old country. When he was ready to board the ship to come to America, his friends asked what he expected to do when he got into the new world. "Well, I've licked all of you fellows, and I expect to lick the first man I come to in the new world." When he got off the boat at New York, he started down Broadway. The first man he came to he challenged to fight to make his word good, as all Irishmen do. Before they started in they drew up an agreement they were to fight until one or the other said "Sufficient." A DORKS* OF \YKMX&gt;MK TO THE STATE NORMAL. COMJ3UK </seg>
            <seg id="p444">444 BEFOBT Or XK8BA8KA 8TATC BOABO Or ACBICrLTt'M: They rolled up their sleeves and fought for twenty minutes. Finally the other man said "Sufficient." BThe Irishman said, "That's the word! Sure an' I have been trying think of it for the last fifteen minutes mesilf." ("Laughter. ) I So I say to you gentlemen this afternoon while I am here to talk you men who know so much more about the potato business than o, I am reminded of the story of the Irishman who could not think the proper word; for what I do not know about potatoes would ke a volume. We have had a little experience with reference to potato growing upon this campus. Seven years ago we had a small garden on the corner of this campus that covered one-quarter of an acre. I was told by a great many of the citizens and a number of the instructors Fig. 1 — General View of Buildings of the Chadron State Normal College 1 would not be worth while to plow up more and put it into corn i potatoes; that there was only one little spot that would grow rthing. I thought it was time to plow up more and experiment to see if we could not grow something on the rest of the campus. We Ewed up different places. I found the soil all over this campus is t about as good and in some respects better than the little patch y had set aside as the only spot adapted to potatoes. I think I drew a lesson from that. Practically all of the soil in western Nebraska is good if we can only find the things adapted to the soil in different localities. It seems to me that is one of the func - tions of this organization— to find what type of potatoes will best grow in the different types of soil. That is one of the things you men will discuss this afternoon. bwant to say you are welcome here. We are glad to have you. lot know of anything I like better than potatoes when it comes ng seated at the table, unless it is more potatoes. So I do not </seg>
            <seg id="p445">445 RKPOBT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOABO OF ASBICVLTl'RE know of any organisation we would rather have with us than this bunch of potato growers. Gentlemen, this is your institution. You have paid for it, and you are entitled to everything we have here we can possibly give you. If you want anything you do not see, ask for it. I will turn over the key to the President. It is a Master Key that will unlock any of the doors in this institution — including the cellar. (Laughter.) We would be glad to have you look about the school. If you want anybody to do anything for you and can not find him yourself, my office is on the north side of the second floor of the building, come over and pound on that door until you get me, and I will find somebody whose business it will be to serve you and see you get the proper treatment while in our midst. I grew poetic when I came in this morning and looked over this potato display. I do not know when I have ever seen a finer display. Fig. 2 — Gymnasium Building of the Chadron Normal College, in which the Potato Convention and Show Were Held There is a little ulterior motive in getting you here. We have been looking for a very long while for some very fine seed potatoes. I have never seen a better opportunity to get seed potatoes for next year than we have here now. I want to say to you if you miss any potatoes when this show is over, you will know where they are. We are going to have some of them. I have a parody on a little song you may have heard.

            <seg id="p446">446 ■TCI Or XEBBASKA STATE BOARD Or AORHM [ I I RK Ladies and gentlemen, we are at your service. Command us. (Applause.) Th*&gt; President — I speak for the members of the Potato Growers and everybody here when I say we certainly appreciate the welcome we have received at Chadron — first, by the Farm Bureau President. We have learned we do not find county agents where we have no Farm Bureau, and if counties are not represented, you will find they have no county agents. This Association works band in hand with the Farm Bureau and the county agents and the Agricultural College, and with the Agricultural Department at Washington. The Farm Bureau and its leaders deserve a whole lot of credit. Consequently we are glad to come to Dawes County, because Dawes County was with us from the first convention we had. I must say we are from Kimball, but we never were afraid of much except Dawes. We are still afraid of them, but not for the reason we were at first. LNext we were welcomed by Mr. Fisher. He explained about his big rt. If it is as he says, it is the first place the convention has struck a man with such a big heart. We want to make good use of it. We like to meet with big-hearted men, and I think we are in the right place. As to the College, of course we are glad you turned over the key. Vos did not mention the furnace, but I suppose the bunch of keys include that, too. We expect to make ourselves at home here. I guarantee for the rest of the boys we will behave ourselves so that when we depart you will say: "Well done, boys. Come again." It is certain the potato growers will behave themselves, especially since you said we could have the key, even for the cellar. We thank you for the welcome. Chadron looks good to us, ( Applause. ) AXNl/AI, REPORT OF sK&lt;KKTAKY-TKKASl KKH Mr. H. O. Werner, Lincoln. Nebraska I will just give you a summary and recommend the Chairman appoint an Auditing Committee. This Committee will have quite a job on its hands, because the accounts of the Association have grown to be more extensive than they used to be. A general summary of the receipts during the past year in the certification fund will be given first. These fees are paid into the treasury of the Potato Asso - ciation. The inspection is done by the Agricultural College but financed through the fees paid into the Potato Improvement Association treas - ury. The work is just about self-supporting at the present time, if we make a proper balance of time. (Report at end of volume.) </seg>
            <seg id="p447">447 ■■I Ml Or XOU8KA STATE BOABD OF AGBICULTUKE Some people have the idea the work is too expensive. I think if you will look the matter up, you will find the fees are about the same here as in most states, and lower than in others. In all the states the sentiment among the growers seems to be they do not want a cheap service. They want something well worth while. No matter how much it costs within reason, as long as it is helpful, it is a good proposition. I was out west two weeks ago and one grower said he would be willing to have the fees in his state run up to ten dollars per acre, or more. If you are dissatisfied in your own mind, or have some neighbor who thinks the money is not being used properly, I invite you to take a very careful look at our books as soon as the Auditing Com - mittee is done. If you find any items you do not understand, I will be glad to explain them. It is always a great deal easier to say how a thing should be done than sometimes to do it yourself. T realize I might go into your fields and tell you, you must do so and so with regard to certification so we could pass your field. It might be easier for me to tell you than for me (physically) to do it. Likewise it is a great deal easier to criticise the administration of this work than to actually administer it. We will all try to be lenient with each other and see both sides of the fence. I think the time has come when the certified seed growers should supply the transportation for their inspectors. The present system amounts to making a livery driver out of your county agent for a total of two months or more. If he is a county agent of the type you need, he has many other things to do, and could hardly be ex - pected to give his exclusive time for two weeks at a time to a relatively few men. We are figuring on buying more cars, supplying at least two of our regular inspectors with their own transportation this coming year. We do not intend to divorce the work from the county agent's office entirely, but do not expect him to supply the transportation. I think that is asking too much. I do not think it pays us to use old cars. The most valuable thing to us during the growing season is time. We had a second-hand car a year ago, and it caused Mr. Bonde and I to lose a total of two weeks' time throughout the course of the season because of being laid up for repairs. We bought a new car this year and we have lost only about half a day throughout this season. I want you to know that the information we have is entirely avail - able for all of you. We want to have a complete understanding on all these facts, especially of these financial matters, so that there will be less chance for misunderstanding and for bad rumors getting started. Let us keep in mind the purpose of this organization is not a commercial purpose. It is fundamentally created for educational pur - poses. While you want to talk about the price of seed potatoes and it is important to you, please do not expect to have any time devoted </seg>
            <seg id="p448">448 BXFOBT &lt;» 1TEBKASKA STATE BOARD OF AGBICri.Tr IK to that in the regular meeting. I think it would be a great mistake to have the meeting go on record as attempting to fix a price on certified seed, or anything of the kind. I think this organization should steer clear entirely from the business side of marketing the El of potatoes. If a marketing organization is to be developed, it lid be developed independently. That feature will be discussed orrow afternoon. The purpose of this meeting is to get new ideas. I find some growers do not like the fact that we have such a large number of college men and- -agricultural department men on our program, and so few farmers. The problems you are up against now are not so much the problems on which your fellow farmer or potato grower can give you help. They are problems of diseases, etc., of the potato, which require scientific information which you, as a farmer, or your neighbor can not work out. You must get help from some other place if you want to get ahead. These men, put on your program, are employed specifically for getting that Information and discussing with you the newest information available. Another thing I hope this Association will do as time goes on is to iron out local prejudices. In every locality during this past year I found they have felt: "They may be able to grow good potatoes over there, but we have a particularly fine climate and our seed potatoes are better than theirs." In some sections they have not limited their opinions to that, but have gone so far as to say potatoes grown in certain sections are no good. Especially has that been the case with respect to irrigated potatoes. I hear: "Don't think of planting irri - gated potatoes. They are not good for seed." Men will say, "I hear practically every grower in the North Plam - valley ships his potatoes to Alliance as dry land potatoes and then ships them south as dry land seed." That story has practically no truth in it. The railroads have given us figures on that, and the number of cars billed into Alliance and billed out is ridiculously small — not as large as might be billed for diversion into and out of any division point. t There are a great many potatoes grown in the irrigated section ch I would prefer for seed potatoes, to some of the potatoes grown dry land right in your county — I mean in every county represented here. In the future we may be certifying irrigated potatoes. If we are convinced that spindle tuber can be controlled in irrigated fields we may certify irrigated potatoes in the future. This afternoon's program has been arranged with the idea of giving us a general view of the potato industry in the various parts of the country. Tomorrow morning we will have a detailed consideration of potato disease problems. Professor Goss has put up an extensive ex- Kid will give you a lot of information, a great deal of which surprising to most of you. He has done a great deal of work </seg>

Tomorrow afternoon we will take up the marketing of Nebraska seed potatoes. If you have any ideas, try to get them in good shape so that you can present them in definite form tomorrow afternoon. There is no question but that something needs to be done. Unless it is done by you men here and the other certified seed potato growers, nothing will be done which will be of special advantage to you. We have reserved the morning of the last day for a discussion of cultural problems, and the afternoon for miscellaneous questions. If we get very far on a marketing discussion, probably the best and most substantial part of the program will be on Friday afternoon. That is a part of the program in which you can all participate to the greatest extent.

Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: The President of the Normal was wondering where he would get come good seed potatoes. I hope before I leave town I may have the privilege of giving him the Cobblers on the end of the table. Maybe he would object to the fact they were grown out of Nebraska, but we would lfke to have him try them. I am not going to tell you all about the seed potatoes in Wyoming, because there is another man here who knows more about that than I do. I hope the Chairman will see fit to have Mr. Westley on the program, because he has a good deal to tell you about our potatoes The only thing I can tell you is something about our potato problems as they apply to Niobrara County, which is the first county in Wyoming on the Chicago &amp; Northwestern. We have been growing certified seed for three years. Of course the first year we had three and four dollar prices for certified se*d. and business went along fine. Everybody was enthusiastic. Last year we took a slump, and a lot of people were discouraged. It has been a mighty good thing for our potato business, for the reason that the men who understood the raising of certified seed potatoes have stuck to the job. The men who did not understand it and were not willing to give it sufficient time and attention to produce a good product have drifted away from the work this year. That means the farmers who are growing certified seed this year are the growers we want to keep in the Association, and we can bring the other fellows back gradually. We have tried this year to put across some real educational work among the farmers. While the business was going down, we let our educational work go up. I do not know whether the other county agents will be interested in doing work with the boys and girls as we do or not. Last spring I felt the farmers needed education on the growing of seed. We held a series of meetings and asked the growers to come in and bring with them a peck of certified seed potatoes — the best they could get. That gave us a splendid start to collect the seed for the County Demonstra - tion plot, such as you have near Crawford and other places; and at the same time it gave us a mighty fine start toward educating the farmers on the growing of good seed. To prove the selection of good seed was an important factor, we had twenty-three boys and girls in Potato Club work, and asked each one to come to a potato meeting and bring one hundred of the best potatoes he could. I wish I had a picture big enough to show you all these boys. Some came ten or fifteen miles. Under our instruction </seg>
            <seg id="p451">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD Or AQBIOUI.TI'BF. 451 they culled out the inferior potatoes, taking the others home and planting them. Our results have been very gratifying. In one of our - plots, the boy who selected his one hundred potatoes secured an avenge of 100.2 bushels. That is not a big yield. But his father, who selected out of the same bin and from the same source, got an average of 64 bushels. So we know definitely that seed selection is an important thing. Of course in our demonstration plot we carried it out a good deal like you folks did here. I remember one farmer said, "I never knew there were so many different diseases as were pointed ont in some of the poorer rows." In Niobrara County we have an organized Potato Growers' Asso - ciation. We have a cellar association, that makes a nominal charge for handling potatoes. The business men of Lusk furnished the money for construction. We insist that all the certified potatoes sold go through the association. The potato cellar pays a small return. The Potato Growers' Association has one man who does all the grading and sacking. We do not like to have a man on the farm grade and sack his potatoes and have them inspected. We like to take out the off-type tubers. We do not want to put anything In that is not up to standard. Then comes the question: "What should certiled seed potatoes sell for?" We naturally want as big a price as we can get. That is human nature. If certification means anything, it means first that the farmer must be careful with his seed. He must have a seed plot and be careful in handling it; and if the inspection is worth anything, it will cost money. Add these up and you will find certification does mean something. We are backing this idea: We can not sell certified seed for much less than fifty cents, and it should be a dollar, more than table stock. The service will cost that. Growing certified seed should yield a good profit above expense of certification. If we can not get it we will let our men go back to raising common, ordinary potatoes. Why attempt certification if you can not do it right? We will try to do it right and put up good stuff. If we can not, why fool about the certification game by slipping in inferior seed? If we can not get a price that will make it pay for the farmers to do that, we will go out of the business. We hope there will be a price in which these men In the south will be interested, and see the justice of paying a good enough price so that we can afford to do it. We are raising the Cobbler potatoes in Wyoming. Some of our farmers would like to raise Triumphs. Perhaps It would be a good thing for some of them, because they can find an earlier market in the fall. Perhaps it would be a good thing for you to raise a few Cobblers. I tell some of my farmers if a man is raising many potatoes. </seg>
            <seg id="p452">452 ■■n or irasusKA htatc boaed or aobioii.tirk he can probably grow both varieties. If you are interested in Cobblers. thave them, and If r. Wesley can tell you more about the seed potato Iness. I thank you. (Applause.) The President — His remarks have met hearty support. His idea. I think, is correct. Do it right and get the price. If it is half done and little difference, it would not be worth while to call one "certified" and the other "uncertified," and use the name of "certified" as a club and think the others are inferior. There are lots of potatoes not certi - fied. Certified seed ought to be good, and the difference in price should be according to the quality of the potato. In the olden time it is written the Wise Men came from the east. It has changed since then. They are looking to the west for some of them now. I do not want to mention Hiram Johnson. We do not have to go clear to California. We have another one with us. I met him here and was surprised. I said, "I expected a Big Gun." When I saw Mr. Cannon I asked if that was the Big Gun — the President of the Pacific Northwest Potato Growers' Association, and also the judge of the show. We are all anxious not only to hear him, but on needles until he gives the decision when the show is over. (Applause.) "THK POTATO INDVHTRY IN THK PACIFIC NORTHWKHT" Mr. George 4. Cannon, Pres. Pacific Northwest Potato Growers' Association, Buckeye, Washington Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: (Comparing watch with program). There is one rather good thing about my time. I will meet myself going back to my seat. II brought these potatoes (showing a number of tubers) at the uest of Mr. Werner. I do not know that they will be of any par - ilar interest to you. tWhen I received a call to come out here and tell you fellows about potato industry in the northwest, I was very promptly reminded of the old Irishman walking about the streets of Chicago. A man stopped him and said, "Pat, my good man, will you tell me right away where the City Hall is?" Pat said, "Bejabers, there are eight thousand people on this street now. Why in the name of common sense would ye pick on poor me?" (Laughter.) There are some people out west who know something about pota - toes. If you had called me eleven years ago, I would have known all </seg>
            <seg id="p453">453 about them. I have not a bit of doubt but what I would have been willing to stand here all day and tell you a lot or stuff about potatoes and potato growing. But in spite of the fact that my head was thick. I have since tumbled to the fact that most of it was not true. I will be a little more careful today about what I tell you than I would have been then. I have not the slightest idea what line of discussion we ought to follow on this. If you have not a suggestion, I would like to make this one: that I will relieve my chest of the tew things that are always on it about the potato business, and then that you question me as freely and as fast as you like, because the faster questions come, the more I can dodge gracefully and pretend not to have heard them. In this way, I may be able to give you a little bit of the ins and outs of the industry in our country that may be of some little service to you. I agree with one of the speakers very thoroughly when be indicated eelier that the northwestern portion of your splendid state was pro - ing the best of the seed. I think that must be true, because I notice the farther I go in that direction, the better seed I find. (Laugh - ter). I think you must be getting pretty good seed even up here. Out in Washington, when you get on one of the railroads you hear all about the "big baked potato." I do not know whether it should interest you people very much. It Is a matter of climate, and I am not acquainted with yours sufficiently to suggest; but we think out there that the "Gem" or Russet Burbank is a wonderful potato. It has its weaknesses like the others in almost every section, but the Russet Burbank is our most common potato. We are all going to have individual ideas about potatoes just the same as we used to have about the girls, and as we have now about the women. It is probably just as well we have, because I know there were plenty of men when I was a young chap who wanted the same girl I did, and I am glad fhere were not more of them. They might have won her from me. When the decision is made and the ribbons placed in there to - morrow, if I get that far, I want it thoroughly understood I am not saying positively that the one little pile of potatoes which draws the blue ribbon is absolutely the best pile of potatoes. This must be so for many reasons. In the first place, a good judge of potatoes can get a better exhibit out of a poor bin, than a poor judge can get out of a good bin. In the next phase of the question, the story of the tuber itself is not complete. There may have been many weaknesses of the plant from which that potato came which were evident in the field and can not be detected in the potato but may be reproduced by it when planted. In a talk at our meeting in Spokane a short time ago, a certain gentleman high in the potato business said he had inspected a cellar </seg>
            <seg id="p454">454 llfMT Or XEWASKA STATE BOARD OF AGEICI I.TIBK. and found all kinds of mosaic, but I could not see it. I doubt that any of you here can detect mosaic on tubers. This is also true of other potato diseases. Again, there are certain types. You may favor a type which is more smooth, with broader shoulder. I may prefer another. I necessarily must choose my ideal when Judging your potato. Then again, the score card says you shall give so much of your score to this one feature — trueness to type or freedom from mechanical injury. The judge is closely bound to that. In behalf of the man who goes home with the second, third and fourth — with the yellow, white or red ribbon instead of the blue — just remember after all that you have not been positively convicted. You may have had the best potato after all. My little girl said to me when my ribbons came to the house a little while ago- — I was not proud enough of them to gather them all up, because they were not quite the right color: "Well, dad, don't get puffed up about them. You got a whole flock of ribbons, but only one blue one." So you see why I take pleasure in saying those things. In getting to the type, we feel that is a splendid type of the Ruaaet. (Shows potato). It has rather a broad body. It is a little bit heavier in the center, and has about the flatness most of us like best. Experi - ments with that potato show us it is not apt to fall off the water wagon nez year. A lot of them get to be tough looking customers. If it were inclined to be narrow in the center, it might come back with a narrow waist line. If it were tapering much on the smaller end, it might come back with a real pointed tip. Those are influences which govern the picking of our type in that tuber. Similarly you might speak of all the other tubers. There is a reason back of a standard type. We potato men do Just like you hog raisers. When you have a hog strain showing very long, slender tendencies, you try to lean toward more of the blocky type. So with the potato. The Russet Burbank is our leading commercial potato and, we think, a little the best potato in the world. It is a good producer, a good yielder. It makes heavy tonnage without being all fiber. Some of our big growers in the irri - gated countries have overdone that thing. They have reached the point where they want potatoes to stack up on the arm like an armful of wood. I think they are losing slightly on the tissue and food value of the potato. We have what, in my judgment, is a strong second for this. If you run across this little chap (showing sample), they will tell you it i* the Idaho Rural — "the world's greatest potato." It is a pretty good looking potato in the bin because it is white and generally smooth and uniform as to shape and size. I think it is really the Charles Downing. Now your Irish Cobbler, I would not attempt to tell you about that. I see you have some good ones — better than we have up north, perhaps. Your Bliss I would not discuss at all as that seems to be your specialty. When I received Mr. Werner's letter asking for samples. </seg>
            <seg id="p455">REPORT OF NEMtASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 455 I picked what I thought was a weak type. I am a beginner in the Bliss business. I believe that elongated shape to be a sign of weak - ness. (Shows potato). I did not go over your show even casually, but I did notice a few Ohios which I thought we could beat. I think if we have the edge on you on a really important variety of potatoes appearing in your show, it is in the Ohio. I consider the Ohio a very valuable potato. I have found it my most ready seller. It is pretty nearly, if not the most nearly, "fool proof" of any of the potatoes we have. Pretty nearly anybody can plant a few Ohios and get a nice yield. The average fellow can plant a few acres and get a fair crop. I have thought it should be spread more widely than it is. This potato (showing one) is not exactly the Stuart type, yet it is close to his ideal. When the Ohios start to running long, like this, they begin cutting up other capers, too. They get knobs on them and do other tricks. These off types should not be planted. I want to comment a minute on the seed potato phase of the potato industry. You can hardly discuss the potato and expect to get any - where without discussing the seed, any more than you can increase your poultry without finding an egg somewhere. The seed is the basis the foundation of the potato. The seed must be secured before you can get anywhere with your potato. I will admit to start with, I am a crank on this thing. If I were not, I would not have made the partial success I have made with the seed potato. I want to put myself on record as saying that some day in this country when everybody is reasonably prosperous, there will be just as much difference between the great, heavy reproducing, true running potato and the scrub potato, as between your $25,000 sire and your scrub bull. On top of the certified seed potato still will be the pedi - greed potato. The certification has not made a double grade yet. It is just as hard to get a true potato that will reproduce heavily and surely out of nowhere, as it is to go over the hills and pick up a scrub calf and curry him up and try to make a $10,000 sire out of him. It is not an accident. Occasionally you go in the hills to the fellow who never had the price to send out and import potato diseases — they have been so poor that they could not possibly send to Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Maine or Massachusetts to buy seed potatoes, and they have bully good seed today. There are cases of that kind where you will find potatoes that make excellent seed. But the reason they are excellent is because Nature has been doing for them what it cannot possibly do for us out on the other potato fields of the country, and what it is almost impossible for us to do using our greatest efforts because our fields are exposed to so many diseases from infected fields nearby and from insects. </seg>
            <seg id="p456">456 STATE BOABO OF AfiBICl'LTVRE Fyou take that potato, (showing tuber) plant it whole or cut in In the garden and let it produce a number of potatoes, and the year plant that number — ten or twenty hills — I am willing to wager you will have a diseased hill and some weak plants before that crop is mature. If you take that whole crop and put it into your cellar and pick your seed from it the year following, you will get the produce of those weak plants and perhaps of that diseased hill in your seed and plant them thinking they are good seed, because they will be nice. rth, little fellows. By this process your seed will become worse year. §lt you are going to have good seed potatoes, you must fight for ill along the line. You can not any more leave a potato affected k disease — I do not care what the disease is — in your potato field and expect to get No. 1 seed, than you can leave a tubercular chicken in your hen coop or a cholera stricken hog in the pen and let it go on and have your flock or herd prosper. The disease will spread. If you are going to fight potato disease you must start at the bottom. You must first get the best seed you can. Then you must "treat it" to guard against not only possible trouble on the skin of that seed, but diseases it will meet in the ground. The minute it comes through the ground — and there is a long story about the preparation of the soil — you must watch it and take out every plant that is not right. You do not need to mind what the disease is. That is for the specialist. The man in the field only needs to know one thing, and that is that the plant is not healthy. If he is going to succeed, he must get the plant out of there. Ail during the year he will find plants which do not look good. He must put in his time and be absolutely careful and unsparing when it comes to pulling out the plant that is not right. Nineteen out of twenty of us will say at some time or other, "There is that one. It does not look just right. I think it should come out but will let it stay." fen you commence doing that trick in your field, you are gone. You do it again and again and your potatoes go down instead of ling up. Now about securing and protecting your market. There are two classes of people when it comes to a potato seed transaction. One grows his seed and sells it to Jim Smith and gets his money or check, and the deal is closed. The other one grows his seed and sells it to Jim .Smith. He gets the money. He says, "Jim Smith and I have just started business. He made me a little payment down today. If that crop of mine — because it is still mine — which he is going to grow, pro - duces a bully good yield for me and for him, Jim will be back next year for more potatoes and he and I will continue to do business." See the idea? The responsibility of the seed grower must mature the other fellow's crop. If it does not mature in mighty good shape, his business is falling off. If I am the kind of grower who considers the transaction closed when I get the buyers' money, I had better stay </seg>
            <seg id="p457">457 MNtt Or NEBKA8KA STATE BOABD OF AGEICUI.TVBE out of the game. If I am going to stay in the game, I am putting my heart and mind into that proposition and using a fair amount of intelligence and a small amount of capital, otherwise I won't succeed. I must also have a good return or I cannot stay in business. t Suppose I have forty acres — and that is too much for any man. iough I have doubled it a few times. I am putting into that field not only the best ground I can get after three years' preparation, but a good deal of cash. The best I can do is $60 to $75 an acre for my seed, and I think it is more nearly worth $100 an acre. Those forty acres will take five men practically all summer long — three or four of whom must be experts. I can not hire a man for $60 a month and tell him to rogue my potatoes. I must hire a man who is (a rare exception ) well educated and absolutely painstaking. Then I must put him through a long course of sprouts and teach him what I want done. He will cost money. I can not leave it all to him, or to six or eight men. I must be among them all summer long. I can not go in once in every ten days and hope it is all right until I come back next time, because it won't be all right. When the year is closed, we will have taken out from 15 to 25 per cent of our plants, if we do it right. I had a buyer come to my field and say, "I notice this stuff along here. It looks like withered plants." "They are. A lot more have been taken out." "Man alive! Do you think I will pay a fancy price for seed and see all this stuff you culled out? Here are young potatoes. What did you dig them out for?" They were not right." "Do you think I will pay you big money for this seed when you have had to take all that stuff out of there?" The fact of the matter is, I was the man paying the money to take stuff out of there. I was trying to grow seed. It cost me time and heavy expense and cut my crop easily one-third of what I might have secured. Will I do that for a dollar or two? No, I will not, fellows. You may. I am not staying in the potato game when it won't pay me $5,000 a year; I can make that outside. Why should I stay in the potato game? If I am not the kind of a man you need in the potato game — and I am talking frankly to you because I have no secrets and I am out of my territory and all that — If I am too expensive a man to grow potatoes, all right. Get another fellow who is not so expensive, but our potato industry will never get very far until there are more $5,000 and $6,000 men in it. There are multitudes of cheap men in all lines of business.

Then us buy only small quantities and produce our own stuff from that e want to work from a seed plat. I When I hear anybody talking about growing certified seed potatoes fifty cents above the average market price, I can not help but say. bsolute poppycock." That is why men come before this gathering 1 ours and the big potato gatherings of the United States and say, ertified potatoes do not mean much." They do not mean much ■a use we have not made them mean much. I want to tell you a little experience we had in the northwest. Some years ago I undertook to develop general seed growing in our country. I won't tell you about our beautiful climate and everything adapted to the growing of the most wonderful potato in the world, as I told my neighbors. Our Yakima neighbors were importing five hun - dred cars of foreign seed a year. I was going out trying to build up competition for my own business, doing it voluntarily, paying my own carfare and hotel bills, so I got quite a lot of calls from all over that northern country. I told them a long story about all these little things that ought to be done in order to produce a real seed potato. Then I pointed out that our potato was very much superior to the seed potatoes being shipped in train loads into our irrigated sections, and pointed out the fact that those people who shipped in the seed were paying $1.00 to $1.25 a hundred freight in excess of what they would pay us. I pointed out that much of this seed was being certified by irresponsible persons in some of the states with little supervision, that it was being done carelessly and we had no check or guarantee about it. If we grew the seed in our own state, the disinterested testi - monials of our own state experts would prove that it was grown so-and-so, and it would be worth more money to the other growers in our state. I said, "There are a few of you who are suited for the growing of this seed. If you do grow it according to these specifications, instead of being on the market trying to sell your potatoes for sixty to eighty cents, you will have a fairly good market at five and six dollars a hundred.' They knew that was what I had been getting and some of them know I had sold out each year. They figured for once I might be telling the truth. They wanted to know how many I would recommend to go in. I said, "I do not believe, looking this crowd over — and all crowds are a good deal alike — I do not believe there is more than one out of ten I would advise going into the seed game." I though) </seg>
            <seg id="p459">459 EEPOBT OF NEBRASKA HTATE HOARD OF AGKICII.TIEK if one out of ten went into it, and one or two of them failed, it would leave three out of fifty to go on. They all went in! They did not go in on one acre — Oh, no! They went in on fifteen to twenty-five acres. They did not remember what I told them except one little paragraph. That was the paragraph that brought them to their ruin. They remembered this flve-dollara - a-hundred stuff. That is where they connected up with the story. They made a few hurried trips across the field and pulled' out a weed or two and a couple of potato vines and said they had rogued them. They dug them up and called them certified seed. Let me say in fairness to our certification officers that they worked him by saying, "I will rogue it right away." They still have the roguing to do. They did not complete the certification so avoided being turned down and that seed went out as seed having passed the second inspection. The fellow who bought it had nothing but abuse for certified potatoes. They were willing to make a second trial and loaded up good and heavy last year. They have them yet. They quit and said, "It is all bunko. You talked us into this. You told us we would get rich and we did not." It may be entirely different down here. If you are going to go into the seed potato business, don't kid yourselves along. You might as well play a game of solitaire and cheat yourself every time you deal. If you can't grow a real seed potato, quit and don't try it. If you want seed potatoes, go and buy them. Don't steal them. If you can't afford them, go without them. If you think you are getting a seed potato for two dollars I am sorry for you. You are either stealing a good seed or you are buying a fake. The reason we grow seed potatoes and table stock potatoes is because we want to get the money. Am I not right? The thing that stands between us and money is poor stuff. We beat one another to the market and underbid each other every day. That is foolishness, of course, and it damages us. But I think the fundamental thing that hurts us is the fact that we do not market potatoes alone. We do not offer human food alone to the market. We offer hog food, culls, and potatoes all in one bunch, and expect the purchaser to take the whole bunch and give us the price of potatoes. He won't do it. If we would cull out everything unfit for human food and say to the housewife, "Here are fifty pounds of table potatoes," Just as her grocer says. "Here is a 100 pound sack of sugar," or a 49 pound sack of flour," letting it be understood that the content is all food, we would get somewhere with our marketing. We would have more hogs fatten - ing on them, and less kicking among the housewives. I did not expect that I would have a chance to see anything in the grand old state of Nebraska which reminded me of home, but today when walking down town I saw a pretty good looking store. </seg>
            <seg id="p460">460 RKPUBT Or NKBKASKA 8TATK BOARD OT AURICl I.TIRK I went in and said to the proprietor, 'You handle potatoes, do you not?" "Yes." "Do you buy them around here?" Yee." "Have you any in storage?" "Yes, I have some here." "Do you mind if I see them?" "No, glad to let you see them. They are not very good." I went downstairs and looked at them. "How many of these have I got in quite a lot of them. I guess I got in too many." 'What did you pay for them? "I paid sixty cents a bushel for these. For some very much the same, I paid ninety cents a hundred. They came in wagons. They did not furnish sacks. Some of the growers owed me money and wanted to pay up that way. I took the potatoes. Do you consider them a pretty fair average?" I "No. I think it is a little bit worse this year than usual. I always a lot of poor stuff — stuff I do not think they should bring in." "You would have been ahead if you had receipted their bills and told them to keep the potatoes at home." He said, "I think I would, because they are hurting my trade." L"Do you mind if I take a scoop and put a few in a sack and you for them?" "Glad to have you." (Laughter). If it were proper, I would swear to you that I did not pick that pile. I never made but one move of that scoop. I have in this bag every potato in that scoop and not another potato. The pile I took them out of would cover this floor. I think it is all alike. It is on the main street so I think I have the goods on somebody. (Laughter). (Shows the potatoes). The grower got sixty cents. I think he should have gotten ninety days! That sort of thing must stop before we can grow potatoes. During the last three or four years in Spokane County we have always had a lot of trouble with the potato business. When we grow - ers got together we all agreed that it was a deplorable thing — no one of us to blame. It was the commission man and the grocer, and we were able to acquit ourselves very nicely. When we got to talking to fe commission men they hinted that we growers were all scoundrels, have had them bawl me out for trying to agitate this stuff about </seg>
            <seg id="p461">461 better prices, etc. I went among the grocers and spent lots of time. They really are the philanthropists of the whole business. If It were not for the handicaps forced on them by the grocer, they would furnish Spokane with a wonderful potato at a nominal cost! And so the story went all around the circle. When we were making up our program for the conference two weeks ago, I thought it would be a good thing to have a free-for-all. I have a couple of Irish relatives and I like a good fight. I hustled around and saw 250 retailers — everyone in the town — and told them what was on my mind. I said, "You fellows are going to be on trial. You might as well defend yourselves, because we are going to give you the devil! I will let you pick somebody to talk for you." They agreed and appointed a man and he said he would talk and light it out with us. The rest agreed to be there. Then I went to seventeen or eighteen commission men and told them the same story, and said, "I want you to be there, because you will be roasted. We want you to pick somebody for your spokesman." They did. They picked Mr. Anderson. I went to the papers and got all kinds of notices to the growers all over the territory asking them to come in and make their charges and show the public what was the matter with the potato industry. If we found that a little bunch of grocers or a few commission men were guilty, the majority of them would make these few straighten up. I think Mr. Werner was there. I counted seven commission men. I think there were four who had something to do with the retailing. There was one grower there, besides myself. We had a very good time and we got a long ways trying to find out what was the matter. There was a whole day's program with a year's warning and agitation in every possible way — we were simply to tear one another's reputations to pieces — yet there was just one potato grower there besides myself. That is the amount of attention we gave to that important question. I wonder if that would be the case down here. I hope it would not. I hope you will all get busy and fight it out. I thank you for your patience. (Applause) The President — There is a whole lot of difference between judges. One time we had a judge from Idaho. He came down and brought us a sample of potatoes. I never saw prettier potatoes in my life. He put them on the table and it was wonderful to see. This judge sneaks in and picks out the worst ones he can find in Nebraska and brings them up here. (Laughter). Back in the old country, two young noblemen were hunting. About dinner time they got hungry and said, "I wonder if we could go to that farm house and get something to eat?" The old lady said, "I can get you some milk and bread." </seg>
            <seg id="p462">462 KKPOBT OF MEBKASKA STATE BOABO OF AGBICL'I.TTBK She was churning and while she got the lunch a big cat waa sitting beside the stove.

I don't feel just right about it." In a short time they went back. "She will be cooled off and I will tell her we are willing to pay for the butter." Of course the old lady recognized them. One of them said, "I feel sorry I played that trick. I am willing to pay for the loss of the butter; how much is it?" 'Nothing." 'Wasn't the cat in the churn?" "Yes, but that's all right. You know we sell the butter to neighbor. They eat everything." (Laughter). It waa his house. That is about like the potatoes. The next speaker we all know pretty well. He must have liked it here. He claims he is closer to heaven when he come* to Nebraska than he is in Louisiana. We will call on Professor Tiebout, of Baton Rouge. (Applause) •'XKBKASKA CERTIFIED SKKD POTATOES IX IXH'IHIANA' Prof. G. L. Tiebout, Department of Horticulture, University of LotMmm, Baton Rouge, I*. rlr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: I am glad to be back with again. I see Professor Werner has me down for a talk on "Ne - braska Certified Seed Potatoes in Louisiana. " He is muddled in his geography. Really, you are growing the potatoes on the same spot that used to be a part of Louisiana, go I feel perfectly at home in my state as it used to be. Although they have given it a somewhat modern name by calling it Nebraska, it is Louisiana, just the same. Professor Werner asked me to say something about certified seed potatoes in Louisiana. I will attempt to give you a little history of our experience with Nebraska certified seed. About five years ago it was discovered that the Triumph potato in Louisiana as a cash crop was on the decline. Large potato producing sections were abandoning the Triumph as a commercial variety be - cause it would not produce a good yield. The growers said that the seed stock was running out. They did not know what the cause of this trouble was and we, from the College, had not given it very much attention, because the growers did not seek help especially and </seg>
            <seg id="p463">REPOBT Or NKBBAHKA STATE BOARD Or AGBICULTUBE 463 we happened to have no county agent in one of the most important sections. About that time, Professor Stuart, whom you all know, came through Louisiana and asked us if we would not like to try some of the so-called certified seed along with the other states like Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas, to see if certified seed of the Triumph variety was superior to ordinary stock or uncertified seed that was commonly offered through regular trade channels. We very gladly joined in this work for a period of five years. The Federal government began to send us lots of certified seed from some of the states that were beginning to perform this service for their potato seed growers. We got some seed from Nebraska, from Wisconsin and from several other stales. These trials have continued for a period of five years, and we have very definitely concluded that certified seed as it is being offered at present is very superior to uncertified seed. The uncertified seed we used in connection with these tests was purchased through regular trade channels in the southern distributing centers of Louisiana. We bought the stock in New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Thibodaux and Alexandria, as a rule. It was alleged to be northern grown seed from such states as Maine, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Nebraska. I have the details in this bunch of exhibits which I will place at your disposal during the show. Over a four-year period, the Nebraska certified seed has averaged in primes 144.6 bushels per acre, with 7.9 per cent mosaic disease. Of the Nebraska seed a total of fifteen lots for the period were tried. These on the average outyielding seventeen lots of uncertified seed which were used as checks, by about 45.1 bushels per acre, or 45.3 per cent. The amount of mosaic in the checks, which averaged 99.5 bushels per acre, was 47.5 per cent mosaic. This high percentage of mosaic accounts perhaps for the relatively low yield. Wisconsin certified seed over a period of four years — with a total of sixteen lots averaged 139.8 bushels of prime potatoes per acre, or 40 bushels per acre average increase over the checks or uncertified seed. The average mosaic per cent was 23.9. W have had a restricted number of lots from Minnesota over the same period, and they have averaged 120.7 bushels per acre, or 21.2 bushels increase over the uncertified, With 33.5 per cent mosaic disease. There are many more details that I would like to have you growers study and I believe it would be 'well worth your while. Last year, as a result of these interstate tests, in co-operation with your Association, represented by Professor Werner, we decided to run the tests of every lot of Nebraska certified seed. It is possible some lots were omitted, but practically all were included. Professor Werner, representing your Association, came to Louisiana for the first time last </seg>
            <seg id="p464">464 BEPOBT Or NKRBASKA STATE ROABD Or AC.8irri.TIRK year to make the mosaic readings especially, as well as take notes 01 the general vine appearance of the respective lots. In discussing the results with Nebraska certified seed among Louis - iana potato growers, we will ta&amp;e 1922 results. They are given in another set of exhibits which I hope you will have the time to look over. In that year we conducted some tests in Rapides parish, with Alexandria, as the center, where vast quantities of your potatoes are planted. The Nebraska certified seed made a very creditable showing at the Warner and Marler farms. In the tests at Warner's, the Ne - braska certified seed led in yield. There were lots from other sections in the same plat, as well as uncertified seed. The test on the whole was very interesting. At Marler's farms some striking results were obtained with Nebraska certified seed. The average for the four lots, inclusive, was 232 bushels prime potatoes per acre, with an average percentage of 16 2/3 for mosaic content. Mr. Marler that year had a large Held planted from certified seed from Nebraska that contained fper cent mosaic disease, and averaged 216 bushels to the acre. 1922, eleven carloads of Nebraska certified seed came to Louisiana. (Shows pictures of the above fields). They compare favorably with Nebraska fields. I want you to know we can grow good potatoes in Louisiana when we have good seed. (Shows pictures of potatoes en Nebraska certified seed from the farm of the President of the isiana Potato Growers Exchange). In 1923 we did not run any tests among farmers compared with those in 1922, but I want to give you some striking illustrations of what your certified seed did that year. The farmers in southern Lafourche parish had been planting Triumph potatoes from uncertified seed bought in the open market, for several years. They were aban - doning the Triumph variety because they could not get financial re - turns. One of our men from the Horticultural office was in that section and induced the manager of one of the large farms — Mr. Mal - lory — to take a car of Nebraska certified seed. He bought one car and was so well pleased with the appearance of it, he got another. E these two cars he harvested 38 carloads of potatoes. I do not how much the potatoes brought but I do know he put them on market. There was a very striking instance of a phenomenal yield recorded by the county agent of Iberville parish. A grower there procured two sacks of western Nebraska certified seed from a car that was shipped into that section to a farmers' organization and harvested one hundred E:s of No. 1 potatoes. The sacks he received were 120 pounds in ;ht and the sacks he harvested contained 100 pounds. This yield, Ink, compares favorably with some of yours. I will now pass to the club work. You should be especially In - terested in this particular activity since you have been using the </seg>
            <seg id="p465">465 ■arcsrr or nkbrahka state hoard of aokkti.ti bk clubs a* a sort of advertising agency for your certified seed. I was interested in the figures that Professor Werner gave for the cost of such work. I would like to add at this point that while you folks are putting considerable cash into this work, keep in mind that we are putting in lots of time. We cannot contribute cash from the public funds for this particular activity. That must come from the interests most directly concerned. But we can use time for the furthering of educational activities, and we are more than glad to contribute our share to this good work. We have about twenty-five home demonstration agents in Louis - iana. These agents are ladies. They look after the major portion of this work among the clubs. In 1922, you folks were good enough to send a limited amount of seed. Some wonderful results were obtained from this certified seed among the boys' and girls' garden clubs. I have exhibits here supporting that particular work and it will be my pleasure to show them to you and explain any points. In 1923. as you know, the work among the clubs was expanded. You sent to Louisiana for test purposes about 300 bushels of certified seed from the respective growers as an Association project, and the seed used for the club work was distributed among over 1,300 mem - bers in about 25 parishes. The net amount of seed for the clubs, I believe, was around 200 bushels. Quite a bit had to be used for the tests I have mentioned. There is a map here giving the location of the work in the various parishes where home demonstration agents are located. You will find in this map a detailed account of the stock that went to these parishes. Professor Werner occasionally calls on me for reports, and some - times they are very hard to give. When we are working with boys and girls we cannot expect to get 100 per cent reports. If we get 50 per cent we feel that we are doing well. There is much to be gained in placing small lots of seed in the hands of juvenile gardeners over a greater portion of a great state. I know of no more effective method of introducing such stock than this one. As outstanding examples of what the boys and girls did with Nebraska certified seed this past year, I have a whole folio here giving the expressions of home demonstration agents and the club members themselves. I will permit my children, and you will permit yours, to out-distance us in any race because we like to see an improvement in the stock. Therefore, there is no greater method of appeal to parents than when sons or daughters produce potatoes that outyield those of their parents or produce more than those grown under field conditions. The community also will begin soon to take notice of such activities. I will venture to forecast in this connection, and that is that the club work last year has brought about a demand from Louisiana for 53 carloads of Nebraska certified seed during the coming season. I will qualify this with one remark: if the price is right. </seg>
            <seg id="p466">466 REPORT OF NKBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGBHTI.TI RK An other phase of this certification work is the exhibits at the fairs. You have some intimate contact with that particular feature, because we have been calling on you from time to time to help us by sending small lots at the time of the state fairs. We have done this work in 1922 and 1923. I am sorry to say that this past year the response was not as liberal as I expected it to be. If we do this work next year, I will have to ask you for more samples, as we did not have enough this year. I have the figures of this year's exhibits and last year's work in this connection. Fro. 8 We have copied after our northern friends in the matter of potato tours. Last year, we thought that since Professor Werner was honor - ing us with a visit, we would stage a tour. We took our guests in Packard cars and drove them over Louisiana. Several parishes were covered and we had some very fine speeches from our visitors. Pro - fessor Stuart was with us also. We went to lower Lafourche where some of the plantings that I have been telling you about were seen. Terrebonne parish where a good deal of club work was being carried on, was included. Ten to fifteen carloads of certified seed from Ne - braska will go into this territory largely as a result of the club work A visit to the Alexandria territory concluded the trip. Our tour was modest, but it was a starter, and I presume that it will be an annual affair now. We hope to feature the use of certified seed on these tours. </seg>
            <seg id="p467">467 When I accepted the invitation to appear before you good folks again, I made a mistake in wording my wire to this effect: "At your pleasure." He, (Professor Werner) "pleased" to aak me to fix np some maps. We made a feeble attempt at that so here's another one. On this map we are showing the approximate number of cars of Ne - braska certified seed that came to Louisiana last year, and if prices are right, we figure there should be a demand for 163 to 232 cars for 1924 planting. The odd figures are brought about my making totals of smaller units, like "three to five cars in such and such a place." We left a pretty good record behind us in 80 cars last year. These dark figures show where the 80 cars went, and the red figures are the fostcasts. We think 53 cars of potatoes will be placed as a result of the car sent to us last year for boys' and girls' club work. I am going to tell you something about your potatoes. You all know that the layman buys potato seed on appearance. When he does that, in some instances your certified seed is frequently at a disadvantage as compared with certified seed that comes from other sections. We often have to make explanations on that point, and this is the remark I frequently use: "Nebraska seed is occasionally poor in appearance but it is H on performance." If any of you have had an opportunity to make rather extensive observations on the appearance of certified seed from different sections, you will notice in many instances that the prettiest seed comes from the sections that have a sandy, gravelly loam, a soil type that does not prevail in your territory. It is needless for me to tell you that the mosaic disease can not be detected in the tuber, and that this is a point we have to explain frequently. I want to say a little bit about certified seed among the merchants. We have been getting commendable response from the merchants in Louisiana who handle seed potatoes. In some sections the work has been very slow, but the farmer is beginning to demand certified seed. It is being talked generally among the trade. We are invading terri - tory this year and asking the dealers to stock certified seed where we have never been able to get any response or interest before. We have some dealers in Louisiana that stock certified seed exclusively, and that is what we want. When their salesmen go out and say, "We handle nothing but certified seed," and tell their customers, "If you want uncertified seed you must buy it elsewhere," the customers begin to think. These retailers buy from the jobbers and they pass the stock to the farmers. We have one merchant in Baton Rouge who said last year, "We are going to handle nothing but certified seed," and that particular .stock happened to come from western Nebraska. The railroads are taking an interest in this work and by the way, there are some very important traffic problems to work out in con - nection with the movement of certified seed. You would be surprised </seg>
            <seg id="p468">468 STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE to know the confusion that exists in the matter of rates to southern districts. It would be well worth while for your organization or some other to look into this matter. The question of storing potatoes in cold storage at points in the line of transit is a very important one. We find good response on the part of the railroads. They are not only interested in the actual transportation of this commodity, but they want to know the reasons why this stock is being planted and what certified seed is. There is another very important activity that we are carrying on in connection with certified seed. This is the publicity we give this matter. I brought along a few illustrations on this point. I would like to have you look them over. We have a very efficient publicity service department at the University that devotes its time to this par - ticular line. The space we get in Louisiana dailies and weeklies is a great contributing factor toward popularizing certified seed. There, (shows the exhibit) is a sample of the press bulletin, and here in blue you will find an outline of the various clippings relative to certified Question — What- time do you plant? Professor Tiebout — Seasonable conditions have a good deal to do with that. Ordinarily, from the latter part of January until the first of March. Most of the seed stock moves in January. The President — I want to say they have carried on good experi - mental work down there. We appreciate the work he has done. Adjournment was then declared until 9:30 Thursday morning THURSDAY MORNING SESSION December 6, 1928 tThe second session of the convention was called to order by Presi - t Pedrett on Thursday morning, December 6, at 9:45. The President — The first on our program this morning is a dis - cussion of "Potato Diseases" by Dr. Goss. You will find by the time he gets through you have learned a whole lot.

            <seg id="p469">469 ■MR OV NOftABKA 8TATB BOA ED OF AOBICULTUBE POTATO DISEA8K8 Dr. R. W. Oom, Dept. of Plant Pathology, Collage of Agriculture, Lincoln, Nebraska Mr. Chairman and Members of the Association: The first disease listed on the program is mosaic in its various forms. The next is spindle tuber. I prefer to discuss them both under the one general heading of "degeneration diseases." You know what I mean by that. Those of you who have been growing potatoes are familiar with the term "run-out" potatoes. A strain of potatoes tends to decrease in productivity, both in quality and quantity. That is what we mean by degeneration. We can classify both of these diseases under that general term. Degeneration has been known for years — generations, for that matter. It has been attributed to various things, soils, climate, irriga - tion, continued reproduction by tubers, and even to the moon! None of these numerous factors has been proven to be the real cause of the trouble. A number of years ago, work was started on the problem from a disease standpoint. The first disease discovered was leaf roll, and all degeneration was attributed to that for a while. Soon after ■ — in 1914— mosaic was identified in Maine, and for a few years we thought of mosaic as the cause. In more recent years, the Department of Agriculture and State Experiment Station workers have shown that what was formerly called mosaic is not one disease but several, either alone or in combination on the same plant. They have designated those under various terms. More recently we have heard of spindle tuber as a cause of running out. As a matter of fact, most workers on potato diseases at the present time recognize that it is not any one disease causing all this trouble, but rather a number of diseases, either individually or in combination on the same plant. Those are the diseases we want to discuss under this heading of degeneration diseases. I do not want to bore you with the details of various types of mosaic. I will try to limit the discussion to the more general symp - toms of mosaic diseases. All these diseases are of the same general nature. The method of transmission and the control are essentially the same. Mosaic Mosaic is not possible of detection on the roots or on the under - ground stem or tuber. Occasionally we find growers who claim to be able to find mosaic in the bin. We find some who think they can detect it on the roots. I do not know of any method of recognizing the disease on the underground portions of the plant. It causes a </seg>
            <seg id="p470">470 UPOBT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AURIC II.TIBK reduction in the size of the tubers, but the individual tuber in the bin does not show any one definite symptom of disease. On the portions above ground, the symptoms are usually evident. (Shows photograph of plant affected with mosaic disease). The first symptom is a slight dwarfing. This occurs in practically all mosaic diseases, but varies in degree. That is the first characteristic we notice in the field. The plant will be more upright, more rigid, so that it can be distinguished from the others. The smaller branches and leaves will often be brittle — more than a healthy plant should be. The foliage, however, usually shows the most marked symptoms on the plant. There is a mottling of the leaf — small spots varying from one-eighth to one-quarter inch, irregular in shape, of light green tissue, Pig. 4 — Effect of Air Temperature on Mosaic. (1) Leaves of Mosaic Plant Grown at 77° P. (2) New Leaves of Same Plant Transferred to 80* F. (3) Healthy Plant at 60° F. scattered over the surface of the leaf, surrounded by the normal leaf color. There are other leaf characteristics. The leaf may be thickened or puffed up in places, giving it a rough appearance. The margin of the leaf may be wavy or ruffled. You might ask whether these symptoms remain constant. If they did, mosaic would be easy to distinguish in the field, but they do not remain constant. Most of the work being conducted on mosaic in Nebraska is in the ry of the effect of various climatic conditions on the symptoms of disease, so that we can detect the disease in the field and make a </seg>
            <seg id="p471">urocr or nkhbakka state board or acbici t.TiRK. 471 more accurate reading. We have not worked a great deal on the methods of transmission or control of the disease. Most of the work of this type has been done in the east. It ia regrettable that we have no experimental evidence on these phases of the problem in this section. In the east, the work has been done under different conditions than we have here. The best we can do is to take the results that are obtained on other varieties and under other conditions and supplement them with our knowledge of conditions in Nebraska. That work will of necessity be repeated some time in this section in order really to understand the mosaic problem in this part of the country. The symptoms vary a great deal under different conditions. We are working on these diseases in the greenhouse under control conditions. It may seem strange that we study this problem at Lincoln. We have found that the best way to study this problem is to take a limited number of plants into the greenhouse where we can control the con - ditions of temperature, moisture, light, etc., and then apply the results obtained to our field readings. We can interpret what happens in the field in the light of the results obtained in the greenhouse. By changing the temperature the plant is growing under, we can practically eliminate the symptoms of the disease. This is particularly true of mild mosaic, the amount of change in the symptoms decreases with the more severe types of disease. The disease is still there, but you cannot see it. That is where the difficulty comes in working in the field. We can take mild mosaic plants in the greenhouse growing at a mean temperature of 75° Fahrenheit, with seed obtained from mosaic plants the previous year, and the plant will appear healthy. Drop the temperature fifteen degrees and all the new leaves will show symptoms of mosaic. The same is true to a lesser degree of the influence of light. By reducing the sunlight, the mottling on a leaf is more marked. In intense sunlight, it practically disappears. We have not done any work with moisture. We are working along that line this year. It has been observed in the field that an increase in rainfall will result in more marked symptoms of the disease. How - ever, those three factors usually go together. When yon have an increase in rainfall, you have lower temperatures and less sunlight. In order to illustrate how we can apply greenhouse results to field conditions, I will mention conditions during the last two years in Kim - ball County. A great many men have not been able to figure out why there was so much mosaic this year, and so little last year when so few aphids were present last year. When we study the temperature changes during those two years, it is obvious why this has occurred. (Exhibits chart showing temperature for Bushnell for 1922 and 1923). That line is 70° P. We have found that above the temperature of 70° F. the symptoms tend to disappear. Below it, the symptoms be - come increasingly evident. </seg>
            <seg id="p472">472 It can be seen from the chart that the mean weekly temperatures during the period from June 15 to August 15 in 1922, was for the greater part above 70* F. The highest temperature prevailed during the period when your field inspections are usually made. The broken line representing 1923 shows very clearly that the mean temperature was consistently below 70* F. In 1922 it was almost impossible to detect the disease. In 1923, temperature conditions were favorable for the symptoms of the disease to develop. That was one of the main reasons you apparently had more mosaic this year than the previous year. You had some the year before which was not evident because of the conditions under which the plants were growing. A good many men cannot understand why it is that if this disease thrives at low temperatures, it should be worse in the south than up here. You think of the south as being a warm climate. During the potato growing season in the south, particularly during the early growth of the plant, the temperatures are lower than up here in TenKWATuRe Su*shi»e Rainfall /(./■.•♦it - J*NC .

I have been unable to obtain the temperatures for the exact periods and points I wanted. However, I have compared the tem - peratures at Brownsville, Texas, in 1922, taking temperatures for January, February and March, during the period the plant was making its greatest growth and compared with them June, July, August for Kimball. At Kimball in 1922 the temperature averaged 71.1* F. It was high enough so that it was hard to detect the disease in the field. In 1923 the temperature dropped below that point, meaning that it was easier to detect the disease. At Brownsville the temperature was still lower, averaging around 65° F. I have no figures for Louisiana, but I imagine that the period from March 15 to May 15 would show temperature with an average below 70* F. Professor Tiebout — We made our best mosaic readings in the latter part of April. It would run below 70* F. Dr. Goss, (Continuing) : The same thing is true with reference to sunshine. During the three months Just mentioned, in Kimball there were 55 days listed as clear. In 1923 you had only 35 clear days, meaning a big decrease in the amount of sunshine. As I have men - tioned, the decrease in sunshine brings out the mottling. At Browns - ville during that period there were only 25 days of sunshine. In regard to rainfall, in 1922 at Kimball there was 4.8 Inches, and very little mosaic could be found. In 1923 there was two and one-half times as much. At Brownsville for the period shown, there was 9.1 inches. It is absolutely necessary to consider the weather conditions in relation to mosaic readings, in determining how much mosaic you have in the fields. We need more information along that line. Tiebout — Tou state that at 75* F. the mosaic would not be discern - ible on the foliage, or hardly so. If you keep the mean temperature at that point, will the tuber develop as it should and be reasonably healthy? Answer — If it is a mosaic tuber it will develop and be diseased. The temperature does not decrease the amount of the disease, as far as we know. It is a difference in the readings; it is not a control method. In plantings this year with three different dates of planting and readings made on all plots at the same time, we found that mosaic showed the most in the early planting. In the next planting two weeks later, the symptoms were not as marked, especially with mild mosaic. In the third planting it was impossible to detect the mild mosaic. In regard to the nature of the disease — the causes of it — I will have to admit total ignorance. No one knows what causes it, whether an organism or some internal factor in the plant we do not know. The experimental evidence would indicate that it is possibly some ultra- </seg>
            <seg id="p474">474 UWI or XOU8KA STATE BOAKD OF AGUCII.TVBC microscopic organism, not to be seen under the ordinary microscope. That does not prevent us from finding out that the disease is trans - mitted from plant to plant by insects, the chief offender being the ordinary pink and green aphids or plant lice. There may be other insects capable of transmitting the disease. The Colorado beetle has not been found to transmit the disease experimentally. Disease trans - mission in the field occurs by an insect living on a diseased plant moving to a healthy plant. These sucking insects puncture the plant and transmit the infectious material and cause the healthy plants to become diseased. The symptoms may not appear the same year that infection occurs. It takes from two to four weeks for the symptoms to appear. If trans - mission occurs late in the summer, you will not find mosaic symptoms that year. Plant the tuber and it will show mosaic the following year. That complicates the problem. The disease is also transmitted by tubers from infected plants which when planted will produce infected plants. I do not mean every tuber from a plant infected with mosaic will give an infected plant, or every eye of each tuber; but for practical purposes you can consider it almost 100 per cent. You will find very few tubers from a mosaic hill that will not produce a mosaic plant. The disease when transmitted frOm plant to plant by insects re - quires a certain amount of time to reach the tuber. It is reported to take about ten days for the disease to diffuse from the leaf to the tuber. In selecting seed, when you select healthy hills, it is best to take them a little early. You are decreasing the chance of infection being in the tuber, even if it has taken place in the above-ground portion of the plant. tWith the exception of the influence of weather on the symptoms, :h of this information on mosaic is the result of experimental work : has been carried on chiefly with the Green Mountain variety in ne under their conditions. Whether all phases of these diseases are the same on the Bliss Triumph and under our conditions, I do not know. Spindle Tuber The next disease to take up is spindle tuber. It differs from mosaic in that we can detect it on the tuber. We can not detect it on the roots, but tubers will show "running-out," elongation; the eyes will be greater in number; the color will be paler; the eyes will be shal - lower; and you will find little bumps between the eyes. In milder cases it is hard to detect. In cases where the disease is transmitted during the latter part of the season, the symptoms may not show up on the tubers that year. When you plant tubers that show the first faint signs of disease, you get the serious type. Tubers planted from plants infected this year will usually give a milder type. </seg>
            <seg id="p475">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AORIOCI.TI'RK 475 The above-ground symptoms are a spindling plant, rather erect, with leaves a little smaller than on a healthy plant. They do not show mottling. The margins of the leaves will be rather wavy and the old blossoms will tend to adhere to the plant. A plant that is badly affected with spindle tuber is easy to detect in the field, even after the foliage is gone. In the milder cases it is harder to detect the disease. We have field observations comparing the disease in Nebraska with that in Maine. Apparently it is not as severe in Maine as in Nebraska. The disease is of the same general nature as the other degeneration diseases. We do not know the tfause, but it is transmitted from diseased plants to healthy plants in the field by means of plant lice. It is carried in the tubers from one generation to the next. Many of you are familiar with the type of plant called "Curly Dwarf." This is usually due to two of these diseases occurring on the same plant. One of the forms of mosaic in combination with spindle tuber will give a plant dwarfed in shape, the leaves being small and wrinkled, very easily detected in the field and known as "Curly Dwarf." I have not mentioned the yields in regard to these diseases. That is one of the primary factors to consider. The effect of spindle tuber on yield is very great and has been observed by most of you. The effect of the different forms of mosaic on yield is not as obvious. We have not made very many tests here on yields. It is so obvious that the disease reduced the yield in the south that we have put aside such experiments for this other type of work on which we need more in - formation. Tablr 1 — Mosaic and Spindle Tuber ' Average Yields 1923 Experiments Total Marketable | Culls 1 The medium plus mosaic is probably a combination of rugose mosaic and spindle tuber. The yields were made by weighing indi - vidual hills, obtaining the average weight per hill, based on germination and calculating the yields per acre. The number of plants was small and the error would be considerable, but the relative differences were constant in all hills. This year on plots through western Nebraska, tests were made at seven different points primarily to discover the effects of the climate on ihe symptoms. However, the differences in yield were so great I Mild Mosaic Medium + Mosaic ■ipindle Tuber + Mosaic Serious Spindle Tuber _ Curly Dwarf Bu. 160 97 70 63 82 I Bu. 123 72 41 23 7 | PerCent | | . 77 75 59 37 23 Bu. 36 24 28 40 24 </seg>
            <seg id="p476">I 476 Ealso so uniform in all the plots that I gathered the information on yields to get a comparison of the damage done by these diseases, e 1 shows the results obtained from these experiments. The mild mosaic plants produced a total yield of 160* bushels per acre, 77 per cent being marketable, the rest were culls. In the medium plus mosaic, we have a combination of two different forms of degeneration disease on the same plant, and thse show a reduction from 160 to 97 bushels per acre, and only 75 per cent was marketable. A combination of spindle tuber and mild mosaic gives a further reduction to 70 bushels. There was not only a decrease in yield, but also in the percentage of yield that was marketable, only 59 per cent being marketable. With spindle tuber alone, in the severe stage, the yield was further reduced to 63 bushels. With curly dwarf, which was probably a combination of a serious type of mosaic and spindle tuber, there was a reduction of 32 bushels, only 23 per cent of which was marketable. That is a comparison of the different types of mosaic and their effect on yield. Undoubtedly the mild mosaic is not as serious as these other forms in reducing the yields. You may ask why we do not allow a greater percentage of this form of mosaic in certified seed. There has not been enough work done on the effects on yields and it has not been tested in the south. If they found you were sending mild mosaic, they would be afraid of it. The chief difficulty here in Ne - braska lies in the fact that we are unable to determine whether or not it is mild mosaic on one year's reading, because of the effect of the climate on the symptoms of the disease. If a serious mosaic plant is grown under unfavorable conditions for the disease, it will show mild mosaic symptoms. If planted next year under more favorable conditions, it would appear serious again. In going through the field, you could not distinguish whether a plant was mild mosaic, or a more serious form with the symptoms held back by temperature conditions. They must be grown two or three years to determine whether it is a constant type or not. Discussion Tiebout — Mild mosaic gave the highest yield, was there a cheek of the very best yield? Answer — The mild mosaic was from seed sent from Maine last year — what they list there as mild mosaic. Planted under Nebraska con - ditions, it was practically impossible to detect mosaic symptoms on these plants during part of the season. The greatest difficulty is in obtaining healthy checks to plant alongside the diseased stock. The strain of potatoes used for checks had a small amount of serious mosaic that reduced the yield below that of the mild mosaic. I could not say that the mild mosaic reduced the yield at all. We would have to run it a number of years in order to be sure. </seg>
            <seg id="p477">BKPOKT Or NEBBAHKA STATE BOABD Or AGBirri.Tt'BE 477 Question — How can these diseases be controlled? Answer — You cannot control them by treatment on the outside of the tuber. It is carried inside of the tuber and by insects in the field. In sections where they are numerous, spraying methods to control the insects might be of use. Perhaps it is not practical in Nebraska because we do not have large enough numbers of insects to warrant the expense of spraying. There are other methods of controlling the disease, some of them not very satisfactory. The best method is probably a hill selection of healthy seed from a field showing a small percentage of mosaic, harvesting the potatoes early, planting in an isolated seed plot, and keeping away from other commercial stock. The ordinary method practiced Is roguing. Unless this is done before insects are present, it is often not practical. In badly Infected fields there will be so much infection taking place from diseased plants to healthy plants during the summer that by attempting to go through the field and pull out the diseased plants you will not decrease the percentage greatly. Under Nebraska conditions the insects that trans - mit that disease are few. Therefore we have better results from roguing than they do in the east. There are other factors that would determine whether or not it would be of great benefit. In order to rogue properly, you should take out the diseased plants as soon as you can see them. The insects can travel for a considerable distance. Roguing late in the season does not amount to much. Tou must rogue early. At the same time, I think your own seed plots should be isolated and the seed obtained from healthy plants — selecting not only healthy plants, but plants having only healthy plants around them. If there are diseased plants close to them, don't use them. The disease might show up next year. Question — I was wondering if you have made extensive investiga - tions in connection with mosaic? Answer — We would like to, but do not expect to in the immediate future. Tiebout — Have late observations shown that the disease is on the decline or on the increase? Answer — We have not complete enough records to make sure until we take into consideration the climatic conditions. To look at the percentage of mosaic this year, you would say it is increasing. If you consider the temperature conditions, it may be different. Question — Perhaps we are more critical as we are beginning to watch this closer. Answer — That is another factor Professor Tiebout — I might say one of the great selling points is the statement that your potatoes are generally free of that disease. That is perhaps one point that will do more to maintain any prestige </seg>
            <seg id="p478">478 BKPOBT Or NEBHA.SKA STATK BOARIi OK AOBICVLTIBK you may continue to retain than any other single factor, since the mosaic disease is the great limiting factor in the production in the south. as developed in the last five years. I call your attention to the fact that the Nebraska stock on the whole during those years showed 7.9 per cent of mosaic. It is extremely important that that average be reduced as fast as possible and not permitted to increase. I was wondering what the probability is. Answer — I do not think it is a question of finding a state free of mosaic. It is a question of the state which has the smallest amount. Naturally we are attempting to reduce it as fast as possible. Professor Tiebout — I do not like to draw comparisons, but in our rtate tests last year, we had certified potato seed from another that showed up a favorably low percentage of mosaic. Answer — I would venture to state they have a limited supply of potatoes. Professor Tiebout — Yes, and they are isolated, too. You had that combination prevailing in western Nebraska some years ago. Answer — You will usually find that a new potato growing section will have less disease. If a man has been selecting his own teed, he has less chance of getting infection where the fields are isolated, and there will be less disease. As the section becomes older in this particular industry, you will have an increase in these diseases. As the disease increases, you must increase your efforts in combating it. We would like to put in the major part of our time in the study of these diseases. This whole group of diseases has been worked out in the east. There environmental conditions are different. The varieties they are working with are different, and the problem will have to be entirely reworked for this section — not just western Nebraska, but this section of the west. We must study these diseases in regard to over-wintering on other native plants. There may be other insects in this section that transmit these diseases. Those things must be worked out here. At the preaent time we can take the information we have, supplemented by our own observation, and do the best we can with it. The other diseases that would come under th'e group of degenera - tion diseases I will not take time to discuss — leaf roll. etc. Mr. Pedrett — You showed a chart with the rainfall of 1922 com - pared with 1923. This year it seems to me especially spindle tuber shows more in general than ever before. Of course, we pay more attention by field inspection. We find more spindle tuber in commercial potatoes than before. Now mosaic does not show up in the high tem - perature like we had in 1922. In 1922, according to your chart, we had the highest temperature— probably as high as in the eastern part of the slate. I am wondering if the high temperature, resulting in a poor qual- </seg>
            <seg id="p479">urorr or Nebraska state boabd of agbicultvbe 479 ity of seed, had not a big part to do with the crop of 1923 planted from 1922 plants? It was practically the same as if I had my seed from the eastern part or the state. If I did that, I would not expect anything but spindle tuber. I do not say everything that comes from the east is like that, but it stands good for potatoes. A — The reason I did not mention the weather conditions in regard to spindle tuber was that we do not have any experimental evidence on it. I have been trying to limit my discussion to known facts, rather than to theories. All I can give you is simply what we have observed happening in the fields. I think it is true that an increase in moisture would tend to favor spindle tuber. I think that is one reason the disease has been considered more closely connected with irrigated than with dry-land potatoes. The disease as it occurred this year was very serious. Last year apparently some of the fields were infected, as you say, and the symptoms did not show up. I recall one lot of potatoes certified last year, and everyone who bought the seed was satisfied with the way it looked. They culled them out as well as they could. That man and everyone who bought seed from him was rejected and the fields averaged 15 to 35 per cent of very serious spindle tuber. Undoubtedly those conditions last year masked the symptoms of the disease. Whether those temperature and moisture conditions are of the same effect all the way through I do not know. At the plots in Dawes County, while mosaic was more evident on early than on late plantings, spindle tuber was the other way around, in - dicating that the disease is favored by high temperature. The relation of sunlight and temperature has not been worked out on spindle tuber. Professor Tiebout: Spindle tuber is a new disease that has a marked bearing on certified seed. I would like to know what the tolerance is at present on spindle tuber and do you consider that out - side of the mosaic group? For instance, your tolerance on the vine diseases is 5 per cent. Is the spindle tuber determined in field in - spections? Answer — Both in field and bin inspections. I think it is included in the 5 per cent total. Werner — We allow 5 per cent on either spindle tuber or mosaic, but not more than 5 per cent of all diseases put together and not more than 5 per cent of spindle tuber in the bin. Tiebout — In making your field inspections, what percentage do you think you get of spindle tuber by the combined symptoms? Werner — Most of it, except where infection has taken place this year we probably do not get it. Question — That is a cumulative question. You get accumulated results, do you not? Goss — For two or three years. The first year you will get no symptoms at all in the field, if infection took place after the tuber was well formed. The second year both the tubers and the plant will </seg>
            <seg id="p480">480 utrarr or nehaska state boakd or agiici'itchf show the disease. The third year it will practically eliminate the strain. Those fields I saw this year showing 30 per cent of spindle tuber could not go much further and have any potatoes at all. Question — Do you advise roguing in this country? Answer — I advise it because it is the best thing we have to advise at the present time. I do not know of anything better. I would advise you to rogue early. As Mr. Cannon said yesterday, if you have a doubtful plant, pull it up and take the tubers out. Roguing done late in the season I do not think would show as great benefit, because you may have had transmission taking place late in the season and the symptoms not showing up. I am trying to talk simply about healthy seed, but you are all ask - ing so many questions about certified seed. If I were making a recom - mendation on that, I would say the best way to get a reading on mosaic would be to plant a representative sample from your various lots under conditions favorable for the symptoms of the disease to appear, and make your readings right there. To do that you would have to have a large enough plat to obtain accurate percentages. Tiebout: I notice in scrutinizing the copies of the certificates coming into my hands, you have spindle tuber listed at the bottom of the sheet. Under those circumstances say spindle tuber was 3 per cent and mosaic 3 per cent. Would that particular lot have been eliminated? t Werner: That is a proposition that must be corrected. We allow the field 5 per cent of any of these degeneration diseases, and in the i we allow 5 per cent of spindle tuber, or of all diseases together. ? might have a situation of 4 per cent mosaic in the field and I per cent spindle tuber in the bin — a total of 7 per cent, which we have allowed to go by this year. Next year we will add the field reading of mosaic onto the spindle tuber reading, whether in the field or bin, and figure not more than 5 per cent. Tiebout — Another point occurs to me that we have to watch in particular. That is certified seed from sections that are likely to have a very high infestation of plant lice. The initial reading of mosaic is made before that serious infestation. Aren't we likely in the south, if that serious infestation of insects should give a secondary infection, to get a cumulative effect there? Goss — We do not have a serious infestation Question — I am assuming such a situation existed Answer — I do not believe it does. That would be true in states where the insects are present in large numbers. We have only limited surveys. What did you find this summer in your surveys, Mr. Morrow? Morrow — Two and one-half per cent of the plants in a field were infected. Wherever I found plant lice on a plant, there was usually only one or two. </seg>
            <seg id="p481">B0OBT Off NEBBA8KA STATE BOABO OF AGBICULTUBE 481 Tiebout: The probability of heavy plant lice infestations would increase the hazard, wouldn't it? Answer — -It certainly would. Tiebout — Then we would get in those tubers if they moved to the south a cumulative effect — a primary and secondary infection. It would be the same thing, wouldn't it? t Answer — When you speak of primary and secondary infection, by nary you mean infection by insects? Question — Coming through the tuber? Answer — If the work done in recent years on Green Mountains applies to Bliss Triumphs, we do not have a cumulative effect. Mild mosaic remains mild and each type of mosaic remains constant. The only cumulative effect would be two diseases on one plant. Tiebout: Woudn't you get a cumulative effect in regard to the percentage? Answer — Yes. The insects here have been very light; this year has been most favorable for insect Infestation and yet the numbers present were very small. Our biggest difficulty has not been the trans - mission of disease in the field, but rather our inability to determine the amount of disease in the field due to the conditions it is growing under. That is the big difficulty in a season like 1922. Pedrett: Spraying at the proper time and keeping those insects you mentioned from increasing — the way they spray potatoes — would it help? Has it been tried? Answer — It has been tried in other states but not here. It would decrease the number, but whether it would pay is another question. They have been working on it in Maine. I would not recommend it for Nebraska without having more evidence in regard to the number of insects. Pedrett — If they should multiply, as it looks as if they might this year, we would have to do something to stop them. Have they had any good results? Answer — They have been able in some cases to decrease the amount of infection taking place in the field by killing off the insects, but they do not find it to be practical. Their growing conditions and type of culture makes a spray of this kind difficult to apply properly. If it ever becomes necessary in Nebraska we can expect to get more bene - ficial results because our type of culture and plant growth would make it easy to apply such a spray. It is chiefly a case of whether the bene - ficial results will pay for the cost of it. Question — For the benefit of our friends in the south, suppose one of these lice transmits the disease from a mild mosaic into a well de - veloped plant late in the season, then that is passed and sent to Louis- </seg>

Would that seriously affect this yield — that transmission in August to a healthy plant? I Answer — If the disease has had time to reach the potato, which ss about ten days from the time infection occurs on the leaves, it ild be just as serious as it would ever be. Question — Even if from mild mosaic that year? Answer — Yes. Question — Don't you think seed grown this year under more favor - able conditions — under colder weather and more rainfall — will make better seed in the south next year than last year? Answer — We hope so. We hope to have been able to eliminate more disease. Werner — I took twenty tubers affected with spindle tuber last year and sent the Maine Experiment Station, and planted the other half at the Scotts Bluff County Experiment Farm. Out here we got typical spindle tuber, very extreme. The spindle tubers in Maine were what would pass as a reasonably good type of potatoes. They reported they had typical spindle tuber symptoms as read there. We may have soils in this state upon which it is easier to read spindle tuber than on other soils. Another proposition is, one of the characteristics of the disease is slow germination. It is not uncommon for spindle tuber plants from seed planted in June to come through the soil the first of September. We had a number of those this year in our tuber graft experiments. In the exhibit in the south part of the hall you will find evidence of how this proposition is transmitted from plant to plant. A year ago was the first anything was printed or said concerning spindle tuber. Before that we had not been sure as to what was the cause of these elongated potatoes in this state. We found them in irrigated regions. In order to determine whether or not it was a disease that was transmissible from plant to plant, we took ten normal tubers* that were healthy, and ten spindle tubers we knew had the disease in a mild or advanced form. We cut both tubers into half. We planted half of the spindle tuber potato and half of the normal potato in a separate plot. Of the halves that were left, we tied the two halves together as tightly as possible and dug the eyes out of the spindle tuber so that any plant would be from the normal half. If that showed the disease, or the potatoes produced would show the disease, the disease had been transmitted from the spindle tuber hair to the normal half. We have the progeny of four hills raised from the normal half weighing from two to three pounds apiece. Between these you will notice the potatoes from the graft, weighing less than one-half pound </seg>
            <seg id="p483">KUtiKI OF NKBBAKKA HTATE H»I\KH OF U.ill'l I T1RK 483 p«r hill — distinct spindle tubers. To the right in the exhibit are small potatoes. Those are the progeny of the original spindle tuber half. That is one of the best pieces of evidence we have that it is a disease. L Other information is secured from some of the work we have done ing the last four or five years. You are familiar with the results of rotation in yield. You have reported year after year when we took potatoes from the dry land yield into our irrigated plots In Scotts Bluff County. The trouble is almost entirely 3ue to spindle tuber. When we took a dry land plot and planted it alongside a spindle tuber, the yield decreased 50 to 60 per cent, and the quality more than that. This year lots with 90 per cent spindle tuber infection produced ninety bushels, and normal potatoes originating from the same lot produced at the rate of 300 bushels per acre. In connection with the questions and answers between Dr. Goss and Professor Tiebout, the thought came that prior to this year we have not found spindle tuber in considerable amount in Sioux County, where potatoes have been grown in isolated fields. In some counties the disease is severe. We can trace those lots all over the state by the percentage of spindle tuber. We seem to have this condition: It is possible to have very mild spindle tuber — so mild it is impossible for the average farmer to detect it. Those of us inspecting fields have difficulty at times to detect the first symptoms of spindle tuber on our plants. The tubers may be very nice, but they will be a little bit shallow eyed and possibly a little bit blocky. While they produce big yields now, in two or three years they will degenerate and contain such a high percentage of spindle tuber as to be worthless. We are searching for lots that contain not even this mild form. That proposi - tion must be watched from the very start. You cannot wait for the severe form to show up and leave it in the field all summer. Another point is, it is a little difficult to detect spindle tuber in the early part of the season. It shows up more and more as the season advances, in which respect it is quite the reverse of mosaic. We are using our Louisiana trials to get information concerning certified seed lots. That work is being done by Professor Tiebout and is of tremen - dous assistance to us. If you get after him pretty hard, remember he is doing us one good turn there, although he may be Interested in cheap potatoes. (Dr. Goss resumed the floor, and answers are by him to the ques - tions that follow). Mr. Foster — At Kearney we buy 150 acres of seed each year. We have had a good deal of trouble.

When the potatoes came up, instead of one or two large, healthy stalks which we like to see, there would be a dozen of those stalks come through the ground. On those plants with the cluster of vines, we would find one or two potatoes, and sometimes none. That condition existed all over the territory to a greater or less degree. I dislike to make comparisons, but we got some seed from one particular spot not far distant from here that showed good results under all conditions, while the rest failed. You see why I am so vitally interested to find out the matter with our stuff. It lost money on account of the yield only. The President — Get any seed from Kimball? (Laughter) Answer — From your description I would say it is a separate disease entirely — one spoken of as spindle sprout. I have not mentioned it here at all because it usually is not severe enough through western Nebraska. Occasionally we find plants in a field with sometimes a large number of sprouts, — just a mass of them. I will have to plead ignorance. I do not know what causes the disease. It has been con - nected in some cases with leaf roll. It is hard to say from a description of a few plants what the matter was with the whole field. There were probably a number of things coming into play. It is the obvious thing to pick out the plants that show up the worst. Perhaps some of the apparently minor things are causing most of the damage. Question — Early blight cannot kill potatoes with no buds on the vine? We did not have potatoes on the bottom of the vine. Answer — When did your early blight come on? Question — When the potatoes were two-thirds grown Answer — That is the time they start to form tubers. K Question — One or two potatoes would be the case. The number potatoes was not there. Answer — Early blight will do considerable damage sometimes. Potato tubers are not formed much before normal blossoming time. If blight occurs early in the season it will decrease the size. Probably there were a number of things coming in to affect your yields. Fuaarium Wilt Fusarium wilt is of just as great interest to growers of the com - mercial table stock as the seed growers. It is one of the worst diseases you have in western Nebraska. In come counties it is the worst. This one thing has reduced the yield in some counties greatly out of proportion to what it should be. Some of the counties with the highest acreage have the lowest yield, chiefly due to Fusarium wilt. You get a rotten potato after it is produced, and you cannot ship it. Some </seg>

It is increased through the planting of diseased stock. The soil becomes so infested it is im - possible to grow a crop free from the disease. You are familiar with the symptoms of the disease. The first symptom that appears on the foliage is a slight mottling. I have seen men who would confuse it with mosaic. Under dry conditions the mottling will increase rapidly; the leaf will turn yellow and the entire top of the plant will wilt and die down. Under high moisture condi - tions there will not be a rapid wilting. There is enough moisture to prevent it, and many men will be fooled because their plants remain green. When he digs he finds he has a lot of stem end rot tubers, sometimes more than 15 per cent. The vines were green, but the tubers were being formed and the organism was working out into the tuber. This disease shows on the top and also on the underground stem, in the roots, and on the tuber. It rots the roots and works up into the stem and up the water tubes, producing a brown ring in the stem. In bad cases you will get a complete soft rot of the parts below the surface of the ground. Sometimes it rots the seed piece and starts up the stem in that way. The organism works out through the stolon until it reaches the tuber where a typical brown ring is produced, often causing stem-end rot. In bad cases there will be a rotten area at the stem end while the plant is still attached to the vine. The disease increases in storage. Here we have a disease different from mosaic in that we know what causes it. We know it is a small organism known as fungus. I do not need to bother with the details of the fungous growth. The organism is common in most soils. On old potato land there is usually more than on new land. The disease can start either through the roots or seed pieces. If you plant healthy seed on heavily infested soil, you will get infection through the roots. If you plant infected seed, the seed piece is weak and has a tendency to rot in the soil, and the infection will go up the plant through the rotted seed piece. Those two methods of infection — through the roots or seed piece — produce the same result in the end. There is a difference in regard to control methods. Because the disease is inside the tuber, seed treatment will not touch it. The only control is healthy seed and healthy soil. I have run across many men who thought they could plant stem end rot seed and get a good crop. One man said he planted certified seed one year and had a high enough percentage of wilt to disqualify his field. The next year he planted his stem-end rot seed and said he was going to get a fine yield. I went through the field, and found from 10 to 15 per cent of the tubers showing stem-end rot even though the plants were green. If he had planted healthy seed he would have had some infection, but not IS or 20 per cent. The infection comes generally from the soil. You will probably get the </seg>

            <seg id="p487">487 idea that if it does not come from the aeed, what difference whether the seed is infected or not? I think it is chiefly that in ease infected seed is planted such a weak seed piece will either rot in the soil, or if the plants come up, they will be weak and the disease will work up into the plant either through the roots or through the rotted seed piece. A good many men have talked about the types of discoloration occurring in infected tubers. We ran an experiment where we tried to distinguish between the different types of discoloration. Some diseased tubers will show a brown ring, others a wide band of soft rotted tissue extending through the tubers, often there is a stem - end rot with no further discoloration, or they may be a brown or black flecking or network of diseased tissue. It has been a question whether some of these types would not reproduce the disease more often than others. We separated out seven different types of discolora - tion and divided them into two lots — slight and serious. They were planted at five different points in western Nebraska. We could not distinguish the difference between the results obtained from the various types. In one plot it would seem that one type gave the greatest number of infected plants, but in another plot it would be another type, so that in the results shown in Table 2, all types of infected tubers are grouped together. i Shows chart of plot at Hemingford.) </seg>

As a matter of fact, (he reason I did not take them through was because there were no results to see at that time. Even though many plants were infected and the roots halt rotted, there was enough moisture in the soil to keep the plant from wilting. You would have said, "There is no dif - ference and we will plant infected seed." At digging time, every tuber was cut across and examined for disease and each hill weighed sep - arately. One field had 95 per cent of infected plants the previous year. The other I listed as comparatively healthy soil. On the two plots we planted certified and infected seed. The infected seed was taken from bin selection of tubers that showed stem-end rot. The first result is Fig. 7 Healthy Seed Healthy Soil Healthy Seed on Inoculated Soil Note the Decay of the Seed Piece and Roots shown under germination. The germination of the healthy seed on infected soil was 90 per cent; with healthy seed on healthy soil, it was 96 per cent. Infected seed on both plots gave 70 per cent germination. Thirty per cent of the tubers rotted in the ground. It may be as well they did rot. The next noticeable result was in the number of barren hills. With the healthy seed on both plots, every plant produced tubers. With infected seed on infected soil, 8 per cent did not have tubers at all. With healthy seed, every plant produced some marketable tubers. Only 80 per cent of the infected ones that came up produced market- </seg>

In regard to the amount of tubers infected, taken by weights on individual hills, we have the checks showing 4 per cent of infection on infected soil. On healthy soil they showed 2 per cent. The infected seed, however, resulted in 20% and 15^t respectively oT diseased tubers. That is based on the total yield. A good many of those would be culls. If you have the organism in the soil, you will get some infection even with good seed, but not as much as with in - fected seed. Infected seed on infected soil produced only 60 bushels; on uninfected soil, 117 bushels; the yield was twice as great with healthy seed. The marketable yield is 88 per cent of the total yield in the case of healthy seed, and only 71 per cent in the case of infected seed. There is no question in my mind as to whether it pays to plant infected seed. There is a reduction in germination, an increased num - ber of barren plants, an increased percentage of plants without market - able potatoes, and a big increase in infected tubers produced. The results shown here are about the same as those obtained in other plots and in previous years, representative of a number of years. It is an example of what happens when you plant that kind of seed. All I can offer on control, is healthy seed on healthy soil. It is the only way I know of to control the disease. By healthy soil I mean without a crop of potatoes within preferably four years. If the land has had a crop with a high percentage of infection within two years, I would not plant it with potatoes. We have plenty of land to rotate. Question — Last year three different parties planted seed out of the same bin. One planted the seed where corn was last year. There had never been any potatoes in that field. The other one had practically the same thing. He had a space of certified wheat and a space of corn and wheat on the other side. He put his potatoes in that plot. There had never been potatoes in that field. I put mine with no corn and no other crop, in new land with two crops of ' wheat. It was summer fallowed. I could not find one potato with stem rot. In every case where corn was the year before we found some infection. It looks suspicious. Answer — I do not believe this organism causes a disease of corn. I do not see why it would be more prevalent on corn land unless you have other factors coming in which you have not brought out. You have such factors as soil texture, moisture, temperature, etc. With lack of moisture you will get more rapid wilting. With high moisture you will get more stem-end rot. The disease is favored by a mean temperature from 70* to 77°. I would say above 77° it is unfavorable for the disease. If plants were already affected, the high temperature would tend to wilt them rapidly. High temperature is not, however, favorable for infection to take place. You have a variety of different factors that often bring about results that are hard to explain. That is why we like to run our experiments more than one year. You ob- </seg>
            <seg id="p492">492 rkpo»t or mkkhanka statk hoard or aukici i.tibk tained these results this year. It does not mean anything unless you can run it next year and get the same thing. You do not know what the factor was. Run it for a number of years. Werner — One factor is the length of time in the ground- -whether early or late. Answer — That would be a factor. Where you have infection taking place any time during the season, the disease works up the stem and into the tuber. If infection occurred late and the crop was dug early, you would expect fewer tubers to show infection. If you left them on the vines, more tubers would show infection. If you had dry conditions and the plants wilted down rapidly, you will have fewer potatoes, but not so much typical stem-end rot. That is confusing to lots of people. The largest number of infected tubers will come from plants that have not wilted. Tiebout Will seed planted in the south that is infected with stem rot injure to a great extent the commercial value of the potatoes for early marketing? Answer — I do not know of any work that has been done on that. If dug early enough so that infection had not reached the tuber, you would not expect any. I did not think it was considered much of a problem in your section. Question — We do not want much Fusarium in our food stock Answer — The biggest factor is not in regard to sending seed south, but in our own yield here. Possibly more in commercial stock than seed stock. Question — If you have infection in one field adjacent to another, both under cultivation, do you think it would spread from one to the other? Answer — The organism may be carried through the soil by irriga - tion water, and you would have a spreading. I have not been able to determine infection spreading down a row by cultivation. It sounds nice theoretically, but I can't prove it. Question — Does it seem to be more in a low place where the water ran run?

            <seg id="p493">BEPOBT OF M-BRASK A NTATE BOABO OF ACIICILTI IK 493 Dry Rot in Storage I wit surprised to find this disease on the program. The first thing I ever heard about Nebraska was that if I wanted a sample of dry rot, all I had to do was to get some Nebraska potatoes. That was ten years ago. At that time nobody wanted Nebraska potatoes. Now - adays the same men who refused your potatoes are glad to buy them, be - cause you have decreased the amount of dry rot. I do not mean you hav« eliminated it. It has been done by careful handling — the only way I know of to decrease it. It is a disease caused by an organism similar to that which produces Fusarium wilt. It is a common organism. It is around your storage house and in the soil. When you bruise your potatoes, you leave an opening for it to start dry rot. That is the problem so far as control goes. I cannot give you a patent medicine 10 control it. You must treat it in the way of sanitation. If you cut your finger, you wrap it up to prevent infection so that you do not get pus formation. You cannot do that with a potato, so don't cut them. The less the amount of bruising, the less the amount of dry rot. It ran also get into the tuber through the stem-end rot. It is not capable of going through a healthy skin. In the exhibit upstairs, there are tubers where a considerable amount of the organism was placed on the skin and kept in optimum conditions for the disease; no infection resulted. Break the skin and put the organism on under similar conditions and you have rot starting in — not only dry rot, but other storage rots. They need an opening in order to get in and start a rot. You know as much about how to prevent wounding as I do. There are various methods to decrease the amount of injury to your potatoes. Picking up of potatoes in half sacks will decrease the amount of dry rot. increasing your horsepower and moving more dirt when digging will eliminate much wounding. In regard to storage conditions, dry rot and these other tuber rot diseases are controlled to some extent by low temperatures. Don't think it kills them. It simply prevents them from growing further. If you have infection in the tubers under good storage conditions, it may not be progressing very fast. Take them out and increase the moisture and temperature and you will find they will rot rapidly. The low temperatures have prevented the growth of the organism. If you can get temperatures down to 41° F. you are preventing the increase of these organisms. They will not grow at temperatures below that. Even at temperatures slightly above that they do not grow readily. That is the only recommendation I have to make on storage rot. It is a case of using good practices in handling and storing your potatoes. I thank you. (Applause). </seg>
            <seg id="p494">494 BEPOBT Or NEBBAKKA .STATE HOARD OF AGHIC'I I.TI Kf By H. O. Werner Let us start with the digger. The moat serious source of damage is caused by the diggers — cutting the tubers in half. It was hard to dig potatoes this year. In dry seasons the digger chain is the most common source of injury to your potatoes. Much can be eliminated by putting the digger in deeper and lowering the rear chain; or taking off the rear chain and slipping in rods that slope from the first chain to the ground. The potatoes slide, instead of dropping a distance of three feet. In dry seasons when the soil is hard and dry, clods come up with the potatoes which will bruise them. Perhaps a little more study of your soil early in the season might help out on this problem. It is a matter of individual soil and climatic conditions. Some diggers have chains made with an extra wide contraption every eighteen inches, which prevents the rolling back of the potatoes. Padding the digger chains by using old garden hose (splitting and wiring a piece onto every other bar on the chain) is another means of reducing injury. I think in an average season in western Nebraska it is better to put on more horses; run the digger as deep as possible; and generally in dry seasons take off the rear attachment entirely, or else put on a set of rods which allow your potatoes to slide to the ground. The next proposition is the picking and the use of picking baskets. Much injury can be done to potatoes at picking time by dropping the potatoes into the basket. I notice in inspecting bins of potatoes (that have been dug two weeks), that when we throw the potatoes into the basket, the wire will frequently cut the potatoes a little. I heard a good story along that line this fall. One of our seed growers lined his baskets. Some of his hired men said they would not work for him any more, that he was "so tight" he lined his baskets so that the little potatoes would not fall through." (Laughter). I think he had the other proposition in mind. The potatoes are often bruised in being moved from the field to the cellar. Fortunately most of you have eliminated the open wagon box and scoop. Some of you have not. When the inspector tells you that you have 15 to 25 per cent of cut and bruised potatoes, there is a difference of opinfon, — to put it mildly. You are sure that you do not have that many until they are shown to you. This year some lots contained 50 per cent of cut and bruised potatoes, which are an absolute waste. They are a hazard to keep and their market value is injured. Dump your potatoes into half sacks, with two baskets to a sack, and have a man on the wagon and another on the ground.

Roll them out. You can do it easily. The largest potato growers in the state handle their potatoes that way. One man with about 65,000 bushels handled all his fields that way. It saved lime and reduced the number of cut potatoes materially. I have never known a man who gave the half-sack proposition a fair trial who considered using any other method. Crates are more bulky than sacks. If filled over full, the upper potatoes will be crushed. Crates may not be quite as good, especially if the sack proposition is properly handled well. Another proposition is in loading the potatoes into the cars. Some - times considerable damage is done which will show up before they reach their destination in the form of some type of rot. By storing potatoes under good conditions, with low temperature, the amount of dry rot can be greatly reduced. I would like to emphasize the fact Mr. Cannon brought out yes - terday. When you sell potatoes to a man for the first time, you should figure that your transaction is not ended. With that idea, you want those potatoes to get to the buyer in good condition. If potatoes have dry rot infection through rough handling, it is perfectly possible under ideal conditions to keep them in good condition until sold without much dry rot developing. Shipments are on the railroad for one to three weeks — almost always, never less than a week. The temperature in a car may run up to 60° or 70° or more, especially if shipped late. The ventilators may be closed and dry rot will advance rapidly. What may have been a car with less than 1 per cent of dry rot at the ship - ping point may show 15 per cent (in all stages) by the time the car gets to Louisiana or Texas or some other point. There is where the demand exists for your potatoes. There is where the reputation is made. The proposition is not solved by keeping the potatoes in good condition until you let go of them, but by assuring the quality delivered to the buyer. This year the problem of digging potatoes was different from the customary problem. The trouble was not to get enough dirt with the potatoes, but to get little enough. A potato digger that will handle Early Ohios is often not worth much for Bliss Triumphs. Keep those ideas in mind until next fall and give them a fair chance and I think you will find the difficulties from dry rot and the com - plaints on the market will be reduced very materially. l&gt;i-l llssioll Tiebout — Storage is the proposition with us.

Answer — Cold storage of between 35° to 38° is the optimum, and have enough humidity in storage to prevent shrinkage — loss of weight — but not more than that. I think the weight of potatoes can be maintained to at least 99 per cent over a two months' period under those conditions. Tiebout — What humidity? Answer — I do not want to quote absolute figures — just enough to keep from shrinking. Tiebout — What is the usual temperature of a cellar in this section of the country? Answer — The average temperature I have noticed in good cellars over December, January and February can very easily be maintained around 40*. That brings up another problem which is often overlooked. In warm seasons if cellars are left open in the daytime in the autumn, you will be starting some of your dry rot troubles there. If the weather is very warm it is desirable to close the doors in the daytime. Leave the ventilator open. Open the doors at night so as to let in all the cool air possible. During the fall on cool days leave the doors open as much as possible to get in cool, fresh air. Get your potatoes down to low temperature as quickly as possible. I think it is preferable to have a moving air space within three feet of every potato by means of false bottoms, double partitions and air flues. The potatoes will germinate heat after they get into the cellar. The temperature at the bottom of the bins will often run 6° higher after they are there for a short time than when put in. Mr. Foster — I might give a little information from a man with twenty-five years' experience in storing potatoes. He tells me the temperature in storing should be governed by the length of time the potatoes are in storage. You can injure the germination of the potatoes by too low temperature, if kept too long. You can kill it entirely. He says he has done that. His temperature under sixty to ninety days is 34*. He likes to keep it there. Others say 37°. This man's information should be valuable to anybody storing potatoes in cold storage. He says 34° for sixty to ninety days means you will have a nice potato that will weigh as much as it did when it went in. The President — I want to ask if stem rot increases in storage under cold temperature. Dr. Goss — There is an increase due to other organisms coming in that produce a greater rot. The actual browning if confined to the ring would not increase much. It is hard to check up. </seg>
            <seg id="p497">497 BErOftT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGBICl'LTl'KE The President — 1 read about an immense lot of potatoes stored in Chicago. They were supposed to be A No. 1 potatoes when put in storage. The loss amounted to thousands^of dollars. When they came out of storage they were not the stock they had put in. The growers lost and the cold storage people won the case. It was proved by experiments that those potatoes had stem rot when put in, and in spite of keeping the proper temperature, they developed more and rame out in worse condition than they went in. Dr. Goh — Probably because the potatoes were infected when they went in. It is hard to check up on a tuber and tell whether it is increasing in a browning that is internal. As far as the organism itself, we can get it in pure culture. When I say they do not grow, the only method is to take a pure culture and test it. With a tem - perature at 41° the organism ceases to grow, although the temperature does not kill it. Moat of the market reports of cars going out of Nebraska (reports through the Washington office) at point of destina - tion show what is found In those cars. The main thing is dry rot and several bacterial rots, but very seldom any stem-end rot. The main trouble is wounding and poor packing, and you get a bacterial rot or dry rot that is due more to wounding than infection in the field. I brought along a couple of cultures of the organism that causes the stem-end rot. You can see how they grow. You will find small circular rings marking the day's growth. They will run one-fourth to one-half inch a day. If you were to drop the temperature to 41°, they would not increase at all. The President — The marketing of potatoes is just as important as the producing. That will be discussed this afternoon. Our present system is that everybody tries to get there first. There has never been so much attention paid to marketing, as the last year or so. It comes because it is absolutely necessary. We must have an orderly marketing system so that we do not rush into one town and overload it. while another town has a scarcity. That will keep the price down. Adjournment was declared until 1:30 P.

We offer the use. free of all charge, of the largest armory in western Nebraska for exhibition purposes, and the choice of sev - eral commodious and comfortable buildings for meeting places We will extend the courtesy of a" luncheon or- supper, as your Program Committee may plan with nt The keys of the city will belong to you and we shall undertake to provide suitable entertainment for your spare moments. Among the advantages we uree in behalf of our invitation is the central location and accessibility of our city in relation to all the potato-growing sections of western Nebraska; three hotels and a number of lodging houses and private homes for entertain - ment facilities; the growing importance of the potato industry in this valley; the interest attached to our new South Side irriga - tion project with its mile and a quarter tunnel, and the putting of 18,000 acres locally under irrigation. It has been several years since the Convention has been held in this section, and Gering has never had the honor, hitherto. A live-wire city of 2,500 population with progressive merchants and a community of up-to-date farmers, representing a forward - looking community spirit, invite you.

Werner, Department of Horticulture, College of Agriculture. Lincoln. Nebraska The speech for this afternoon is one of these endless speeches.. We are about fifty-five minutes late on it. There are many important things that should be said. If I do not say them now I will have to write them, and you won't read the letters, or forget them and say you have never heard about them. There are many changes to be made. When people first started going across this country, they went in prairie schooners. That was the best they had at that time. Our certification started out with the best we had in the way of potaoes and men — both growers and inspectors. We must improve as time goes on. We are hoping the growers are improving. We know the potatoes are improving. We are hoping the inspectors will improve as time goes on. We need to tighten up in our methods and do better work all the way through. I want to outline specifically what the function of the University of Nebraska, as represented by the Agricultural College, is in con - nection with this certification work; and some of the things not the function of the University. The first function is education. We are an educational institu - tion. The primary reason for starting the seed potato certification work was because we are supposed to do educational work among the people of the State of Nebraska. We chose the method of certifying seed potatoes as the best means of interesting the people in the potato industry In improving seed potatoes — the fundamental proposition in the potato industry. We decided, if we could show some financial reward for improved potatoes, there would be more incentive for growing them. For that reason we assumed the responsibility of certifying as to the quality of the potatoes we inspected. That is the major reason we have considered it our function to certify potatoes. The function of the University as represented by the Horticultural and Plant Pathology Departments, is to give you all the information </seg>
            <seg id="p503">RKPORT OF NKBRASKA STATE ROAM) OF AG1ICII.TIBE 503 possible on the growing of seed potatoes — the latest and most trust - worthy information we can secure in this state and from workers outside. I am sure those of you here this morning were amply repaid by being able to hear the discussion by Professor Gobs. Any grower who heard it has a better idea of what potato diseases are and why some things are insisted upon in certification work. Another function is to assemble a lot of potatoes from every certi - fied seed lot and from most of the lots rejected, and plant them at places where we can get best results of the type we want. For that reason we sent last year, and will send this year, a sample of every lot of potatoes certified in Nebraska to the State of Louisiana for trial purposes. We will plant a similar plot at some high altitude point here. We can get mosaic readings and a line on various things con - cerning them. We may be able to advise you people better next spring as to the quality of your potatoes than we can now. Professor Goss pointed out that some diseases show up early in the season and you may have a fairly good certification on your potatoes. That may not show the actual conditions of the potatoes, as they will perform next year. You may have mild infection in your stock which will show up later. We conduct these Louisiana trials primarily for your benefit. If we find a lot does show up well this year, we can inform you by the middle of May before you have planted your crop for the coming year. The University has no function whatsoever in connection with the sale of any potatoes. We have no connection with regard to the setting of price. I shall limit my answers to all of your questions concerning price to a statement of the prices that have been received and the prices that are being received as we get the information at our office. I would prefer that you do not ask me for advice concerning future prices. That is not my function. If I do give suggestions, you may immediately forget that I made them as suggestions and quote them as a statement that I said a certain price should be received. We want you to get the maximum price, but we want to state that we have no connection whatsoever with stating what the price should be. Our major and specific interest is to certify to the quality of the potatoes and to do our work in such a way that anyone who buys those potatoes can depend upon that certification. If we do that work thoroughly, the price proposition will, in the course of time, (with considerable ruffling of feelings), take care of itself. We sometimes stray from what certified seed really is. I am not especially interested in running the seed certification business as a means for booming western Nebraska. Anything that brfngs on a boom is unstable. In some sections, some men have taken it up as a teal estate proposition to show how many bushels can be grown per </seg>
            <seg id="p504">504 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATK BOARD OP AGRICri.TfRE acre and how much the land would be worth. People brought in on a scheme like that would not make certified seed growers, in most rases. Our object is to locate the best lots of seed potatoes in the state and assist the growers in keeping them good, or making them better; also to give a true statement concerning those potatoes, whether they amount to fifty thousand or fifty bushels — whether belonging to the richest or poorest man in the locality makes no difference to us. We aim to play fair to all and have this certification service available to everyone who cares to abide by the rules, and does so. There is a difference of opinion as to what constitutes certified seed. We have the Triumph as our major industry. We have a market for Early Ohios, but it is doubtful whether it is as desirable a proposi tion for us as the Triumph. The Irish Cobbler is another proposition we may get into. In the case of varieties raised on dry land in western Nebraska, our market is not at home. Our major market is far removed — a thousand miles from here. That market wants a large supply of potatoes annually. The potatoes they can get from other sources - certified seed from the states northeast of here — are not satisfactory. The certified seed from some of those localities has not been as satis - factory as desired. Thus far our certified seed from Nebraska seems to have given satisfaction everywhere in competition with other lots of potatoes. The difference between the common run of stock from Maine, also the stock they raise themselves in the south and our better dry - land stock is so great that in the south they can use our lots which are not absolutely perfect (with regard to seed qualities), to considerable advantage and profit. All of the lots we certify are sufficiently good for any grower in the Gulf coast country to use for seed purposes. I do not recommend every one of the certified lots as seed stock for the seed grower in the north. There is a considerable difference there. One man uses it one year and disposes of the crop. The other man wants to get permanent stock. He must keep his stock up. Seed just on the border line is not the kind a seed grower in the north wants. He wants the ten or twelve best lots in the state. Those better men should be given consideration financially in accordance with the quality of the potatoes they have. I think it is reasonable to expect that some of those growers should get more money than others, based on the quality of their goods. All the growers can not expect to get the top price for all their stuff. After a while the price becomes so high as to be prohibitive. A grower in the north may be able to pay the fabulous prices asked for the best seed, if he is raising potatoes for seed purposes. I do not think it is advisable for the hundred or more certified seed potato growers to expect to get that price, because 99 per cent have not done the work to justify the additional Investment on the part of the buyer, and the market would </seg>
            <seg id="p505">BEFOBT OF NKBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AOBICUI.TUBE 505 not stand for that proposition. It would soon break and we would have the law of supply and demand coming in also. I am hoping that in future we can make two grades of certified seed — one which might be called 'superior certified seed," which we would list as having a very small amount of all the diseases (after giving it a two-year trial), and consider that as the quality of stock to be used by the seed potato growers. The breeder who intends to continue breeding livestock must have considerably better individuals lhan the grower who wishes to raise feeder stock animals, or wants to have animals better than scrubs. In connection with the work this coming year, we will make more requirements, and will hold to some requirements made in the past pprhaps a little more strictly. We will not require certified seed to be used for seed purposes. We think there may be lots of potatoes we have not yet inspected that may be sufficiently good to be certified. Possibly some isolated lots may be superior to lots we are certifying. However, we will refuse to accept for certification this coming year any potatoes planted with potatoes coming from a field rejected be - cause of spindle tuber, mosaic, or fusarium wilt. It is not worth while to attempt to make certified seed from seeds rejected for these reasons. We have followed this proposition for three years carefully, and the chance of a man getting certified seed from these is slim. If he can meet the requirements, he must do so much work that it is not as profitable as getting new seed and starting all over. All applications this next year must (probably) be in before April first. By present plan, unless we are in possession of a one-bushel sample of the seed you are going to plant next year, you will not be eligible. A bushel of potatoes for trial purposes must be sent to the point we designate so that we can plant those potatoes, together with the stock certified this year, in an early trial plant so as to get some readings in those trial plants. We very much prefer— we do not insist -if you intend to change seed potatoes, that you ship us a sample of seed of the quality you will plant, before January tenth, sending it to Mr. Neuswanger, at Alliance, so that we may include it in the shipment that goes to the south about that date. That will protect you. If the lot you intend to plant shows up with high mosaic content by May first in Louisiana, it will mean considerable to you, because you will know whether to go ahead with certification or to plant that seed. We will probably ask that a fee of five dollars be sent with each application on April first. By June 20th the customary fees per acre are to be paid; so that you will not be out the money for the entire inspection until that date. Since we have required all lots be treated before planting, we have not rejected a single lot because of scab. Two years before we made </seg>
            <seg id="p506">506 BEPOBT Or XEBBAKKA STATE BOAKI) OF AGKM't'l.Tt Kl that requirement, we rejected as much as 25 per cent of the crop because of rhizoctonia. Evidently seed treating pays. With our certi - fied seed this disease is practically unknown. Many of you know how poor some of the potatoes are that have been raised on lands with short rotations. In western Nebraska, it is not advisable to plant potatoes on the same land more than once in four years, and preferably five or six years. Our stipulation has been and will be that no potatoes shall be entered for certification when planted on land which grew a crop of potatoes within less than four years. Three crops shall have been grown between. There is a place where we will depend upon your honesty. You will not gain in the long run by violating that principle. One or two did it this year. Of these lots, one field was rejected, and in the other field 60 per cent of the potatoes were scabby. You can beat the game temporarily. In the course of time it is liable to beat you. We may do a new thing this year. Professor Goss went into detail to explain to you why sometimes we find more mosaic in western Ne - braska than others, due mainly to temperature conditions. If we want to grow certified seed out here, we must make the proposition abso - ultely reliable. If we give the benefit of the doubt to anybody, it must be given to the buyer, because if your buyer is disappointed, you may not only make him disgruntled for one season, but you may lose out on selling to him and his neighbors for several seasons. Con - sequently if there is an element of doubt at any time, I think it is preferable that the growers in the north shoulder that element of doubt, rather than to expect a man somewhere else who buys potatoes in good faith to do that. We this spring advised many of you to withdraw your applications for inspection work after we made mosaic readings in Louisiana. Up in Dawes in July I made the statement that "a thousand acres listed for certification should really be withdrawn." The results throughout the season confirmed that statemen as being pretty close to the truth. We plan this year to take the no es on the Louisiana plots and on our early planted plot in western Nebraska as a basis for reading mosaic, in addition to the field readings. If we find the conditions in western Nebraska are such, on account of the temperature being too high, that we can not read mosaic distinctly in July and the early part of August when the first inspection is made, we will probably consider the mosaic readings in our trial plots as a basis upon which to work. In case a lot shows high in the trial plot and low in the field, we may drop that lot so far as certification is concerned. We will plant the trial plot six weeks before you plant your field. We will have potatoes a foot high before your potatoes are through the ground. Generally the temperature is lower and we can make mosaic readings well. I think you will see the fairness of that propo - sition and agree that it is a solid basis upon which to conduct our </seg>
            <seg id="p507">507 RKPOKI OK NKHRASKA STATE HOARD OK At.Kh'l I I'l KK work. It is probably the only way we see for getting reliable mosaic readings. Those plots will be made larger this year so that we will have at least three hundred plants of each lot in each trial plot. This fall we had a great deal of trouble making bin inspections. One group wants potatoes inspected in September. Another is not ready to have the potatoes inspected when we come the first of Novem - ber. We can not make special inspections on any one set date. If you want early inspection, we will do the best we can to give it to you. We can not promise to do that. If we have to send a man fifty or one hundred miles to make one inspectior,, he is losing the time which should be devoted to seven or eight inspections. Most of the trouble is due to late digging. This year has been a difficult season in which to harvest potatoes. I was out here digging potatoes myself for the three weeks during which time potatoes should have been dug. Where T was it was raining all except two days. It was quite significant to me that some of our best potato growers — scattered in every locality — were able to get their entire crop out before severe frost occurred. In view of the experience we have had, this year, especially, with field frost, we will probably base our inspections on the assumption that all potatoes are dug by October 20th, which ia somewhat later than I think is really advisable. We will then start to make our in - spections. If a man does not have his potatoes in the cellar by that time, we will have to pass him by until all our inspection work is done. We can not come back in two or three days. The man who has his potatoes ready will be given the service to which he is entitled. We will also have to be more careful concerning the frost proposi - tion. If any lots contain frozen potatoes next year, we will require those potatoes to be re-sorted entirely before we will certify them. We are having too much trouble this year because of careless sorting on the part of some growers. If a lot of potatoes contains 5 per cent of frosted potatoes, we might require them to be sorted, and then give them another bin inspection or sack inspection a reasonable length of time after that. The proposition of frost necrosis has come up for consideration this year. Many potatoes out after the 24th of October did not show watery potatoes. When we got to cutting, we found them discolored in the Interior — a typical frost necrosis. You can see some pictures in the bulletin by Professor Goss up with his exhibit. Those potatoes may keep. Some of them may grow. One of the men whose field was turned down because of 85 per cent showing frost necrosis, was going to show us up next year by using those potatoes for seed and then listing them for certification. I wish him luck, but if he gets a 25 per cent stand I won't be surprised. Many of them may have healthy eyes, but many eyes are liable to have been killed. The probabilities are that those potatoes will show a few sprouts. They will be rather weak. They will come through the 3oil late. Many may rot in the </seg>
            <seg id="p508">508 EEPOBT OT NKRKASKA STATK HOAKII OF AdBICI'ITlRK ground before they produce plants. It is hazardous to plant thai type of stock, and we can not consider certifying anything like that. It is surprising, how many people expected us to do it. If you are com - pelled to use stock of that kind, the best suggestion I have, is to cut your seed pieces twice as big as usual. Have a good sized seed piece, so that even if the sprout is weak, it will be pushed along. A statement made to me by Mr. Sawyer was quite a surprise. He told me that twenty years ago when he was farming south of Rushville. he had an experience with frost injured potatoes. He dug the potatoes and put them into storage and they kept well. He planted them the following spring. He got from two to three plants to a quarter mile row throughout the field. We will have to combine the mosaic percentages found in the field and the spindle tuber percentages found in the bin, and report them under total virus or degeneration diseases. If we find 4 per cent mosaic in the Held, and 2 per cent spindle tuber in the bin, we would have to consider that stock as having mosaic plus spindle tuber, because it is all in there. You may have rogued out your mosaic stock in the field. If those plants were in the field, they were a menace as long as they were there. Some of you have been unable to understand the certificates we sent to you. They were based upon tlie first mosaic reading. At the second inspection we seldom tried to read mosaics carefully. It was out of the question. The weather was too hot. We therefore took the first mosaic reading. If the spindle tuber reading in the field was higher than in the bin, we took the field reading, because many plants adjacent to those badly infected spindle tuber plants will show that tendency this coming year. It is only fair to the buyer and yourself to know the approximate valuation of that stock. On the matter of inspections, we want to make our first inspection as early as possible. We will make a number of inspections this year and not adhere to two. We may make four or five. We will endeavor to make at least three. We will notify you when the first inspection will be made. We will not obligate ourselves to notify you when the other inspection will be made. Probably the inspector will tell you after the first inspection as to the approximate length of time granted to you for cleaning up the field; but he will not be obligated to wait any certain length of time before coming back. The first inspection is not for the purpose of education entirely, but to detect the quality of your seed Prom the mosaic standpoint, the first inspection is of most importance We will have early field meetings again this coming season. Those field meetings are planned for the purpose of informing all of you men concerning the difficulties you will encounter, allowing you to revive your acquaintance with them and refresh your memory as to the symptoms of these diseases. In some sections the growers had the mistaken idea the first inspection was for that purpose. </seg>
            <seg id="p509">MEFOBT Or *EB*ASKA NTATK BOARD OF AGE1CI I.Tl BK 509 Another proposition in which we will probably call upon you older growers for active support is the checking up on lots of potatoes sorted and ready for shipment. This year we have an arrangement with the State Bureau of Markets whereby the local inspector acts as our in - spector. Regardless of the fact every potato grower claims he is as honest and efficient as any other, it was necessary for these inspectors to turn down 20 per cent of the cars offered for shipment this fall i before December 1 ) . It is extremely important that we check up by somebody more interested than some of the local inspectors might be, in certification as a whole. The best scheme I know of is the one to require all certified seed potatoes to go through a warehouse. I hope some day that can be done. Our certification work will not be 100 per cent satisfactory until that is accomplished — until we have a uniform grading by a disinterested party. In the meantime, since it would involve consider - able expense and require a well organized organixation, possibly the following scheme will work well: to give each grower who has never given any trouble in sorting seed potatoes permission to grade his own potatoes; that all the newcomers or men who have given trouble at some time by not sorting their potatoes properly, be required to have the approval of some one, or perhaps three, certified seed potato growers in his locality who can be relied upon to see to it that those potatoes have been properly sorted. We will withhold tags until we get information by the parties authorised by us that the stock is up to par. It may mean unpleasant situations in some neighborhoods, but I think it is the best thing to do. I hope we can get that proposi - tion organized. Even though adjustments are made after the potatoes have gone into the market, such adjustments indicate that there is risk in the buying of certified seed potatoes. This afternoon we have set aside considerable time for the con - sideration of the marketing phase of the question. I will digress onto tnat subject. I do not pose as a marketing expert or an expert on economics. I have watched the certification business more closely than anyone else in the state, and I think I can make a few suggestions. Some are just ideas advanced — not even suggestions for action. Let us consider the way we have marketed our certified seed potatoes in the past. It has been almost entirely a buyers' market. The buyers have discovered somehow where we have had good seed potatoes. Nobody has gone to them especially to tell them, (with the exception of the educational work done in Louisiana), that certified seed potatoes were better. They found it out and wrote up and inquired. They bought certified seed potatoes. In certified seed we have a standardized article, but not advertised. So far as I know, nobody is spending a cent in advertising western Nebraska potatoes. It is a well understood fact that you can not create much of a demand for anything without advertising. If you do not have much demand, you do not have much </seg>
            <seg id="p510">510 RKPORT OF \KHRANKA STATE BOARD OF AliKK'l I Tl KK of a price. Therefore, perhaps one of the solutions for the low price is advertising to get more people interested in your product. If you do not increase the number of people interested in your product, you muat be contented with the price the people who are interested want to give you. That is recognized in all business enterprises. Another thing is, we have always depended upon somebody else to do our business for us — to do the selling. Last year many of you men would not have sold your potatoes if it had not been for Professor Tiebout in Louisiana who, through himself and the other men in his Department, interested many individuals. We know definitely that some of them would never have even thought of buying Nebraska potatoes if their interest had not been attracted by the work of the Louisiana people. There is nobody like that working in Arkansas. Mississippi, Texas or Oklahoma, and the number of potatoes that went into Louisiana was great in comparison with those going to other states where no preliminary work had been done. That showed de - finitely the result of somebody doing aggressive advertising work. It was not you people. It was a party removed a thousand miles who became interested because of the seed needs of his customers, not because of the selling needs of you people. I have been amazed sometimes this fall at the lack of information on the part of the certified seed potato growers as a whole concerning the market they are supplying. The price of cotton, the price of potatoes received last spring and the general marketing conditions in the south enter into the demand for seed potatoes in the south during the winter. They recognize those as important factors. We know the general size of the potato crop. We do not have any in - formation concerning the buying ability of the south. Therefore, if any man comes up here from the south, or with southern connections, he may tell you the south is hard up. I have noticed that every year the south is "hard up." Some years they are harder up than other years. "They are not going to plant many potatoes, because last year they lost on potatoes." After a certain amount of that talking — because it is a good talking point to them — the growers weaken and the price weakens with the grower. Perhaps it should weaken. Per - haps it should not. Nobody here has information and we all guess. Some quotations are high and some low, and some sell at a low price and affect the market unfavorably, and others are an outrageously high price and drive buyers out of the market. With a short selling season such as we have in this state, it is important that we have business arranged to do business quickly. The absolute lack of organization of any kind or facilities for doing business greatly retard the doing of business up here. I think it is rather a primitive way for us to expect the certified seed list, — which contains all the information the grower needs to buy seed potatoes, — to sell our potatoes. </seg>
            <seg id="p511">511 KKTOBT Or NEBRASKA 8TATE BOABO OF AftklCULTUBE You growers should get together, as I see it, and at least have some means of advertising your product in the regions where it needs to be advertised. Don't be afraid to spend a little money on advertis - ing. Probably one of the ways would be to nave a representative who knows certified seed potatoes and has business ability to go down into your buying region and there size up the conditions, get acquainted with the trade, and talk up certified seed. It needs personal contact. There are hundreds of potential buyers in the south who have never learned what certified seed is, or that Nebraska certified seed has special merits. He might sell for an organization or for individuals, or might not sell at all, and still be worth a great deal to you. If you could be advised that your price would be in line at a certain figure and have a sound business basis upon which to arrive at that point, it would help considerably. I think it would be more desirable to have a very stable and mod - erate price, year in and out, than to try each year to get the highest price, which will drive buyers out of the market. It might be that you would want to do that by means of organization. I know there are men amply qualified to talk certification from both the scientific and the selling standpoint who would be available for work of this kind in representing Nebraska growers in the south. You would un - doubtedly have to pay those men a good compensation, but they would he worth it. We have supplied this carload of potatoes for them to distribute to their boys' and girls' clubs in Louisiana. That piece of work cost you growers about $600. Professor Tiebout has pretty good, con - servative information to the effect that it will probably sell fifty-three cars thin year. The cost will be around $1,000. After this year I will let it to you as to whether you wish to continue work of that kind. We will conduct demonstration work of that kind in Oklahoma, and perhaps Florida and a few other states. As an educational insti - tution, our activities must be limited mostly to cooperating with other educational institutions in the south. You can not expect them to take care of your proposition entirely. DiM-11—.iiin Question — You did not mention how early we could plant potatoes in western Nebraska. Answer — I think it will be best to have them planted between June 1st and 25th. The President We have here a marketing specialist from Lincoln. Mr. Boomer. We won't have him here tomorrow.

            <seg id="p512">512 BEFOBT Or XEBftASKA STATE BO A El) Or AGHCII.TI RK PRODUCTION AND 1USTKIHI Tlo\ Mr. George R. Boomer, Agricultural College, Lincoln, \ebruk« As there is not much time to spare and you are anxious to get to the remaining part of the regular program I will take only a few minutes in calling to your attention the fact that in my opinion there are two principal divisions of the farming business. Those two phases are of equal importance. One is production and the other is distribu - tion. Neither can be successful without the other. The result of an investigation before the war showed that Austria- Hungary produced more per acre than any other country in Europe; and it also revealed the fact that the American farmer produced seven times as much per man as the farmers of Austria-Hungary, showing that the American farmer is seven times as efficient when it comes to production per man as the best farmers of Europe. I take it that if this statement is true that it is not because he does not have the ability equal to the farmers of other countries. It is not because he could not be as good a distributor as any of the peoples of Europe. It is because he has not given as much attention to that part of his business. The Nebraska farmer has left it largely to others to figure out the best methods of distributing the products of the farm. I used to think that Henry Ford was a mechanical genius. Since I have been riding around the country with these county agents. I have changed my mind. I still believe he is a genius, but I think he showed his ingenuity more in the distribution of his product than he did in its mechanical features. When you get a Ford car it is like buying groceries. You go back and get some more. How does it happen you can get more of it? (Laughter). The facts are it doesn't just happen I was out in the Sand Hills last summer and one day when I was out in the country about fifteen miles from any place I came upon a mail carrier who had gotten into a blow-out and twisted an axle off his Ford. He went over the hill to the house of a man he knew and said, "I'm in trouble. I twisted an axle off the car." He put in an expressive word there that I am leaving out. (Laughter). The rancher turned around and went into a little shop and soon came out with a Ford axle in his hand and they together put the axle in place and the mail carrier went on his way rejoicing. You say that that just hap - pened. It may be that in this particular instance it did just happen, but as a general proposition it didn't just happen. Henry thought it all out. He was thinking about the marketing of his product when he made it obligatory upon the people who sold his car that they should keep on hand a supply of repairs at all times so that you could get "some more" no matter where you were. </seg>
            <seg id="p513">513 RKPORT OF NKBBASKA STATE BOARD OF AGBICl'LTURE There is quite a large number of farmers who think we have solved the problem of production. I do not believe that we have so far or ever will have completely solved the problem of production. As I listened to the discussions here today it was impressed upon me that we are attempting to solve some of the problems of production, and the most important problem is how to lower the cost of production. That will always be a problem. For example, advance steps toward the control of potato diseases are steps toward the lowering of the cost of production. Ford is studying that problem of lowering the cost of production all the time. Someone said to him the other day, "I have a little device which I thing would be a good thing to put on your cars." "I am not interested. If you can tell me how I can take some - thing off, I will listen to you." Laughter). Conditions are changing with respect to farming. My father came to Gage County and bought some of the best land in that county for ten dollars an acre. When land was the highest a few years ago he rould have sold it for $2 50 an acre. He could have put his thumbs in his vest and said, "When I was on the farm we were successful. We did not have any Agricultural College or Extension Service or any farm organizations such as the Farm Bureau or Farmers' Union or anything of that sort. We did pretty well without them." I am not saying what he did do as a farmer. But all he would have had to have done to have had considerable money when he sold the land would have been to have just stayed there and eked out a bare existence and he would hare had some money in spite of himself. Those conditions have changed. I homesteaded and bought more cheap land and raised white-faced cattle and milked white-faced cows to pay expenses. I have four boys and each has a sister. It is the same sister. (Laughter). I have often thought if any of the four boys or that girl ever own a Nebraska Farm they will have to know, if they are going to pay for it, how to produce stuff at a low enough cost so that when it is put upon the market there will be a margin of profit. If they never learn how to do that thing, they will never be able to own a Nebraska farm. That is a straightforward proposition. We are facing new conditions and methods, and a better understanding of these conditions is going to be necessary. I have not time to go into the marketing. There are so many different forms. I was listening to one of the discussions this after - noon. It was intimated there were subsidiary considerations that en - tered into these things. When you begin to discuss this question, there is a good deal enters into it. What may seem, on the surface, to be an easy job, when we begin it we will find there is a good deal to take into consideration. I think we should study it carefully. I would eneourage the formation of marketing organizations, because </seg>
            <seg id="p514">514 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD Or AGUCCLTUBE through cooperation we will be able more easily and efficiently to solve some of these problems of distribution. One of the difficulties in cooperative marketing is that we believe in cooperation in theory, but in practice we do not. It is like the two fellows going into a city. They were trying to figure out how to get a little money. In crossing a bridge which spanned the river, they saw a big sign which read: "FIVE DOLLARS REWARD FOR THE RESCUE OF A DROWNING PERSON." Tom said to Bill. "There's our chance! You fall into the river and 1 will pull you out, and we'll divide the money." Bill said, "But I can't swim." "That doesn't make any difference. I am a good swimmer." When they reached the middle of the bridge, Bill tumbled into the water. He promptly sank, but came up, and repeated this a second time. When he came up the third time, he only had breath enough to call, "Why in thunder don't you get me out?" Tom answered, "I see another sign, and it reads: 'TEN DOLLARS FOR THE RECOVERY OF A DEAD BODY." (Laughter). That is where cooperation ceases. That is one of the big difficulties we are facing. However, I want to say right here that I think through cooperative organization we will be able to accomplish more. We hear a great deal about California eggs in New York City. They organized cooperatively to market those eggs. One of the first things they did was what you are trying to do with your potatoes. They tried to standardize and grade them so that they could sell them regularly in a systematic way. The first year they marketed five carloads of eggs; the second year, eight. This year they will have marketed 1,800 carloads of eggs in New York City alone. I had a letter from a man in California who sells poultry food. H&gt; - said, "I wish you would put me in touch with some elevators in Ne - braska where I can buy corn without going through the Grain Exchange at Omaha. I want it to crack to sell as poultry food." Here was a man buying Nebraska corn; paying the high freight rate; selling it to the poultry man; feeding the old hens, and shipping the eggs to New Tork, and still outselling in net profits. Somebody will say, "It is a better climate, of course. Hens lay better." They would say it is the climate, of course. The fact* are a little study of the matter showed the same hen will lay more eggs in Nebraska than in California during the year. There are more days egg production is checked on account of the hot temperature in California than days in Nebraska when it is checked on account of the low temperature; and we can overcome the low temperature by proper feeding and housing, and they can't overcome the high temperature. So that is not the reason. They have systematized and standardized </seg>
            <seg id="p515">KKPOKT OF NKHKASKA STATK BOARIl OF U.KICI ITIBF. 515 their marketing go they are able to outsell us in net profits on the New York market. I am not willing to admit that the people in California have greater ability than the people in Nebraska. If we will give our attention to the marketing of our product and do all that is necessary, so that we may have the right kind of a product to market, we will be able to market as efficiently as California. I have bought Nebraska potatoes in Lincoln whenever I could get them. I have done it a good deal through patriotism. I can not see that there is much difference between Nebraska and Minnesota potatoes. The other day I went into a market and told the man I wanted a sack of potatoes. He said, "Here are some fine Minnesota potatoes." I said, "I don't want Minnesota potatoes. If you have Nebraska potatoes, I will talk business." He said, "I bought a carload of Nebraska potatoes. Before I dis - posed of all of them, they began to go down on me; and I lost money on the car. I am not selling Nebraska potatoes any more." Probably gome of the potatoes he sold me were Nebraska potatoes. He was attempting to show me he had something superior. Because the Minnesota potatoes have a good name, h,e was taking advantage of it. I do not know how they are grading this year or whether potatoes are upon the market that should not be sent; but it was impressed upon me that those who are producing in Nebraska have a good deal to do in standardizing their product and putting a standard product upon the market, so that when a carload comes they can say, "Those are No. 1 Nebraska potatoes," and the buyer will know what he is getting. This will have a great influence upon the marketing of pota - toes in Nebraska. We have not solved this problem yet, and it is one of the big problems we have before us. I thank you for your attention. (Applause). The President — The next speaker is Mr. Meredith, from Bushnell. who will discuss Marketing. (Applause). M \KKKTI\(i THK NEBRASKA SKKI) POTATO CROP FROM THK VIEWPOINT OF THE GROWER Mr. E. G. Meredith, Bnshnell, Nebraska Mr. Chairman. Ladies and Gentlemen: When I noticed my name on the program I was wondering why they gave this subject to a farmer. I wish I were able to let a speaker have the floor and occupy my time. This is a big subject — too big for me. I believe every grower who has given this thought realizes we should organize. I have talked to a good many on this subject since </seg>
            <seg id="p516">516 SKPOBT Or NKBIASKA STATE BOARD OF AGBK'I'I.TI'KK I have been here the past two days. It is rather amusing to talk to some of these men. I talked to some men yesterday who had an idea how we should organize and market our potatoes. Today I have talked to the same men and they had a different idea. That is the trouble with us growers. We do not know what we want to do in regard to the marketing of our potatoes. We must get together and figure it out. I know of no better time than the present to take this into consideration. We all realize that a good many of our potatoes are going into the south at prices ranging from $1.25 to $3.00. It is out of the question for a grower in the western part of this state, and also unfair to the raiser in the south. There is not that much difference in certified potatoes. I believe there is a difference in certified potatoes. There are some strains and some men entitled to more money than others. At the same time $1.75 is too much difference. We might say there could be fifty cents differnce in the price of certified potatoes. In the south, as as I understand it, each grower has a list sent out by the Department of Horticulture from our state which gives him an idea of what potatoes each man has and what per cent of disease. I am not sure it should be up. to the man in regard to the loading and sorting of his potatoes. It depends a good deal upon the reputation of the man. I believe we ought to get together at this lime and set a price upon our certified potatoes. I have heard men say there is nothing to the certification game. This comes largely from the men who have been turned down upon their fields this year. The man who has this roguing in charge well realizes the difference in price between uncertified and certified potatoes is not any too great for the extra labor he must perform. Under our present marketing conditions a few neighbors will get together and say, "Let's put a price of $2.50 on our potatoes." The trouble is in a week or so one of the growers gets to thinking, "I am needing some money. Let's make a lower price and see if we can't turn them." Maybe he has only told one or two neighbors. That is an injustice to the other men. That is the trouble we are up against today. For that reason I am strong for organization and having a set price. We want this on a sliding scale, for as Mr. Werner stated a few minutes ago, some men's potatoes are better than others. We might say from $2.50 to $3.00. I say there is not more than fifty cents' difference between certified potatoes after they have passed inspection. I hope before the meeting is over a bunch in each county can get together and try to organize. I would like to meet with more men in regard to an organization. We could talk this over and each man return to his own county and see what could be done. It would lead </seg>

The President — A lady was sick. She went to the doctor. He said. "If you had come to me in time it would have been an easy matter to help you. It is too late now. How many did you consult before you came to me? Did you consult anybody?" Yes, I have." Who was it?" She said, "I asked the druggist.' "You went to the druggist first? Don't you know it is dangerous to take the druggist's advice? Lots of times it even causes death. That is a great mistake." 'Well, I got a little frightened when he gave me his advice." What advice did he give you?" 'He told me to come and see you." (Laughter). Mr. Clarence Lesh, (Glen) — I think the most important part or the marketing of the Nebraska seed potato crop is to form some sort of an organization that can get these seed potatoes, whether certified or uncertified, and put them out on an equal basis and distribute them in an equal way in order to make u? (or the difference between the production and the demand. For instance, if we have a large yield we can cut down the number of bushels for sale and bring the price up enough so as to warrant me grower will get a fair profit for his potatoes, and he can keep some on his farm for feed. That would help the growers over the country out individually and collectively. The time has been pretty well taken up here on this question. I think it would be a good thing if the seed growers would have a meeting in the morning some time before the program, and see if they ran't start to form such an organization. I thank you. (Applause). Mr. James Phelps, (Belmont) — Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentle - men' There is little use of any man attempting to outline a marketing system in the limited time allotted for the subject on this program. I believe we would have more interest and excitement if we open this up to general debate. We have seen experiences all over the United States, and we don't want to start anything while we are in the attitude or the old cow in the spring when the grass begins to look green. She can't find much where she is, and it looks greener over the hill. Don't minimize the difficulties and exaggerate the possible profits. I believe in the possibility of doing good to ourselves by some knowledge of marketing. But I fear unless the group of men who enter it realize </seg>
            <seg id="p518">518 REPORT OF .NEBRASKA STATK HOARD Or AORICl'l.TI KK its enormous difficulties, they will fail, just as organizations have railed before. If it is started, as I hope it will be, don't expect immediate or great results. We must expect years, possibly, of toil and effort before any definite, successful method is reached. If it is true our cent-and - a-half potatoes turn into four-cent potatoes in the south, it is not to be suggested there is two and one-half cents profit. If there be any profit in the present system, instead of cussing the system, why not be a part of it? If it takes a retail store to get them properly priced, possibly we will find it profitable to open a retail store, if that is the way they want to buy. It might be a good plan for this group of men to meet outside of this meeting and talk it over, and possibly elect some man to go into it. I think that would be the best way to do it. The sentiment of these men is they want to go farther, talk it over among themselves, and arrange for a meet - ing outside of the time allotted on this program and start the ball rolling that way.

I will leave it to Professor Tiebout to give you the advice from the south. The President — We are in the same business and produce the same goods, yet sell them at different prices. We got in touch with a salesman in Kearney. They had the best sales business this year they ever had. They got an expert. We have expert farmers among us. I would like to see the one who can say. "I am an expert salesman." I have sold a good many potatoes but I am a long ways from being an expert. If you ask, "Do you want to sell them?" I say, "What will you give me?" They have two salesmen in Kearney hired by the year. They made us a proposition at a meeting of forty farmers who came to town. They got those forty farmers 100 per cent signed up. They said, "We want such and such a per cent. I know we can get those potatoes and how many we have to sell and how much demand we must look for."

The position I am in somewhat embarrasses me. But I will endeavor to give you a line on what we have done in the past and what we intend o do in future. In the last day or so I have had so much stuff handed from every side and pounded into my head, I am somewhat flustered. If I make any mistakes in making my few remarks, you will please overlook them from the fact I am somewhat bothered and trying to masticate this vast volume of information that has been passed to the last two days — and a great deal of it is good. The work is great I notice we have a newly elected President of the Potato Improve- ment Association. He gave us a little talk a minute ago, and to make it plain to you gentlemen, used a slight trace of oratory. I think he will make you a good President in future. The gentleman who just left here — Mr. Boomer — has given the Kearney Potato Growers' Association more trouble than any ten men I said. "»2.50." </seg>
            <seg id="p520">520 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATIC HOARD OF AGRICl'I.Tl RK in the state. You wonder why that was. When we undertook to form our organisation in Kearney, I want to say to you we found it is no easy matter to get up a set of by-laws and put a cooperative proposition across through that State University down there when they have anything to do with it. It must look right or you can't get a charter. We had our trouble with this chap who just talked to you. I want to pay him a compliment. Eight months ago there was a man traveling over the United States who stopped at Kearney. He was sent out by some commercial organization either from Oregon or Washington. He looked over the by-laws of our organization and our incorporation papers and paid us this compliment: "Gentlemen, I have made a trip over almost the entire United States. I have looked over a lot of different by-laws of most of these cooperative organizations over the country, and I say to you people you have the best I ever saw." So he took a copy of them home. Does that mean anything to you men? I want to go into this a little bit farther. Cooperative marketing is rapidly reaching a point where we will all get into the band wagon. I am not here to talk to you about Kearney with 140 members, or to ask a single one of you to join our organization. Disabuse your mind in regard to this. I do not want you if you do not want to come. We do not have to have you, because we went "over the top". We did not have a dime when we started. "How did it start?" They say "Necessity is the mother of inven - tion." That is the fact of the case. We were absolutely stuck last fall. We could not sell potatoes or give them away. We would move them to the market and they would come back, "Refused." In many cases we paid the freight. My brother paid freight of $165 on one car sold by Miller &amp; Company of Chicago. Those are the conditions we were up against. Don't think they haven't made an impression upon us. I took 10,000 bushels last year and gave them away. Those are the conditions we confront without a centralized proposition. When you talk about marketing you are talking the biggest proposi - tion we have today. We plug farmers are 98 per cent producers and 2 per cent sellers. We have the goods. Let's sell them. If we can not, we had better feed them to the hogs. There is a lot of stuff we try to sell we had better feed to the hogs. I have had potatoes sent in from the country that were a disgrace ro go out of anybody's market. They were wished on me. I did not want them. Those are conditions we must rectify. Seldom do I get a chance to talk to a bunch of men like this. I will give it to you so that you will understand what you are up against. There are many things that come into the marketing proposition the everyday man never thinks about. He never thinks about the poor devil who has to buy. He will stick some rotten potatoes in, and he expects the fellow at the other end to take them. They come back </seg>

Put good stuff in and you will Ket the pay. If you do not do it, you will never have a market that satisfies you. Those things I have been up against for the last year. I am between the devil and the deep blue sea. Don't think I am working this game from an altruistic standpoint. I have to work it. If all of you fellows do not get together and market your potatoes right, you will be in the same position. We will go a little farther about putting stuff in condition. I do not want to create the idea the Kearney Potato Growers' Association can create any markets or govern any markets. We are not big enough. If we were, we would sure do it. The day is close at hand when somebody is going to control the market. Get that in your mind. The whole mind of the people is now agitated. There is no business in this whole United States that is run in as haphazard a manner as the farmers run their business. They want to do this and that. Go to a farmer with a proposition. If I will do what you want, you will do it. If I won't, you won't do it. That is the situation. In putting over any great proposition— and it is a great proposition to organize these potato growers — it takes a long time. It is what we might call a reform. It is getting out of the old rut. We can not do it in a minute. We must walk and run first and then jump. We will make many blunders and it will take some time. We can not perfect it in an hour. We can make the start and we can figure out the fellow who has the best ideas and put them into execution, and finally we will have a proposition nobody can cut a hole in. You can not pick holes in a proposition after it is perfected. Let us get into the grading of stuff that goes out. There are too many who get careless. We want to get away with our stuff. We do not like to take that loss. We are losing heavy tonnage. We are not hurting the other fellow but hurting ourselves and our market. Especially on a mean market do we need good stuff. We need it this year. We do not need anything else. Put good stuff in the car and you can sell it at a price that perhaps you can get by with until another year. Maybe we will have a better market in future. God help us if we don't. I am a grower. I am not talking from any other view - point. I do not like to talk about this Kearney Association, but I am on that particular subject and I will stick to it a little bit. You want to know something about the workings of our organization. In the first place, we incorporated under the laws of the state. If you become a member it costs ten dollars. If you do not, it does not exactly mean we would not sell your stuff for you. Our charges are ten dollars on seed stock and twenty-five dollars a car on table stuff. That is what we charge you people out of the Association. I work for a good many fellows who do not belong. You should belong if we sell two or three </seg>

Our actual expense last year of the selling organization was $17.50 a car, which includes a manager at $7,000 a year. If we did not think he was worth the money we would not give it. He built up his own business, and if he does not earn his salary he does not get it. He has been successful so far in earning the salary for himself and several others. The banker said, "I want to join something that has been a success in the last twelve months. There are very few things that have." We are on the up grade. We are going over the top. We are going to start up. That is the only way we have to go. We can not get any lower. We will take up the cash buyer and the visiting buyer. One man says, "If we organize and give you all our stuff to sell, will you run these cash buyers out?" We will bring them in. If a cash buyer knows he can walk into your office or mine and buy what cars of potatoes he wants on the market, he would rather do that and buy ten cars and get on the train and go back to his family, than to visit for ten days and pay $1.00 here and there; and maybe never get either his potatoes or his $100. Those are actual conditions. . I met a man in Kimball trying to collect $300. Those are things buyers consider if they have some - body behind that deal. That applies to some individuals. It makes a man timid about laying down his cash and wondering whether it will be put up according to schedule. There is where we shine. If one of these buyers comes into this particular community and buys a car of potatoes of me, I will do my best to see he is getting it. I will deliver his potatoes and show him he has not lost his $100. I can do that much. That is what a lot of growers haven't done. You wonder why if a buyer comes to Kearney I grab him. That is my business. I am supposed to sell potatoes. He is pretty glad to grab me. When he buys anything of me he gets it. If he puts me up a deposit on future delivery, he will get the potatoes and won't lose his money because we have something behind us. We are solid as a rock. You can be the same way if you want to. I am not saying a thing I would not take on my own shoulders. You can figure it from that standpoint. The whole topic this afternoon has been certified seed. I want to say to you certified seed constitutes a small per cent of the potatoes, marketed in northwestern Nebraska. We have other things to con - sider. We have to consider marketing the whole business. If a sales - man has ten carloads of stuff and sells one car and the other nine rot, he is not a good salesman. That is the proposition, whether you sell all or one car. You must get this stuff at a place where some - body will buy. </seg>

I won't work at this business any more. In three months I will have all of mine. You see how impossible it is. If we could figure those things out we could tell what the future held. There is a commercial basis and a law of supply and demand that has a lot to do in governing the price under present marketing conditions. There is no concern in this United States has any control over the potato market or almost any other product the farmer raises. That is a fact, and you know it. I am not telling you anything you do not know. Everything I have said has been said a thousand times in front of you. You have tried to figure up what the price of stuff ought to be. There is only one way you can figure price. We have a market and you can not outsell the market only in isolated instances. When you try to make a market on certified seed, there is something else to be taken into consideration. There are two stages to that. We have the producer and the buyer. The price of any product will depend somewhat upon the supply If we have a short supply and a heavy demand, we will get a long price. If we have a large supply and a low demand, you know the result. Somebody must figure that thing out. Who is going to do it? Do you think Crockett &amp; Wiles, with a thousand wires out a month and a 'hundred circular letters, do not know more about conditions than the individual who never sends a wire? Imitate them in your county. It is reasonable they should know more about it. They have a better general idea of what they may expect in the next few months. They know more about the acreage that is going to be planted. You are handicapped if you have not similar information presented to you. You can not get it if you do not pay for it. Nobody will give it to you. We got this information by paying for it. We can not do business for you for nothing, and nobody else can. When it comes to making a price on certified seed, I am not prepared to do that. I do not know what the future holds for you. I know we will sell for as high as we can. The other fellow will buy as cheap as he can. Some of these days we must cut the balloon and let them go. We will move them one way or the other, and we are fighting for price. If we had this certified seed and table stock in our hands, we would tell them what they were going to be worth, and we would stay within reason, also. If we did not we would ruin our proposition. We would take a legitimate profit. Let me tell you a little story that happened in Kearney. We have a man in Kearney — Dr. A. D. Cameron. One day there drifted into Kearney a tourist — a man of considerable wealth. He got to talking with Dr. Cameron. He said to the doctor, "My business is the manu - facturing of rugs." The doctor said. "You manufacture rugs? Where?" </seg>
            <seg id="p524">524 BKNCT Or NKBBA8KA NTATK HOABD OT At.Wcl 1.1 I KK New York City." "I am well acquainted in the city of New York. I was born in New York state and know conditions there quite well. What priced rugs do you manufacture?" "All prices, from $20 to $2,000." "Do you make a $2,000 rug?" Ye*." "That is fine! I have been looking for something like that. I want five of those $2,000 rugs." He thought he was going to make a real sale. "Now, listen. I want to tell you something you don't know. When you get through making this sale to me and deliver the rugs, I will give you $500 apiece for them." "Man, that would ruin me!" "I don't give a d n. You don't care anything about us. This is what you are doing to us. You are setting a price on your rugs. You tell us what you will give us for our product, and tell ug what we will pay you for your product." Isn't it a good story? That is the way we are marketing our stuff today. We are just as wide apart today as ever in the world, only there is an undercurrent and a desire on the part of the people and an awakening to the fact we must get these marketing conditions where we can market at less expense. Hold your production as low as you can. You won't get any place by that. If you produce potatoes for two cents, somebody would sell them for one cent. If we had this stuff where we could control it, we could control a little of the supply now. We would feed it to them as they needed it. If they didn't need it we would feed the rest to the hog*. The main thing you are interested in is what thiB price will be on certified seed. I can not tell you. I wish to God I could. If I could tell you, I would say two and a half cents. I do not know whether we will be able to get it. That is another proposition al - together. I have tried to stay away from our little organization as much as possible. I am talking to you strictly as a man who knows something about marketing and has paid the bill of marketing individually. You can not do it. It is an impossibility. I thank you. (Applause).

Wilson, Ohadron Normal College, Chadron, Nebraska Ladies and Gentlemen of the Potato Improvement Association: Since I am to talk about the legislature. I will make my remarks rather brief. I am aware of the fact that we are a little bit late in beginning, and that there are some topics of deeper interest to you at this time than the one that has been assigned to me. Permit me to preface my remarks by saying that in the field of public affairs in this country, the American farmer as a rule has been sure-footed insofar as his thought has been concerned. It was not until after the close of the Civil War that our farming population began to take an especially deep interest in public affair* from the standpoint of their own interests. At the present time a number of proposals relative to laws that were advocated by them in the creat farm movement of the '70's have become a part of our National Constitution. The election of United States senators by the people, equal suffrage, and the income tax are illustrations of this. It may be noted also that at that time the statement of the principle' that in the matter of transportation, interstate commerce carriers should be subjected to the will of the people as expressed in our legislative enactments was advanced. That was enacted into law by the farmers of the west in some of their legislatures at that time, and was met with intense opposition; but in 1887 that principle was put into the laws of the country and has remained there since, and I am sure will continue to remain. I am told that a number of years ago in one of the European uni - versities — I think perhaps the University of Copenhagen — a profound study was made of basio legislation of the nineteenth century. The </seg>
            <seg id="p526">526 BKPOBT OF XKBBAHKA STATK HOARD OK AIIKUI in KK conclusion reached was that from the standpoint of absolutely basic legislation, this idea just mentioned, which originated in the minds of the western farmers of this country, was unsurpassed by any piece of legislation enacted by any legislative body in Europe or America. At the present time there are economic questions that are grave in their nature that must be met if agriculture is going to hold the place it ought to hold as an American industry. As we look back over the histories of nations, as a general rule, from the economic standpoint, the lot of the tiller of the soil has been an unfortunate one. When we speak of peasantry in history we think of European farmers. If we go back to the story of the nations of the ancient world, we find with practically no exception the lot of the tiller of the soil was most unfortunate from the standpoint of the advantages that should have been his. The development of America opened a new chapter, a new opportunity, insofar as the status of the tiller of the soil in society is concerned. It is a principle well recognized that every man must fight his own battle. In the present conditions, every group of persons of the same interests must fight their own battles. So I want to con - gratulate you here who are primarily interested in the culture of pota - toes, especially those used for seed purposes, on your organization, on the interest you take in it. and on the opportunity that is before you for rendering the highest sort of service to the potato growers of western Nebraska. Now with regard to Nebraska laws and how they are made. I would say first that Nebraska laws to a great extent are the result of public opinion. I am sure the average man who is a member of the legis - lature desires to be very responsive to public opinion. Since this is the case, there is a heavy obligation resting upon the people of the various sections to acquaint the members of the legislature with their desires and their ideas relative to legislation. Here in western Nebraska we are to some extent at a disadvantage with regard to this. As you know, Nebraska from an agricultural standpoint may be divided into three great divisions: first, the eastern part of the state; next, the sand hill area; and next, the high plains area west of the sand hills. In each one of these divisions agriculture has an individuality quite its own. We are farthest removed from the seat of government of any of these three divisions. To a great extent, self-interest controls in matters of legislation. So when it comes to legislation relative to matters of primary interest to the people of this part of the state, on account of our distance we find it more difficult to acquaint the legislature with public opinion. In the next place, on account of the fact the other portions of the state have by far the greater number of members of the legislature, we are under another handicap from the standpoint of acquainting the members of that body with what we consider to be our interests. </seg>
            <seg id="p527">KKPOKI OK NKHRA.SKA HTATE HOARD OF AI.RKTI.TI'RK 527 Speaking specially from the standpoint of legislation relative to i he potato industry, I am very sure those matters that may be helped as the result of legislation should receive very earnest and serious consideration in every one of the meetings you hold, and also in whatever contact you may have with each other when not in formal session. I am aware of the fact that at the present time there is a marked tt-ndency on the part of the public at large to assume that almost any sort of grievance anyone may have can be remedied by legislation. I think we greatly exaggerate the ability of our law-making bodies to reach all the troubles that may be experienced in the prosecution of any industry. Nevertheless, as the result of conditions that exist at the present time, there are some things that easily fall within the Held of legislative enactment. Those matters should receive a very considerable degree of consideration by those foremost in the indus - tries directly involved. I am sure that as a rule* the arguments of i hose whose interests are at stake will receive careful consideration *&gt;v members of the Nebraska legislature. In the next place, Nebraska laws to a large extent are the result of the judgment — the wisdom, if you please — of the men who are members of the legislature. Every man who is a member of that body ought to exercise to a very considerable extent his best judgment with regard to the measures that come before him. A man who is not willing to have ideas of his own and firm convictions of his own as a result of debate in that body and of committee hearings and of what - ever investigations he may make, is not the type of man you should want to represent you. Understand that with this reasonable measure of thought and action, it is obligatory upon every member of the assem - bly to desire to keep in the most intimate touch with the thought of the people to whom he is directly responsible. There are some phases of the work of the legislature that are susceptible to considerable improvement. But when we come to con - sider these, I think we must understand there is Involved what might be called an element of human imperfection. The first of these points I may mention is this: In my judgment, the legislature of Nebraska as a rule takes action that is too hasty on the more important measures that come before it. If we go back in the history of our state for thirty-five or forty years, I suppose we shall find that the number of vital measures that were before the legislative sessions was consid - erably less than is the case now when the population is very much greater, and when there is a much more complex economic and social organization that needs to be taken into consideration by those who are our law-makers. It would be my idea that we would get better results if our legislative sessions were lengthened, rather than short - ened. In Massachusetts, the legislature is in session practically all of the year. </seg>
            <seg id="p528">528 BEPOBT Or NEWASKA STATE BOABO OF AORintTlRK I am aware of the fact that we can hardly expect any definite or decisive action with regard to a matter of this sort in the immediate future, at least. In the thought of the country at the present time there is more or less of distrust relative to legislative bodies. I regret this because of the fact that the legislative department of a govern - ment such as ours is that department that gives to our system of gov - ernment its peculiar distinction; and if legislative bodies are inefficient in their work or if the people should lose confidence in them, we have a situation that is fraught with possibilities that we do not like to con - template. As evidence of the necessity for a larger measure of consideration for measures before the legislature, I may point to the fact that as we look back over the history of our legislative sessions we find that there is a steady tendency toward longer sessions. In the next place, from the standpoint of the efficiency of the legis - lature and all that is involved in that, I think I should lay considerable emphasis on the necessity for the election to that body of the most desirable persons in the various districts of the state. I know this is a trite subject. We have always heard talk along this line. Never - theless, the common place is as a rule the most important, after all; and the strength, efficiency and virility of our legislative bodies in time to come will depend primarily upon the degree of care exercised by the voters of the various districts in selecting the men and women who shall represent them. It is my conviction that the average man in the legislature is sincere in his attitude. I do not sympathize with the view that is contrary to that. I am convinced, however, that the need for election to that body of men who are conscientious in their attitude on public - questions, and who are men of reasonably broad attainments as far as their contact with the public is concerned, is one of the most vital problems involved insofar as legislative efficiency is concerned. There is one illustration I think I may give, speaking still in a somewhat general way, that has to do with the functions of our legislative body and also, I think, with the way it does its work. In the present era every legislature is compelled to make very large ex - propriations. That is unavoidable. We have our various state ins&gt;&gt; tutions. I speak especially of those that exist for the care of the un - fortunate classes of society. As a matter of humanity, we feel as though we can not permit these unfortunate members of society to fail to receive the care that is owing to them. The number of these unfortunate members is increasing, rather than decreasing. We are bound to have in years to come a steadily increasing need with regard to the expenditure of money for these classes of society. Let me say a word with regard to our educational institutions. The American people have always been distinguished for their interest in education. In recent years there has been an enormous increase </seg>
            <seg id="p529">RKPOBT OF NEBMA8KA RTATE BOAEI) OF AOBICI'I.Tl'RE 529 in the number of boys and girls who finish the eighth grade, the high schools, and the institutions above the high schools. These institu - tions are going to need steadily increasing appropriations if they shall continue to exist and take care of the young people who are flocking to them. On account of these conditions, one of the most important duties that devolves upon any legislature is a matter of making appro - priations for the various needs of the state. When it comes to this, there is, it seems to me, a great need for the highest &lt;%jgree of in - tlligence and interest on the part both of the people at large and on the part of those who are members of that body. With regard to these matters, we need to follow a pretty broad policy, because a narrow policy in the end will be tenfold more expen - sive than the policy we ought to follow. In the consideration of measures of this sort, it is sometimes the case that statements may be made to the public that are very misleading as far as their nature is concerned. I could give illustrations of this which I think I should not perhaps take time to give in this talk. I do know our institutions at the present time — some of them — are suffering more or less so far as their maintenance is concerned, because of misapprehensions along the lines I have just mentioned. I would summarize what I have attempted to say as follows: In the first place, the American farmer, speaking from the standpoint of his history, as a rule has been a correct thinker when it comes to the field of legislation. He has made mistakes. But I am sure no class of people in this country has been more nearly fundamentally correct than have the men and women who live on the farms of this country. In the next place, we have at the present time a critical condition with regard to agriculture. I doubt if we have ever had a more critical condition than exists at the present. Hence the necessity for clear thinking on the part of those who live in the country was never more necessary than at present. When it comes to the matter of efficiency so far as legislative action is concerned, to a greater extent, perhaps, than ever before do our legislative bodies desire to respond to public opinion. It is much easier at the present time to bring public opinion to bear on legislative bodies than was the case years ago when the means of transmitting intelli - gence was less efficient than is the case at the present time. There is constant need for a profound measure of interest in the selection of those who shall represent the people in their legislative assemblies. There is need — as it seems to me, a very great need — for a larger measure of care and deliberation and investigation when it comes to the matter of passing upon important questions that come before our legislature. In connection with this, I hope the time will come when the length of our legislative sessions will be extended. We have had </seg>
            <seg id="p530">530 REPORT Or NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AGRIOri.TVRE — speaking especially from the standpoint of western Nebraska — a constant handicap that should always be taken into consideration when we have under advisement the legislative enactments relative to the interests peculiar to our part of the state. In the last place, I would give emphasis again to the necessity for the selection of men and women of independent thought who are intimately connected from the standpoint of their interests with the vital conditions or forces in the lives of the people that are supposed to receive consideration from legislative bodies. (Applause). The President — The next is a gentleman we are fortunate to have here with us — Mr. Minick, of Crawford, who is Vice-President of the First National Bank of Crawford, and President of the State Bankers Association. I take pleasure in introducing to you Mr. Minick. (Ap - plause). "FINANCIAL AND OTHER POTATO BOGS" Mr. C. A. Minick, President State Bankers Association, Crawford, Nebraska Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: Perhaps that large title read by our President is the largest part of this number. Since I received this great honor — for me — and since hearing from Mr. Werner that he wanted me on this program, and having all the details of trying to keep afloat a national bank, or any other bank, in these depressed times, makes the time seem short since that election occurred and this invitation was received. In fact, I feel a little like a parrot. It is said a lady living close to a church had a very profane parrot. Each Sunday as the services were about to take place, she slipped a black hood over the parrot's cage in order not to disturb the services. Immediately after the services the hood was removed. On Monday morning the pastor called on this lady. She noticed him coming, and before opening the door, slipped the black hood over the cage. After he had made his short and formal call, she again removed the hood, and was much surprised to hear the parrot say, "This has been a h — 11 of a short week." (Laughter). I came from Hay Springs with two Methodist preachers. Our Meth - odist preacher from Crawford also is in this audience. If I do not get by with this speech, I will either withdraw my membership from the Methodist church or quit trying to speak. I did not ask an interest in either of these gentlemen's prayers, but being a member in good standing in the church, I presume I have their support. </seg>
            <seg id="p531">531 seroBT or .nkbbahka state boabd of agbici mi kk As I looked around over the beautiful display upstairs and thought of the times I have eaten the luscious potato of Nebraska, and finding the beautiful blue and red ribbons laid on such small potatoes, I have come to the conclusion you fellows are rather "small potatoes." One thought I have in mind regarding the potato business is this: I may be mistaken, but I hope we can convince Professor Tiebout we are right in thinking our country peculiarly adapted for the production of a high quality of potatoes. I think it is up to the men of northwest Nebraska to capitalize on that. Let us see to it we make this the country where are grown "potatoes of quality," so that Professor Tiebout, until he is grey-headed, shall be coming up here to see how we are getting along on this industry, instead of going to Maine, Washington, Minnesota, or any other lesser growing potato state — not lesser in quantity. There are a lot of things we do not know up here, and perhaps never will know. One is how far we can go in production of seed potatoes without making an over-supply. The seed potato business has a fine outlook and will give fine returns if attention and intelli - gence are given to that particular thing; but when they offer twenty - two cents for No. 1 table potatoes and let us furnish the sack, I think we might just as well give them to the hogs. At the present time and for two or three years our table stock potatoes have had a poor reception from the buyers, and perhaps from the consumers, in price. It seems our table stock has not the reputa - tion some of us eating these northwest Nebraska potatoes think they are entitled to. We may have been trying to "put something over" on the people of the east — anything to get the stuff off. The thought occurred to me if we are raising and can raise potatoes of quality equal to any other state, so far as the table value is con - cerned, we should be trying to find out why we are not getting the market. Perhaps the Extension Service of the State University could help us solve this problem. Our own effort is a little far removed from the consuming interest, but we can stand four cents differential against us because of the cheaper land, if we can get the market. So I think the potato growers of this country, in addition to seed potatoes, should at least experiment on what they can do with the table variety. If they are making fine progress in producing seed that is well received and highly valued in the south, it would add to their stock of ex - perience and observation if they should try a few acres of some stand - ard variety of table stock which the consuming public wants, and see what they can do with it. There may come a time when you will have to cut your acreage of seed potatoes and increase the acreage of table stock in order to have a good outlet for your product. Another thing from the standpoint of our University is this: The great prosperity of western Nebraska does not depend on having some </seg>
            <seg id="p532">532 REPORT OF .NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OT AGRICll.Tl RE one man raise two thousand acres, Kfit its prosperity will be greater, to my mind, and I am more interested in having five hundred men in our territory around Crawford raise ten acres of certified seed, than having fifty men raise one hundred acres, because it is scattering the labor, the profits, and helping diversification of our crops. In the potato business or any other business, as nearly as I have been able to observe by Inquiry, reading, and everything else, it is not a business I would recommend anybody, outside of a very few Individuals, to go into exclusively. With but few exceptions is the one-crop industry profitable and reliable to the farmer. They are rich one year, and poor three. The thing to do is to work the potato business in with other things in western Nebraska. Diversification of crops is nothing new, but it is the thing that is going to make northwest Nebraska a paradise for the farmer. I feel there is no place I have ever been — and my life has been spent in the middle west largely — where it is more pleasant and profitable to farm, when the price of land is taken into considera - tion and our climate, our bright days, than is western Nebraska. I feel that the farmers coming to our country enjoy farming up here. One fellow from Wayne bought two thousand acres. I said, "How do you like farming up here compared with down east?" "It seems pretty good to get some place where you do not have to wear rubber boots six months in the year." We sometimes think we are the only place where the wind blows, but people coming from south of Lincoln said, "You folks don't know what wind storms are here." There are better countries, acre for acre and section for section and mile for mile; but we have a lot of miles and need a lot of people. We do not need many people to own several sections and farm forty acres. We need more small farmers. More fellows are going broke on larger places than on ISO acres. It used to be considered up here a man could not make a living on 160 acres. We need hogs and alfalfa, potatoes and corn. Another thing we need to make this a place where you like to live and people from the east would like to live, is better roads. There is a wonder, with some of our roads in the condition they are, that people would stay. I suppose they could not get out. I heard of one man owning 5,000 acres. He has 300 cattle. We were talking about asking the county commissioners to build a road to the state line. He said, "To h — 11 with your roads! We had better roads when we first started here, and did not have a tax, either." That is true, but if he does not adjust himself to the new con - ditions he will go broke. Every farmer wants good roads, and we should be willing to pay a little more tax, or vote for somebody who </seg>
            <seg id="p533">BCPOBT Or NKBBAMKA STATE BOARD Or AORIl'l I.TIRK 533 is willing to put a gasoline tax and get good roads in that way. Let the man who burns the oil pay a little toward the upkeep of the roads. I heard a man named Cox — a banker from North Carolina — say: "We are spending $40,000,000 for roads and will spent $20,000,000 before the year rolls around. We are selling bonds." "How will you pay for them?" "We have a tax of three cents a gallon on gasoline. We figure it will pay the interest on the bonds, the upkeep on the roads, and retire the bonds in forty years. It is not costing the farmer more than the town man." Mr. Werner said, "Maybe you will want to say something about finances." I said, "I do not know very much about that. I do know what subject to choose. I might as well say, 'Financial and Other Bugs,' and he put in 'Potato Bugs.' " As to financing the potato grower, we have financed some potato buyers and charged off some pretty fair sized notes some years ago with no prospect of getting anything back. I had a conversation the other day with a young man who in - herited quite a little property. He showed me a telegram from Louis - iana: "Quote us price on 35 cars of seed potatoes." He wanted me to help him out, but I was a little afraid. Professor Werner touched considerably on a thought a lot of people have that a government or some other agency should make the price right to protect the farmer. I am sure if you gentlemen study the proposition very long, you will know neither our government nor any other can keep up a false price ve long. A lot of people think because the government for a few months or a year during the war kept wheat at a certain price, they might be able to do that always. I believe the government — as great as it Is — can not do that any more than anyone else can do it. If we produce eight mil - lion bushels of wheat in a year and consume five million bushels and ex - port a million bushels and do that constantly for four yean, we will have eight million bushels surplus wheat; and neither the government nor anybody else can sell that wheat. Argentine and Europe and Can - ada would be saying, "We will sell for eighty-five cents and supply the market." Even though we had a tariff to protect us against ourselves, we could not sell on a falling market. The only thing I can see in the way of helping the farmer a* to price is this: If it does not pay, let us cut down more than we do. We must produce the things the consumer wants in the way he wants, at the time he wants, and in the quality he wants; and if the con - sumer does not want our wheat at a price we can afford to raise it at, </seg>
            <seg id="p534">534 REPOBT OF XEBBAHKA 8TATE HOARD OF AlikU'l I. Tl RK let us put in corn or alfalfa or something else. We can not get a high price when producing more stuff than can be consumed by the people who want our product. The same is true in the potato busi - ness. If you do not produce the kind of seed potatoes the people from other states want, they won't come here. They will go some place else. The same is true of the table stock. If the quality is good they will take them from other states. The potato is a hazardous crop and we must get it marketed. As far as financing the farmer is concerned, even in normal con - ditions, I do not think the bankers would want to finance the potato crop very largely in western Nebraska, because it is a hazardous propo - sition at any time. You have only a few months in which to get rid of them. Those left over to next year are not very valuable. I understand the Central Nebraska Potato Growers' Association at Kearney is a great success. Mr. Foster said they had the best by-laws of any association in the world. If they can do that In Kearney, we do not want to compete with them, but it might be necessary out here in western Nebraska. If you have to have much assistance from many of the banks that want to keep open, you are going to have to change your marketing system a little. There will have to be an organization here and one in Louisiana for the protection of both ends. Somebody in Louisiana writes up and says, "We want a carload or two of potatoes. How much do we have to pay down?" Our grower says, "We should have $200. We would rather have it all." I would rather have them have it all if I had to loan the money. Once in a while there may be an unscrupulous purchaser in the south. He says, "The potatoes are not up to standard and I won't accept them." He refuses the car of potatoes. If you get anything after that you are doing well. The President of the Association who was elected yesterday lost two cars. I liked the purchaser; thought he was the finest man I ever met. He was a southern gentleman. The inspector said that was the best carload of potatoes Jim Phelps shipped out last year. He sent two cars. They were in turn turned over to a commission broker in Little Rock. He said, "We won't have them. They are sprouted." Every farmer who talked to me said it was the finest car that went out of Belmont. They sent back and said. "We want the money back we paid down on the potatoes." It was simply a steal. We do not want any of those growers in the south to pay for any of the mistakes of you fellows. If you have allowed frost to creep in, even though it gets by the inspectors, there is no moral reason why that grower in the south should lose one dollar because those potatoes were under quality when they left. Truth is truth. The only thing </seg>
            <seg id="p535">HI I'l &gt;H I OF NKHRASK \ STATE BOARD OF AGRICll.TI'BE 535 you have a right to put in is potatoes of quality. Because you can put it over is no reason why the southern grower must pay a high price and high freight on inferior stock. I would like to think it were possible under Professor Tiebout and the Louisiana State University to perfect an organization that could say: "Grade your potatoes up. See they are sorted properly. Don't pay freight on potatoes that will be of no service to us." If there is anything the matter with those potatoes when they get there, or any claim that they are not what they bought, there should be some organization under the University to say, "We will have a representative investigate the potatoes and give you a square deal." If they throw out 20 per cent, you have confidence the honor of that organization is back of the transaction and you are getting a square deal at that end of the line, and the grower is only asking what is just and right. On the other hand, the man down there wants the same deal. He must know he will not lose the money advanced; that there is an association that will throw out any man off color, or who tries to put something over on you. I hope some man in western Nebraska strong enough to bring about an organization with strict rules and regulations may be found; and if some fellow tries to put stuff across as being A No. 1 and it isn't, the Association will blacklist him. We are proud of Nebraska. She is a great agricultural state. Let us make the quality of our Nebraska products as good or better than any other state in the Union. We have no oil or coal. We have a little gas, but only in the people. I hope to live and die in Nebraska. I don't want to die very soon. I am interested in western Nebraska, and more especially in northwestern Nebraska. I would like to see western Nebraska use the State University and all the intelligence they have to make it a real garden spot; because it is not considered quite the equal of Illinois and Iowa and some parts of Missouri. I take it you are the most intelligent and progressive potato grow - ers or you would not be here . I want to say as a by-product of our study with these State University men, let us have honorable dealings with our fellow men. I thank you. (Applause). The President: If Mr. Minick likes the dollars as well as he likes potatoes, he surely loves them, because I had the pleasure of sitting with him at the table last night. I have not heard much in this convention about railroads. When we are at home we talk about them lots. We look at the railroads like they were monsters. If we do not get out of the way, we will get run over. But when we come right down to talk of the railroads, we do not talk of the Individual, but of the railroads as a whole. </seg>

McOinnis, Traffic Department, Northwestern Lines, Lincoln Mr. President and Officers of the Potato Improvement Association; Lad i As and Gentlemen: The President is very kind in his introduction to mention McGinn is was Irish. I have never denied that. I have never been taken for an Italian. Being of that nationality, I do not feel out of place trying to talk to people at an Irish Potato Conven - tion. Shouldn't there be some harmony in that? You have had two days of this meeting and have some more good addresses on your program. Probably you would not appreciate what little I might have to say, so I will cut it short. As our friend, George Snow, the great Chadron Journalist would remark, "I will now give you a few little gems of thought." I will admit at the outstart I do not know very much about pota - toes, only what I have absorbed in mingling with potato experts like the two gentlemen sitting at the head of this table. A few years ago it was my good fortune to come to Crawford to meet Mr. Pedrett and Professor Werner and my good little friend, Jimmie Lawrence, who has gone out. Guess he did not want to hear me talk. They had a Potato Exhibit Car to go from Crawford down over the Northwestern through the potato district, and talk potatoes, their diseases, etc. We came into Chadron and put on a show. We went to Hay Springs and put on a show, and then down to Rushville, through to Long Pine. The farther we went, the larger the crowds and the most interested they seemed to be, consequently after putting in almost a week hearing these experts make their talks, and see - ing their demonstrations, I became sufficiently familiar with most of the more important varieties of the Potato Family that if I met one of them on the street, would recognize it at once. This name "McGinnls" is not unknown or unheard of, although I am not tracing my genealogy back too far. I know my great-grand - father came from Ireland. Why he left I do not know, and do not want to know. Maybe he had to leave. I used to live in Maryland and worked for the Western Maryland Railroad — a great road! — connected with Baltimore at one end and </seg>
            <seg id="p537">BEFOftT OF XEMASKA STATE BO A ED OF AOBICULTUBE 537 the Baltimore and Potomac Canal at the other. I took my family back there this summer and showed them where my father was born and went to school, and where I was born and went to school, and the first station at which I worked. We took a little trip on the Western Mary - land Railroad down to Washington. I noticed some of the stations had their names changed. Double Pipe Creek was changed to Detour; Mechanicstown was changed to Thurmont; and Brucevllle was changed to Keymar. As we went on down the line, the brakeman opened the door and called "McGinnis." I thought, "Has somebody sent me a telegram?" but discovered it was the name of a station. I said to the brakeman, "Come here. Have they named a station after me since I left? What was formerly the name of that station?" He answered, saying, "That ain't no station. It used to be a dis - tillery, but it ain't running now." (Laughter). In the traffic department of a railroad company, the duties are many and various, and at times arduous. We might be termed sort of a missionary out among the people — going out endeavoring to con - vince the people of the true situation regarding the railroads. Under - stand, ladies and gentlemen, that I can produce proofs of any statement I make here today. I am not running for any political office — never did and never expect to — not even cemetery trustee. I admit I am around the legislature some when they meet, but that is duty and not choice — merely protecting the railroad's interests the same as the banker's and farmer's and others, if you please. Although if you read the newspapers, they will tell you the railroads maintain a great big lobby there to influence the legislators. I want to say to you people up here at Chadron, at the last legislature that convened from January 4 to May 4, the only railroad representative during that time except some attorneys before the committees, was Yours Truly — 210 pounds. If this is the "big lobby," look me over care-fully and see if I do not look pretty harmless. The more I thought about coming up to Chadron and talking to you the harder I thought of the proper thing to say, the more I was convinced I was getting a little out of my class. I was going to wire Professor Werner: "Unavoidably detained. Impossible to be with you." But feeling I had a number of friends and acquaintances up here and they might apologize for any blunders I made and take into consideration I was sincere and doing my best, I decided to make the effort, something like the fellow at Tombstone, Arizona. He was a pretty good fellow around town and it came his turn to die. Around the saloon they raised a purse and buried him up on the side of the hill. After the funeral they concluded they ought to put something to mark his grave; so they held a meeting in the saloon and came to the conclusion they would put an epitaph on the </seg>

They did not know where he came from, but they thought they should put something else on, so finally they added: "He did his Damndest." That is what I will try to do here today. The subject I have selected is, "The Relation between the Farmers and the Railroads." I think that is quite a large subject to handle. It takes considerable study. When I was a little fellow about nine years old. I had what I thought the severest case of toothache a boy could have. I went out barefoot too early in the spring and T had an awful time. I com - plained to my mother and she said, "Robert, don't worry about that. I will give you something to cure that. Whenever you think you have any trouble, you go and hunt up somebody else who has more trouble and sympathize with him, and your trouble will be over." That has been a good motto to carry through life. Next day my seatmate went home and had the awfulest case of mumps you ever saw a boy have, and I sympathized with him. (Laughter). Now then, here we go, and I am sure that when I get through talking I will have succeeded in convincing a few of you farmers at least that the railroads have many troubles, as well as yourselves, and furthermore we could not get along very well without each other, con - sequently we better arrange to keep on speaking terms, work together for our mutual benefit and at any time your burdens get heavy and your troubles great, just pause a moment and compare them with what some of the railroad officials have to combat today, and soon you will forget yours and be sympathizing with them. Railroad building constitutes one of the most important epochs in the history of our country, and it gives all a thrill of patriotic fervor to recall the courage and masterful wills of the men who projected, financed, and constructed the lines that today span the continent, and bind the different parts of our widespread territory into one great unified nation. The history of railroad building is most interesting and shows rapid development of this country — the roads taking the chances going first — blazing the trail, pioneering into new country so the people can seek new homes as the population along the eastern shores of this country increased. The Baltimore and Ohio, the pioneer of all railroads in this country, had constructed thirteen miles by 1S30. In that same year twenty - three miles constituted the entire length of all the railroads in this country. By 1840 it had grown to approximately 3,000 miles, and by 1860, just before the Civil War, it had reached a total of over 30,000 miles, and about this time the Chicago &amp; Northwestern Rail- </seg>

Gradually as the finances could be secured they built west, in short stretches to Fremont, Wisner, O'Neill, and finally Valentine in 1884. About this time I left Maryland and came to Nebraska. Being a young fellow who had railroaded in the east, and coming out here, I expected to find dollar bills growing on the trees. Some fellow had. been there before, however, and picked them off, so I secured work at Fremont, trucking freight for the Fremont, Elkhorn, and Missouri Valley road. Valentine was the end of the line. If somebody did not die at Valentine every twenty-four hours with boots on, business was dull. We graded and built on west, lap by lap, and each time we got the name of iome new station, we were all thrills. Finally we had another division point west of Long Pine they called Chadron, and I understood the town was started some years before when Col. Coffee camped on the "Lone Prairie" with his stage coach and passengers over one night, saying, "Boys, we will camp here tonight, and start a town, and call it Chadron." That settled it, and the town was started and Col. Coffee is still camped here, and a mighty comfortable camp, too. Surveys were made to the Black Hills on the north, and to Wyoming on the west, and Chadron was destined in those days to become a great rail - road division point. Conditions are different today. Who is responsible for the change? The strong men and women who pioneered and braved the storms, and went through the hardship and privation in settling up a new country, made it possible for the present generation to live here and enjoy this prosperity. Those were the days the farmers and the rail - roads were working closely together. I remember one incident at Fre - mont. A fellow wanted to ship a threshing machine to Hay Springs. We had no flat cars long enough. Ho took it apart and loaded it in a furniture car. He had a great job. What good would the railroads be with no freight or passengers to haul? How can the farmer prosper without a road to haul his products to market? The Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley, now a part of the Chicago &amp; Northwestern Company, took the first chance and secured the funds — which I do not think they could do now — to build a road through what was then called the sand hills and grazing country. Would you permit anyone to come out here and call it that today, with the good people living here in nice, comfortable homes, prosperous and happy? These were the people who took a chance the same as the railroads. I got up early this morning. We passed crib after crib of corn. That is something new in this country. It was reported you had so much corn raised in the fields this year you did not have a supply of corn huskers to pick it, and some did not know how to get it off the stalk, having in the past shipped in shelled corn from the east. I do not believe that. </seg>
            <seg id="p540">540 REPORT Or NEBEA8KA STATE BOAKD OF AGE1CII TIRK Neither the farmers nor the railroads always have conditions to their liking. We run our trains out on schedules and furnish accom - modations whether we have a full load or not. We must go. The farmer works early and late putting in his crops and not knowing what the rain and sunshine will bring. Even though he succeeds in getting a crop, he does not always get a good demand and a satis - factory price. We have people telling us every day how we should run the railroads, and the farmer has people telling him how he should run his farm. The majority of people who make a practice of finding fault with the other fellow's business are doing it so that their own will not be investigated, and they are generally living off the farmer. When the farmer markets his crops, it is not all profit. He has many and various expenses. No matter what he gets for his product his taxes keep mounting year by year. It is the same with the rail - roads. For instance, for the year 1913, the Northwestern Railroad Company paid on their lines in Nebraska $472,169; coming to the year 1919, taxes levied on this same property were $677,957; in 1920, $724,585; 1922, $721,110; 1923, $715,609. Remember that is just on our real estate and rolling stock and depots and other property. In addition to that we have special assessments. In the towns where they want to make improvements we go with them, — Sewerage, paving, drainage, etc. We also pay our tribute to building good roads, which enable the people who formerly could not reach the railroads to haul forty miles or more, increasing our tonnage; although there are other cases in the more congested districts where the trucks and autos certainly take business away from us. It also costs money to operate a railroad. Every month I get a statement of what we buy. In the month of September, 1923, we paid $9,590 for electrical supplies, $13,700 for lanterns and signal ap - pliances, $204,095 for car wheels. Our dining cars also cost money. For tea and coffee we paid $1,773. To the Railroad Steel Spring Company for springs for cars — no doubt sometimes you think our cars do not have springs under them, but they do — we paid $20,376. For brake shoes to the American Brake Shoe Company the bill was $21,849. For lining grain cars so they won't leak out the grain — patent paper lining on the inside, we paid $3,740. There are numerous bills for ice. On lumber, such as ties and everything of that nature, we spent $497,609. We also have to have fuel. We use oil and coal for our engines, and cars, and also our depots. The total amount spent in the month of September for coal and oil was $1,259,441. Of that amount, we paid the Midwest people of Casper $146,778, and the Hudson Coal Company, $17,751. That was putting money close to your home. </seg>
            <seg id="p541">REPOBT OF NEBBASKA STATE BOABO Or AGRICULTUBE 541 I wired the superintendent yesterday asking how much money he was spending right here at Chadron This morning I got this state - ment: In September, 1913, there was paid out at Chadron, to all employees at this point, $44,800. In September, 1914, there was paid $43,513. Then came increased wages and all conditions over which we had no control. In September of this year we paid-. $105,488 So you see we are spending money as well as earning money, and the question is whether we can earn as much as we spend. I know you will wonder why I do not say something about freight rates. I am going to later on. I will say in the past ten years — I have the figures to substantiate this — the price of coal we buy for the use of the railroads has increased 156 per cent. The price of ties has increased 180 per cent. The price of cars has increased 146 per cent. Wages have increased 130 per cent, and taxes 154 per cent; while the freight rates have increased only 60 per cent, and our passenger rates 51 per cent. While we are paying taxes, we also realize the farmer pays his taxes, and it all is not spent right here at home. It in part goes to the state for maintenance of our state institutions, and especially our state normals and great university and agricultural college, which, through the efforts of the regents and faculty and liberality of the tax payers we have now got a college for our farmer boys and girls that they are entitled to in this great agricultural state of ours, and also some of his taxes go to support men in different parts of the state, representing the various state departments, checking up county treasurers, surveying our soils to determine by test what parts of the state are best adapted for different crops, school representatives visiting our schools and keeping our education up abreast with the times, game and fish department stocking up our clear water streams and lakes with all kinds of fish, physicians fighting various kinds of con - tagious disease, etc., and last, but not least, we have armed men traversing the state purging this land of ours of cocktails, white mule, and elephant breath.

The railroads have the rates for earning money fixed by the Interstate Commerce Commission at Washington, and what they pay for labor is fixed by the Labor Board of Chicago; and neither body making rates or wages functions with each other. Since we evidently prefer to live in or near a city, and Nature produces the raw materials far from the point of consumption; and we insist on having what we want when we want it, someone must collect, store, ship, and deliver to us at the place and time that suits us, we must pay the cost. Coming to the rates, I have prepared a little data I want to read, being present rates in effect on potatoes, carloads, from the various potato shipping stations to Omaha, Lincoln, Fremont, Hastings, Super - ior, and intermediate points. </seg>

            <seg id="p544">544 REPORT W NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I presume you potato shippers are about as familiar with the rates in this territory as I am. A good many years ago, when it was first discovered they could raise potatoes here, the farmers were selling the larger and better quality and planting the small ones. Our general man - ager got a man from Wisconsin University — our people at Lincoln had not developed the potato industry to that extent — to come out and put in a summer along our lines, and got them to planting a better variety. They were all mixed up — different kinds in the same field. Since that time the fanners became interested to such an extent that today we look upon the potato business from this territory as one of our principal incomes from freight earnings, and the potato farmers have developed and improved the quality to such an extent they command good prices in any market offered. Our rate at that time was 35 cents per hundred, beginning at Harrison and going to Long Pine. Since that time rates have been reduced. At the present time we have a rate of 32 Vfc cents per hun - dred from Harrison. That applies to Omaha, Lincoln, Fremont, Hast - ings and Superior, and any of our lines in the South Platte country and intermediate points. When shipments go over this line, they get the benefit of this rate. We start in at Crawford where one railroad crosses the other, and go clear to Clinton — 65 miles — making a rate of 26 cents a hundred for those points. That means 15H cents a bushel. Then we start at Gordon and go to Bassett — a distance of 154 miles — and make a 24-cent rate, or 1 4 Vi cents a bushel. That is a pretty wide spread, so that whether a man lives at Crawford or Chad - ron or Hay Springs or Rushville, he gets the same rate when he ships out his potatoes. Going from Gordon down there, all that distance, he gets the same rate to Bassett. Before I left Lincoln yesterday I made inquiry of a wholesaler who handles potatoes. I inquired what they were paying for potatoes up on our line in the potato district. They said thirty to thirty-five cents a bushel. That was for the best grade sacked and loaded on the cars. Take 30 cents plus 15 H cents, and it means potatoes delivered at any of those points for 45 H cents a bushel. I asked five different grocers the same day what they were retailing potatoes for, and they said 95 cents to $1.00. I will ask you people in all fairness, do you think the railroad is getting as much or more out of the hauling of these potatoes than it is entitled to? It is 412 miles to Fremont; 40 miles from there to Omaha; and 50 miles from Fremont to Lincoln. I mention potatoes because this is a potato meeting. It is no more all profit to us than to the farmer. You will read in the public press where a man raised so many thousand bushels of potatoes and got so much money for them. You do not, in the same article, see what it cost him to do that — to sack or load on cars, or what he had to grade out. It is the same with the railroads. For loading our refrig- </seg>
            <seg id="p545">BEPOBT OF NEBRASKA 8TATE BOABD OF AGBICULTUBE 545 erator cars it costs more money than for a common box car. They must be hauled from Omaha to this country empty. There is no profit in that. We must use power and pay our train employees. It averages three days to get one of those cars loaded and forwarded after it is ready for market. A number of the cars — I forget what per cent — are not shipped from the farmer to the man who handles pota - toes; but bought by buyers here and billed to some junction point. In the meantime the owner of this car sells it to somebody. That means a delay. He may divert it three or four times. The man who holds the bill of lading may sell it around. We are not saying the man who handles the potatoes is doing wrong, because our tariff provides for that. We do that in order that you may get a better market for your potatoes. If we could bring a refrigerator car up here as we can a stock car, it would be better, for the reason a stock car is generally loaded the day it arrives at fhe station, makes a quick run to the market where it is unloaded and ready for a return trip in two hours, consequently a stock car hauls on an average of three loads of stock to market while a refrigerator car makes one trip with potatoes, and you understand the only way our cars can earn us freight money is to keep them moving. We must keep a larger supply of refrigerator cars on hand to handle these potatoes. I am mighty glad to know, however, the work of these potato experts has brought some good results. They argued and plead with the potato farmer that he should make some provisions to have cellars or some way to store his potatoes, and not rush them on the market and pull the market down. I understand there have been a number of cellars put in up here. I want to tell you candidly and frankly, the railroads are not the public enemies that some imagine them to be. Their stockholders con - sist of thousands of individuals, many of whom are women and children, scattered over the entire country. Their managers are conscientious men who fully realize that in the operation of railroads they are engaged in a public service that requires the highest degree of care and attention; that in the performance of that service they are only entitled to earn, in addition to necessary expenses, a reasonable return upon the value of the property; that practically everything they do is under the strict surveillance of the Interstate Commerce Commission; that they are hedged about by strict laws and regulations, and that con - scious violations of them is liable to lead to swift punishment. They are doing all that is humanly possible to meet the conditions imposed by the public, and if allowed a reasonable time under existing condi - tions, they will place the railroads upon a secure footing and be able to do their part in reducing the high cost of living. When I go to church with my wife and the preacher says, "In conclusion," I wake up a little. In conclusion, I want to say the railroads are blamed for every evil that comes upon the people for </seg>
            <seg id="p546">546 BETOBT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGBICULTUBE the reason it is a very easy matter for a man to say, "It is the high freight rate." Any coal dealers present? Do not blame them. Last July, a year ago, the freight rates were reduced 10 per cent on a large number of commodities we haul, including coal. Taking Grand Island as a central point equal distance from the mines in Wyoming, Colorado and Illinois, and the docks at Milwaukee, the average rate per ton was $4.50. That rate was established by the Interstate Commerce Commission. The 10 per cent reduction made, a difference of 4 5 cents per ton. On July first, when the rate was reduced 4 5 cents a ton, through the people who owned the land that produced the coal, or the mining company that mined it, or the jobber who sold it — not the retailer — the price went up one dollar a ton. Yet you go to anybody and say. "Coal is high," and the answer would be, "Yes, it is the high freight rate." We are never there to defend ourselves, and are to blame for a whole lot. Furthermore, the Northwestern Railroad, — and I think the other roads are the same — want to do everything possible to build up the communities through which we pass, realizing if we have happy and prosperous people living along our line, we will do a large and satis - factory business. I thank you. (Applause) SIGNIFICANT KXPKKIMKXTAI, KKSl I/TH OX POTATO (1 I.Tl UK H. O. Werner, Department of Horticulture, College of Agriculture, Lincoln, Nebraska In associating with you men throughout the past few years. I have come to the conclusion a great deal of experiment work which has been done in this country would be of value to you. For many - reasons much of this work has not been called to your attention. I will not go into detail on a lot of these things. I will summarize very briefly. Very often by doing some things differently than we are accus - tomed to do them, we can get more nearly the results we are after. We want to have the largest yields possible and control the pests. We want to grow potatoes uniform — small and medium size. There is a reason for everything that happens. We do not always know it. It has not always been discovered. There is a reason somewhere. The experiment stations have discovered some reasons for some of these things- </seg>
            <seg id="p547">KKPOKT m NKBBAKKA STATE BOARD OF AGBICri.Tl'SE 547 Let us take the rotation proposition. That was touched on yester - day. We figure at least three years should be allowed between the potato crops, and four or five is better, as a means of controlling disease. You get considerable benefit from your potato crop on the following grain crops. In North Dakota they found over a long period of time that the grain crop following potatoes was as large within a matter of half a bushel as the grain crops following summer fallow — that potatoes are just as good as summer (allow. You get the benefit of it for probably three years or more, so that putting potatoes quite a few years apart is no loss. I was glad Mr. Minick mentioned the diversification proposition. I very emphatically agree with him it is very much better to have a number of growers with ten to forty acres, than with the same acreage in fields of forty to one hundred acres. Our best seed in this state has never come from the big fields. Those are the fields which are border-line fields. You can not hire most of the seed certification work done, because the man who hires out at wages you pay Is entirely incompetent to do the quality of work necessary. No man can rogue forty acres of potatoes nor handle it properly unless he has excep - tional farm help. In the matter of soil moisture, I won't dwell on that very long, because we have with us a man who can tell us more about it. A factor in western Nebraska — probably the most important limiting factor — is the moisture. Seed is important. But the best of seed will not produce fifty bushels if the moisture is lacking. If you had the benefit of moisture it would produce two hundred bushels. At Ardmore, Akron, North Platte and South Bend, there are dry land experiment farms, finding ways and means of conserving the mois - ture so as to produce the largest crops from the moisture available. The general result of all these experiments is along the line of showing that the most important thing for the farmer In this territory to do is to so prepare the surface of his soil so that it will catch all the rainfall and hold it and prevent run-off by crumbling the surface — not a fine, powdery surface, but loose. Another main feature which has been brought out at all the stations is to conserve that soil moisture. The old theory has been that cultivation was necessary for conserving soil moisture. Later results seem to show it is not so much conserving of moisture that counts as the killing of weeds. If you keep your soil from packing and baking, which means loss of water by evaporation, and keep down the weeds, you will conserve your moisture. In that connection, I might say at Akron, Colorado, accurate determinations were made a number of years ago concerning the amount of water used by various plants. An average sunflower will, throughout the course of the season, use three times as much water as a potato plant of the Irish Cobbler variety which will yield at the rate of 115 bushels per acre. </seg>
            <seg id="p548">548 BEPOBT OF NEBRASKA 8TATE BOABO OF AGBlrri.Tl'IK When you are growing one sunflower, you can grow three potato plants. When you grow one sunflower you won't grow the potato plants. We have the same thing with other weeds. Many of us may keep the weeds out of the field after the crop is once started to develop, but I have noticed more and more we are getting to late planting of potatoes, until this year mnay fields were planted as late as June 25 to July 3. Many of those fields were not plowed until a few days before planting. At that time in many places the soil -was entirely unfit for plowing. As a result the man could not fit his seed bed. The stand of plants was 25 per cent or less, and the potatoes are not desirable as seed stock. Late planting seems to be desirable up to a certain point. That does not mean late plowing. Leave your soil with a crop of weeds and grass and you will lose con - siderable moisture, and that moisture loss can not be regained. Id a season like this that loss was of little concern. During most seasons with no rainfall from June 15 to the early part of September, the initial moisture stored up means a great deal. Careful experiments have been conducted which indicate the keep - ing down of weed growth early in the season is very important. Whether it is done by discing or early plowing I think does not matter much — just so the weeds are kept off the ground. I think very many people have made a serious mistake in that connection. At these var - ious stations, not very much work has been done on the potato crop, but other cultivated crops have been used. They have considerable information with regard to the depth of plowing for wheat and other crops. I think some of the old theories we had corncerning the importance of very deep plowing do not always hold. In regard to potatoes, we have an underground product. I think the deeper the land is plowed the better. Nothing less than six inches should be con - sidered under the conditions we have. I mean six inches on the side you should measure by, not on the ridge side. Mr. Cannon says in Washington he plows his land twelve inches. He has conditions similar to ours, with a little more rainfall. As we go along logically, we come to the matter of seed treatment. Some work which has been done recently in the west has revealed the fact it is best to soak potatoes twenty hours before treating — to put them in water and leave them, or pour them out and cover them so that they will remain moist. If you have big scabby spots, the corrosive sublimate will penetrate better than if the potatoes have not been soaked. The potatoes contain dirt which weakens the solution; where- as if they have been soaked, much of the dirt has been washed off and lost. We touched a little bit on the storage of seed potatoes. In some sections potatoes have been put into cold storage and planted imme - diately. The results have not always been very good, the reason being a certain amount of growth must take place. You must have internal </seg>
            <seg id="p549">Bcporr or nehbakka state board or aomculti-ke 549 action started before you can have your sprout develop; therefore the experimenters have found a little sprouting is really desirable. Pota - toes that come out of cold storage start such vigorous chemical action they generate an excessive amount of heat which has an unfavorable effect upon the sprout. These long sprouts are undesirable because they weaken the potato tremendously. A lot of the poor stands this year was due to the fact the potatoes kept until the latter part of June were so weak they could not produce a good, vigorous plant. Very often the soil was too dry. We can always get up an argument on how to cut seed potatoes — whether by machine or hand, and where to make the cut. There are some definite principles that have been worked out, mostly in Mary - land. As a general rule, we find the larger the seed piece planted, the larger will be the yield and the more stems will be produced. The potatoes produced from large seed pieces with a large number of stems will average smaller than from those with small seed pieces. It does not matter so much whether you plant exceptionally large seed pieces, or medium sized seed pieces closer together. When you want to get a large crop of Triumph potatoes, plant almost twice as much seed per acre as has been planted in the past — between twelve to sixteen bushels per acre. I think the most desirable way is to plant a large seed piece weighing between one and two ounces, and spacing the plants eighteen inches apart. When you get one plant every twenty inches with a number of stems from a large seed piece, you can observe ii better than if crowded close to other plants and can rogue it out. If you do, you just need to take one plant. If you plant two small seed pieces, you have the labor of cutting out two plants. Prom another standpoint it is also desirable. If your soil is dry in the spring, your small seed pieces may lose considerable moisture. It has insufficient stored-up plant food to produce a good plant under those dry conditions. If you have a large seed piece, a fairly good - sized plant can be supported until your roots become better established. Sometimes you have seen in your fields a plant that has sprouted and seemed to grow slowly, and occasionally the plants die off and you can not find an apparent reason for it. If your soil has been dry, the most probable reason is the stem was forced up because of stored - up plant food; but the roots sent out did not develop because the soil was too dry. In order to have root development, you must have mois - ture in the soil. Therefore it is desirable to conserve the moisture rather than to plant in dry soil and have hopes you will get rain before very long, because the rain sometimes may not come. We can always get up a discussion also as to which is the better — the seed or stem end of the potato. By the seed end, I mean the end with the stolons — the small end. If your potato is dormant there is practically no difference. If any difference, it may be in favor of the stem end eye. If potatoes have started to sprout, the eyes on </seg>
            <seg id="p550">550 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AORICll.Tl RK the seed end are worth more, because as a result of chemical action, th plant food has moved from the area adjoining the stem end eyes to the area at the front end of the potato, and you have more stored-up plant food there than at the stem end. Consequently, in order to get more uniform stems, in cutting it is desirable to make the seed piece on the stem end a little larger than on the seed end. Of course you can not do much of that if cutting by machinery. In the matter of depth of planting, you must always remember your tubers are developed from stems upon the seed piece, and the deeper the planting, the deeper the potatoes wil be developed. You may say you do not want that because it is too much of a job to dig them. If you do not have much underground, you do not have stolons. They develop runners underground because of moisture conditions and lack of light. If light were present they would develop leaves. You need to surround your stem with conditions favorable for inducing their stolon development. In the basis of the work done in the Greeley conservatories, this takes place early in the season. By the time the plants are flve inches high you have a stolon development of two inches. Practically all of the stolons that will develop, develop within the few weeks after the plant shows above ground. About fifty days after the potatoes have been planted the tubers will form most rapidly, and practically all of the potatoes form at one time. You may Bee little potatoes and con - clude they are small because formed late. Very carefully conducted experiments at Greeley over a two-year period indicate practically all the potatoes form at one time. Some potatoes are small and some large because there is an insufficient amount of moisture to develop all, or some are located on the stem more advantageously to get the necessary material to develop size. At the Greeley station they also found the moisture has a great deal to do with the development and the formation of tubers. For instance, when they take the same variety of potatoes, plant them on dry land, and then irrigate early and late, they found they had the heaviest set of tubers on the land where irrigation was early; the next heaviest set came on the later irrigation; but it was just a trifle heavier in set than the dry land. Not many here are interested in irrigation. Moisture early in the season is necessary to have a heavy set of tubers. You can not control the rainfall, but you can control many of the cultural practices. If you control them in such a way as to have moisture available, your chances of having a heavy set of tubers are increasing. By planting large seed potatoes you can increase the set. Another thing of interest, you can see the chart in the exhibit showing the rate of tuber growth — the curved line creeping up. The greatest tuber growth takes place in this country in the early part of September. If you plant your potatoes too early, or do not protect your leaves so that they are destroyed in August, you probably by </seg>
            <seg id="p551">BEPOBT OF .TEMLA8KA STATE BOARD OF AGBICULTUBE 551 that practice are losing 25 to 50 per cent of your crop. If you look at the chart carefully you will see potatoes left in the ground until the end of the season, averaging 400 bushels at Greeley under irriga - tion were growing at the rate of from twelve to thirteen bushels per acre per day during the latter part of August and early part of Sep - tember. Very little growth was made after October first, and very small change in tonnage was made before August 15. If you dig your potatoes early you lose that growth. Many fields have had the same thing. The vines were killed by early blight early in the season and were practically mature the first of September, which means they lost the chance of utilizing all the development during the latter part of August and the early part of September when tuber development takes place most rapidly. If you have large acreage and want to plant early and your early plantings should come to early blight, you can prolong their life by spraying with Bordeau mixture. Generally the trouble is not in maintaining the green plants, but in maturing them early enough to handle the vines at digging time. During the last few years early blight has been common throughout this region and flea beetles have been common. Bordeau mixture will stimulate the vine growth and increase the yield and prolong the time during which the vines will be green. It will not kill flea beetles, but it will drive them out. They do not like it. They won't work on plants sprayed with it. On this Pine Ridge, the flea beetle proposition has been very serious, practically ruining many large fields of excellent potatoes. So far as we know, they are all right for seed purposes. They are not in them at the present time, but have gone into the soil. The flea beetles are the results of the working of the larva stage, which went into the soil and live in the trash around the potato field. If you plant potatoes next year close to a field where you had potatoes this year, it might be worth while to clean up the weed roots and trash along the side of the field to destroy the flea beetles hibernating over winter. A question which has come up this year has been the shape of the early planted potatoes. In view of the fact we have been emphasiz - ing spindle tuber, especially this year, it has complicated the situa - tion in the minds of some people. Many early plantings of potatoes were almost of the spindle tuber type, but not shallow-eyed. Their elongation was due to the fact that they made most of their growth during the period when the weather was very mild. Had they developed later, the tubers would have been round in shape. Those potatoes which were blocky because of weather conditions as the result of having been grown in warm soil are all right for seed purposes, but be sure they are not spindle tuber conditions. It is desirable for all the growers to become as familiar as possible with spindle tuber. Last winter we grew potatoes in tanks in which we controlled the soil temperature — at 55° to 65°. and 75° to 85* P. At 55° we got </seg>
            <seg id="p552">552 BCPOBT OF NEBBASKA STATE BOABD OT AGBJCULTUEE a nice round type of Triumph potato. Possibly many were wider than long. When we raised the temperature to 65°, we got a round potato. That Is about your September temperature in most of the areas out here. When we raised the temperature to 75°, which is warmer than you have in almost any year, we got the elongation. By the time we raised the temperature to 85° we had many tubers decidedly elongated, but not spindle tuber. They had normal eyes and color and produced normal plants this year. That was the result of the temperature under which they were grown. There is a big market for western Nebraska potatoes in the North Platte valley and in the Greeley district. This last year I had Mr. Bonde pick up 110 lots of potatoes from farmers in Kimball and Scotts Bluff and Sioux counties, representing the quality of stock the farmers had been running this year. We planted them the same day in a plot in Scotts Bluff county. We have dry land lots and certified lots. We had 55 lots of Triumph potatoes which under irri - gation averaged 148 bushels per acre. The range of yield in those lots was from 31 to 288.9 bushels per acre. Some farmers were planting potatoes that yielded 31 bushels, whereas some other farmers had potatoes that yielded 288.9 bushels. The nine certified lots aver - aged 208 bushels per acre. The highest of the certified lots went 288.9 bushels. It seems to me those figures show a big need close to home for good seed potatoes. It is not entirely necessary to go to the gulf to sell our stock potatoes. They have bought a good many potatoes and I think will buy some more. In western Nebraska we conducted demonstrations with Early Ohio potatoes. I do not know whether it is advisable to continue that work because our acreage and tonnage have been decreasing every year. We found from these demonstrations conducted in five counties in western Nebraska that twelve lots of western Nebraska certified Ohios — two at each of six plots — averaged 140 bushels per acre. Thirteen replicas of Minnesota potatoes averaged 107 bushels and the home-grown averaged 106 bushels per acre. This was a margin of thirty bushels in favor of western Nebraska grown Early Ohios. Pos - sibly if we paid as much attention to the Early Ohio as to the Triumph, it would be possible to raise very good Early Ohio potatoes. It might not be desirable to put all our eggs in one basket and raise all one variety, because the economic conditions in the market affect the price of our product. In selling Early Ohios, we sell to an entirely different market than in selling Triumphs. Another variety is the Irish Cobbler. The Niobrara people have been able to raise excellent Irish Cobbler potatoes for several years. This potato is in demand throughout the Triumph and Early Ohio market period, not as much in the former as the latter. From results at the North Platte station and the field observations I have made in the Kearney districts, it seems quite probable the Irish </seg>
            <seg id="p553">553 urarr or Nebraska state board of aobicultube Cobbler will replace the Early Ohio in those districts. I think the reason it is not being grown more extensively is because of the scarcity of good seed. It is difficult to grow good Irish Cobbler seed potatoes. I do not know whether it is more difficult than to grow good Triumph seed potatoes. In some of the late varieties we have less trouble keeping up the vigor of the stock. I am quite sure there will be a market for one hundred carloads of Irish Cobbler potatoes in Nebraska if we had them. In the western part of the state the growers realize it is a better variety to raise. Another variety is the Downing, referred to by Mr. Cannon as the Idaho Rural. It is not desirable to raise on dry land for commercial stock. For seed stock it is excellent. This year in our trial plots at Bushnell and Scottsbluff and Alliance, we got practically as good yields from the Downing as from the Triumph, or a little better. The percentage of scabby potatoes was highest on the Early Ohios. At Bushnell one planting was practically worthless because of scab. Sev - eral other varieties had a small amount, while the Downings and Triumphs were practically clean. We have had observations on our Triumphs for five years at nine different places. In every one it produced a yield available for seed purposes, equal or superior to any of the other varieties in the trials. In a dry season you would have many small potatoes, but not too small for seed purposes. The market for these Downing potatoes is In the North Platte valley and Colorado territory east of the mountains giving the biggest yields. The Downing variety has practically gone out of existence because spindle tuber has come in and ruined the seed stock. We have been able to maintain good seed stock around Chadron and Bushnell for several years. That stock is as good as can be secured from any place. We are developing a big reputation for Triumphs, but perhaps it might be well to endeavor to cater to markets closer at home which come at a different season of the year and would probably be equally as profitable as the Triumph proposition. There is no reason why Wyoming and Montana and South and North Dakota — especially the western parts of the two latter states — can not produce as good seed potatoes of the Triumph variety as you can. The good results you have secured in a financial way from western Nebraska potatoes have spread to these other territories. They are starting into the Triumph business on a more or less extensive scale, so that in two or three years the competition you will have, especially on the Triumph market, will be more keen than at the present time. Competition with Wis - consin and Minnesota and Maine has practically gone out of the question, especially in the case of your buyer who has consideration for his trade. It does not need to be considered seriously. We have practically taken over the business that once belonged to Maine. With that large territory producing good Triumph potatoes, it is reasonable to expect the quality will be as good and your margin may be cut down </seg>
            <seg id="p554">554 bepobt or itebbahka state boabd of agbioii.ti rk considerably. In the meantime, it might be well to have something else to distribute your labor over a longer period of time. It is quite a job to get the Triumph out in time. You must get all the crop out by February. With the Irish Cobbler and Early Ohio our shipping season may be prolonged. The market for them will come in February and March. Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, Tennessee and Mississippi are also states that will use large quantities of Irish Cobbler potatoes if they can get reliable stock. Northern Missouri, Kansas, easfern Nebraska and Iowa use large quantities of Early Ohio seed potatoes. I am inclined to believe the Red River Valley has the advantage in growing Early Ohio potatoes. They grow practically to perfection up there. They have less "trouble with scab which has been so serious on the Early Ohio potatoes, and potatoes do not grow aa knobby with them as with us. Our object should be to supply a market not being supplied in the Cobbler business, which exists close at home. I want to call your attention to an exhibit in the southwest part of the room where I have ten piles of potatoes showing the different degrees of spindle tuber. Probably the first three piles from the west look pretty good. If you will examine them critically you will find they are shallow eyed and a little bit elongated, and sometimes a little bit tapering. They are all affected with spindle tuber, in some form. In a year or two they will show more advanced forms, as found on the eastern end. I will refer to a certification proposition to emphasize one thought — the matter of roguing. You can not go into your fields to do roguing too early. It must be done. It is desirable, as Mr. Minick said, to have a number of farm operations. You must get it into your mind if you want to grow certified seed potatoes your roguing must be done when the time is ripe to do it. No excuse you may have from the economic standpoint can have any bearing upon the certification of those potatoes if they have not been rogued properly. While you are making the hay, the bugs are transmitting those diseases from plant to plant. At the end of the season you will have those diseases trans - mitted in your seed stock. We must insist upon early, timely and ef - ficient roguing. I think it is not out of the way to say it is necessary to rogue every field of certified seed potatoes at least three times, and preferably five times, throughout the growing season. These various diseases come on, and if you want to keep up the strain of potatoes and improve it, it requires unceasing work. It is not easy work. We can not maintain our industry without maintaining the quality of the stock. </seg>

Goring, Nebraak* Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: This is an important ques - tion, although I sometimes think that there is much truth in the saying that the farmer is 98 per cent a producer and 2 per cent a marketer: but if we have not the potatoes, we do not need a market for them. I am not an old potato raiser, although I have had some experience and am specializing on potatoes more than anything else. In growing potatoes, it seems to me it is like growing stock. I happen to know a little more about stock than potatoes. Potatoes and stock are the same in that you must be a good potato raiser in order to be successful. I heard quite a successful stockman in the eastern part of the state make the statement that there are three main factors in raising cows. First, you must like cows — like to work with them. He said you must "love" them. The next factor was work, and the third was judging ability. You must be a good observer. Those same three factors will apply to potatoes. When we came up, our County Agent made the remark we were discouraged because we did not profit by it. It is rather hard to like this game when you are not making a profit. Comparing stock and potatoes further: We must have the potato or the stock. My father calls certified potatoes "thoroughbred" pota - toes. To get good stock is the first thing. The next is the cultivation or food. We have to feed our crop right, and giving it proper attention is "feeding" it. If it hasn't the soil and climatic conditions it won't thrive. As to judging, I have noticed we can not be keen enough observers to detect the different diseases of plants. It takes an expert to study and understand these various diseases and condition of the plant. As to rotation, it is easier to tell how it should be done than to do it yourself. It is not for me to say a certain method is the only proper one, although I can give you my method in Scotts Bluff County. There are different methods in rotating, just like some doctors have different methods of treating cases than others, and still may be success - ful. With us we find by rotating wheat followed with potatoes, we have more of a yield and a better quality of potatoes and fewer diseases than if you follow corn. I understand in this part of the country they have more success upon results following corn. As to the method of preparing the soil, it should be cultivated thoroughly and often. We can not get around as often as we should. I think by thorough cultivation and giving the plants a fair chance, </seg>
            <seg id="p556">556 RKPORT (W NKBKAMKA STATE BOARD OF AUBU'l I.Tl RK they are stronger to resist disease. It seems that holds true the same as with stock. It is claimed one or two germs of hog cholera will not affect hogs if they are in thrifty condition. If a spud is in a thriving condition, it seems to me it will not take the diseases so readily. I believe in preparing the soil as early as possible in the season to hold the moisture, and then plowing as late as possible before seeding, to get the best results. With the moisture we have at present and a little more snow in winter, the proper cultivation would retain enough moisture to produce a crop next year without more rainfall. This may be a strong statement, but I think it can be done. The method I use in storing this moisture is this: When our wheat crop is harvested, we leave a stand of stubble eighteen inches from the ground which will strengthen the soil and keep the moisture until late in the season. Then by working it in, we have practically all that moisture that otherwise would escape with summer fallowing or even with corn stalk. Give it two or three discings and plant from eight to ten inches. We do not believe in the ridging of our potatoes. This is a debatable question. We have an enormous job to harvest our product with potatoes so deep. I thank you. (Applause). Adjournment was then declared until two o'clock. Fig. 10 </seg>

THE NKI5HA.SK A SKKD POTATO CROP From the Standpoint of Louisiana Growers Professor G. L. Tiebout, Baton Rouge, Ix.ulttiana I seem to be on rather dangerous ground. I do not know whether it would be well for me to say very much, because my position might be misunderstood. You all know that our relation as an educational institution to this certification work is a little different from the rela - tion that your own College bears to this activity. I think your College stays altogether out of the business end of this proposition, and we are disseminators of information regarding the business phases of this work. Now, we hope that it will not be very long before you people make a proposition to take over this line of work altogether, so that we shall have nothing to do with the business phase of certified seed. I should like very much if I were like my good friend. Professor Werner, who can sit back and start a crop and not be responsible for any of the financial results. With his efficient work he certifies the seed and makes it so popular that you folks grow a good quantity. Un - fortunately this year it seems that the supply is far greater than the demand, and some sacrifices must necessarily be made, I am afraid. We must all remember that primarily my efforts are with Louisiana, because I represent that state officially and I do not represent Ne - braska in any such capacity. Because we have found that Nebraska certified seed gives very dependable performance in Louisiana, there is no reason why we are under any obligation to buy our certiled seed from Nebraska, or from any other section. You should all remember that Louisiana interests are in the position of buyers, who go where they see fit. We buy from sections where our requirements are most nearly met. That is just the way you do when buying something. In our stores there are certain privileges accorded to the buyer on good economic prin - ciples. I think everybody will concede this. So It is our privilege to conduct this work as we see best, and our first obligation is to our Louisiana grower. </seg>
            <seg id="p558">558 KKPOBT Or .NKBKASKA STATK HOARD OF AURICI l.TI RK Now, as an educational institution, we believe in the application of the Golden Rule. Nothing would please me better than to be able to otter you people a price for your seed that would make every one of you happy. I would like to do this, but I do not make the price on certified seed. I do. however, have a relation to the work that perhaps puts me in position where I can advise, and advise I do and shall probably continue to do so as long as we are so closely connected with this certification work. In all fairness, I want you to understand my position. When I left home, I had certain definite propositions put up to me, and I pass them on to you growers informally. If the buyer in Louisiana is willing to make a certain offer on certified potato seed and you are willing to sell for that price, business naturally results. If, however, you offer at a certain figure and the buyer is not willing to give that price, business stagnates. That is just about the situation with regard to certified seed at the present time from the Louisiana standpoint. I want to tell you what we did in this connection. Some time ago, as you know, I sent out a questionnaire requesting voluntary offerings on your part and asking for certain information regarding your certified seed stock. W&lt;&gt; compiled this information and at present it has assumed the proportions of two sheets. On these sheets is given the name and address of the grower and dealer in certified seed, the number of cars offered, and the price you gave for January shipment. If you quoted a price for other periods we have put that down as far as space premits. The other information given in the questionnaire is filed in the office for special inquiries. We can not give all of that in detail to every prospect. After we mimeograph these sheets, we send them out to Louisiana prospects — farmer and home demonstration agents, jobbers and mer - chants, and farm organizations. Some farmers are in position to buy carload lots. As this is an educational proposition, we send it to all farmers who are potato growers. We will not furnish this list of Louisiana prospects to the grower of certified seed in Nebraska. We will, however, give you names of county agents in sections where there is likely to be a demand for certified seed, so that you can send them samples. We would like to have you use the College as the nucleus for disseminating your offerings so that we can keep a line on what is going on. This list must be kept as current as possible. We can not spend public funds for telegrams outside the state. Please keep that in mind and do not wonder why we do not wire you. We can not. After we have given this information and the season advances and we see how things are lining up, we are going to do as we did last year, no doubt — send out letters to you of this fashion. If we see the market in Louisiana is around $1.50 to $2 and the offerings to us are not in line with those figures, we will send out a questionnaire to this effect: If you wish to offer all or part of your stock at such a </seg>
            <seg id="p559">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD Or AOairULTUBE 559 price, wire or write at once. You remember that this wu the course that was taken last year. If I put the figure too low, do not think I am trying to offend you. I am simply giving you the conditions as they are seen by me. If our taking that amount of' interest in the work will handicap the general good that can be done, we must get together and use some other method. I think this is a proper course and I have not received criticism on this account. I believe some of the people last year misunderstood me in this connection, but after I came up in the summer and explained the matter, I think you agreed with me that the course adopted was the proper one to take. I will take the same this year unless somebody suggests a better method. I want to ask your President if it is fair to send our questionnaires asking if they have potatoes to offer at such and such a price? The President— That is all right. Professor Tiebout — That price is governed by my observations in Louisiana. The President — I do not pay much attention to the circular from the Farm Bureau in your neighborhood. They say, "If you have certified seed potatoes to sell for $1.25, let us know. If you have not, don't waste postage stamps to answer us." Do those growers in Louisiana consider what it costs to furnish the cream for them? I want to say this: I have raised potatoes for years and years, and the average of my potato sales never was as low as $1.25 a hundred. If you go back ten years, if they were low in the fall, they came up in the spring. I am speaking of the average price. I have sold potatoes for forty cents, and I claim I sold at the highest price — a car of 40,000 at six and one-half cents, that went to Kearney a few years ago. We must have $1.25 if we want to exist. Do you realize what the farmer must go through. We can not do it for $1.25. If the southern potato man can not afford $1.25, we will have to quit selling to him. We spend our time to talk certified seed. If they won't pay the premium I don't want to be in it. It is the money we are after. Not only that, but before the certification game came in — while I am strong for it — If they would offer me $1.25 I would say "Nothing doing." We spend that time. In Nebraska, 95 per cent of our potatoes are other than certified seed. We have hundreds of acres that need im - proving. If we can induce our own farmers to have certified seed. I think we can not invest it better than to use it at home. Now the buyers say, "Are they certified?" If it comes to a price like Mr. Cannon said for certified potatoes, then the fellow can say, "I can buy four dollar seed." Then he can offer you uncertified seed at $1.50 to $2. That is just exactly my standing. It is plain talk from a producer to a consumer. Can you pay it? If we do not get anything for our extra labor other than honor, that does not pay our </seg>
            <seg id="p560">560 KEForr or neb&amp;aska state board or aqrici'i.tubk debt*. If we go to the store or bank and say, "I want to pay my bill with the honor I got from having the best seed potatoes," I can not pay my notes with it. I must have the price. When I raised com - mercial potatoes- I sold a car of uncertified seed, I got the money down and it did not cost me extra. When the inspector came and my potatoes passed, it waa $72. When you have a bunch of men harvesting pota - toes, and you buy your sacks and the men want their money on Sat - urday night, even $72 is hard to pick up. I said to the inspector, "I did not expect you to come for two weeks. By that time I think I could have made it. I just paid my men Saturday. As soon as I can arrange it, I will send it in." "We expected you to have your money to pay in at this time." You must sell something and get that $72. Everything is all right and lovely if you get it paid back. But with potatoes at $1.25, we can not possibly do it. Anybody who wants cream must pay for cream and not skim milk. If they want skim milk, they can get it at skim milk prices. A difference of thirty-five cents a hundred is not quite enough. I think I have spoken for the farmers who produce certified seed. As far as only one opening is concerned, I have never shipped a car to Louisiana. I have sent to Arkansas and Texas. Two buyers were at my place before I left. The Texas man said, "I do not care so much about certified seed. Our growers know they can get seed from western Nebraska gtving good results. That is what we want." Mr. Westerbrook said, "We do not plant the tags down there. We want good potatoes." Even today if they want certified seed, they must pay the price. I thank you. (Applause). Professor Tiebout — I do not know whether I ought to proceed or not. I do not want to be misunderstood, and perhaps we folks who talk all the time say too much. I would like the opportunity to explain to you just exactly how we perform this service and ask for construc - tive criticism or any suggestions you may make as to how we can improve it. Of course we have no control over inquiries that may be sent out to you. While we may not agree with the method of approach that you mentioned, remember every individual has his particular way of doing business. If you receive offers that you consider ridiculous, you are under no obligation to answer. That is nothing but business. Suppose you want to buy a product, you have a perfect privilege to send out wires and see if anybody wants to meet the price you can give. If the parties you approach are not interested, they keep quiet and do not answer. If you have a commodity to offer and send out wires offering it and your prospective patrons are interested, they may </seg>

We get a little knowledge by rubbing against business men If you get offers from Louisiana connections that you do not want to accept, just ignore them. If we get offers from you that are put of line, I am sure the Louisiana interests will ignore them. If you write to the College, we will give you a courteous answer. That is our business. We are in educational work and we want to study in)ih angles of this matter. Isn't that perfectly fair? I am ready now to take up Mr. Foster's thousand-dollar offer. I ran tell you what certified potatoes are going to be worth. They are going to be worth just what you can get for them. Isn't that a fact, Mr. Foster? Mr. Foster — Taking it from that viewpoint, that is true. The President — Would you have any objections if we can, from ur standpoint, point out some growers down there in your neighbor- hood who got potatoes from Kimball, and what the result was with 'host- potatoes, and the earnings per acre last year? Professor Tiebout — I am anxious to receive such information. The President — I have a man who can give the information. Mr. Gadeken, will you tell us what the Eaton potatoes did? Mr. August Gadeken, (Bushnell) — They were potatoes of Mr. Katon's. Two carloads went down. They did well. They were put on land where they gave up potato raising of the Triumph because they could not get results on them. Those potatoes of Mr. Eaton's went in. They did so exceptionally well — I do not believe the actual flfciires were furnished me, but they averaged 150 bushels to the acre and went on the market at four cents a pound, making a total income for one acre of $160. I do not know how many acres they planted. They shipped a hamper of those potatoes to Mr. Eaton and they certainly were fine stuff. We had a meal out of them. The original soil was good looking soil. Professor Tiebout — I can tell you that the average yield in the field mentioned by Mr. Gadeken was 130 bushels to the acre. Some of it, I believe, gave a yield as high as 160 bushels to the acre. A County Agent in Louisiana reports that a grower planted two sacks of seed and got 10,000 pounds. You remember I told you about the work of Mr. Marler and Mr. Warner in 1922. The results with Nebraska certified seed are cer - tainly splendid. It is evident by the amount of work that we have done in promoting the stock. An unfortunate situation seems to have arisen, and we must wiggle out of it the best we can. There is more </seg>
            <seg id="p562">562 KKPOBT OK NKIIRASKA STATE HOARH 01 AI.Khl III Kl certified seed being grown than there is a demand for. I should think that it would be best for you to organize at once and send some good salesmen into southern territory. You might be able to unload some of this stock. You have 350 to 400 cars. The President — About 300 cars, and we need seed ourselves. The Secretary — On the basis of a 500-bushel car, we have almost 400 cars. Professor Tlebout We do not want cars loaded with more than 500 bushels. Wisconsin has quite a few and Minnesota a good many bushels. All of these certified seed being on the market will have a general effect on the price. I understand Wisconsin certified seed potatoes can be bought at a pretty low figure. Early in the season I had quotations, and not very long ago I had some that were out of line. I would like to bring out some more points on the business relations between Louisiana and Nebraska. As you understand, the College does not buy any seed. It gives information, and all business contracts must be made between the buyer and seller. We undertook to run these exhaustive tests in Louisiana so that each state would get information on the performance of its certified stock. We also visit the trade in Louisiana and do our best to get them to purchase certified seed so as to raise the standard of the crop as a whole for Louisiana. In the application of this list, we do not get it out at any stipulated intervals. We put it out as occasion demands. As fast as offerings come in we file them. When we feel that we have a sufficient number, we issue a new sheet and send it out to prospects in Louisiana, and they are governed accordingly. There is a detail to which I wish to call your attention. If you get a wire from a Louisiana connection asking you for quotations, please be sure to answer by wire. That is business courtesy. I will give you a concrete case that happened the other day. One of the county agents came into r.iy cfTico and said. "I wired three men on your list, and I have not heard from any of them." That was several days after. They were probably waiting to write. He said, "I want more potatoes now." I went to the files and chose what I thought was a connection that would answer the wire, and in two or three days the car of potatoes had been bought. The President — May I explain why he did not answer? We are slack in answering, but it depends with me — and I think most of the farmers are that way — on the nature of the wire we receive. Make an attractive offer and you will get the answer promptly. Professor Tiebout — This party wanted to trade at the offer the farmer made. The President — Then the farmer was to blame. </seg>

We believe $100 in escrow should be about the uniform deposit. Some growers ask for cash; some require one-third down, and others want $200. ■;• far as I know, none is willing to ship "open." I made a suggestion in my ques - tionnaire that Janusiy shipments be the basis for the quotations. Some varied from ihat. That is your privilege, of course. We will be glad to put down such offerings if we have the space. Mr. Gadeken — I have shipped a number of cars into Louisiana. I do not know what you mean by "open" shipments. I shipped one to Alexandria and another to Mr. Warner. There was no deposit made on them. Professor Tiebout — That is what I mean by "open. Mr. Gadeken — I like to do business with people of that kind. I know I will get my money when the potatoes get there. If you ship to some unknown party, especially if it is a produce dealer, "the market has gone off" and you get into trouble. Professor Tiebout— -I am making these suggestions. You must make your own terms and decide as to the responsibility. We are not operating as rating agencies. If a deposit of $100 is made in escrow, the general custom is to let the balance follow with the bill of lading in the form of a sight draft. I think it would be well to permit inspection on arrival. You show confidence in your stock when you do that. Suppose you require deposits that are not uniform. The man who offers to accept a $100 deposit stands a better chance of selling than the man who asks for all cash. The grower who does not handicap the trading relations any more than he can help, is the one most likely to get the business. I believe that is sound. Keep that in mind in your business relations. Some merchants will not make deposits on cars under any circumstances. They feel that if their ratines will not permit of "open" shipment — open account — they do not have to buy the potatoes, and they will not. They can get such accommodation from any broker, so it is not likely that such mer - chants will trade with a farmer. However, it might be possible he would if the farmer would use the same methods that the business man adopts. I want to say a little about what our people like and what they do not like. Our growers do not like large seed stock, so it would be well for you to keep that in mind in making shipments to Louisiana. You will not pleaae a Louisiana connection by large sized seed stock, nor with scabby stock. Please be very careful in sorting your potatoes and grade to your utmost ability. Your reputations are at stake at </seg>

I believe I saw one car last year where there may have been a disposition to take advantage of the tolerance under U. S. Grade No. 1. The "tolerance" was too great when the car arrived at Louisiana. Ad - justment was necessary, and all adjustments are unpleasant. Let us avoid them just as much as possible. You folks have said something about a possible organization to sell certified seed. I may state that a certain sister state of yours has, I believe, such an organization, and they have employed a dis - seminator of information who is to travel the southern states and sell certified stock. I believe that is a proper step to take. The matter of storage has been injected into this problem — storage in transit. I have been giving this point a little study myself and believe we will see a good quantity of our certified seed stored in transit at centers like Kansas City and Omaha, perhaps, so that this stock may be shipped out on short notice. It is being tried this year in rather an extensive way. It seems a certain letter written up here to your people has caused somewhat of a sensation. I want to say matters have come up in the other direction that do not sit very well with our people. Bui we will all have such things happening. If we have a committee on interchange of ideas, we will weed out such matters very rapidly. Some of you may ask me why it is that some potatoes have been sold in Louisiana for three dollars a hundredweight. They have been sold strictly on performance. A car here and there and some place else is being brought in there as a test of whether it really pays thrs" individual growers in dollars and cents to give a premium for certified seed that th»y feel will givp an increased yield. I hope that th° time will come when John Smith or somebody else growing certified potato seed will have a performance record in the south on which they ran sell. I know of no greater value of tests than that one point. I believe that if you can get your stock established with some of the large farming syndicates down there, some business of that sort can be worked up that would be to the advantage of both the grower of certified seed and the planter. I have brought some questionnaires along. If you want to revise your figures, I will take the revisions back with me and send them out to prospects. You will probably hear from me in a little while along the lines I pointed out a while ago. asking if you want to sell at a certain price. IMsru.HsliHi The President — My opinion not always goes, but I am in position m make you that offer. Isn't it your idea, as you stated right here. </seg>

You say you are not going to buy potatoes, but your advice is "the whole cheese" down there. If Mr. Tiebout recommends western Ne - braska potatoes, all right; "But don't pay too much because they must unload them, and they have no other good buyers." Your influence is more than if you were a buyer yourself. You told us they expected the price from the growers and we did not answer. I must say we are to a good extent guilty. If I ask for a price and the man says "I will take it," I am sure he gets it. In that way I think an association would he helpful. If a man wrote to the acency and set a price and got it from the agency he would be sure the potatoes came forward. If they were not what he expected, there is an association back of them. In Louisiana they want smaller seed. In Texas it is different. I was following Mr. Tandy through Kimball County. When I found a lot too big, Mr. Mulling followed along and bought the big ones; so we are not so much "in the soup." because Texas knows the value of the certified seed, too. We will come together some way. I am not so afraid we are overloaded. If I could give you advice and thought there would be 10.000 sold for the price of a dollar, I would advise pvery grower to plant the 300 acres at home. Don't forget the certified seed is worth more to you. It is up to us. We want a living price and we want those people not to lose money. How much does it cost the grower in th- south as an average for his seed? We know about what the freight is and about what we get. You must not forget those growers were financed probably by jobbers or bankers, and naturally their prices will be higher. The average, as I am informed, is five cents down there. I have noticed when the potatoes were the highest, the production that year was less, because everybody wants it when high. If low, a big per cent of the growers are coins out of the business. So don't be discouraged about that. The Secretary — As a matter of fact. I think nothing will be arrived at by this line of discussion. We are not going to set the price of seed here. If we do. nobody will stick to it. It seems to me we are taking a strange attitude. If we want to convince Professor Tiebout we are at his mercy, I think the way to do is to follow a line of discussion like this, to makp him think he has the only market for our seed. I told you people last snring there would probably be 200,000 bushels of certified seed, and suggested you get busy and think about doine something. I did not hear a word about it. Now you are all wanting to do something desperate. I feel the attitude that has been shown toward Professor Tieboi't is entirely unjust. Last year It was through his efforts and his insti - tution's efforts that one-half of your certified seed found a market. I am convinced if it had not been for his effort, one-half of your </seg>

If he had any effect upon the price of potatoes last year, his effect was in your favor. Prices paid by the Louisiana growers were 10 to 15 per cent higher than those paid by the growers of Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas; and 100 per cent higher than those paid by growers in your own state. Let us have a little balance on this proposition. Professor Tiebout did not come up here with the intention of fixing a price on potatoes. He came up to discuss the certified seed potato proposition with you people. I am very much disappointed in the reception you have given him. I do not think you will improve trading relationships as you have been doing. Mr. Fred Stanfield, { Kimball I — I move Mr. Tiebout be given an uninterrupted hearing. The motion was seconded, and carried amid applause. Professor Tiebout — I am glad to hear these kind expressions of Professor Werner's. I believe I can conscientiously say that I am trying to apply the Golden Rule in this situation. If my advice is worth anything to you, you are welcome to it. Remember, it is given in the best of spirit. Be careful on the point of frosted stock. Do your best t it out. Discussion The Secretary — That is going to be a mighty serious proposition this year. There have been thirty cars shipped, and local inspectors have held up 25 per cent of those cars because they have not been inspected properly. Question — You say your people like small seed.

Cannon, President Pacific North went Potato (ii-miMs 1 Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: I do not know whether you wanted me to read the names of the winners. I can not do that. The idea I had in mind was that possibly a little explanation of my manner of trying to arrive at some of those conclusions would be some satisfaction to you. In commenting on the Show generally, I have this to say. I am not a great man to scatter compliments where I do not believe they are earned, because sometimes I think the fellow like me who comes down here can better earn his money by telling the truth. I think your Bliss potatoes are the best large collection of Bliss Triumphs I ever saw. I do not mean that I never saw as good a tray or specimen as any here. But taking it as a whole, the large number of very, very high quality displays of Bliss seems to me to be above anything I ever saw in a show. I think your Ohios as shown here are not a credit to you. If you are going to continue in the Ohio business, you should go to Massachusetts or San Francisco or wherewhere and get some good seed. If you are going to go strong on the Cobbler as a show type you should improve them also. The one sample of Netted Gem, which of course we think is our greatest potato for table use, is rather off type. It is too long and pointed I do not consider these criticisms serious, because you are not living to grow those things. You are trying to grow the one thing with which you have made a wonderful success — the Bliss. You have tmrwmi a great deal of glory with them. There are two or three exhibits that might be puzzling on account «&gt;! the way I put down the scores. Maybe I have not interpreted this card as it should be. The first item is "Trnenetw to type," which i tins high in seed and not so high in table stock. You might have a splendid table potato quite a bit off type. I presume we consider it in connection with its reproducing tendency when we score seed and go heavy on type. Next is "Krowlom from disease." That meant absolutely, as I scored them, freedom from surface diseases — scab or rot or something that would show on the surface. The reason is that later on we have a score of "Quality of tle*h." In judging for that score, I opened the potato and looked at the flesh of one or two or more as occasion seemed to warrant. In three or four cases, when I opened the potato \*&gt;.in iutioii.

I did not amend my score on freedom from disease but simply inflicted all the penalty I thought the grower was entitled to on the quality of flesh. That is something that happened seldom, because you had very few potatoes in which I could find any disease. I do not want to belittle the decision of any judge; but as I stated the other day. the judge has on the table before him only part or the story. There are so many diseases in the field that might do great damage — might deteriorate that potato materially — which I can not see at all on the table unless in the few cases where the selector Fig 11 was so careless as to show them. Then again, I do not like to cut all the potatoes. It is not necessary. I think if you cut for internal troubles and And the first potato 100 per cent good, it is just as well to let it go at that. If you were to go back upstairs and cut several potatoes, you might find trouble where I cut the one that was good. When I found trouble in the first cutting, I cut several more. There is always the possibility that had I cut another potato in each tray. I might have cut the perfect potato here and the imperfect potato there, and it would change the scores. The best we can do in judging a show is to try to give everybody the same chance. The only way I can do that is to take plenty of </seg>

If that does not get me out of town in good health, I will have to take the chance. There is a comment I would like to make about the selection of your potatoes for exhibition. I say this only for the very few who might not have tried it, because most of you know these things as well as I do. I think the best way to get an exhibit for a show is to bo out with a flat-pronged fork early in September when the ground in loose, pry it under the hill, raise it, and with your hand take the tubers up. If you find one perfect tuber, take it out and place the rest back carefully; continue to gather until you have three times what you need for your exhibit. After letting them lie an hour or two, go back and dust and wrap them, put them in your basket and let them lie in cool storage for two or three weeks. Dust them carefully and wrap for the show, and you will find the skin will have toughened, the color will have remained as it should, and the potato will stand a Rood deal of abuse. If you are going to take blue ribbons, I do not know how you can hope to do it any other way. Another thing is prevalent in some places. Where you have county exhibits, I think it is generally understood that the county agent or some person employed by the county makes the selections, or helps very materially in the making of them. But I notice when the boys and girls come in, you require them to certify that they have not only grown, but prepared their exhibits. I think that is right. If Smith or Jones wants to prepare an exhibit, I do not think he should call upon the county agent to go out and help him select it. If he did call upon him, I do not think the county agent should go. (Applause). ( Voice — Amen! ) When I am scoring, a great deal of the score goes to the ability of the grower in making selections. If he has not made the selections, he has some of the score he did not deserve. I do not know that this practice exists here, but by the way you laughed, maybe it does. It should be guarded against where we can. I do not know of anything else that would be worth while my taking more of your time. I like to talk to you. An Irishman always likes to talk. When I am home I can not talk as much as I want to because my wife is Irish, too. But I like to hear an Irish lady talk, so I am compensated.

I do not want to refer to our individual association, because it may fail for one reason or another. When 1 speak of the abstract business, I am like the fellow laying cement.

You will think of other things Instead of that. There is another thing you probably will do, and if so. you will fail. When you get somebody to sell your potatoes, you will refuse to do the one thing that is absolutely necessary to make it possible for anybody to sell them, and that is to let somebody who has absolute knowledge of what grades should be, decide your grade. I have talked with hundreds of men and they say, "We will do i his, sure! You bet!" I have seen them sit at the table and sign papers. To one bunch I said, "See here, boys; remember this: you have not one thing to say about how your potatoes will be graded or when or how they will be sold, any more than your vote if you are on the board of directors. You simply must grow stuff according to the contract, bring it where ordered, leave it there, and get your returns when due." Invariably they said. "What! Do you mean we grew those potatoes and can't sell them?" They quit right there. (ientlemen, the growing is a big thing. The selling for profit is a bigger thing. I do not believe I have ever met one hundred men who ran do both well. I never met one who could do both well at the samo time. If you are going to form an organization, my suggestion would be to bear in mind those things. Pretty nearly everybody who has hit the rocks in a marketing organization will tell you that is where he has hit them. I have very much enjoyed being here and enjoyed having the chance of learning the many things I have learned. I very, very much appreciate the cordiality and kindness that have been shown me. It reminds me of one thing. A friend of mine went to some of these southeastern states one day and came back. Maybe it was here. He said.

JAMES G. PHELPS, C. V. SVOBODA Mr. Svoboda — We realized in going into this job of auditing the books, we were answerable to a great number of farmers and a lot of people interested in the finances of this organization. Occasionally a man has been turned down and wonders what has become of the money. I think in justification to Mr Werner, who is responsible for ihe finances, this should be taken up and discussed a little bit and perhaps we could arrive at some conclusion to give us a better way ItKI*OltT OK All&gt;ITlX«i (X»I&gt;I1TTKK </seg>

I think we can arrive at a better scheme by having these books audited by some responsible party. Mr. Phelps — What Mr. Svoboda has said about hesitating to follow the usual procedure and present and move the adoption of that report was just this: When two men not accountants take a few hours to audit a set of books whose accounts are in the thousands, they are foolish, and the organization is foolish to believe them if they do more than to say to the best of their knowledge and ability It is correct. Not that there is the least question of the correctness of it, but because the man handling the money and the men auditing it both want a proper statement, it was left off here. Lots of questions have been asked for a long while how much money is spent and what it is for — not in a critical way, but for information. We believe the figures are absolutely correct. We leave the motion for adoption to you people, and want it understood we are not public accountants or competent to do more than we suggest we have done. The Secretary — I do not want you to hesitate to say anything you want to. I felt it was quite a big job to put on these men because it took me a few days to run over these accounts and be satisfied with them myself before I struck a balance. It seems to me at this time it would be proper to adopt a practice of having a certified ac - countant check the accounts. Our by-laws and constitution provide for an Auditing Committee, therefore we did not hire a public accountant to check the books. Every item of expense will be printed in the annual report, as usual. Mr. Phelps — We understand Mr. Werner would welcome that sug Kestion. It is getting to be too big. Mr. J. P. Lawrence, (Lincoln) — I believe that proposition can be solved very easily and still stay within the limits of the Constitution, if we continue this Auditing Committee with power to employ a public accountant to go over their accounts, and they as an Auditing Com - mittee make their report through the accountant's. I would give power to the present Auditing Committee to expend a sufficient amount of money to get a public accountant to go over these accounts and show they are correct. I would so move. The motion was seconded. The President — It has reached a point where we must take care of that money so that we can prove to them. The proof is a whole lot. I can not express my appreciation of what Mr. Werner has done. It is a load for our Secretary. I think it would be a business proposition </seg>

If there is an interest and desire on the part of a good many to at least have an Information Bureau — some organiza - tion where the certified growers can get together and talk — we had better have something organized under some name today, although it has not a thing to do until the middle of next summer, and come back to the meeting again and the same old thing. So call it what you will; give it dues or leave it alone. Maybe we had better name some kind of a committee. I would not want to call it a Marketing Committee. We might call it a Committee on Information and suggest next summer, if nothing has happened before, that thoy should call a meeting to consider further action. They can write to the growers or call a meeting and go themselves; but give a chance next summer if there be this feeling existing to go further with it.

As a hardy pioneer, a good citizen, a leader in his own community and in the western part of Nebraska, and a developer of agricultural industry, his presence will be long missed. In our particular industry, his help can not be u-asured, and we bow to his memory. Respectfully submitted. M. E. ADAMS, FRANK G. ROWLEY. J. F. LAWRENCE, Mr. Lawrence I move the adoption of the resolutions. The motion was seconded and carried. l T pon motion, the seventh annual convention of the Nebraska Potato Improvement Association was adjou-nod, sine die. </seg>

Gentlemen : Pursuant to the request of your Secretary, Mr. H. 0. Werner, we bare audited the record* of the Nebraska Potato Improvement Associa - tion for the period December 1, 1922, to November 30, 1923, and herewith submit our report which includes the following exhibits: Exhibit I — Statement of General Fund Cash Receipts and Disbursements, December 1, 1922, to November 30, 1923. Exhibit II — Statement of Seed Certification Fund Cash Re - ceipts and Disbursements, December 1, 1922, to November 30, 1923. Exhibit HI — Reconcilement of the account with the N braska State Bank as of November 30, 1923. tAll Cash Receipts, with the exception of a few minor items, were lenced by duplicate receipts. A number of receipts and their licates were missing from the receipt books. It is our opinion that le were thoughtlessly lost or destroyed by the field agent when an error in issuing the receipt was made. A further discussion of this practice will be made in the paragraph entitled "Recommendations." All Cash Disbursements were evidenced by cancelled checks properly endorsed. In most cases evidence of disbursements in the form of statements of expense, invoices, etc.. were submitted in support of the disbursements made by your association. It is our opinion that all cash receipts have been accounted for and all disbursements are correct and proper. "Recommendations The receipt books now in use by your Association do not contain a uniform number of receipts nor are they consecutively numbered when printed. We believe that receipt books incorporating these changes and providing for a place to show the date of issuance would be a great improvement. Parties issuing receipts should then be re - quired to account for each and every blank receipt, and in case of mutilation of a receipt the original as well as the duplicate should be preserved and presented as evidence that the original was not issued for cash actually received. BBPORT OK ACCOUNTANT </seg>
            <seg id="p605">605 We would also suggest a new cash receipt book and a new dis- bursement register. We have discussed with Mr. Werner our sug- gestions on this subject, which if adopted, will greatly facilitate the bookkeeping work and audit procedure. Respectfully submitted.

The associa - tion boosts for those things which will make this industry in Nebraska a better business in years to come- Just as earnestly as it boosts for things which promote progress in our great livestock industry, it fights any activity or organization that operates in such a way as to reflect against this industry in our state. The annual meeting of (he Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders Association held in January, 1924, was attended by over 1,500 stock men who took part and were keenly interested in the subjects up for discussion. The first session took place on Tuesday afternoon and was addressed by several prominent horse men of Nebraska. The speakers and many men in the audience who took part in the discussion were of the opinion that in a very few years there will be a real demand for big, sound, drafty horses. They seemed to be of the unanimous opinion that the small broncho type of horse is a thing of the past, for the simple reason that he is not a marketable product. The man who en - gages in the raising of good horses and high class mules will probably receive a fair profit for his business. The sheep meeting was one of the most interesting held for several years. About 300 sheep men were present and were in a rather optim - istic frame of mind. In view of the fact that wool and lambs are com - manding a good price, sheepmen should be able to make back some of the money they have lost in past years.

They felt that for the money invested no class of stock will return, on the average year, a larger profit. Two subjects were quite thoroly discussed at the cattle meeting. The one which probably commanded more attention and discussion than any other was that of tuberculosis eradication. Several hundred cattle men were present and went on record practically unanimous in favor of area tuberculosis eradication work. Baby beef production called forth many short talks and the discus - sions would lead a listener to believe that the average man is beginning to market more of his cattle as baby beeves. A great deal of interest was aroused by the discussion on the fattening qualities of baby beeves versus older cattle. It was the opinion of many men present at this meeting that the future will see a great many calves in Nebraska marketed directly from the cows. This plan is being carried out to a great extent in some parts of the United States with good success. As a usual thing, the calves are grained during the summer and receive grain along with the milk of the mother until they go to market in the fall. A great deal of the time devoted to swine was taken up with the discussion of problems dealing with hog lot sanitation and the control of various hog diseases on the farm and in the feed lot. The state champion boys and girls pig club demonstration team pointed out how it is cheaper to prevent such parasites as round worm in hogs and such diseases as "necro" and bull nose than it is to attempt to cure the after they have once attacked the hogs. It was the consensus opinion at this meeting that the average sow in Nebraska must in i future raise on the average of 7 or 8 pigs instead of the present aw age, which is 5, if we expect to make a good reasonable profit on o i hogs. At the annual meeting held Thursday evening, January It sociation went on record as being very much in favor of promoting boys and girls club work in Nebraska, tuberculosis eradication, and the better sires campaign. During the year, the association hag aided in promoting the Nebraska High School Judging Contest which is held annually at the Agricultural College and. also, the College Students Judging Contest held at the same place. We have paid the expenses ol our junior judging team from Seward county to the Inter-State Livf Stock Show at Sioux City and have awarded medals to the boys and girls who competed in the livestock judging contest at the State Fail and to the club girls who exhibited canned meat at this fair. A number of the members and more especially the president hav« spent considerable time in checking up and attempting to banish from the state those individuals who have been bringing in large number! of so-called dairy cattle.

Wittmann, Secretary During (he past year the regular semi-annual and annual meetings were held as per schedule. On Tuesday afternoon, September 4, 1923, the semi-annual stockholders meeting was held at the State Fair ('.rounds, which was quite well attended. Two important matters were presented for consideration, namely: First — The resignation of Secre - tary Palmer, who has taken up his residence in the state of Tenness'e. and second- -the location of the next state show. Both matters were pft for final consideration to the board of directors who met in the veninK of the same day. This board meeting was called to order at P. M. at the State Fair Grounds with President A. C. Andrews in the chair, and all board members pies nt. Resignation of Secretary Palmer was presented and read and upon proper motion was unan - imously accepted. It was then moved, seconded and carried that the chair appoint a temporary Secretary, whereupon H. C. Wittmann of Lincoln was appointed. The Treasurer's Report was next read and accepted subject to the approval of the Auditing Committee because the books of the retiring Secretary were not available. Hastings and Lincoln then made bids for the coming state show, and after consid- erable discussion adjournment was taken until the following day at 10:00 A. M. The board met promptly Wednesday morning at the speci - fied hour and after due deliberation voted to hold the next state show at Lincoln. January 7th to 11th, 1924, and thanked Hastings for their kind invitation. Motion was then made that the chair appoint H. C. Wittmann as permanent Secretary to fill the unexpired term of the retiring Secretary. Seconded and carried. The new incumbent was then given his instructions and authorized to proceed in getting every - thing in shape for the next state exhibition. Adjournment. Thirty-ninth Annual Inhibition Accepting the invitation of our capital city, The Nebraska State Poultry Association held their thirty-ninth annual convention and exhi - bition in the Lincoln Auditorium. An excellent exhibition was staged. Much credit is due our energetic and capable Superintendent in arrang - ing the well balanced show.

            <seg id="p622">622 BEPOBT OF .NKBEAKKA STATK BOARD OF AOEICl LTl BE tainly was more than made good in quality. We might pause to remark that all exhibitions of this or similar kinds in the central west showed a noticeable decline this season, in the numbers of exhibitors, and this is attributed to the money stringency prevailing at this time. On the other hand, the quality in the exhibition and breeding stock is showing a healthy and pleasing progress. As the show was held during the week of Organized Agriculture, it enjoyed the visits of many farmers and breeders who were in the city attending one or more of the various other conventions. These visitors made many purchases of high quality breeding stock in order to improve their flocks in standard re - quirements as well as in egg production. The largest class was the Barred Rocks, closely followed by the popular Khode Island Reds and the White Leghorns. In these varieties the competition was very keen and many of the winners changed ownership at high figures. Another feature was the Egg Show which is now an established and permanent feature and is increasing in interest each year. Breeders and pro - ducers are beginning to realize that quality in eggs is as much desired as quality in the breeding stock, and are taking more precautions in selecting their hatching eggs and in selecting, caring for, and preparing their eggs for market. One wholesale and commission house in this vicinity inaugurated the new system this past year of buying eggs on a quality basis. All eggs are candled and graded and paid for accord ingly. All eggs weighing 24 or more ounces to the dozen with good shell texture and reasonably good shape and with small air cells are graded as No. 1. All eggs falling below 24 ounces to the dozen or larger eggs showing carelessness on the producer's part, such as poor shells, soiled shells or larger air cells are graded as No. 2 and No. 3. No. 1 eggs bring more money from the wholesale commission buyer than the ungraded farm eggs are retailing for in our towns and cities These No. 1 eggs are not sold to our consumers in Nebraska, but are shipped to the New York market where they bring a premium The No. 2 and No. 3 eggs remain here for local consumption. Here is plenty room for thought and improvement in egg producing lines and the sooner more commission men buy on a graded scale the sooner our producers will wake up to the fact that it pays to use as great care in selecting hatching eggs as in selecting breeding stock. With diligent care and selective breeding all our standard bred exhibition stock can be brought to the point where we can expect show winners, heavy producers and layers of No. 1 eggs, all these virtues in the same bird or birds. The 39th annual business meeting of the State Association was held at the Lindell Hotel parlors the evening of January 10, 1924, and was very well attended. In the absence of President Andrews, Vice-presi - dent Nels Peterson called the meeting to order and presided. After completing all unfinished business, numerous important prob - lems were debated and many progressive steps taken. A very interest - ing paper was read by Prof. Frank E. Mussehl of our State Agricul - tural College on the subject of "The Poultry Industry of Nebraska." </seg>
            <seg id="p623">REPORT OF .NEBRASKA STATE BOARD Or AGRICCLTURE 623 The Poultry IihIii-ii \ of .Nebraska The poultry industry of Nebraska, is developing in a sate, sound and sensible way as is evidenced by the 1920 census report. This re - port show that although the number of farms in Nebraska decreased from 129,000 in 1910 to 124.000 in 1920, nevertheless the poultry pop - ulation has increased from 9,010,000 to 11,615,000 hens during the same period. This represents an increase of 28 per cent in the poultry population of the state, and is definite evidence of an appreciation of the possibilities of poultry raising in Nebraska, where we are favored with all of the natural feeds and a good climate. Most of the poultry production in Nebraska is still a by-product of general farming, altho on an increasing number of farms the poultry and egg income is more than a by-product and is becoming one of the main sources of income. We find instances also of very successful specialists, who have solved the problems of poultry management, and who are keeping flocks of a thousand or more hens. One Saline county poultry farmer sold over five hundred dollars worth of eggs produced during one month from August 10th to September 10th, 1923, this at a time when most flocks were dropping off in production. This farm will have a gross poultry iiue of better than five thousand dollars for 1923. The records which have been kept by the accredited farm flock co - &gt;p«-rators indicated that last year the net income per hen on these anius was $2. IK per bird. On all of these farms standard bred poultry is kept and improvement of the standard qualities as well as egg laying ability of the birds is part of the management program. The rapid development of the hatchery business in Nebraska has resulted in a great opportunity for standard bred poultry producers, and breeders. The baby chick business is still in its infancy, and the iit demand is for standard bred chicks. This results in a market Mr thousands and even millions of eggs during the hatching season, from good standard bred flocks, at prices quite a little above current market prices. This cannot help but have a great influence on the standard bred poultry business. There rests with the poultry breeders the state the responsibility of maintaining mat ings of standard birds of good vigor and vitality and good egg production, since these flocks will really be the seed stock by means of which the standard and pro - ductive qualities of our farm flocks will be improved. With a growing poultry population the problem of disease control will be increasingly more important. Much progress has been made in this direction, but much remains still to be done. The relation of proper housing, proper feeding and breeding in the control of poultry diseases is a field in which careful investigational work is immediately urgent.

The question is often asked, "Is there danger that the poultry business will be overdone," or in other words is there likely to be an overproduction of poultry products. Apparent overproduction may often really be underconsumption The high esteem in which eggs and market poultry are held at the present time indicates that advertising campaigns of the type which some of the other agricultural industries are promoting will be very effective in increasing the consumption of eggs and market poultry. The present per capita consumption of eggs is about fifteen and one-half dozens per person, and of market poultry about five birds per person per year. Besides this we exported last year a very large quantity of eggs to England, Cuba. Mexico and Can - ada. One Nebraska produce company alone shipped out 110,0(10 cases or 275 car loads of eggs to foreign countries. This, we believe, indi - cates that the poultry business is well grounded on a wholesom* demand for its products. With good stock and good management prac - tices we can surely count on a continued healthy growth and develop - ment of the poultry industry. The election of officers was held at this meeting with the following results: Mr. C. D. Tharp. McCool Jet., President; Mr. Nels Peterson Mason City. Vice President; Mr H. C. Wittmann. Lincoln.
