            <seg id="p021">■ Report or Nebraska State Board of Agbicultube replacing them with uniform- and shapely buildings, these and many . other great Improvements are the achievements" of this Board during 1 these fifteen years. \ &lt; " Let us review for a moment the financial showing made by this institution. Going back to 1901, the year the State Fair was'per - manently located in Lincoln, we find that during this period there has been' paid out a total of $2,853,702 for permanent improvements ■ and expenses of various kinds. Of this amount only $705,166 has been appropriated by the Nebraska Legislature, for the purpose of purchasing grounds, the erection of the buildings and minor improve - ments. During the same period the State Board of Agriculture has paid $794,833 in premiuns and has put back into the grounds in the way of permanent improvements and upkeep a total of $797,913 "from its own earnings. Thus it will be seen th^t the State Fair has been an -asset and not a 1 ability from a strictly financial standpoint. It has distributed back- to the people of Nebraska in premiums morn money than has been' appropriated by the Legislature and it has given back to the State of Nebraska in permanent improvements and upkeep more money than the State has expended. While the building program is a source of satisfaction to us all, yet when we review the stupendously greater things this organi - zation has done for the State of Nebraska- through its annual exposi - tions the assets and financial statements given above sink into insig - nificance. During these same years the State Fair, has grown and grown. Its attendance has increased from a meager 43,000 to a record breaking mark in 1926 of 307,000 Its exhibits have multiplied many times over. This great increase during very recent years is quite marvelous. In 1923 the farm product entries totaled 4,435. At our' last Fair the entries of this department jumped to 8,648. The boys' and girls' club exhibits in 1922 were 1,05 7;. in 1926, 2,904. A similar ' increase is to- be seen, throughout the various depart - ments of. the. Fair, and when we sum up the total' number of exhibit entries it gives a more definite idea of how the Nebraska State Fair is growing by leaps and bounds. In 1923 the total entries reached "14,714. Last year these exhibit entries reached the high water mark of 24,177. Thus it will be seen that the Nebraska State Fair is keeping pace with the advancement of the great and growing State it "represents. It was only a few years ago that we looked forward with grwat anticipation to the time when the attendance would reach 200JIOO This goal wa3 reached and then the mark was set at a quarter of a million. Again this goal was reached and raised anew and our last Fair witnessed an attendnce of 307,000 people. 30,000 autos from far and near congested the grounds. Cars came from every county in Nebraska and from forty states in the Union. </seg>
            <seg id="p022">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture m 4 J° b " ng th6Se Pe ° Ple the Fair management carried advertising m 50 newspapers which reach the homes of probably 2,000,000 p ople i-TiT 5S.-S SETS- " a ~ ~- - ■? The management of the Nebraska State Fair is showine the greatest .ibera.ity possible both in the entertainment of The V as ! rTb :^u vl t lts grounds ' and in the distribution o° P r em .u m ; on the exhibits these people bring. It takes 100,000 admissions to entertain our guests while they are here and another 100.000 admis - sions to pay the premiums they take home with them. . These achievements have not been brought about by any one man or set „ , 8 a membershlp that reache8 J State and enlists the services of leaders in every walk of life and a constants changing directorate selected from those of expedience who have grown in the work that has guided the course of this country tlOn an&lt;1 made U °" e ° f the gfeateSt ° f Us cla8s ln ttto As an evidence of the constant injection of new blood into the organization I wou.d say that there are now only four of the present 29 members who were here when I came upon the Board. Burin - this time seven Presidents have held office. l say ' his in answ f to the statement sometimes heard that the State Board of Agriculture is a body that perpetuates its own mem - bership. On the contrary it is an organization that attracts able and representative men in the various sections of the State who are anxious to do something worth while for Nebraska. That is why the Nebraska State Pair has reached a front rank among the great fairs of this country. In my opinion the unwritten rule that no President should hold offlice for more than two years should be continued to the end that the most modern and advanced ideas may be injected into State Fair management. While every department of the Nebraska State Fair shows remark - able growth and achievement, yet there is one department that stands out in bold relief and is the pride and joy of the people of this State I refer to the boys' and girls' club department. This most unusual activity is increasing the strength and extending the range of agri - culture as an art, as a science, and as a practical and worth while vocation in which the coming generation as well as the present one can visualize a bright future. State Fair visitors who have visited these wonderful exhibits brought by the boys and girls of Nebraska, comment lavishly on the </seg>
            <seg id="p023">Report of Nebraska State Boabd of Agriculture good Influence these young people have given, to their home com - munities, and the inspiration resulting therefrom. The State Fair has been a potent factor in aiding the Extension Department of the' State University In developing this work. The results have been greater than the most .skeptical person could anti - cipate. The largest building on the grounds was entirely inadequate to house these exhibits from the club boys and girls of Nebraska at our last Pair, 'and to take care of this great overflow five large tents had to be pitched close to the exhibit building. A new building for this work must be added soon if we are to properly care for this great and growing exhibit. ■ The- rapid growth and increasing popularity of the Pair "has created demands on the treasury that have been almost impossible for the management to meet. The adding of new departments, the constantly increasing premiums, the housing of larger exhibits, and the upkeep and repair of grounds and buildings, to say nothing of the new structures we are constantly adding, has made the financing of this great institution a. difficult problem notwithstanding the great success the Fair Is meeting with. '■■■• When we look upon the resources of Nebraska well can we marvel at its greatness. The nine million head of livestock with a valuation of 256 millions of dollars makes It one of the three great livestock states of the Union. It is surpassed by only, one state in the produc - tion of swine. It is third in the production of cattle and ranks first in number of cattle per farm. Its six hundred thousand head of dairy cows are now. making it a great dairy state, and this is shown. . by the fact that nearly a dozen of the nation's largest creameries are located within its borders and its metropolitan city of Omaha leads the world in the manufacture' of butter. . There are only three states that raise morie horses than Nebraska. It has two of the largest horse markets and the! second largest livestock market of the country. Nebraska's farm poultry represents an iniius - try rated at thirty, millions of dollars. ■ ■ The value of crops and livestock raised on Nebraska farms reaches well over the five hundred million dollar mark and places the State about fifth in rank among, the agricultural states of this country. Then why) should not the .Nebraska State Fair continue to be a great show window of a great state. It Is the University of Nebraska agriculture. .While It Is educational and Inspirational to the people of our own State It carries to the world the message of our great resources, not In figures but in actual demonstration that fairly be-* wilder the person who attempts to see Nebraska as it is depicted on the State Fair grounds. ■ Thus I say that the State Fair has given back to the people of Nebraska dollars for every cent the State has invested in it.

In doing this you . will have the support and co-operation of the substantial and leading people of your communities and you will be builders of better county fairs for Nebraska. ■ In conclusion I desire to express my deepest .appreciation to the officers, members, superintendents and workers who have cooperated so lpyaliy'ln making the 1926 Pair a success. Among those who have aided materially in the success of the last fair I would call attention to the loyalty of. the press of the State. Daily and weekly papers,' farm and trade journals ' have been especially kind in giving freely ■of their space, "this- has been an asset greater than can be easily estimated and one that everyone connected with the Nebraska State Fair, appreciates .in the. fulle'st.- The Press Bureau,' which for the .first time functioned on the grounds during Fair Week, was a great, factor in putting over publicity that had a far-reaching effect and was of great value from the standpoint of advertising Nebraska. PRESIDENT PURCELL: I believe the next order of business Is the report of the Secretary. •• - SECRETARY'S REPORT " The 1926 Nebraska 1 State Fair- and Exposition not only, set new records for attendance," but a new record watfiachleved for fulfilling its real mission as an educational institution. | From every department came the words that the visitors seemed to grasp the underlying, vital aim' and principle of the Fair; which is to point the way to better methods of farming, to make more efficient men and women, and by working with the boys and girls of Nebraska to develop a higher and cleaner- citizenship... " .. ' It Id an institution of. which we all should feel proud of. It was. pronounced by the press of the state as , well as other states, and by the patrons, to' be the ' greatest Fair and Agricultural Show that was" ever held in the state. It will go down in history as the biggest from an exhibit, viewpoint as well 'as attendance. 307,832 people passed through the gates in the six days, or an average 'of 51,305 per day. This was 37,148 more people than the high mark - In 19.20. It is a interesting to note that the total attendance in 1917, nine years ago," was 200,468 or 10.7,368 less than this year. The fact that the Nebraska State Fair" could make such a showing in the face ':" of the fact that almost one-third of the state was a complete crop failure is positive proof that the Fair pas become an established institution and is moving steadily on. • It has outgrown its swaddling &gt;■ clothes, launching ahead of Nebraska's, progress. . . • ■ ' Thousands come to the Fair because they look upon it as an • investment. It makes no difference what their vocation in life may </seg>

They realize that they get a fair return for the investment of the trip. ■ *' e spnd ° ur people to school, then through the University and all the way through their school period they, study from books; he authors of which possibly have specialized and no doubt spent their lives working on. specializing in their line. We may apply the same to Fairs. In every department of the Fair you will find specialists who are authority upon their special line, it may be breeding and developing a hog or some other breed of stock, or it may be raising corn and selecting seed. It matters not where you turn you will find r n vl T len th3t haVe speclalized and giving real service at the Nebraska State Fair and you have an opportunity to come in personal contact with the people that are specialists in every agri - cultural activity. y e Nebraska, in the eyes of the world, stands near the top in Agriculture and it is only r i ght and proper that the Nebraska State Fair should measure up with the best and call attention to the agri - cultural resources and superstructure of American wealth Not only may we Justly boast of its fertile fields and per capita production but its citizenship as well. There is not another state in the union hat has produced as many outstanding characters as Nebraska and in evidence of this fact I will call the names, of a few that we are all proud of: Pershing, Dawes. W. J. Bryan; men of world-wide reputa - tion. In athletics we have Locke, champion fpct racer; Alexander, who built such a reputation for himself just recently; Weir, national char - acter in football circles; Stecker, champion wrestler; Munn, coming up near the top in boxing; and many others. Through the Boys and andMnrt? ■* °', We haVe had m^ champion judging teams and individuals; in fact the College of Agriculture is turning out annually a great many young people that meet all comers in some of the hardest contests in the country. Agriculture If much of the State of Nebraska suffered a drouth during 1926 and a subsequent short crop, it was not to be disclosed by the Agri - cultural display in the Agricultural Hall. The exhibit of farm pro - ducts and fruit was never better. When the Agricultural Hall was built the Legislature appropriated one hundred thousand dollars for that purpose. The building was erected and all the appropriation absorbed, leaving nothing for interior decorations, so like all other buildings built by piece-meal, it was never completed until this year After expending approximately $2,500.00 on interior decorations' Plumbing, and completing the several nooks and corners, it is now considered by those of authority to be the equal of any Agricultural exhibit building in the United States.

            <seg id="p027">■ Refobt of Nedbaska State Board of Aobiculture C. A. Lindstrom of Washington, D. C, in the office of Exhibits, visited the Fair and I was privileged to accompany them through several buildings. After looking the Agricultural Hall over carefully they voluntarily said, "We have been out making Fairs ever since Fairs started but we have not seen anything that will equal this building." "The finest I ever saw," was a common expression of visitors. It was necessary, in order to get the exhibits in the building, to reduce all agricultural exhibits 25 per cent. Thirty counties were represented with farm product displays and there were seven individual exhibitors. Douglas county, which eventually won first prize, had the largest display; following closely Scotts Bluff, Cheyenne, Kimball and Richardson counties. The counties, exhibiting were Kearney, Scotts Bluff, Dawson (irrigated), Cuater, Cheyenne, Adams, Franklin, Kim - ball, Red Willow, Richardson, Dawes, Box Butte, Lancaster, Phelps, Blaine, Antelope, Thayer, Washington and Douglas. First place was won by Douglas, Washington second and Lancaster third. Their places were on the basis of points scored. The counties do not com - pete with each other but are paid on the basis of points, Eastern counties receiving 30 cents per points; central counties 35 cents; Western counties 40 cents and irrigated 40 cents.. In the central division Kearney County's collective exhibit won the most points. F. Poore's individual exhibit from-Kenesaw, second, and 0. J. McCul - lough's Individual exhibit from Merrick county, third. Kimball county was high in the Western division, Red Willow second and Dawes third.- Scotts Bluff County won first in the irrigated and Dawson second. The Dominion of Canada had a concession space in the Agri - cultural Hall and showed a wonderful display of its farm products. ' The fruit display was also one of the best ever shown. Joy Morton's orchards of Nebraska- City, had a fine display of apples and peaches. There were many other fruit displays from the southeastern Nebraska fruit section. . The floral exhibits added greatly to the pleas - ing arrangements of the big hall. The Butter Statue The butter statue was a very unique exhibit moulded out of genuine Nebraska butter which State Fair visitors look for each year. This year the statue depicted a life size Nebraska farmer husking an ear of corn and labeled, "The Cdrnhusker.! 1 There is possibly more interest in the butter sculptured- piece than in any other single exhibit at the Fair. The Nebraska State Fair has perhaps had more fine pieces of butter sculpture on exhibition than any other Fair held in the United States. For the past sixteen years they have had a fine piece on exhibition which has been put on by the creameries of .the state to advertise the dairy industry of Nebraska. Mr. J; E. Williams, butter sculptor, has made most of the exhibits; he now has a national reputation and is now the leading butter sculptor of the country. This </seg>
            <seg id="p028">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture year he will make exhibits for Kansas, Nebraska, Iowaj Illinois, Michi - gan, Ohio, Ontario, Canada, Texas, Tennessee, Florida and most of the big national dairy shows. Canary Bird Exhibit The canary bird exhibit was not quite as large as we expected but added quite a pleasant touch to the surroundings in the center of the Agricultural Hall with the flowers and fruit. This was the first year for this department and we are looking forward to a won - derful canary bird exhibit in 1927. State Institutions An interesting exhibit was placed before State Fair visitors by the State Board of Control which is in charge of the various state penal and charitable institutions. If affords the Board Its greatest opportunity to acquaint the people of the state with some of the fine things that are being accomplished at these institutions. Seventeen institutions were represented. There were exhibits of needle work by the widows and wives of' soldiers at the Soldiers Home; exhibits from the Milford home for women, and the Girls Industrial School at Geneva; an exhibit repre - senting the various crafts being taught at the Men's Reformatory; the Penitentiary exhibited furniture and exhibits from the shirt factory; bead work, reading and writing by the Brail system at the School for the Blind were on exhibition; school exhibits and farm products from the Boys' Industrial School at Kearney; and demonstrations of treatments given to children at the Orthopedic Hospital and also the State Tubercular Hospital. These exhibits and demonstrations were greatly appreciated by the State Fair visitors. A band of thirty young people from the institution at Beatrice, gave concerts regularly during the week in the Agricultural Hall. The band from the Kearney In - dustrial Home was brought in two days. The music from these two bands was listened to with a great deal of interest and was appre - ciated by all. Xeedle Work The Needle Work Department seemed to be much larger and more interesting than ever before. This is one department that it is neces - sary to understand the work before it can be appreciated to the fullest extent. Men as a rule are not interested in this line of work, but pass there when you may and you will find the rail crowded' 'with ladies eager tor information in tatting, crocheting or other fancy work. The Antique exhibit was of interest to all; for instance, a quilt made in 1850 was on exhibition, also a wool coverlet made in 1848. A. pair of white socks knitted 160 years ago was another heirloom exhibit that drew the attention of many of the visitors. </seg>
            <seg id="p029">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Domestic Products | . . '■ -j The usual large display of domestic products, canned and pre - served fruit and vegetables were on exhibition. One hundred thirty - seven exhibitors exhibited nine hundred eighty-one cans of frulto, jams, preserves and vegetables; one hundred ninety-one glasses of jelly were on exhibition; making a total of one thousand one hundred seventy-two jars. Exhibits were received from Ceresco, Elmwood, Bennett; Davey, Geneva, St. Paul,' Waverly, Hastings, Friend, Plattsmouth, Hickman, Arlington, Wabash, Wahoo, Fairmont, Martel, Daykin, Ashland, Over - ton, Milford, Comstock, Lincoln, College View, University Place and Bethany. Educational The Educational exhibit has grown to such proportions that it threatened to over-flow its boundaries. All the south side of the. falcony floor of the Agricultural Hall was necessary for the exhibit and there still was not room enough! Twenty-three counties of the state had exhibits. . The Parent-Teachers Association and the Council of Christian Education co-operated in making the Educational Depart - ment a great success. All hours of the day you would find the exhibits being carefully inspected by the crowd. It Is just another phase of making the big Fair for all the people. A new feature this year in the Educational Department was a state-wide spelling contest, both written and oral. The contest was open to eighth grade students. Over forty contestants were entered, representing' nearly one-half of the state. Carolyn Cummings of Falls City, 13 years old, carried off the honors in the first state spelling contest; she won first place in both the written and oral contests, au honor that she will feel proud to refer to all through the rest of her life. Clifford Zockoll of Exeter won second place, Jeanette Jennings of Thayer county won third place. The counties sending In contestants were Adams, Antelope,. Franklin, Saline, Scotts Bluff, Gage, Custer, Thayer, Douglas, Fillmore, Lancaster, Pawnee, Howard, Nuckolls, York, Butler, Holt, Kearney, Hall, Blaine, Kimball, Washington and Webster! Boys and Girls Glob . It is useless in this limited space to try to cover in any detail the Boys and Girls Club Department of the Fair. It has become a Junior State Fair in itself. It was necessary to erect four tents to take care of the overflow. Their exhibits of stock created more interest than any other exhibit on the ground. It exceeded the fondest ex - pectation of all. The sheep exhibit filled ten pens. Some idea can be gained from the fact that the boys and girls brought 409 baby beeves into the baby beef contest, compared with 176 last year. It was the sensation of the Fair. After the baby beef prize ribbons had </seg>

The various packing companies entered into a spirited bidding for possession of the prize winners. The last day of the Fair a special train of thirteen cars carried 310 of them to the Omaha' packing houses. Approxi - mately 4,000 exhibits of stock and poultry were made by the boys and girls. In addition to the baby beeves they exhibited more than a hundred dairy calves, compared with 15 last year. Their pig show numbered about three hundred. They also had a wonderful agricul - tural exhibit, there were 146 entries in the corn show and every kind of crop grown in the state was exhibited by the boys and girls Exhibits of canned fruit and vegetables was another outstanding fea - ture of the Boys and Girls Clubs. Competition between the boys and girls teams in the canning and clothing making division of the home economics department was almost as keen as the baby beef class - there were nineteen counties represented by teams. The style show was another very interesting feature, fifteen young ladies dressed in garments of their own design and make competed for honors. The boys and girls in this department published their own daily paper, reporting the important events of their department. We all may feel proud of the wonderful development of the Boys and Girls Club Department and we have not by any means reached the climax. I'nited States Department of Agriculture Kxhibit This was a very interesting exhibit. It was held in connection with the Boys and Girls Clubs which consisted of a series of small booths showing in pictures and graphic charts the plans and accom - plishments of the Extension Service through the federal department and the various State Extension activities. liees and Honey The Nebraska Beekeepers made a very creditable exhibit. The display consisted of stacks of golden honey, granulated honey, comb honey and the many uses to which bees wax can be put. The number of exhibitors were less this year but there was more honey on exhibition. On account of Nebraska's increased acreage of white clover, a plant which yields honey of the purest white it is bringing Nebraska to the front as a honey producing state and this department should be built up with young exhibitors and interest ■&lt; larger portion of the state. Feeder and Pat Cattle Demonstration On the north side of the Agricultural Hall on the outside undor the balcony was the fat cattle feeder demonstration, the first of the sort ever given here. It showed various grades of cattle and showed the farmer what is the basis for the price they get and how to best, feed and finish their animals for the market. It was also a lesson </seg>
            <seg id="p033">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture to housewives how to select the best grade of meats. The Nebraska Agricultural College co-o] lerated in this display with the Union Stock Yards. Company, the Live Stock Exchange, the Traders Exchange and the Omaha Journal-Stockman.. Personally I feel grateful to these organizations for the interest taken in the Nebraska State Pair: Cat Show. The Cat Show, a ne\r department, was located under the balcony of the Agricultural Hall en the outside. . It opened on Wednesday and; continued the balance of, the week. Public enthusiasm centered around the showfrom morning until night. There were blue cats, yellow cats, brown cats, black cats, w! ite cats, striped and plain cats and a number of just cats of all sizes, ages and dispositions.' We had champions from Omaha, Kansas City, Has :ings and Lincoln. : ': . :• • " -I ■ . i i . ' Better Babies This department is 1.0 arouse interest in child study and to aid, motherfe in the physical and mental defects of the child. It has developed to such an exteit that it becomes one of our most perplexing problems how to best takj care of this interesting department. Under our present method it is impossible to handle over two hundred and twenty-five babies and each and every year we have nearly that many disappointed mothers that make their entries too late to be considered. After due consideration and investigation' I feel justified in making this recommendation, that doctors and specialists be engaged for four days instead of three. T lis would' make it possible to handle at least one-third more entries or about 300 babies, which could be done with an additional expense of about $75.00. At least 75 per cent of our entries in this department come from Lincoln and within fifty miles. The more interest we car create within this territory the more times the turnstiles will click. So, looking at it from a selfish viewpoint I feel it would be a safe proposition. There were 221 babies entered and. given the most thorough ex - amination by a corps of specialists and nurses. The score card system was used and a copy of he score card was presented to the mothers for future reference.- Alter the examination of each child was com - pleted the mother was ac vised by the doctor on the minor defects of her child, if any, and the methods to pursue to improve the condition of her child. This department is divided into classes of city babies, town' babies, and rural babies. Each baby is carefully examined for contagious diseases before being brought into the show. A Defective Clinic vras held on Thursday of the Fair at which time Twenty-five defective children were brought by their parents for examination by physicians ; and to secure advice for their improvement. The Kindernook is a play ground operated near the Woman's Building by the Camp Fire girls. A great many mothers avail them- </seg>
            <seg id="p034">Report ok Nebraska State Board of Agriculture selves of the opportunity to leave their little tots for a short period. This plan is very satisfactory both to mothers and children.' Emergency Hospital The Emergency Hospital is another department that gave real service and was appreciated by many. This department is located in the Woman's Building in charge of physicians and nurses. Nearly one thousand minor cases were cared for during the Pair. In spite of the immense crowd at the Fair there were no fatal accidents and only one or two major injuries. The second floor of the Woman's Building is fully equipped with baby beds where tired mothers may leave their babies in charge of competent nurses. Play Ground The Play Ground is located just south of the Woman's building and was one of the busy places of the grounds. This play ground equipment was added to the many other conveniences of the Woman's Building department this year at a cost to the Association of $731.35 or one-half of the wholesale price of the equipment. During the five days in operation it served 5,288 children with but one minor accident. Manufacturers The manufacturers, largely from Omaha and Lincoln, but also representing pretty well the United States, filled the two buildings as usual. Most of the exhibits shown were machines for the homfi and household; furnaces, oil burners, shirts, shoes, stoves, vacuum sweepers, school equipment, caskets, plumbing fixtures, many foods, cooking utensils, toilet articles, etc. Each building was crowded to its utmost capacity. The State Highway Department had a fine display for the first time showing the amount of good roads constructed and under construction and also showing how these roads were built.' Farm Machinery Everything now days, is done by machinery, even to milking the cows and oiling pigs. Every machine manufactured for the use of the farmer or even the folks in cities were on exhibition at the 1926 Nebraska State Fair. The machinery exhibit covered acres of ground. Manufacturers realize the importance of exhibiting at the State Fairs. Small country dealers do not find it profitable to carry in stock large machines such as tractor, elevators, threshers, silo fillers and many other of the more expensive pieces, so they line up their cus - tomers for the State Fair where they can see all kinds and watch the demonstrations. Many sales are made directly and indirectly from the State Fair exhibits. The exhibit was the largest in the history of the Fair. </seg>
            <seg id="p035">Report of Nebraska State Boabd of Agbi&lt;?ultube Irrigation plants for individual farms attracted a great deal of attention. It would be impossible to try to report the farm machinery division in detail, but after^ looking over the wonderful exhibit one is convinced that almost every kind of work that the farmer used to do in a laborious way can now be done by machinery. Horses A study of the autos, nito trucks, and tractors shows why the horse is not as popular as he once was. Much of the work is now done by gasoline. The nunber of horses were not there but there were some high class individuals on exhibition. Our horse show would increase quite materially if we had suitable barns and exhibit ring. The International Stock Yards exhibited their champion eight horse team and was one of the outstanding exhibits on the ground. They came to us without any cost and was appreciated by all that had the opportunity to see them hitched. Mules Like the draft horse, this mule has been dealt a blow by the power machinery which is taking his place in the world of toll, but the mule is still with us; while not so numerous he is a better mule than during the olden days. The mule team on exhibition this year testified to that fact. " . S letlaml Ponies ■ ■ The Thompson Pony Farm of Dorchester which has had exhibits of ponies at the Nebraska State Pair for twenty years was here again with eighty-two head. Several other breeders were there making competition in the exhibit riAg very close and interesting. There were more than one hundred head in all. The Pony Ride did its usual business; during one day two thousand four hundred seventy-one rides were taken by the litt e folks at ten cents each. Cattle The cattle exhibit in po nt of numbers was equal to any previous year and in quality it was pronounced better by the superintendents in charge. Approximately 5:00 head of Hfeef cattle were exhibited by forty-four individual exhibitors. The major, portion were Nebraska exhibitors but there were herds from KansasJ Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Texas, Missouri and Indiana. In the dairy class therj were 298 head shown, by twenty-seven individual exhibitors. The Nebraska br.eede'rs found themselves up against strong competition with herds from Louisiana, Missouri, Illi - nois, in fact the best show cattle from morje .than a dozen western and middle western states contested for awards at the 1926 State Fair. </seg>
            <seg id="p036">Rbpokt of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Hogs The swine show was the largest in the history of the Fair- the pens contained 1.700 head, there were approximately 350 exhibitors. Every available pen was filled and could not have accommodated any more. The quality was extremely good. Eighty-five per cent of the exhibitors were from Nebraska, the others came from Iowa, Missouri Kansas, South Dakota, Minnesota, and : Colorado. A feature hog was a 94 0 pound yearling. There were 433 Duroc Jerseys, 404 head of Poland Chinas, 279 head of Spotted Poland Chinas. 156 head of Hamp - shires and 295 Chester Whites. Sheep and Goats The number of sheep exhibited this year did not come up to last year, the quality however was better. For the first time in the history of the Fair the Corridale breed was exhibited. The goats seem to be gaining in favor and are winning a place in the live stock division. Poultry The Poultry Show this year was the best in the history of the Fair. Every nook and corner of the Poultry Building was crowded with birds, many of them winners at other big poultry shows. There were 2 50 pen entries this year compared with 144 last year the single entries were less than last year. Breeders consider pen entries better representatives of the quality of the flock. Almost every breed of poultry was on exhibition; various breeds of ducks, geese, turkeys and a few pet rabbits. This year for the first time we put on an egg show and demon - strated the methods of packing and grading, this created a great deal of interest. Fish and Game The State Department of Fish and Game under the supervision ol the Department of Agriculture, had their usual good exhibit with Superintendent W. J. O'Brien of the Gretna Hatcheries in charge All specimens of fish found in Nebraska waters were on exhibition A tank of pearl fish was a new attraction. A seventy-two pound Miss - issippi catfish was the heavy-weight of the show. Automobile Building and Show- In the spring of 1925 a contract was made with the Automobile. Auditorium Association of Lincoln to erect an automobile exhibition bunding 87x200 feet in length. The contract reads that the Auto - mobile Auditorium Association is to have full control of the buflding for ten years, then to revert to the State Fair or state. After exhibit - ing at the 1925 State Fair we found that it was not large enough to accommodate the growing exhibit of cars, so we contracted with the same company for an addition to the building running the entire </seg>

There were approximately five thousand people that camped for the week. When the Fair was over and the time came to leave fbr home they were loath to leave and they seemed to feel that the Fair had been altogether too short a period I feel the most of them would have been glad 1 to stay another week. The new bridge and the two new toilets added a great deal to the convenience as well as the) several acres of camping ground. One hundred sixty of the trees set out last year died on account of the hot ,wind, they were replaced this fall and seem to be doing well Tpredict that we will have ten thousand people camping with us within the next five years. The Horse and Automobile Races ' | The horse racing card was an exceptional one and the weather was perfect throughout the entire week for'the races. One of the best field of horses that ever contested on the Nebraska Fair grounds took part, in the race program and the plan of every heat a race Pleased the people. On Thursday, "Red Hern." owned at Wlnfield, Kansas, equalled the track record when he paced the mile in 2:07y 4 . Auto races were held Monday and again Friday.

Our Carnival Company may not have been Quite up to last year in appearance but they gave us a very clean entertainment. It seemed however, that it was impossible for them to get the money. The 1925 Midway brought us $6,879 25, the 192G Midway with an Increased attendance, $6,236.90, or a shortage compared with 1925 of $642.90. The Pair on Wheels On Thursday, promptly at 1:00 P. M., the big Nebraska State Fair in motion passed before the Grandstand headed "by Governor McMullen and his cabinet and followed by the members of the Board of Managers of the State Fair. Every department of the State Fair that could be represented in a parade passed before the grandstand. The one outstanding fea - ture was the great herd of baby beeves which had been exhibited by the Boys' and Girls' Clubs and in dress suits for the grand review. The parade was divided into units; Club Work in all its activities, old soldiers and war veterans of all the different wars, drum corps, stock A by the exhibitors, floats representing the different departments, seven bands, machinery and many other minor exhibits and attractions. It is hard to please everyone but this one feature of the Fair all were interested in and it can be made larger and greater and should be. Music The success of the free entertainment of any Fair depends upon the music possibly more than any other one item. The Board of Managers are very particular about the class of music they engage as well as the number. This year the patrons of the Fair were enter - tained by the following bands: Thaviu of Chicago, a band of wonderful artists assisted by a strong chorus of opera singers; the Elk's band of thirty pieces — everyone playing their best; Dan DesDunes Colored Band seems to be one of the fixtures at the Nebraska State Fair; the Broken Bow Band, one of the leading amateur bands of Nebraska; and on Thursday and Friday, the Chicago Northwestern Railroad Band of Chicago, a fine musical organization, was a special guest of the Fair and rendered several splendid concerts. A band of thirty pieces from the Beatrice State Institution was with us all week, playing in the Agricultural Hall, also a band from the Kearney State Institution favored us with some fine music for two days. All the bands took a part in the parade. Last but not least the Thomas Sax-o-tette which is one of the outstanding organizations in thin country. All our music was high class, the kind that would inspire one to higher realms of citizenship. Free Acts ■ We heard more favorable comments on the vaudeville acts this year than ever before. In fact, they are talking about them yet. </seg>
            <seg id="p039">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture It is not always what you take in at the gates that make Fairs a success but. what is taken' out at the gates. It is those things that . they take home to inspire others that builds for the future and it was not necessary : to&lt; apologize for our free act entertainment this year. The Sunday Program | In spite of the hard rain Saturday" night and a drizzling rain on Sunday morning which lasted until afternoon the large Sunday crowd leads to the positive conclusion that the Sunday .program is probably a necessary part of a well balanced Fair. The Sunday pro - gram was a pleasing and appropriate one; starting with a Sacred Concert rendered" by, Thaviu's Band and chorus in the Auditorium at 2:00 P. M. The building was crowded to capacity and the numbers were enthusiastically received. Thavlu was followed- by the Oberlies Bible Class, the subject for discussion was, "The Able Bodied Voters Who Won't." !.! ! Sunday' evening. Thavlu and his company assisted by a chorus from the city of Lincoln, rendered "The Messiah," before an audience that nearly filled the Grandstand. During an intermission community, singing was lead by Mr. L. C. Oberlies. Bishop Irwin P. Johnson of the diocese. of Colorado of the Episcopal Church delivered an address. The entire Sunday program was appropriate for the Sabbath day and was one that the folks of Nebraska have the opportunity to listen to only on rare occasions. In Conclusion In conclusion it appears that the '1926 State Fair was a big success. Satisfied customers have made all big business and it will apply to State Fairs. If any of the patrons of the Fair were dissatisfied I failed -to hear of it. Any big institution that is building for the future must have satisfied patrons in the past. While we did not take in ' as much money as we would liked to have done, we gave out lots that will bear fruit for the future, and I feel that the Nebraska State Fair will grow in spite of partial crop failures. Patrons begin to realize that a trip to the State Fair is a good Investment and they can get more for their money invested than most any where they can attend. ■ In closing I want to thank all the members and the superin - tendents that gave such loyal help, the Board of Managers for their wise council, the superintendent of grounds and the office force for their many long days of service and 'the interest taken in making the Nebraska State Fair the success that it was. </seg>

WEAVER: I want to report that we find no statutory provisions against the nomination of more than one or of.' two mem - bers from each county. The statute authorizes the Board to make said nomination, and together with the By-Laws of the constitution relates to a nomination from each Congressional district. There is no pro - vision in the statutes or in the Constitution and By-Laws providing in relation to nominations from each county. Both divisions are made as to the number from each Congressional District. (Mr. Weaver then read the law starting as follows: "Statute passed in 1879, Chapter I on Agriculture." Then he also read a statutory provision. Section 2, and Section 3, Page 29 of the Premium List Book giving the law relating to the State Board of Agriculture and reading Section 6.) There is no provision made indicating nominations by counties. MR. WEAVER: Therefore, I move that the nominations in the. Second district be closed unless there are other nominations that it is desired to present. PRESIDENT PURCELL: I think perhaps there has been a mis - apprehension arise in regard to this question due to the provision that no more than one member of the Board of Managers could be present from one county.

Present agricultural depression is largely due to high prices— maintained at war level— paid to protected industries for their products.

The transportation facilities in the great middle west are inadequate and rates are high. Western farmers and manufacturers are at a great disadvantage in offering their .product at sea-board markets. THEREFORE: We favor the Immediate and energetic development of the Missouri River and other inland waterways! that the farmers and manufacturers of this great interior region shall, have the benefit of lower transportation. ■ MR.

Resolution No. 3 pertaining to Good Roads, etc., was read.) . Good Roads are no longer a luxury but a necessity which all classes enjoy. However, in an agricultural state like Nebraska prac - tically all taxes, in the final analysis, are paid by the farmer. Under the present depressed condition of agriculture the present burden of </seg>
            <seg id="p050">Rktobt ok Nki.haska State Board ok Agriculturb taxation is all the termer ran well bear.

There shall hereafter be held at the county seat of each county, under the super - vision and direction of the county superintendent, and county board on or before the first" day o[ May of each year, an exhibit of school work done in each school district of said county during the current school year. The nature and character of said exhibit shall be de - termined by the county superintendent. Said exhibit shall be open to the public for not less than one nor more than -three days. The county, superintendent shall annually offer and award premiums intend - ed to stimulate the interest in school affairs. A list of premiums to be . awarded shall be published in the various county papers, as other .school news at least sixty days before' the date or dates fixed for said exhibit. Each year the county board shall i make arrangements to have said county school exhibit taken to the county fair of said county, if there be one, and to the Nebraska State Fair at Lincoln. (1919 p. 1016.) 6544. PROVISION FOR PAYMENT OF EXPENSE. To defray the expenses incident to assembling and carrying on' of said annual county school exhibit a sum equal to not less than two and one-half cents nor more than five cents for every pupil of school age shall upon the written request of the teachers of at least one-half of the schools for said county be set aside each year from the general fund of said county by the county board. Said fund shall be known as " county school exhibit fund." It shall be the duty .of the county board to pay all bills incurred or approved by the county superin - tendent of said county for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this act, not exceeding the sum set aside for such purposes. Said board may in its discretion include said items of expense incident to said exhibit in its annual estimate and levy a tax for the payment thereof, together with other necessary taxes for the current year.

We now have a resolution that has been handed in by members of the Board from Knox County at Bloointleld. It is in regard to the S'cliool Tax Levy for educational work! of County Schools in , County and State Fairs. They say that under the existing law that Ihe sum that they are able to raise is urisufflcient for their work. They have had a measure introduced at the present session of the Legislature. We are unable to tell you just what the title is or just who had It. They think it will be- passed. They ask that this resolu - tion be brought before the members of this- Board in order that you </seg>
            <seg id="p052">Rkport of Nebraska State Board qi/agriculture may understand this measure. I think in order that you understand this measure it will be necessary to incorporate part of the present law so that they will not be misunderstood. Then we could read the resolution in the light of the present law. I find that men from a good many counties knew nothing tbout this law and in a good many of the counties few men are aware of it. It makes a provision for con - siderable money that should be obtained and it is very easy to operate In Thayer County and in numerouß other counties we have been following the law since it has been in effect and we have been getting very satisfactory results. Is there any questions about this or any members wish to ask about the law, I will be glad to answer them before we vote on this resolution. PRESIDENT PURCELL: I see here that I recognized that as a bill that I introduced in the Legislature some years ago It was passed so I didn't know at nrst that it was the one that was up for discussion at this time. MR. WEAVER, of Richardson County: I think we should have some explanation on this before we attempt to take any action here and it provides for any increase in taxation. I would like to have an opinion of the gentleman from Custer County who introduced this bill. PRESIDENT PURCELL: I introduced the bill as I recall it some years ago in the Legislature. The idea of this was to cover a dual purpose, first to interest the school people and parents and patrons of the County in school exhibits, that is, to establish exhibits and that was to be accomplished by placing the exhibit at the County Superintendent's office. That comes in the early part of the year We have followed it for many years in Custer County and in other parts of the State, I think with very good success. Secondly it was concluded that as the County Pairs come in the Pall, right as the school season opens, further plan permits a preparation during the school year. When the County Fairs come just as the school opens there is no way to get preparations for these exhibits if it is not done during the preceding school year. This has served as a medium for preparing exhibits that can later come on down to the State Fair I don't know as I have anything more to say at this time about it' What merit there is to the proposed increase I do not just know I am not familiar enough with the working of this to give an opinion on that at the present moment. MR. MITCHELL. Resuming: Well, I would just like to explain to the membership how it is operated with us. We have been using it. I don't remember just when it was introduced or brought forth but we have been using it ever since it was made a law We get out the exhibits and place them with . our County Superintendents The County Superintendent, of course, co-operates with the Department </seg>
            <seg id="p053">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture down here and they get out the list of what! they can use in our County and then place with the State Fair. That list is made out and printed and put in the hands of the schools all over the county long before the printed list of the State Fair premiums comes out, so that they have it to work on, and they get their ( exhibits ready early. Then they assemble them there and put on their own displays in the Court House as provided by law. From there they bring it down to the County Fair and show it; then the principal part is takeu from there down to Lincoln. By following ,that plan we have won first, prize in the educaional exhibits year after year at the State Fair, for seven years in succession. So it is worked very well that way. . . . In this way we get a special appropriation. This matter is brought up before the County Commissioners. They give us the five ceitf limit. I don't know wh&lt; ther that .Is just the regular procedure . in some counties or not, but M r e have been getting the 5 per cent and it has brought us between $20). 00 and $300.00: .We pay the expenses down here and we pay the : &gt;remiums. • Our 'premiums run in that educational exhibit to the sun of $2500.00, so you see we are out cm that about flf ty-flf ty. It is. optional with .the commissioners and they- can allow under the law in amount that makes us able to do this. I Ip is said to the people that are . asking for this that if they capAfiave ten per cent they will be able to get a fund that would be commensurate for this ttsk and they could carry It out. You skee that $250.00 to $300.00 U at we get is paidj right out in premiums. /It doesn't take care of any expense or keep a Superintendent to bring the exhibit, or to have the exhibit taken back, but all of that comes out of other funds. . . MR. VON SEGGREN, of Wayne County: Mr. Mitchell has ex - plained this pretty thoroughly. In our County we have 5300 children and this amounts to $256.00. We have talked this over with Pro - fessor Frisbie and he don't find any better way to j get at this and create a fund that will be ample. Even it is not very much, perhaps $500.00. MR. WIDLE, of Genoa: In our County we have used that law. I have been on the Board all of these years and we have never been asked to appropriate the full appropriation that we could have given the County Superintendent. We have had three 'County Superin - tendents in that time, so it is not a matter of| the individual Super - intendent being rather strong on expenses, I think that there is an ample provision as it stands! I would not like to go on record as having put on any additional authority or having educated anything that brings about an increase in taxation unnecessarily.

So in order to complete as much of the business this afternoon as possible for this reason we will ask if it is possible to take up a matter of business that appears on the printed program for tomorrow. Espe - cially, as we have a number of the Directors and Delegates from County Fairs who are also delegates for this meeting of the State Board of Agriculture who are also members of the present House and Senate which tomorrow have important joint sessions, they have requested that we expedite the business of tomorrow morning as much as pos - sible. The election of officers ordinarily would come up between ten and twelve o'clock and may be pushed ahead tomorrow morning so these men may attend the joint session of the House and Senate, which lias been called some days ago for the purpose of a confirmation of appointees of the Governor. These members of the House and Senate are most of them anxious 10 be with us at the important business of thir session and at the same time find it almost nceessary to be there. I am making this explanation preliminary to asking if we can take up now some of the reports on the Revision of the Premium List. MR. A. W. LAMB: In regard to the report on Revision, we do not have the entire report ready, but the Agricultural reporr r ls rrady. That has been prepared by Mr. Grau and is quite lengthy. So if he would give this it may save some time and we will have that much out of the road tomorrow morning, and the balance of the report then will take perhaps but a few moments. MR. GRAU, of Bennington: Mr. Chairman and fellow members, and Directors of the County Fair Association: I have re-written CLASS F entirely on the strength^of recommendation made by sev - eral Fair bodies throughout the State, also from information given at the last State Fair. </seg>
            <seg id="p055">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture ■ Mr. Chairman, the first that '.'. want to read will be some resolu- " tlons which strengthen as a position I have taken 1 in making this revision. Resolved, that we, the Great "8" N. E. Nebraska Pair Circuit, favor a state-wide classification ot Class F Agricultural Products, for the 1927 State Fair Premium List and absorb the $ 1,377. 75 now offered for irrigated products in a state-wide classification. The above resolution was c arried unanimously at the annual meeting of Circuit held at Oakland,- Nebraska, OctbDer 14, 1926. E. M. BAUMANN, . ' Acting Secretary, West Point, Nebr. Now if you will get your pri-mlum list you ViiU note for several years in referring to Class F (115) — (Referring to the page in tie 1926 Premimr List.) You will notice there that t le total offering of purses has been $0,089.00. This was divided in two purses, one for dry land, $1,711.25, and irrigated, ,$1,377.75. There has been almost an equal division of the entire purse - for an area covering irrigated classification and not in direct comparison with the dry land classification. In other words, two years ago one county had an opportunity of taking the greater portion of this $1,377.75, where a great number of dry-land counties only got $1,711.25. Last year two counties took 72 per cent, or, about $999.00 or so of the entire purse that [was taken only by .two counties. That is why thesj resolutions have been passed show - ing an inequality of this division of the money. • When it was recommended several years ago that this classifica - tion that has been prevailing be made, the idea was that it was not fair for irrigated products to be allowed to compete against dry-land products. That seemed to be a 'fair proposition at that time, but since then conditions have changed. It was figured to have dry-land products compete only against dry-land products, but already certain conditions have so since changed that there are now numerous places where irrigated products go' right along with dry land products in the. same county so the dry-land products must compete against irri - gated products anyway. So much irrigation by wells has contributed to bring this about and under the rules that designate as irrigated counties only those that have 10,000 acres, it throws the two classes together in many counties. There was a piece. in the Nebraska Farmer a month or so ago referring to the many thousands of acres that are irrigated by wells but which wo aid still be classed; as dry-land in this matter and those products come in competition with dry-land products and with the. other irrigated products. So in making this revision, we have interplaced one classification instead of the division. ■ Now I also wish to present a resolution from Waterloo: </seg>
            <seg id="p056">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agricultube Waterloo, Nebraska, December 4, 1926 To Whom It May Concern: At the annual meeting of the Douglas County Agricultural So - ciety, held at Waterloo, Nebraska, on this day, the following resolu - tion was offered by Chas. Grau of Bennlngton, Nebraska, and sec - onded by Otto Pfeiffer of Elkhorn, Nebraska: WHEREAS, there has been a separate classification for irrigated agricultural products and an equal amount of money offered in Class F State Fair premium list, for several years; and WHEREAS, after a fair trial it has been shown that too much premium money is won by one or two Counties in comparison with all the rest of the Counties in the State; THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Douglas County Agri - cultural Society, that we consider this unequal distribution of premium money an injustice to the great number of dry-land exhibitors and we respectfully recommend to the State Fair Revision Committee that a state-wide classification be adopted, in lieu of the present system - and that the money now offered for irrigated products be absorbed in the proposed classification. The resolution was unanimously approved and adopted. Respectfully, DOUGLAS COUNTY AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY, By Harlan G. Cog, Secretary. Now I have one or two important resolutions from Cheyenne County. There they adopted a resolution calling attention to the classifications as being too small on wheat, so I want to present the resolution from Cheyenne County: RESOLUTION NO. 1 WHEREAS, Cheyenne County and Western Nebraska depend largely on wheat for their income and think of it as their major crop, and WHEREAS, Nebraska ranks fifth in wheat production of the Imted States, and Western Nebraska produces the major portion of this wheat, and WHEREAS. The Nebraska State Fair Premium List for 1926 pro - wdes for only twelve possible threshed wheat prizes/the total cash value of which is but $15.00 compared with $667.00 for corn prizes in the western district and $333.50 in corn prizes in the eastern district, and WHEREAS, since all wheat in Nebraska in 1924 was valued at $60,680,000, and all corn the same year at $184,985,000 the total prizes offered on wheat are not at all in proportion to those offered on corn in any district, either in value of first prizes, nor in the .lumber or placings that can be made under any exhibit number therefore, </seg>
            <seg id="p057">Report of Nebraska State Board of (agriculture - ' ' ■ ■ I ■ I- ■ BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cheyenne County Farm Bureau Board that the State Fair Board and' its Premium List Committee, be re - spectfully requested to increase the vaiue of prizes offered on threshed wheat by increasing the value of firsts to tie samj} as for the best corn and running prizes out to at least the fifth place, with propor tionate value to corn for each priz;. I also have a resolution No. 2 from Chejenne Coanty: RESOLUTION NO. 2 WHEREAS, corn prizes as offered in the 1926 Nebraska State Fair Premium List, are only offered in two I districts into which the State of Nebraska has been divided, namely, the 'eastern and the western, and formerly the State was divided into three districts, namely, the eastern, central and the western, and J WHEREAS, corn yields itself to local adaptation so readily mak - ing it impossible for the western jnd of the western district, due to difference in elevation, and. climate conditions, to compete and show against the eastern end of the same district, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cheyenne Ccunty F^rm Bureau Board respectfully, request the State Fair Board, through their Premium List Committee, to again' divide the state into three districts, as in former years, to the end that the western district exhibitors of corn may compete more fairly one against the oth'er. These resolutions were submitted to and passed unanimously by the Cheyenne County Farm Bureau Board in meeting assembled. Then there is another resolution that has be m adopted along similar lines from Kimball County, and si »ned by the members of that Board. (Mr. Grau presents resolutioi from Kimball Ciinty): RESOLUTION NO. k WHEREAS, Kimball County and Western Nebraska depend largely on wheat for their income and think of \t as their major crop, and WHEREAS, Nebraska ranks fifth in wheat production of the United States, and Western Nebraska produces the major portion of the wheat, and . j -I i , WHEREAS, The Nebraska State Fail Premium List for 1926 provided for only twelve possible threshed wheat prizes, the total cash' ( value of which is but $15.00 compared to $667.00 for corn prizes in the Western District aud $333.50 in corn prizes in the Eastern District, WHEREAS, Since all wheat in Nebraska in 1924 was valued at $69,680,000 and all corn the same year at $184,985,000, the total prizes offered on wheat are not at all in proportion to those offered </seg>

Our report crosses out that entirely, in the revision we submit. Now on Lot 1 — • ! -.. THRESHED GRAINS, LEGUMES AND OTHER LARGE SEED The amount ottered is $346.00 as the first prize. That, reads for red winter wheat. Ist 2nd 3rd 4th sth . 6th 7th Bth $5.00 . $4.50 $4.00 $3.50 $3.00 $2.50 $2.00 $1.00 Now on 1602 when we come to Red Spring it reads: Ist 2nd 3rd 4th sth 6th' 7th Bth $5.00 $4.50. $4.00 $3.50 $3.00 $2.00, $1.0.0 $.50 That makes a total of $23.50, just $1.00 less. Now" on 1603, Durham or Macaroni it will have a total of $20.50 and read, $5.00, $4.50, $4.00, $3.00, $2.00, $1.50, 75c, 50c. Then Red Winter runs $3.00, $2.50, $2.00, $1 50, $1.00, 75c, 50c. RYE— The Spring Rye is less important and that is placed at, (Sec. 2)— 53.00, $2.00, $1.50, $1.00, 50c. Now down to OATS. The Early White runs the same there, for first, second, third, fourth and fifth. The Early White and the Late White run $3.00, $2.00, $1.50, $1.00 and 50c, making a total of $8.00. Then on the Red and Yellow it is the same. Then on the Black, it is the same. Then Hulless is the same this time. : Taking BARLEY. That makes' a total of $$.00 at $3.00, $2.00, : $1.50, $1.00 and 50c. FLAX is placed at the same rate as early wheat and late wheat and has a total of $8.00.

Sorgo; the Amber Red and the Amber Black) the Orange remain the same and Sumac carries $2.00, $1.50, $1.00, .75c and 50c, and biat comes on down to the Kaffir. The same applies for Feterita. The same scale applies to Shallu, $2.00, $1.50, $1.00, 75c and 50c. Now that brings us down to Red ar d Whit6 Milo. That carrie3 a total of $5.75.1 Now on Soy Beans, there is the Back Soy Bean, and there is a new size or kind of Black Eyed Soy Bean. |On that is fixed so now we carry it at $3.00, $2.00, $1.50 and 50c. That makes a total of $8.00. You simply add the fifth premium there. </seg>
            <seg id="p060">Rkport of Nebbaska State Board of Agriculture You understand this is done in order to meet the abolishing of he irrigated class or the consolidation of it with the dry-land so that the total premiums will be practically the same; There will be very little amount of difference in the total amount of money that is offered in these classes. Sunflower seed is listed for both Black and White. Now in the items for collection of grains must be separate from the above. There we have $10.00, $8.00 $6 00 and $4.00. making a $28.00 total, or making a total of $344.00 for ihat lot. LOT 2— THRESHED GRASS SEEDS. ONE-FOURTH BUSHEL AND MUST BE CLEANED.

Collection of sheaves must be separate from above by a County are arranged that way so as to get that in a more artistic shape for display. When it comes to Buckwheat, we drop them to five J. just men - tioned the collection of sheaves and might remark that they go now at $10.00, $8.00, $6.00, and $4.00, adding a $4.00 clan 'and making a total of $28.00. We have been asked to add here the matter of a sheaf of flax. But the sheaf of flax is not included in this list because the Western Counties would be only available for that so we just met that by having $5.75 added to the total sum at the end </seg>
            <seg id="p061">■ - . .' ■ I Repobt of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture - . Alfalfa Sheaves. Here is a point where there will possibly be some objections. Heretofore alfalfa has been under the heading of first cutting, second cutting and third cutting. From my experience it seemed to me there was nothing so udfair above these different cuttings but it isn't hardly possible for the 1 judges' to distinguish be- , tween the first cutting, second cutting, and.' third cutting. A compe - tent exhibitor can take any cutting and make the 'sheaves, so I have cut out all cuttings and just make It apply] to sheaves of alfalfa and we don't care what cutting they get it from, just | so it is one sheaf of. alfalfa, then another sheaf, showing the seed and head. That is all the change there is in the alfalfa class. (1686). Now the Clover. We take the Sweet White, and the Sweet Yellow, the Red, the White and the Alsike and leave them on a new classi - fication of $2.00, $1.50, $1.00, 75c and 50c.| The grasses, blue, Billion Dollar, and on down including Red Top, Sudan, Japanese or Million Dollar, and will all carry the same amount of money, $2.00, $1.50. $1.00, 75c and on to 50c.

The collection of tame grasses we separate from the other grasses. They carry tne same amount of money, $10.00, $8.00, $6,00, and $4.00 'added, all of which totals $28.00.

I The proposition here is to cut out the stalk display on Dent Corn, though it has had a place in the premium 1 st. There is hardly a demand for it only on the very lowest money, so low it hardly makes it worth bothering with. The amount now offered is $101.25. . SORGO. The Amber Black, the Amber Red anjl Orange, and Sumac. The old list did not contain Sumac. There is where we get an addition. Now as I indicated before, the miscellaneous has been pushed over to the last of the list in its proper place. In the present list it is placed somewhat in the middle, which is not a gpod place, so we put it over in the last classification where it should have always gone in the list classification. ■ • ' , ■ i </seg>

Because in the Central District we could not compete with the extreme Western on stalk display so we have classified the Yellow Dent, the White Dent and other Dent than above and gave them all a scale classified as $2.50, $2.00, $1.50, $1.00 and 50c. LOT 10--CORN, GROWTH OF 1927, CENTRAL DISTRICT Amount offered in this lot, $307.00, the same as is offered for the Eastern Division. This lot is for corn growers in Central District. (Refer to map). Samples are to contain 10 ears. We use practically the same classification as for the Eastern Division only we start with Yellow Corn over 8 inches Instead of over 9 inches. The same on the White Corn, over 8 inches instead of over 9 inches. The Yellow under 8 inches for the Medium Early and the White under 8 Inches for the Medium Early, the Yellow 90 day and the White 90 day all carry $5.00, $4.50, $4.00, $3.00, $2.00 and $1.00. The White Cap Yellow type, other than White or Yellow, over 8 inches; other than White or Yellow, 90 days, carry $3.50, $3.00, $2.50, $2.00 and $1.00, and the Flour Corn, any color, $2.50, $2.00, $1.50, $1.00 and 50c' </seg>
            <seg id="p065">. Report of Nebraska State Board of Aoriculturb The only distinction now made between the Eastern, Central, and Western is that we took Into consideration the geographical dis - tinction. We started out with a scale of seven Inches or over but wound up with the scale of eight inches for central and nine inches or over for Eastern. These are all for growth of 1927 corn. ■ LOT 11— CORN, FOR GROWTH OF 1927. This is for the Western District.- It has the same amount offered in this Lot, $307.00. You can refer to the map and see where the growers for this District are. Sample is to contain ten ears. As I said we started out with the seven Inch over, and the seven inch under, and carry practically the same scale of flgxires for each class, with the same total for the class. For the best and largest collection of ten ears by County the rules are virtually the same. The only part of it that is cut out from the former rules is the irrigated part of the rules and that is the provisions that are related to Irrigated, products. In the items relating to money paid on the certain basis, we had to cut part of that out because the State is now divided in only three classes, Eastern District, Central District, and Western District and that cuts out the irrigated! district and divides the money up, • Eastern District, 30c per point scored; Central District, 35c per point scored; Western District, 40c per point scored. I might call your attention to the fact that the rules oh collective club exhibits provide that nothing shall prevent an individual exhibitor from having his exhibit scored and receiving equal consideration for the score made and he shall receive the same amount of money as under agricultural societies award under rules governing, but no indiv - idual exhibits will be permitted when they collect an exhibit if 'shown in the name of a County. Now turn to the score cards. The score cards of Nebraska State Fair County Collective Exhibit of any certain county. .In the center of the old score card provided for "Extra Samples on Exhibit Competing For Premiums." This" was a sort of an unfair advantage to certain counties and gave them a chance to score more points than perhaps they should have had because they could carry extra samples. I can see disadvantages of that because certain local counties like Lancaster can carry an enormous amount! of extra samples and they would be benefltted while the others would not be benefitted. Now we come to a certain number of parts for the owing to proposed classes and what varieties shall be counted in each class, and the possible number of points assigned. Now we keep the same final score. We started in with a limitation on Dent Corn,- beginning at 30c for the Yellow Large, 25c to the White, 25c to the White Medium, </seg>

KEEDLE: I notice Kohlrabi is listed not m the Vegetable classes, but m the miscellaneous field or garden crops. MR.. GRAU: Well, I didn't intend to put that m the vegetables because there are so many other things that are like Kohlrabi that are of minor importance and are found anyway m the County Collective Exhibits. We can't put m all of the minor Agriculture products m separate classifications because there are too many or them. So we took many of those minor products and left them j out, but it was considered that Kohlrabi should be' m.. It can go m if Mr. Keedle wishes to have it m. I have no objection to placing it m. The only reasons that we considered leaving it out were that there were so many of them. Also we had to figure pretty close and consider many things m re-figuririg the money on the entire classifications where we cut out the different classes, we absorbed that money m the other classes, when we got through after miking a number of changes back and forth to adjust, we found that the total figures would not amount to over $15.00 increase. Now any changes that are made m addition to these will add to the gqand total. Now. the aim of the Revision Committee has not been so much a less total amount of money as= a total that we had tried to view along the line of protecting the Association just as well as the exhibitors. MR. KEEDLE: Mr. Chairman, I don't see very much difference that will' be accomplished by adding the ' Kohlrabis and letting it be listed at $1.50, $1.00, 75c, 50c and 25c. After talking with several men m my part of the State who are interested m this, we will main - tain that. Mr. Grau told me that he would have put It m only he didn't consider them of very much importance. That may be. Then he said they got pethy, more than Turnips or Beets. Now .there are a lot of crops m the same condition, but til is one is being grow«n all over the State. Now it is going to make very little difference, just a matter of three or four dollars to put it m the premium list and it is going to satisfy a good many exhibitors.

We will try to hurry things up, but we are not going to neglect anything just so. as to get. through. Now we have the rest of the revision of premium list reports to take up and consider. The greater portion of. this was no doubt taken up and disposed of yesterday, but now we. come to the matter of completing it. I think the Poultry Department and possibly one or two other departments have something to be taken care of in the Premium Revision list. Elliott Davis of Hastings, a member of the Committee has a Poultry Revision list with him and it is not yet quite completed. We will hear from Mr. Lamb on the balance of the report. MR. A. W. LAMB, of Boone: The report of the Committee on Revision of the Premium List first brings up the 1 point of malting a change of dates of the List to comply with the year 1927. We have cut out a clause in the paragraph under "Payment of Premiums,'" where it says, "Exhibit does not in their opinion deserve the full premium." Now the ne&gt;!t thing pertains to Class "A" on Horses, on page 50. We had a request from the Shetland Pony Breeders to make increases there. But we do not increase the amount of money. Now over on page 68 under Pure Bred Steers, Spayed or Martin Heifers, we eliminate 373, 374, 375, 376, 377, 378^ 379. 380, 381 in Lot 7, Fat Cattle, and substitute, the paragraph presented in our report taking the money say on Junior Yearling at $15.00 for 1st; 2nd, $10.00; 3rdj $7.50; 4th, $5.00; 5th, $2.50; and 6th, $2.00.; On Summer Year - ling it is the same. Now going over to Class D, Sheep and Goats. Under the item of Milch Goats. We add a class of Does two years and under three and we have eliminated entirely premiums on 882, 892, 897 and 904 • ■ ■ v / </seg>

Page 189 in 1926 book. This matter on Boys' and Girls' Club Work conies up to the Premium Revision Committee at the requests of the County Agents. Some of these requests we have adopted, and some in some respects have changed. Now we are recommending some further changes. We have passed on these in the State Fair Committee and think they should be adopted into the Premium List. Take the paragraph on page 189 of the 1926 book: 'Each exhibitor of livestock will be required to show a certificate of ownership before he is allowed to show animals. In Baby Beef classes, ownership on January 15 must have been certified to state club office by March 1st." We recommend that the words, "by March 1st," be struck out. "In other animal classes, ownership on June 1st, must have been certified by July 1st." The words. "July 1st," should be struck out. "In all animal classes, feed record sheets will be required. These blanks will be sent to all entrants to be returned to the State Club Office by August 28th." In Lot 4— (Page 195) Dairy Cattle: It was recommended in the Dairy Cattle Division, Guernsey and Jersey classes, that they be made to read the same as the Holstein class, and made them upon the same scale. As to this request from the agents that we add two classes, 'he Board thought beirt not to add these two classes at the present lime until more certain of a place for housing them and on account el' the additional money. You will find a reference also in the report to the Grade Dairy Cattle. Now in Lot 4— (Page 197) Baby Beeves: We think that should be changed to read as follows: Where it says "that show 20 or more calves," change to "30 or more calves." On item 3599 and item 3600 these two should be struck out. Strike those out there and put them in the class that we recommend in this other place. It is also recommended in the present rules that a $5.00 prize will be given to each other club member showing the Baby. Beeves, lour prizes being given. But it is recommended that we reduce it to |2.00 for all calves not receiving premium money, and $2.00 or more providing they go into the parade. </seg>
            <seg id="p071">Repobt of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture In the Calf Showing Contest, (Page 1'98) it is recommended (hat there be a calf showing contest for Jersey Beeves in another class and only medals given in the amount of free medals.

Lot s— Sheep: ■ ■ ■. . ■ • We recommend there be added sheep "over! one year old." This request is not made a recommendation, we do not approve and do not deem advisable at the present time. Lot 6 — Poultry. There is a requested recommendation made here that we adopt. Lot 9 — Canning. It is recommended that the classes named :.n "3669," the second year Canning Club" Budget be extended ten places, the lowest premium being $3.00. .This was adopted by the Revision Committee and that will make them an. addition of $12.00 there. On page 201 there is a recommendation in relation to five jars of Vegetables and five jars of Fruit. A change is recommended in entry 3692 by changing a word, remove 3694 entirely, make a new entry for 3696, for Sport Dress and put in a 369A, a Sport Dress — Winter. Remove item No. 3697 entirely. On entry.3699 it should be made to read, "Afternoon Dress," striking out the words, "Summer Wear." In|'37ol it should read. "Wearable Garment," 3702 on Patching, should read, "Patching of Wearable Garments." Now before I finish please turn back to page 195, Lot 4 — Cattlo. In 3565 Angus, it is suggested that there be a 6th, 7th and Bth premium. - $124.00 would be offered in this class. Angus and Gallo - way would be offered $8.00 for Ist; $6.00 for 2nd; $5.00 for "3rd; $4.00 for 4th; $3.00 for sth. The Herefords an'd Shorthorns and Red Polls likewise making a limit of $124.00 added. MR. GRAFF, Of Cummings County: I don't want to disorganize the regular program, but I believe it was understood before we ad - journed last evening that we would revise our entire program this morning in order that these members who highly are interested in this organization are also members of the House and' Senate and they must be up there at the State Capitol before eleven o'clock so it seems to me that it would be right and proper to see if this part of the program could be switched so the electors could proceed now and then we could finish up this miscellaneous work after the election. If the Chair will entertain such a motion, I will now make that motion. MR. KEEDLB: I second the motion. </seg>

There I« no objection sustained to Fat Cattle and according to the way it Has been outlined, my objection is to the reducing of the premium money. I don't know whether we can afford more money or not but if we can we should do so. I understand you proposed to reduce the first prize to $15.00. Iowa pays for the same premium $75 00 In FaIr C in ttI , e h P n Ze i S t "" the re " utatl ° n »f being the cheapest Fair in the United States. County Fairs pay as high as $40 00 If you are going to build up a Cattle Show in Nebraska you have got * °^n r .n eaS ° nable Premiums - If jt •» Possible to leave the first prize at $20.00 and the second prize at $15.00 as in the old premium list H seems to me It would be the best thingcto do it. That wouldn't add any great amount to the total of our premiums.. MR. H. J. MCLAUGHLIN: Now, Mr. Chairman, when we come to placing the money in this club, it was thought that instead of having p ure Bred Steers and Grade Steers competing against one T r T 's o PUrP Bred Ste6rS com P etin e agaliwt each other, and he Grade Steers competing against the different breeds so we put in three classes instead of two and in that way we offered $100 00 more money than the year before. In putting this extra grade in it makes three classes instead of two and really gives a hundred dollars more money in putting in the other classes is not in the money so much but to get it better classified. That was the idea. We didn't figure that we could recommend too much of an Increase so we listed il as it was and put it in the $30.00 class. MR. MCCARTHY: That doesn't overcome my objection. We are not offering sufficient money in the Cattle class as a whole. I don't want to make any scrap on it, and I am not going to make any motions c-ither, but I do want to make my position plain. Taking the Cattle department as a whole we don't offer as much money in comparison a- other Fairs offer. It is a fact that showmen of Nebraska have aken cattle and made the circuit of other Fairs rather than show them in Nebraska and we can't build a Cattle Show in our State Fair on that basis. MR. WIDLE: So far as our being the lowest in the entire circuit we have taken that matter into consideration and I think you will find that Kansas paid $30.00 in the entire class and we are not by any means the lowest in the circuit. </seg>
            <seg id="p075">Report or Nebraska State Board of Agriculture MR. GRAFF: I haven't paid much attention to the Revision that this Committee has made. I asked one member of the Committee on the Revfsion of Premium Lists whether or not any reductions are being proposed by this committee on Breed Cattle. He Informed me that there was not. Now I know men that is the whole story about a few dollars that the Nebraska Fair pays for JLivestock in prizes ■ compared with other Fairs, but having the many; years of experience that 1 have had and being a booster for the Livestock end of it. on this Board, and especially the Breeding Livestock I have contended all along that every possible dollar that the Board can put into the breeding of livestock in this Fair would be a good investment. But this Board has been up against this proposition so many years. While It is true, that Iowa, Minnesota and Illinois can "run rings around us when it comes to paying the prizes, it is also true, out in those States their Legislatures have been laboring to make appropriations fostering this enterprise. The State Board of Agriculture in the past has put In a great deal of their earnings In the necessary improvements to carry on that Fair, consequently they have found that some funds have not been available to put In this department of livestock what they would like, to spend on It. Consequently I don't believe that such stock could be further recognized by this Association, at that time. The fat livestock should be recognized but we are not putting en a Fat Stock Show. There are fat stock shows in the land better than the Nebraska State Fair which doesn't pretend or claim to go very strong on the fat stock show end. I don't know Mr. McCarthy, but what if this is left without a recommendation in order to pay that premium, as this organization has always done, that perhaps he Committee is not very far wrong. MR. PERRY REED, of Hamilton County: I want to say as a member of that Committee that we had a number of cattle breeders before us on different classes asking for increases in their different classes. The idea of the Committee I think is that if we had to add to one class that we were pretty nearly bound to add to some other. On ' account of the financial condition of the Association we thought that we should hew to a straight line. -I PRESIDENT PURCELL: There is really nothing before the House.

TREASURER BANNING: We have generally been paying on the attendance shown on the record sheet, whether it is three days or two days.

Lots of us can't come and go back m three days and I think the delegates should be paid what they are out. The fellows up West must take a day to come down and a day to go back and they should be paid on that basis. Motion seconded. CHAIRMAN PURCELL: There is a motion to amend now. As it stands now the motion of Mr. Keedle is that the delegates be allowed $4.00 a day and Railroad Fare, and that they be paid for three days' time. The amendment is that they be allowed $4.00 a day. Railroad Fare and such time as they would actually spend m coming, and going. MR. KEEDLE: It has been the custom since I have been on this Board and I think before that that we have only been used .to paying $3.00 and Railroad Fare, but our hotel bills have advanced. One year we paid $5.00 and then we reduced it to $4.00. I wouldn't exactly swear that that is exactly true about the history, but I think that is correct as to extra pay for the time coming and the time poing back that motion is quite practical and all right In expense, but to do that I rather think would make quite a heavy pull on the Treasury of this organization. Of course I have no objection because I live right out at Minden and I would he entitled to a little bit more, but I don't know whether we regard it favorably. </seg>

So many of you are interested in promoting movements of this kind and do a great deal toward that development. I had the privilege when I was twenty-five years old of intro - ducing into the Legislature the bill for locating this State Fair at Lincoln. I have always taken some pride in that matter because I regarded Lincoln as the logical place for this institution, with its development of the Capitol here and also with the Agricultural College here. This should be the center of these activities. Now we can only, develop enterprises like this State Fair with the cooperation and with the help of these other institutions with the use of these other facilities. As this organization Is here it should be something definite. It is here to build up a great institution. I want to do all I can to help along that line and this institution wants to do what it can to help Agriculture. The greatest pride you have in this organization is that it has become a great medium for the expression and display of Agriculture and Livestock progress in this State It has acquired over a million dollars worth of property. That is real progress. I assure you that it is an honor to me to secure the First Vice President of this institution and .to serve as a member of this Board and you will find me cooperating in every wav I can at any time.

Since Mr, Tolin has referred to the change in atmos - phere I Want to remark that George has done a great deal but in one respect he has fallen short. Part of the State has been blessed with- moisture, but his old coifnty has dried up and blown away.

A few years ago. and not so many y ears ago either, you would never see the high officials of railroads at any other meeting than a political meeting, but now you don t see them in political meetings, but you do find -them in agri - cultural meetings. During the organized agricultural meetings that were eld at the Agricultural College early in this month one of the highest salaried railroad officials in America and his wife were there during the entire week and were very much interested in the matters ha were being dealt with there. They were interested In the work that was going on. Then there was another one of the great railroad officials who was there for several days.

That is cooperation and organization. We have the cooperation I mTehT T*t r UVity 8UCh ES thC rafWdS - We need ra »«-oads. I might cite just an instance of cooperation. When a heavy storm came up on Saturday we felt that we were up against it. the Bur - l.ngton Railroad switched in seven or eight carloads of cinders and havings without any expense. The Northwestern fcbad brought a band from Chicago to play for two days without any cost whatever being Placed on our Fair. We have had the cooperation of not only the big people, but a lot of smaller organizations in the State and of many such men as you people. This matters not who you would elect Secretary so much, but when you have an organization propelled with he momentum of this organization, when so many people are working to serve it and some way it seems that we are lined up together In h" P bitter/ 0 make th ' 8 great ln8tltUtlOn a 8UCCeS8 ' " CaD not bnv S Th T U f, th /1 e i effort8 of the Colle Se ot Agriculture we have 8,000 </seg>

If the Boys' and Girls' Club work aimed just for aj chance- to make a little material development, it wouldn't amount to much of any thing. But it is doing so much more than that. It is making leaders of. those boys and girls. If there ever . was a time in this world that we needed leaders it is right now. They seem to realize that they are establishing a reputation for them - selves as they go through life. If they establish a reputation for themselves they must have first created a desire to work. The greatest asset that any young person can have is a desire to work and to gain the confidence of the people that they ark to do business with. If they have the confidence of the people that they associate with they in return will overlook a lot of their nllstakes. If they lack that confidence they will be criticized for a lot of things they never did, so it is very essential that they establish a reputation for them - selves as they go through life. You know that 90% of the bad accounts on the books of the business people |are from those people who refuse to work. You go down to the penitentiary where they have about 700 convicts and the sad part of it is that about sixty-five percent of them are under twenty-eight years bid and a considerable part of them refused to work. So the gre itest asset the young people can have is to desire to work. We may need laws to protect young people in the great labor centers, but let me tell you there are more young people ruined by underwork in Nebraska ten to one, • than there ever was by overwork. That is vjhat this club work is doing. Mr. Frisbie points out that they are going to be leaders in agricultural activities in this country. They are going to be tomorrow what we should be today. As they come down here every year and are becoming more and more interested ii the State Pair, I can visualize what these boys arid girls are going to do for the Pair. They are extending graveled roads in (very direction out of Lincoln for two or three hundred miles and \he people are coming now and |C amping for a week and beginning t'o look upon our State Pair as an educational institution. We knojw it is. People that come in here for one day can not get much from the Fair in an educational way. When they do that they try to cover too much territory and when they get home they don'; know what they did see. But! they are coming in here now so they can remain for a week and we should encourage them. As I slid in my report when the time comes to break up, some of the piople in the camp feel very badly about it. and express a wish tha't they could stay for another week.

During this period of time the legislature of Nebraska has appropriated $705,000 for the purchase of the grounds, erection of buildings and minor improvements. During this same period of time this organization has staged the twenty-six lairs, paid out for premiums during this time the sum of $794,833, and have put back into the grounds in the way of permanent improvements and upkeep a total sum of $797,913. You will note that from our receipts during this twenty-six year period we have paid out $89,000 more for premiums than the total state appropriation for grounds and buildings. The Nebraska State Fair is conceded by all to be the greatest advertising medium in Nebraska. We are proud of its record. It not only advertises our resources but find3 buyers for our products. During the twenty-six years residence in Lincoln it has developed to such extent that the institution is valued at one million and a quarter dollars. </seg>

            <seg id="p109">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association ANNUAL MESSAGE OP THE PRESIDENT OF THE NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION WAYLAND W. MAGEE I want to congratulate the Crop Growers' Association on the interest which is shown by so large an attendance at the opening session. The first year of my two year term of office as your President has rolled around, and though I find no precedent in the annual reports of the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association, as compiled by your Secretary, for making a brief summary of the year's work, yet I feel that such a statement is due our absent members, and will, if made a custom, tend to keep he officers of this Society on their toes, and also furnish a record of our work for the guidance of those who will assume the direc:ing hand when we who now have the responsibilities have served cur term. . Our very efficient Secretary, Prof. P. H. Stewart, has compiled and edited the formal annual report which he has filed with his PJxcellency, the Governor, Adam McMullen, and in which the report of the annual meeting of January, 1926,. is included. Our activities then as recorded here are subsequent to that date. Your Association has carried on during the last calendar year in much the same paths that have been laid out for it in the past. The second annual Ten Acre Yield Corn Contest has been held, and a detailed report will be made 'at the proper time in this program. The annual Corn and Small Grain Show, as you all know, is now in progress, and I direct your attention to the exhibits which you will find in this building. A word of appreciation is expressed for the generous co-operation of the Lincoln Chamber of Commerce, the Nebraska Millers, the Griswold Seed Company, and the late Hon. C. H. Rudge for the ■trophies they have provided. Perhaps the most important; work of this organization, to my mind, is the propagation and distribution of certified seeds, which work has been carried on through the year, as heretofore, under the certificate plan. The marked advance, if any, to be recorded here, is the fact that many ot the seed growers in Western Nebraska are desirous of having clover seeds and alfalfa included in the list of seeds to be certified. The work of this certification and field inspection has heretofore been done by the members of the Agronomy Department at the College of Agriculture, but the thought and desire of your officers is to make the carrying on this work, while still continued under the guidance of the Agronomy Department,- self-supporting.

            <seg id="p110">Report of Nebraska State Board op Agriculture finance this through a small tax on the sales of certified seed, or possibly a contribution from each of the growers, which would be sufficient to meet the cost of inspection. If there should prove to be a surplus at any time, it could well be expended in advertising the work of the Association in order that the fund Itself might thereby grow. During this year your Society has had its representatives at the Chicago Conference of the International Crop Growers' Associa - tion; the first annual meeting of Western Nebraska Organized Agri - culture; the Seed Marketing Conference, and the International Hay and Grain Show. In the work of propaganda and education, we can report that your Society has taken an active part in co-operating with the Union Pacific Railway in furnishing exhibit material and speakers for "The Better Crop Special" train which that railway ran over its entire system in Nebraska in August of this year. A detailed report of this very interesting train will be incorporated in the annual report. Suffice it to say here that from the standpoint of the Crop Growers, this work has been a definite step in advance. In the field of Law Enforcement, we have to our credit one judgment which has been rendered against a seed house in Nebraska and which sold seed containing Canada thistle, contrary to the pro - visions of the seed statutes of the State. Under the heading of Our Desires for Expansion, perhaps it would be well if we had an expression at this meeting as to the practicability of asking for more funds in order that we can enlarge our work to carry on contests in the growing of wheat and beets, both of which crops are predominant in their sections of the west, and where we think there is a great deal of information to be had along the lines of such contests, as they will doubtless bring out pointd in soil conservation, and throw much light on the cost of cultural methods. Your general policies have been carried out in much the same way as in the past. The program gives a chance for free expression, and all are urged to take part in the discussion. This year It Is thought that the economic side should be given the place of honor at the opening of our program. This is done because beyond question Agriculture is out of step with industry, and the money rewards tn farmers have not kept pace with industrial returns. It is therefore important that this outstanding economic problem come before think - ing farmers who today recognize that it involves production, not so much in itself, as in its relation to marketing and distribution. To boldly state the case, we believe, as farmers, we have reached the point where it Is not yield but profits that we must have. </seg>
            <seg id="p111">; Nebraska Chop Gbowebs' Association . Our program this morning treats largely of economic problems. The first subject to claim our attention is "Can Producers Control Prices?" by Harold He'dges. , . * . . . ■ ■ " ' . - ' v CAN PRODUCERS CONTROL PRICES? ; HAROLD HEDGES Agricultural College, Lincoln A discussion of price control is bound to lead one into disputed territory. It is said that there are always two sides to every question, and usually three: your side, my side, and the right side. We all have enough faith in our own views that we are pretty sure that our side and the right side of the question are identical, but that isn't necessarily true and we are often forced to change our views. Even the best men miss occasionally. Before I attempt an answer to the. question which appears on your program I am going to raise another question: Why do producers want to control price? They want to do so because they see in It a means of adding to their profits. The feeling exists, and quite generally too, that the present private marketing agencies have suf - ficient control over the marketing machinery and the supply of certain farm products to enable them to secure monopoly gains. It is common belief that dealers act together to keep prices low in the fall and raise them in the spring; or manipulate prices from day to day or week to week, so as to make gains that are to the disadvantage and loss of producers. Such belief and opinion may be largely without foundation tho not entirely so, but we must recognize the fact that nothing so rankles In a man as a sense of injustice. The farmer feels that his products are not selling In line with what he is forced to pay for farm supplies. What About Supply and Demand ? It is a stock expression that supply and demand determine price, and undoubtedly they are the principal factors that make farm prices. However, these two words — supply and demand— are often misunder - stood. They are not the simple price makers that some would have you believe. The average price at which a crop sells during a year may reflect production and consumption quite accurately. Take, for instance, the price of potatoes in recent years. ; If we had a chart here showing potato production and yearly prices over a period of years, we would see that prices were low in years pf large crops and high in years of short crops. </seg>
            <seg id="p112">I. Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture .Such a chart as the one I have mentioned is often used to prove that supply and' demand are the price making factors and that manipulation of price is nothing but idle talk. Admitting the fact that the chart does show supply and demand to be effective over a long period of time there remains the possibility that speculation or manipulation may carry prices out of line with' market conditions for a day or week or month. Take wheat prices in January, 1925. The fever of speculation by the public carried prices 15 or 20 cent3 above what supply and other market conditions warranted. Eventually prices returned to the true basis in line with supply and demand, but not without considerable profit making and loss taking as a result of the speculation. No doubt, manipulation or speculation are minor factors in the markets but yet they often result to the disadvantage of the producer. Is Price Control Possible? Now to consider the question of price control. Price control implies monopoly. What do we mean by monopoly? One economist lias denned it as "that substantial unity of action on. the part of one or more persons engaged in some kind of business which gives exclu - sive control more particularly, altho not solely, with respect to price." We must recognize that even monopoly does not put complete control of the market in the monopolist's hands. There are two sides to the market and the buyer's or consumer's side is just as important as the supply side. You recall the old adage that you can lead a horse to water but you cannot make him drink. If the price is too high the consumer buys less or not at all — always less. If there is so much of the product to sell, price must be such as to attract purchasers to take that supply. We must recognize how modern production is carried on. Pro - duction of farm products i3 not based on orders. By that I mean that consumers do not put in orders for definite amounts of certain commodities at agreed prices, and then production is based on such orders. Instead, production is carried on ahead of demand and in anticipation of demand. If the amount produced is to be in line with what consumers will use, production must be based on a fairly correct estimate of demand. To control price it is necessary to control supply. Can producers of farm products control or hope to control supply? A control of supply before production has started is necessary if that control Is to be the determining factor in price. Once production is completed the price must be set which will move all of the supply into consumptive channels. Therefore, the question is: Can producers control produc - tion so that they may control price? There are a number of dff - ficulties they will encounter in trying to control production and supply so that the price obtained is high enough to make farming profitable. </seg>
            <seg id="p113">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association I will leave it to you to decide whether or not these difficulties may be overcome. I will mention some of them: 1. The outcome o£ production is largely dependent on weather, disease, and similar factors largely beyond the control of pro - - . ducers. 2. Agricultural commodities are produced by a very large nunv ber of independent units. 3. Farmers are .separated by distance and prejudices, making it difficult to secure united effort. 4. Differences ' in living standards as between producers and groups of producers makes agreement on a fair price more' difficult. 5. The number of middlemen between producers and consumers adds to the difficulty of adjusting supply to demand. - If we consider these difficulties and the long period of time elaps - ing between ' the time production is started and the time of the price response to the resulting supply, we will conclude that price control by agricultural producers is not likely to be realized in the near future. I do not wish to leave the impression that the existing situation is the best that can be hoped for and that nothing can be don? to improve it. 'There is much room for improvement and much that can be done. I have said that, the supply produced is a dominant factor in making the price. In agricultural production, the opposite statement is all too true; that is, price determines supply. For example, if -wheat sells at a better price relatively than corn this year, it may be expected that farmers next year will grow more wheat and less corn. Thus we see that present price is a big factor in determining what' future production will be. " Cycles in Production We hear of the cycles in hog production. It is the same story of letting present prices determine future production. When hog prices are ' high, production is stimulated and too many are raised to sell at satisfactory priced. When prices are low, production is curtailed too far, and in time prices go to high levels. Not present prices but the probable prices that will likely prevail when production i3 completed should be the factor influencing how much will be pro - duced. In other words, the desirable situation is to let supply be a determining factor in setting price, but not let price — by that I mean present price — be the determining factor influencing production. Most of you, no doubt, are familiar with the government reports on Intentions to plant and on the pig crops, and with similar reports on the outlook for important farm crops. Some writers in farm papers make considerable sport of the value of such reports. To </seg>
            <seg id="p114">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture prove that such reports have no value, they proceed in about this manner. The report on planting intentions showed a probable increase in wheat acreage, for example, of ten per cent. The report on acreage planted shows only a two per cent increase. Therefore,- the "inten - tions" report was worthless and the government had no business putting out such a report so far different from actual plantings and thus misleading farmers. If one stops a moment to think, one will see how absurd such argument is. Yet, I have seen editorials in presumably reliable farm papers in which the writers use such state - ments and take delight in ridiculing government outlook reports. And, still worse, many farmers believe such absurd arguments. What is the real purpose of "intentions" and outlook reports? They give the farmer information upon which he can intelligently base his farming operations for the future. Such editorials as I have mentioned are a libel on the intelligence of progressive American farmers. The purpose of the "intentions" reports is to induce some change in actual planting that will result in production nearer in line with consumptive needs. If farmers failed to make the change in line with the government report, they would certainly be showins poor judgment. In the illustration I have used of wheat acreage, the fact that actual increase in acreage planted was much below the intended increase gives evidence that the report does have value in helping to keep production more nearly in line with consumptive demand. I have mentioned some of the difficulties that make it haTd to fit production to consumptive needs. Many of the factors, like weather, are beyond the control of the farming industry. Even so, such pro - duction risks should not prevent the attempt to bring production' more nearly in line with demand thru intelligent consideration of future price and production prospects. Such a course offers real possibilities. Some persons are fond of bringing up the "bugaboo" of a decrease in acreage as a result of concerted action on the part of farmers accompanied by a near crop failure. Such fears are based on such a vague possibility that they are hardly worthy of consideration. Cer - tainly, farmers can scarcely be expected to indulge in surplus pro - duction year after year so that consumers may be assured of a full stomach in the exceptional year. Production of bur staple farm products is so widespread that the likelihood of a failure of all crops In all sections of the nation is negligible. In this day of substitution it would be no hardship for the consumer to substitute a handful of rice for a few potatoes, or lo eat corn bread once a week to make a short wheat crop go farther It is my conviction that farmers can and should make full use of reliable market information in planning their farming operations and thus securing a better adjustment between supply and demand. I </seg>
            <seg id="p115">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association am not in favor of jumping from one crop to another. A well-planned cropping system will not permit it. However, there is usually enough flexibility, in the cropping system to permit some changes in line with an intelligent consideration of future market prospects. Such a policy if pursued only by some of the more fore-sighted producers, will be of benefit tp the farming industry generally as well as to those who make the changes in response to future price pros - pects. Take hog production as an example. Those who anticipate a decline in hog production increase their own herds. By so doing they get higher prices but also add to hog supplies at the low point in production and prevent hog prices going still higher to further stimulate the unthinking producer. If the intelligent producers antici - pate an increase in hog production they reduce their herds. By so doing, they tend to reduce supplies at the high point In production. As a. consequence, prices do not go as low as they otherwise would. Reliable market Information, even If used by only the more fore - sighted producers, tends to reduce the extreme high and low points in production and, therefore, in price. What Determines Price? Many a time when talking to fanners on this subject of price they have expressed this viewpoint: "We have nothing to say about price either when we buy- or when we sell. When we go into a store ' to buy, they name the price. When we sell our grain or livestock, the buyer names the price. We get it coming and going. Can't we reverse the process and do a little price-setting just as the other fellow does?" Such a situation, if true, needs to be remedied. The ques - tion is whether or not the storekeeper or the local buyer does set prices. Is the law of supply and demand, inoperative when the farmer buys and. sells? Let us consider for a moment what price policies may be used in' the field of marketing. There are several which I want to men - tion. First, there 1b the policy of setting a price on a commodity and then attempting to Influence consumers to accept it at that price. Good examples are such specialty goods as vacuum sweepers or safety razors. Influence is brought to bear on consumers thru advertising or personal salesmanship. A second price policy is that of studying carefully all the available information on supply and demand and the setting a price in line with such information. The prices of most of the products sold in the grocery or dry goods stores are arrived at by such a procedure. The purchaser may think he has nothing to' say about price but it is his willingness and the willingness of other consumers to buy which makes effective the demand for the commodity. If the product will not move at the set price, then it must be lowered. </seg>
            <seg id="p116">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture . A third method is that of the open market. Buyers and sellers meet in specified places, and their bids and offers form the basis for determining the prices at which commodities exchange. The fourth price making method is that of the future market. There the persons meet and are willing to trade on their ideas of what prices ought to be. As a result of this pooling of Ideas, a price is arrived at. In all of these cases, the more accufate the Information of buyers and sellers on supply and demand, the more accurately will price bo registered. I must not overlook a fifth method of registering price, the hap - hazard method which is really no method at all. In this case the buyer or seller or both have little or no information on the market and price depends on whether buyer or seller is the better bargainer. There was once a time when much of the buying at local points was of this nature, usually to the disadvantage of the producer. Such a method is now out of date. More accurate market information made avail - able to producers thru newspapers and other sources, better know - ledge of marketing costs and fair buying margins, producers' organiza - tions at local points, these are some of the factors which have con - tributed to bring local prices more nearly in line with what supply and demand warrant. One point that should not be overlooked Is how producers may influence price by improving the quality of their product. You men -members of the Crop Growers' Association and other similar organi - zations—are interested in the quality of your products. We must recognize that, due to the distance between producer and consumer, the farmer is unfamiliar to a large extent wtthwhat the consumer wants. Producing as near as possible what the consumer wants results in better prices and less waste in marketing. You, In your efforts to improve the crops of the state, should and undoubtedly do give consideration to the wants of the market. Co-operative organization is an effective tool that producers may use to improve their position in the market. I will leave it to ona of the speakers who follows me to expand on the possibilities of co - operation. In concluding this discussion, you may wish a more direct answer than I have yet given to the question before us: Can Producers Con - trol Prices? My conclusion is that producers cannot control prices. Why? Because at most, producers could control onjy the supply side of the market and therefore could not dictate a price beyond that which consumers would be willing to pay; because price control re - quires control over not only supply but over production. I have already enumerated some difficulties to be met in any absolute production control measure. Producers can influence price/however. This will result from more widespread use of market Information and by con- </seg>
            <seg id="p117">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association certed effort or co-operative organization to improve bargaining power. Our marketing system is far from perfect and much remains to be done to improve the position of the farm producer. The intelligence of farmers, of farm leaders, of farm organizations, of the agricultural colleges and of governmental agencies should be applied to the problem. ' PRESIDENT MAGEE: Beyond question I express the feeling of this gathering when I take it upon myself to thank Mr. Hedges for his admirable and scholarly presentation of a vexing problem. The fact that he comes before us as a representative of this Agri - cultural College 1 brings up a thought I would like to express. A couple of years ago President Coolldge called before' him the presidents of the Land Grant Colleges and pointed out to them that the future of our agriculture rests with the kind of men they are turning out as leaders in these Land Grant Colleges. I think today we have a very excellent example of how the administration focused its power and authority for the benefit of agriculture. Mr. Hedges is a repre - sentative and product of our own state University College of Agri - culture. The next subject on our program is, "How I Use Market Infor - mation," by Ira W. Hepperly, of Norfolk. HOW I USB MARKET INFORMATION IRA T. HEPPERLY Norfolk, Nebraska I . feel like the New Yorker. When he was approached by a ■ stranger and asked for information, he said, "Out of the five million people in New York, why pick on. me?" When there are so many other fanners in the State who could have been chosen to take this place and could have done better than I can do, "Wliy pick on me?" My talk will be just examples of what Mr. Hedges has told you upon the subject of price control. That is, when we use market infor - mation it is in a measure applying price control. The producers of Nebraska are not the independent producers they were fifty years ago. Instead, they are the interdependent producers in competition with all the other producers of the world, this being brought about by rapid transit, and now w 3 are In competition with the producers of. Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia and South ' America. For example, if we are favored with a particularly good wheat and rye crop we have Very little place to sei.d our exportable surplus; if the south grows an enormous crop of cotton, as they have done this last year, </seg>
            <seg id="p118">Report ok Nebraska State Board of Agriculture the next year they will naturally swing to something else, and it will undoubtedly be corn and hogs. Therefore the producers of the central west, including Nebraska and Kansas, will naturally have a restricted market for the corn and hogs, and will turn to wheat or some other product. If Europe is well supplied with wheat the Nebraska farmers will have to have a place to market their wheat. So it behooves all producers to watch the market information. There was a negro being questioned by the Judge in regard to chicken stealing, and when asked a particular question he said, "Judge, I jest disremember." And I want to give a few Illustrations of how we dis-used market information, by giving some examples of what we have done in the past, paying no attention to the estimated plantings and hog populations, and all those things. Before I do that, however, I should perhaps give a brief summary of our particular farm condi - tions at Norfolk. We are primarily market gardeners with about 50 per cent of our land in staple farm products. In order to equalize our labor load we have distributed our labor over the entire year instead of over a three months period by raising some corn and wheat and a few hogs like the average farmer of Nebraska does. We are fortunate in being near a packing company where we can sell things at guaranteed prices. In the spring at planting time we can estimate farmers' intended plantings and if we find that the possibilities are that corn will be cheap that fall, and we know the contract price of canned sweet corn is high, we grow more canning sweet corn and buy our field corn. Coming to an illustration, I want to speak of hogs. ' We took over a farm from my folks in 1920, when prices were high. We accu - mulated a large herd of hogs, and you know the results. We took a severe loss on hogs because the price broke before we produced enough and put them on the market to get good prices. We coin - niFiicod then to watch the markets very closely and on March 1JT, 1922. we sold about 100 head of fall pigs, which I was assured would not bring a decent profit. We sold those at auction and they brought more money when they weighed around 100 pounds than when fed out to about 225 pounds. That information I got from reading "Wal - lace's Farmer." Sources of .Market Information I think it mipht be a pretty good plan to give a few of the sources from which we get our information. We get the -crops and markets published by the United States Department of Agriculture, which always gives a good resume of agricultural conditions, Wallace's Farmrr and The Nebraska Farmer, and we listen to the radio. The radio speeches have a particular bearing on particular places and tilings, and we find by listening to a good many of. them that we </seg>
            <seg id="p119">Nebraska Chop Gbowebs' Association Bet a very good idea of how market conditions are, what the acreage is, the growth of the crops and things like that. Now as Mr. Hedges has said there are many factors that enter into the crop before it is produced, when it is. a difficult proposition to determine the acreage. Even though we know that wheat will probably be cheap next year because there is an immense acreage this fall, we can't say what Trill happen to that crop before next summer. Undoubtedly the South will plant thousands of acres of corn next year where cotton. was raised this year, and it would seem that the logical thing to do would le to decrease the corn acreage in the North next year: and it prob ibly will be decreased. So it looks from my personal viewpoint, as though it will be a good proposition to grow corn next year and therefore in case the contract price of the factories on sweet corn is i ot extremely high, (which it probably won't be, because the canning industry is now filled up with canned goods, the amount on hand" exceeding anything previous in this line) the probabilities are that we w 11 plant a larger acreage of field corn next year and a smaller acreag &gt; of sweet corn. Climatic Influences on Production I might give another particular example which happened in 1925. I figured from estimated plantiigs, hog population and other factors, that corn would be cheap in th ; fall of 1925, and therefore I planted a very small acreage, planning to sell the sweet corn to the factory and to buy field corn cheaper, and that is what actually happened. But my prediction of field co n was shot as I didn't need to buy any field corn due to a very high yield. That is what happens when .Fig. 1.— The weather factDr has much to do with the yield of our corn crop. </seg>
            <seg id="p120">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture the factor of good weather comes in and we have an enormous amount of field corn. We raise a good crop of potatoes in any ordinary year. Potatoes were a good price in 1920 and 1921 and we made a very good profit, and naturally increased the acreage in 1923. Everybody had a good acreage in 1923 and we took a loss of about $50 an acre on our potatoes. We didn't stop growing potatoes, but we set the acreage where we could handle it better and take advantage of high prices. These high prices in our territory come in the summer-time before we have shipped any potatoes from Nebraska and Minnesota. Since then we have made a profit on all our potatoes. We watch the plant - ings very closely and if the actual planting gives as large a production as the forecasts, we try to sell our potatoes as early as possible to be rid of them before the fall break comes. Not knowing as much as I should about the potatoe price curves due to under and over - production I failed to make several thousand dollars last winter because from my own thoughts I figured that potatoes were too high in the fall, when they would have cost us $1.10 a bushel F. O. B. Western Nebraska. The seed potatoes we let slip last fall went up and we paid a good price for seed potatoes this spring. There are several other factors which enter into the production of crops other than just the variation of prices and demand and supply, and among those are the weather, which has so very much to do with crops such as we raise. For instance in 1924 our onion crop was practically noihing because the weather was very unfavorable to onion growing. Onions were naturally high that fall, and we had very few. In 1924 we had a very severe winter, killing alfalfa all over Nebraska, which naturally brought the price of alfalfa very high during the winter of 1925. Those things on a long time process mako it impossible for any farmer to take advantage of high prices, becauso of the fact that it takes about two years to get a stand of alfalfa lo growing and you can't put it in any time. Mr. Hedges gave another point which is absolutely true, and which we follow, and that is that we can't jump from one thing to another. We make variations of crops, but we must raise a continual acreage of alfalfa. We can vary it some but it must be in the rotation and regardless of whether the prices are high or low we raise it just the same. We keep a herd of hogs on. hand all the time because whether the prices are high or cheap we must have them to use some of our by-products; and we must have a few cows all the time to use our surplus alfalfa and to produce fertilizer; so though the crop? are not constant we produce some of each every year but we try to vary the major crops so that we can take advantage of all the high points in any particular cycle. If I am fortunate enough to live another fifty years perhaps 1 can hit all those high points; so </seg>
            <seg id="p121">Nebraska Crow Growers' Association far, we have been unfortunate because of the fact we did not use market information when we si ould have. Now I really believe that most of the farmers are too much on the old type of raising one particular acreage of each crop each year, half perhaps in oats and half Jin corn, a little alfalfa, and some are starting 'sweet clover, and they do pretty well. They are like the little girl who started the cat's tail through the wringer and when the cat complained she said, "Never mind, pussy, we'll soon be through." following her mother's plan. THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Hepperly's remarks remind me of the story of two city men, each possesed of one dollar, who met on the street and exchanged dollars and went their severed ways; they traded dollars but there was still just two dollars between them. Two farmers meet at the end of a corn row, and talk over the fence, or in a meeting of organized agriculture come forward with an idea apiece, they swap ideas and when they go away there are two ideas in each head. We thank Mr. Hepperly for bringing his ideas to us and I know we will go away with them in our minds. ' Next we take up the subject of "Why I Market My Wheat Early," by W. F. Dale of University Place. WHY I MARKET MY WHEAT EARLY Wi P. DALE University Place, Nebraska I am rather thankful for the remark of our chairman a moment ago in regard to the fanners swapping ideas, and I hope when this meeting is through, in some way and from some of these professors we will be able to go away with more than those two ideas. I am the only one on the program who never had the' opportunity for an education like the younger generation is receiving through this great university. .But you will notice further that my subject is more restricted than the others. The others are allowed to wander from market gardens to livestock, and. all the various branches of Agri - culture. The marketing of wheat, friends, is something to my mind that a farmer who raises wheat should study from year to year, and during the past thirty-five years, when most of that time I have been producing wheat either directly or indirectly upon my land, and I have, tried to watch the marketing of that product. It seems to me that if we are careful, if we are thoughtful, if we watch the market in its varied forms we can from time to time get some infor - mation that will be of advantage to us in the marketing of that crop, </seg>
            <seg id="p122">Rf.port of Nkuraska State Board of Agriculture possibly more so than in some other lines. In the marketing of hogs it seems to me il is quite easy to be deceived in regard to what *.he outlook and the prospect is from time to time. I have- talked to a great many during the last six months, and the general impression was that the hog market at Omaha would drop to $10 or lower during November, December, and January, and yet we have received, as you have noted from time to time, a very strong market when it came to the marketing of hogs; I suppose very largely from the fact that (here were not the hogs raised through the country that was antici - pated early in the season. Now let me call your attention to the question that In the market - ing of wheat we must judge the future to a large degree by the past; but not entirely to be sure. You will notice that I have not taken notps like those speakers who have had college experience, and which I suppose is the proper thing to do, and yet I hope that In the study of this question I have been able to gather some facts by experience. Let hip say right here that I have not always hit the mark with the best judgment, and I don't suppose there are many farmers here today who have been marketing wheat for the last forty years who could say that he always hit the top. But there are various things influencing us also in the marketing of wheat or other crops. A friend speaking to me yesterday over the phone said he marketed early in June because he was forced to, but he didn't know whether to try that many times. When I marketed early it was because it seemed I had to have some ready money and as you know the bank3 are not always ready to dish out to the farmer when he needs it most. In Ifll8, IMS and the early part of 1920 they were urging the farmers to take money from the banks and some of those very banks today are suffering from that ready money which they w_ere forcing upon the farmers at that time. Numerous Costs in Holding Wheat But there are olher things to take into consideration. If tlio farmer holds that crop of wheat he must have a good place to hold it; he must have granary room, and as you and I know that is ex - pensive, in this western country at least. I know some have tried to hold the grain by putting it in elevators and some have had a sorry experience in doing that because when they came to sell their grain, the grain had gone and they didn't have the money, nor the other fellow didn't either. It would seem to me that the safest thing if a man expects to hold that wheat crop from the time it is threshed in July, is to hold it on the farm, though as I say that is ofttimes expensive. Another question we should take Into consideration, but I don't know just to what degree the professors have determined it, and that </seg>
            <seg id="p123">Nedraska Ckoi 1 Growers' Association is the shrinkage from July to the following April, May or June. I mention those particular months chiefly from the fact that if a man holds his wheat from one year to another and expects to profit by that holding, he must hold that whiat in all probability until the following May or June to reap the beneiU of an increased price. Another question that comes in is the question of insurance. ' Whether you insure the- crop with some insurance company or hold it without insurance you are running a certain risk in various way3 that you must take into consideration, especially in this day and age where a man's hogs or a wojman's chickens are not safe behind a lock or anything else. And there is not only the question of theft but also the question of fire and other means of getting away with Hie crop. So there are those vkriousi factors to take into consideration if you expect to hold that crop of wheat from harvest to the next spring or later.

We must remember in th &gt; marketing of wheat that while we are not the very first here to thresh -winter wheat, yet our wheat in this latitude is through the mac line before any of the spring wheat to the North of us either in tlie Dakotas, Minnesota or Canada. Their wheat goes onto the market to compete with ours, and therefore my experience has been that if w« can market wheat early we get out of the way before those in competition with us break the market. Post Records on Wheat Price by Months I. want to call your attention just briefly to a chart that I have prepared, not from my own experience, because the experience of one farmer will not go very far on this subject. This chart is taken from </seg>
            <seg id="p124">Rkport ok Nkiirakka State Board of Agriculture rt bulletin from ihe Agricultural College, and represents a period of forty-two years. Ii is a long period of time, from 1880 down tc 1922. and should be a period of time sufficient to determine what the advantages are in the early marketing of wheat. This chart is taken from the Chicago market for forty-two years. For instance, by taking the month of July and figuring the average prices lor 1880, 1881. and so on down to 1922, you have the average market price per bushel of wheat for that month for forty-two years ot $1.HK 1/5 per bushel. You will notice that from July up to and including December there has been no time when the average price of wheat in C'hieaeo during the forty-two years- has gone higher than it was in July and there you have the six months that you may have held wheat. On th« average of the forty-two years you have lost your storage, you lost your insurance, you lost your shrinkage and you have received no gain in price. But in January the price aver - ages one cent a bushel higher in the forty-two years than it did in July. Then it dips down again in February to $1.06 2/5 cents, just 1/5 of a cent higher in February, eight months after you threshed compared with what it was when you threshed. In March it runs lo $1.07. Have you any gain rrom $1.06 1/5 in carrying that grain fight or nine months, in any way, shape, or manner? You have lost the interest on your money, you have paid insurance or carried it yourself, and there has been some shrink. And we find from March the price runs to SI. 10 in April, to $1.14 1/5 in May, and back in June to $1.0!) 2/5. So in June it only averages 3 cents a bushel higher that, it did in July, and the very highest average point was the month of May, in which it averaged nine cents higher. Fin. 3. -To store or market at threshing time is a question which the wheat grower must decide. Considering the interest on the money, considering the insurance, considering (lie storage, considering the shrinkage, and the various factors to take into consideration, the question is can the average farmer over Nebraska, east, west, north and south, afford to carry that wheat even though he sold it at the very highest peak, which would be in the month of May, and market at an advance of nine </seg>

To my mine, as a rule the farmer who can market liis wheat in the fall immedia ely from the machine, saving the shrink - age, the waste of putting it into and taking it out of the bin, the possibility of the weevil, the insurance and other factors, is the one who will reap an advantage. THE PRESIDENT: An;- man who has the analytical brain that Mr. Dale has, and carrying gray hairs in his head, has demonstrated to -my mind that he has no need of a College education. If it had not been for men of his type, with a vision of the future, where would we fellows be now? Those are the men who have brought to us the opportunity of going to school. It is to such men that we owe great things for making "it possible for us to have this opportunity. What is a college education? Someone has said it is nothing but ". the systematic reading of good books, and that is the truth. QUESTION — (W. C. Johnson): 'Is it possible for the railroads • to handle in July all the grain raised? THE PRESIDENT: If it had been- in July this year you would have seen their equipment far handling the great crop break down under the stress, but there was a great deal of grain handled in July. We will now hear from Ira Kindig, a farmer from Gage County. WHY I DECIDE FT It MYSELF AVHEX MY GRAIN IS TO BE SOLD IRA K: NDIG, Holmesville. . When I was first given my subject for this morning, I said that I would not be able to say anything on that topic; but my wife said, "Don't worry, you'll talk Ion ; enough." So I wrote this out and read it to my wife and girls. The question is, "Why doil decide for myself when my grain is to be sold?" My- answer is because [ have not yet found any other way of selling in which I have the :onfldence that I have in my own ability ■ to determine when my grain should be sold. The plan or system tha . I use is the same old system of selling where I can, when I can, anl for all I can. Have I considered other systems as advocated by "Tie Grain Growers," "The National Wheat Growers," or any such mark ;ting or pooling organization? Yes, I have considered their systems, but I have not joined any organization. Back in 1920 when The National Wheat Growers or- </seg>
            <seg id="p126">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture ganized and started their campaign, wheat at the beginning of thresh - ing sold at our local elevators for more than $2.40 per bushel.- 1 hauled some of the first wheat that our crew threshed. I remember asking the elevator man about the price while he was dumping my load For wheat such as I had in the wagon he was bidding ?2.44 per DllSn PI , "Down some," I said. "Yes, and it will be down more before it goes up." His advice was to sell. I could have sold at that moment for S2.44 per bushel and I would have had a reasonable time to get the wheat to market. Ten days is the ordinary time that is given. I knew that the price was away above the normal price. But I did not sell. Why? Our crew was just starting to thresh. With favorable weather and no breakdown it would require 15 to 18 days to make the run and my wheat was toward the end. It was farther from the elevator too, than what I had just delivered. Uncertainty of my ability to deliver at that time was the leading reason for not selling I aln not saying that it was the entire reason. For I was hearing the noise of the propagandist and I will admit that his noise diverted my attention and to some extent, had an influence in the making of my decision. When first I could have marketed my wheat to advantage the price had fallen to about $2.30 per bushel. On every hand wo were hearing, "Hold for $3.00." I held nearly as long as I could I had to sell before March. 1921. and so in early January of that year, I sold. I guess everyone knows that I did not sell for $3.00. In the fall of 1921, an organizer for "The U. S. Grain Growers" interviewed me. Ke was very patient and explained in detail all the questions that I could think to ask about the contract that I was asked to sign. I read a great deal about this association and thought a great deal over the contract but at no time did I get the consent of my judgment to sign. This organization, as I now remember, handled little grain. The final failure of the U. S. Grain Growers was not due to the plan of organization nor to any defects in the contract. Apparently some unfortunate mistakes were made in the election of the first hoard of directors. Xot all the members of this board were as con - servat.ve or as well-informed upon grain marketing as the represen - tative elected from Nebraska, Mr. C. H. Gustafson. But there are growers or producers organizations that are doing a grain business. Secretary Jardine says that there are about 4,000 </seg>
            <seg id="p127">Nebraska Cr&lt;p Growers' Association farmers' elevators in the Unit sd States and no fewer than nine wheat pools.* In the wheat pool lie grain of all growers in the organiza - tion is put together and marketed as one lot. In joining the organ - ization the grower/agrees that for a certain length of time, probably lor five years: 1. Sell his grain through the organization. 2. Deliver his grain to the organization upon demand, and 3. Receive payment fo| his grain upon the basis of the net average price of all grain sold by the organization. Their claim is that by following the principle of orderly market - ing and that by endeavoring |o sell on the high points of the market from time to time, the organization can put into the pockets of the producers a higher average price for their grain than the producers selling alone can put into their own pockets. I have not been unwill - ing to concede the possibility of the claim. But I have doubted If it would work out to the producers financial gain in practice. And the reports and statements that I have read concerning the system have substantiated the doub;.§ I would not condemn the system upon my doubt and its substantiation alone, however, for the system is new insofar as its application to the grain grower is concerned and it may be that it will give a better account of itself later on. There are other reasons why I do not favor the pooling system. It restricts the marketing opportunity as to when and where and renders uncertain the pri:e as to time and amount: With doubt, restriction and uncertainty es represented in this system I cannot agree to adhere. And so I do not have much confidence in the future of the pooling system. Especially is this true when it is compared with Ihe opportunity of the open and free market as we have it now. Now Have Open and Free Market And what is the opportunity of the open and free market? Let me explain by telling what happened just one week ago at about this hour. I went into our farmers' elevator at Rockford, Nebr., and asked Mr. Taff, our manager, about the price of wheat. One dollar and twenty-three centts was the bid. I had just come from the other elevator and knevr that Bert was bidding the same. 1 sat down and asked about si orts and bran. The office door opened and a second inan asked: "What's wheat worth?" . , "?1."23," Mr. Taff answered. "I'll wait a while," heieplied, closed the door and went away. Shortly the door opened again and a third man appeared. * See Nebraska Farmer, Dec. 18, 1926, page 25. § Evans, W. S., .Co-operation and Wheat Pooling in Canada Price Current Grain Reporter, Oct. 27, 1926. </seg>
            <seg id="p128">Report of Nkdraska State Board of Agriculture "What's wheat worth?" he inquired. "$1.23," again was the answer. "It is down a little." "Yes. I was paying $1.25 yesterday." "What made it go down?" "Well, the cables were lower yesterday morning and the reports from ArsHntiim are favorable to a good crop and ready marketing. The reports from the markets of this country a little later showed a decline in harmony with the cables and so we have to pay less here." Three men in ten minutes who had wheat to sell and not one sold. An open and free market. If anyone had sold he would upon delivery of the main have been paid in full, the amount due. An open free market. That is what it is hi Hockford. That is what it is in Lincoln, that is what it is in Omaha, Kansas City, St. Louis, Chicago. Liverpool. There is not a market place in the world such as this where it is not possible lor me and my wheat to go. And every day my wheat and I are reflecting our respective influences upon these markets the markets of the world. And these influences" com - bined with all other influences fix the price. And the price makes the markets so. There, now I believe I have given you my philosophy of markets. Hut what does my philosophy of markets have to do with the proposition? Not much in a general way, perhaps, but Mr. Bixby or The Nebraska Stale Journal I believe It was who once said in my hearing that every one must determine for himself his own phil - osophy of life. And upon one's philosophy will his success in life depend. Very well, my philosophy of markets then will decide my success in marketing. But more of the open and free market. The market at Rockford is optn. Anyone can go there and buy. Anyone can go there and sell grain. It is free. Any one can sell at the price stated or buy at the price asked. The price stated or the price asked is not an agreement to sell. As it is in Rockford so it is at every such market place in Nebraska. We all know how that is. And as it is at any of these places so it is at all these places, Omaha and Chicago included. In loto? No' The influence of my wheat in the market at Chicago would not amount to as much as a bale of hay before a thousand hungry bulls or a pound of honey before as many ravenous bears. In substance? Yes'. In all these markets the seller and the buyer come together and make a sale. The difference in market hinges upon volume of business and not upon principle of operation. </seg>
            <seg id="p129">Nebraska Citor Growers' Association Differences in volume ot business renders necessary differences in practice. With the volume of 'grain that I have to sell it is not prac - tical for me to go farther to market than to my community elevators. And in consideration of my entire business it is not practical for me to go there just any day. I Itried to show that when I told about my experience in July, 1920. In stating the time of and the reasons for selling that- year's crop I also tried to show that my judgment and my need are each a factor in the solution of my marketing problems. To sum it all up I- have endeavored to show that: 1. In a general way I have the opportunity of an open market, I am free to sell at will and I have an influence in the determination of price. UNIQH P(g. 4.— The country elevator is a free and open market. Anyone can buy or anyone can sell there. </seg>
            <seg id="p130">Rkport of Nebraska State Board ok Agriculture 2. In a particular way I know something about marketing con - ditions and the influences that determine price, and. 3. In a practical way I sell when it is convenient for me to deliver, or when I need to have the money or when I think the price is right. I believe that the system is good. I believe that some improve - ment in practice beneficial to the producer is possible. But I do not believe that any practice that restricts as to when and where of delivery or that defers payment of price will prove to be satisfactory in the grain business. And in concluding I answer as I began that I decide for myself when my grain is to be sold because I have the greatest confidence in my ability to determine the time to sell. The answer is not born of conceit. It has come out of education, observation and experience. And it is in substance I believe very near the answer of any suc - cessful farmer or prosperous grain grower. THE PRESIDENT: I think the advice that I was given as a boy in college in the public speaking courses is still good: "If you want to make a good talk, have something to say and then say it in the fewest words possible and sit down." Mr. Kindig has taken that advice and tried it out at home, before the best audience poss - ible; they are extra critical. The next speaker is connected with the College of Agriculture, and it is to this college that we of Nebraska look for guidance. It is hardly proper that I introduce him; probably if I simply announce that Mr. George R. Boomer will speak on what Co-operation can do, that is all the introduction that will be necessary. WHAT CO-OPERATION CAX DO GEORGE R. BOOMER Agricultural College, Lincoln I have been very much interested in listening to the discussions thus Tar. There seems to be considerable difference of opinion on the subject under discussion, and I suppose that is a good thing. We probably never will get to the point where we will all agree along certain lines of endeavor. I believe as the last speaker said that probably the open and free market is a good thing, that we can sell when we want to, but we don't have very much to say about what we shall receive for what we have to sell, and I for one believe that there is some virtue in laying aside some of our independence and trying to do something along the line of co-operation. I used </seg>
            <seg id="p131">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association to think Henry Ford was a mechanical genius, but I don't think so any more; I have been riding around too much in Ford cars with these county agents to believe that. I believe he is a genius all right, but I believe he shows iis genius more in the marketing of his product than in the' mechanical end of it. They say when you get a good thing it is wise anc important to have it so that people can get more of it. Henry thought that all out long ago when he made It obligatory upon the person who handles Ford cars that lie keep a certain amount of supplies on hand so anybody could get more of it. He -was thinking about the distribution of the product, and putting it on the market in as large a volume as possible, at the best price possible, and they tell me he has been quite a success in marketing his product, and I believe there is an element of co - operation in the method he used. Large capital and ability to handle a product because of large capital — for that we might substitute co - operation, and that is the thought I want to present to you. The last speaker's illustration of tie bear and the honey was a good illustration, but suppose the an ount of honey had been considerably increased and the number of bear had been diminished, there might have been a different condition. ■ Those are some of the thing's we must take into consideration, and there are a great many factors eitering into it. As I said, Henry Ford has used much of his ability to control the marketing of his product through the use of the capital that he possesses. I have been studying the question of marketing and thought I would confine myself to the marketing of grain but the subject has taken a broader Held here. We have all heard a great dsal about the achievements of co-opera - tion in' the handling of perishable and semi-perishable products, but its achievements In the field of grain marketing have not been loudly advertised. Nevertheless, the cooperative elevator system represents the largest financial investment that has been made by the farmers to develop better marketing methods. These elevators represent about $100,000,000 of capital investment and ' over a, ten-year period the annual value of the grain hardled is around $700,000,000. Farm supplies as a side line amount to more than $200,000,000. These elevators have'a membership of ibout 550,000 farmers and they handle about three-fourths of the grain in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, the Da - kotas, Nebraska, and Kansas. . . Co-operative Elevators Important The cooperative elevator is largely responsible for the establish - ment of uniform methods of grading. When the line elevators were at the peak of their power they practically dominated the grain trade (1888-1905). There was much dissatisfaction among the farmers due to the wide margins taken by tho elevators. These margins were fairly </seg>
            <seg id="p132">Report of Nkbranka State Board of Agriculture uniform over the whole territory. When corn was torty cents at Chi - cago. for example, the country bids ranged from 25 to 30 cents where reight was three or four cents a bushel. There were other practices that were manifestly unfair that prevailed. One of these practices was thirty-three pound for a bushel of oats when the legal standard was thirty-two, fifty pounds of barley when the standard was forty - eiKht pounds. The method of taking dockage was not satisfactory - barley taken from wheat or wheat taken from barley was seldom paid for. and buying at a lower grade than was justified was a common custom, especially in the spring wheat area. The lino elevator system had reached the place in 1888 when it completely dominated the grain trade. The grain dealers' associations were very strong in the late nine - tie*. They included the line elevators as well as most of the inde - pendents. The Nebraska Grain Dealers had a membership of 770 members while it controlled 200 other dealer*, making 970 out of 1200 dealers in the state. Each day the association members received a card instructing them what price to pay for grain. The amount of gram which each member should handle in towns where more than one member operated was set and a fine was levied where a member exceeded his quota or paid too much. This money was used to help members who did not get their share- or reimburse members who were used to put non-members out of business. The co-operative elevator has been responsible for the elimination of many undesirable practices in the grain business. It is admitted by all concerned that the margins have been cut at least 2 cents a bushel. This would amount to nearly $100,000 annually on Ne - braska's wheat crop. The growing volume of the grain handled by farmers' elevators is another proof of their efficiency as compared with tile efficiency of the other grain companies. Farmers' elevators have done much in narrow - ing margins for grain at country points and rectifying many abuses with matter of weights, dockage, and grades that formerly existed However, their influence seems to stop there and does not reach beyond the point where the car of grain leaves the local station. Still Have Problems to Solve But very little has been done to regulate the flow of grain to market. In that respect the same condition prevails as existed before the co-operative elevator made its appearance. About 72 per cent of the wheat leaves the possession of the producer during the first three months after harvest. The fluctuations are as wide as ever The co-operative elevators have not been able to achieve complete success. </seg>

(3) They have not developed machinery, except locally, to reduce the cost of marketing. It is true that several attempts have been made. to organize to get through to the terminal markets. Some of these later, attempts, it seems to me, were based upon sound logic. But perhaps it was too much to exi ect or too early to expect even pro - fessed co-operators to lay aside all selfishness and prejudice. It is probably true that opportunity :s'so seldom recognized because it is disguised as a hard job. Any. Undertaking that must overcome pre - judice and at the same time build a foundation of favorable public opinion must of necessity requre considerable time. The pioneer, the leaders and thinkers have ofien been laughed at and even scorned. The Canadians have gone farther than we have been able to go, but I think the time is ripe for e, general forward movement along co - operative lines. The wheat producers of Canada were beset with the same difficulties that face us in the business of co-operative marketing of grain. However, they have bkn making steady, and we might say, rapid progress and are now able in an organized way to eliminate many of the undesirable factor! that entered into the marketing of grain. ' Co-operative Bnsli less Volume Knormous The co-operative movement has gained much from experience. Probably the greatest potential gain lies in the field of experience. This wealth of experience has c6st dearly, in many instances running into hundreds of thousands of dollars. Many times the purposes of co-operative organizations' are n)t understood. The. co-operative marketing activities are probably more extensive at present than many of its adherents realize. Secretary Jardine says that one-fifth of all the farm products sold in the United States in 1925 were sold by co-operative associations. This volume of business amounted to $2,500,000,000. It has been estimated that one out of every four farmers living hi the United States sells his crops co-operatively. A survey made by the Department of Agriculture shows that there are now 12,000 active farmers* business organizations in the United States. This number is more than twice, the number that existed in 1915. This number does. not iiclude co-operative banks or insurance companies.

If, over a period of years, co-operative marketing cannot bring more money into the pockets of the farmers It has failed to' realize its purpose or reach its ultimate goal. (1) Can improve production methods. The manager of the Owatana Egg Marketing Association told me that in the first car of eggs shipped from the Faribault Association, only 20 per cent of the i ggs made the first grade, while last year all the eggs from 17 district associations averaged 64 per cent first grade eggs. It seems to me that in this field lies one of the greatest and most easily understood benefits, the fact that farmers can be paid for their products on the basis of quality. (2) Can Aid in More' Orderly Marketing. — Through warehousing and processing the California Fruit Growers measure the demand from week to week and make shipments in accordance with the actual de - mands conditions of the market. (3) Can systematize distribution so as to meet the demands of different markets. This prevents shipment being made to markets that are already overstocked. Associations are able to supply the dally needs of the large melon consuming centers of the east. ( 4 ) Can help in the carryingover of surplus. Tlie Twin City Milk Producers' Association, for example, freezes large quantities of sweet cream during the season oC over-supply and puts it upon the market when the current supply becomes short. In this way great fluctuations in prices are avoided and the needs of customers can be met at all times. But we must not forget the fact that permanent over-production is a condition that is beyond the power of any co - operative to adjust and adequately care for. ( 5 ) Can increase consumption. New markets can be found by the organized efforts of co-operatives. This can be done through stand - ardizing and carefully grading and packing. "Have you had your iron today." The little five-cent packages of raisins are examples of the way that co-operatives increase consumption through advertising. Anyone who has eaten New York apples knows that New York can pro - duce apples of better flavor and more desirable quality than Wash - ington or Idaho. But apples from those states are sold In New York City and bring a price that is far in excess of the price that New York apples will fetch. This disparity in price is due to the careful grading and packing of the apples from Idaho. This standardized quality is made possible through the co-operative efforts of the western growers. (6) Advertising. In 1916 the Cranberry exchange put on a campaign of advertising in Chicago. They spent $23,000 and Increased the sales 47% per cent of that year over 1915 and 57 per cent over 1913. </seg>
            <seg id="p135">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association Co-operatives cannot arbitrarily nx prices. And co-operatives that control a small portion of t!te product can do little, if anything, to influence prices. This is particularly true of co-operatives having control of the supply of commodities that have a world market like wheat and cotton, and it is equally true of some other goods. On the other hand, those that control a relatively large acreage of the com - modity may influence prices s[ome by attempting to limit the supply - through education, tariff walls, by creating demand, by better distribu - tion of the product. and improving of the marketing service. </seg>

In eastern Nebraska we have felt seriously the hay shortage. Those in the middle and western parr of the state who produced hay are vitally interested because it influences the returns; so we have arranged a hay program. Three men are on that program, a representative of the runners who are producing, a representative of the College of Agriculture. These men will give their talks, and any discussion to lie had will hi' alter they have had their say. To start with on this question we will luiir Mr. Elmer Youngs of Dawson County. WHAT AUK THK IJKST MKTHODS OK MAKING AM AI.KA HAY? Elmer Youngs. Lexington. Mr. Chairman and Friends: In opening the discussion of this subject I i. el as though it is on" that can hardly be discussed froni all the different angles in the short, time given. In discussing the making ol hay I have only twenty minutes and I want it distinctly understood that what 1 say will he along the lines of the producer m hay in Die I'latte \ alley ol Dawson and Buffalo counties and part of Lincoln county, and undt r conditions there I will attempt to tell of tin' making of bay, and you will take that into consideration when I say there is no set nil.- in making alfalfa hay. The time to cut it. the way of handling it, and the way of stacking it to have it in good condition lor feeding or sale is supposed to be done under normal weather conditions. Hay On Market Judged Largely by Color I find in approaching the men who are buyers of hay in the lasti in part of the stab-, who unfortunately are not producing enough for themselves, that they are almost exclusively governed by the colo; - of the hay. I am sorry to say that on the hay markets of Kansas City and Omaha Kansas City being the largest hay market in the country anywhere it is graded almost entirely on color and the hay dealers in (hose cases make the grades themselves. The federal grades that we have bet n trying to establish and get in force in our great hay producing country, are controlled largely but not entirely by color. I am here as a hay grower, feeding around five hundred tons a year. </seg>
            <seg id="p137">Nebraska' Crop Growers' Association - and .1 say that hay not- graded on values and prices, but on color, is partially wrong. . .. Likes Brown to Feed The best feeding bay not only for breeding and stock cattle but for show cattle is hay that his gone through heat in the stack and gets slightly colored. I don't doubt that you men who buy hay are influenced in looking for coloi for the reason that in years gone by in our section of the country -hay of a dark brown color that is not. sound hay has been put in the bale; but that is not being done now I am glad to say. With the inspection we now have on federal grades tf you buy on grade the hay ii all inspected at the car door and the farmer knows he can't get tjy in putting up badly damaged hay. But I want you to retain in iour mind this idea; that hay because it is discolored is not necessn-ily bad hay, I see two or three in this audience who have visited my place and who have seen how we feed hay, and I tell you this 1 3 show what the cattle like and prefer in hay. My barn has a. five section feed rack going the length of it and we sometimes- put this brown hay in one position, sometimes in another, position and anotl er time' in still a different position. In our country when we mako hay we have to make hay, we can't wait for certain particular \\4ather conditions. And I have found this. Invariably since 1913 we have been putting hay in that particular barn, and in every section in the barn, where we feed the brown hay with the cattle running ti it, the cattle ate it first. Some was very dark, almost black, other was slightly brown, and that is what they like best, what we call in our country tobacco cured hay. I was telling some fellows out in our country about this talk and •one man who feeds, two thousand tons of hay a year said: "Tell them that you find almost inviriably that they like brown hay." It is more soft and the. particular idea is, when you have slightly brown hay, that it makes no difference how you handle it, in an open rack or what we call a basket ract or with a pitch fork pitch it down from the mow, it does not shatter the leaves off like the green hay. I have seen them sell green hay on the market that didn't have fifty per cent of the leaves. Sjieed in Haying is IniiioHnnt The hay making proposition in our country is not a very serious difficulty; the hay tools are not a very serious matter. We do not have many methods of curing it but do it in the wind row and partly in the swath. The fellows wl o handle quite an acreage have come to the conclusion that the quicker you get hay into the stack or into the bam, after you get it down to a reasonably good condition, the better it is. That is the universal conclusion of the men who handle two or three hundred acres. The man who handles Uventy or thirty </seg>

There has been quite an agitation in our country about this method of handling, but I find that most of the fellows are using (he same old methods thai they have used for years, but they have got away from the effort of trying to get it just exactly right before they stack it. I want to say that you eastern men are interested as much in the hay market as we are. We have not begun to produce the hay in our valley that can and will be produced, if we overcome this so-called "wilt disease" that is coming into our fields — and we will do that if we have to plow it up and start in again. Fi&lt;;. 5 —Farmers with large acreages of alfalfa find that speed in haying is very important. I was very much impressed with some of the arguments this morning, but I want every man to bear in mind that the man who buys hay and the man who grows hay have interests very mutual, and when we solve the problem of distribution and co-operation we will do it for our mutual benefit. It can only be brought about by one method, of you and I and our neighbor being willing to co-operate to make conditions better for the agriculturist who raises hay for the man who buys it.

D ° W We must Impoitnnce of Color in Hay Mr. Youngs spoke of the hay buying proposition. I have watched hay on the. Kansas City marke for years, because that is the great hay market of the world, and controls the price. In February 1922 they developed a new grade oJ hay called "Fancy fiairy," which is a eafy hay with small stems and a nice green color. I noticed that his particular grade of hay Wb shipped largely to New Jersey and the eastern states. I asked on4 of the buyers why, and he said be - cause one ton of that hay would produce more milk than three tons of ordinary hay. And that is probably why green hay sells for a higher price, because of its -mint producing qualities. . Development of Hay Tools The evolution of hay machinery is very short. First we had the sickle, then the scythe, .thei the hand rake, and then some one made a pitch fork. The mowei came next after thousands of years </seg>
            <seg id="p140">Rki'ort ok Nkhranka State Boakh ok Agriculture I can renieniber the first mower my father had, it had a platform bigger than a grain binder. After the mower came the old wooden revolving rake and then the sulky rake. We talk about saving the leaves of alfalfa, but we have given very little attention to It. The Agricultural Colleges tell us that the leaves of alfalfa contain sixty-five per cent of the protein of the entire plant and eighty per cent of the fat; then isn't it reasonable that we should save the leaves? The manufacturer did not invent a machine to do it because there was no call for it, anbNit is only since 1914 that the manufacturers have started laboratories of their own to study plant life. How would a doctor treat you if he did not diagnose the case? Water travels through the stem of an alfalfa plant at the rate of ten inches per minute it is said. Since we know that surplus mois - ture is going out through the leaf we begin to realize how to save it. Our new system is that we rake the hay with a left hand side delivery rake immediately after we cut it — the sooner the better, by driving in the samp direction that the mower goes. By using the curved teeth on the rake you can lift the hay and turn it over, putting the leaves inside so that they will siphon the moisture. out of the stem and the wind will blow it away. The growing plant takes up a great deal of moisture which it gives up through the leaves. The less moisture you leave in the leaf the less likely it is to mold; altho it is the outside moisture that causes mold as Mr. Youngs has said. THK IMUNCIPLKS OK (TIUXG ALFALFA HAY T. A. KIESSELBACH Agricultural College, Lincoln At the time of cutting, alfalfa normally contains about 70 r /r water. In other words a ton of green alfalfa consists of 1400 pounds water and fiOO pounds of dry matter. It is this dry matter of the plant which contains the feed constituents that are of value in feeding livestock. In this green condition alfalfa may be fed directly to livestock as a soiling crop, but cannot be preserved in the stack of mow. In order to store alfalfa as hay it is necessary to dry it rather rapidly after cutting so that bacterial action associated with long continued high moisture content cannot spoil it. The maximum amount of moisture which it is safe for hay. to contain under favorable conditions at time of stacking is about Z0 r /r. This just reverses the ratio of dry matter and moisture contained by the alfalfa at time of cutting and a ton of forage cured to this ex - tent has 14 0(1 pounds of dry matter and 600 pounds water. </seg>
            <seg id="p141">Neiiiiaska Cno? Growers' Association Forage containing 20—25% water is regarded as sate to storo under any circumstances. If placed in the hay barn or properly stacked the moisture content continues to lower to about 15% when it has become fully air dry. The curing process consiss in drying this excess water from the forage. The forces are identicjal with those concerned in the evapora - tion of water from any wet object. The rate of evaporation in general is increased with high temperature, dryness of the air, wind move - ment, and direct sunshine. Any wet object spread out. thin under drying conditions is commonly recognized to lose water more rapidly than if piled deep. There are many illustrations of such a principle on the, farm during the course of a year. During the last 5 years various tests have been made to apply these evaporation principles to the curing of alfalfa hay. It has been found that the rate varies with the method of curing. The question of speed is not very important, so long as favorable drying weather continues to prevail. On the other hand, rainfall on partially cured forage tends to bleach and otherwise lower the quality. If the wnt weather continues long, and extra handling is required to dry out the hay, the bleaching, shattering of leaves and other deterioration of quality is likely to become serious. • . ■ -Relution of Me hods to Rate of Curing Hay must be cured eithei in the swath, windrow, or cock or by some combination of these methods. Therefore, to get at the problem directly, alfalfa has been cur;d comparatively in these experiments by all of these practices. Tlie methods were as follows: (1) Con - tinuous swath curing; (2) Wir drowing immediately and also preceded respectively by 3, 6 and 18 hours of swath curing; (3) Cocking im - mediately and also preceded respectively by 3, 6 and 18 hours of swath curing. The farmer does not maki; moisture determinations of his hay to tell when it is ready to stack He tells by its feel thru experience. However, the principle is best brought out experimentally by showing the actual rate of water loss (luring the curing period. The hay was cut at. 10 A M., and divided into tenth acre plats which were cured in duplicate according to the prescribed methods. Where hay was cured throughout in the swath, 27 hours were required to reduce it to 30% moisture content. When cured entirely in the windrow and cock, 65 and 102 hours were required, respectively. When partially swath cured to the respective stages of (1) begin - ning to wilt, (2) well wilted, md (3) two-thirds wilted, preceded by windrowing, the time required to reduce the forage to 30% moisture was 50, 44, and 29 hours compared with 27 hours for curing in the swath throughout, and 65 hours for curing entirely in the windrow. </seg>

            <seg id="p143">Nebraska Cro:&gt; Growers' Association When partially swath cured to the same stages as above, before cocking the hay, the time re juired to reduce the moisture content to 30 per cent was 53, 45, aid 29 hours for the (1) beginning to wilt, well wilted and two-thiids cured forage. In comparison, 102 hours were required for hay cured entirely in the cock and 27 hours for forage cured entirely in thd swath. These results show clearly that the time required to cure alfalfa hay is materially-shortened by complete or partial curing in the swath as compared with wlndrowing or cocking at once after curing. This is also well illustrated by Figure 6, which records the actual moisture content of forage at successive intervals, curing in the field under various conditions, in 1924. Various tests to determine whether the normal transpiratory function of the leaves might b&lt;! utilized to hasten curing, by some spe - cial system, thru the continued withdrawal of moisture from the stems, gave negative results. • . Relation of Hay Quality to Manner 'of Curing It was shown in the preceding tests that the length of time re - quired to cure alfalfa hay niiiy be reduced by partial swath curing before raking. It is, however vital in farm practice, that this swath curing does not progress too ar before the raking is done. Unduly loog drying in the swath results in unnecessary loss of leaves thru shattering. The leaves are very thin and lose moisture more rapidly than the stems. When dried much beyond the well wilted stage, they are inclined to fall off upon handling. The dryer the hay beyond this stage, the more easily do the leaves shatter, and the greater is the loss. Hay cured overly loig in the swath to an air dry condition may in extreme cases lose most of its leaves before reaching the stack.' As an average for two tests in 1924, hay cured in the swath iintil ready- to stack, lost 20- per cent of its leaves. In comparison only 3 per cent of the leaves shattered with hay cured in the swath for 3 to 6 hours before rakirg. Practically no loss occurred where cured entirely in the windrow. Since the leaves comprise approximately half of the tonnage and contain nearly three-fourths of the protein of properly cured alfalfa, their loss by shattering is a serious and unwarranted waste. To' summarize: Wherever the curing of hay is subject to rain interference, curing practices should be followed which shorten the interval before stacking. Thin consists primarily of the use of com - bined swath and windrow cuiing. The swath curing should be dis - continued by raking before th i leaves are sufficiently dried to shatter materially. T.hls condition is commonly reached when the leaves have become well wilted. Th; hay should be placed in the stack or barn as soon as cured sufficiently that It may be safely stored. </seg>
            <seg id="p144">Rkport of Nkhhakka State Board of Agriculture MR. MILLER: Is it better to swath cure six hours than a shorter time? PROF. KIESSELBACH: That varies with conditions. If condi - tions are favorable for rapid curing, we suggest from six to nineteen hours, or probably until the next day; it depends on moisture condi - tions of the atmosphere. Sometimes in cutting hay when the air !s humid it cures very slowly and in that case probably you would not want to rake it quite as&gt; soon as if conditions were very dry. There is a tendency if you dry it too long for the stems which hold the leaves to become brittle. They are very'small and if they dry unduly long, they break in handling. The figures which I give simply show the principle that we should rake before the leaves become dry and brittle. MR. CHASE: I would like to ask Mr. Youngs how he measures alfalfa hay. MR. YOUNGS: We have overcome those difficulties of measuring hay in the stack. A little book has been published in our section of the country showing how to measure either an oblong or round stack, and we have no difficulty. I cannot give the method offhand. We find almost invariably that hay which has colored a little in the stack will run over from fifteen to twenty-five per cent and where it is a good color it will fall short fifteen per cent under the formulas that are commonly used in measuring hay. E. E. BINFIELD. Prosser: I understand Professor Kiesselbach to say that tobacco cured hay showed a loss in nutfiment of some fifteen per cent. MR. KIESSELBACH: Mr. Adams says over twenty per cent. MR. BINFIELD: Are those conclusions reached by laboratory tests or are they conclusions by tests in the feed lots? I want to know whether the feeders, who seem to be very much in favor of tobacco cured hay are correct in the conclusions they have reached. MR. KIESSELBACH: We have no data from our station. I iindf-rstand that the Kansas station has actually weighed hay as it goes into the sta-ek and also weighed the dry matter as it came out of the stack aftfr it was stack cured, and found a loss in weight. Almost any wet material which undergoes a heating process will lose come in weight. So far as I know the feeding value of the hay you take out of the stack is very good, but on the market it will not have a very high value. I do not know that our Animal Hus - bandry people have fed this brown hay in comparison with green hay. \V. H. MOORE, Marquette: I have not been in the hay game very long but I have found out that brown hay is the best hay to </seg>
            <seg id="p145">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association feed. But I don't know just how to get it; "I get it sometimes, but' other. times when I want it I don't get it. MR. YOUNGS: I have had thirty years in the hay field and have planted alfalfa with one exception for thirty years, and I believe that when you put it up with its own moisture only, you will get it. We feed a lot of it, and we sell a lot of it. When you think there is sufficient moisture out of the stems,' stack it. MR. JANSEN: We seem to have a misunderstanding about the brown hay. My hogs are nov taking the green hay I notice. I have shipped hay to dairies in several states from the Platte Valley, and have found all the dairy men want pea-green hay. I admit it cost3 a good many more dollars to make, pea-green hay than the brown hay. The sulky rake is one reason for having the hay in bad condi - tion because it turns the hay the wrong end up, and if it rains it catches all the rain that coires. Then again, the first of these side . delivery rakes that came out were very good .when it came to raking, but almost all o£ the manufacturers made a little plaything to make hay with, while we in the Platte Valley want to make hay while the sun shines. One reason why some rakes put the hay in a better condition is that they leave it turned so it will practically shed water. Some of the side delivery rakes instead of turning the hay over roll, it into a rope and the air gets so blue you forget all about hay making. MR. HALL, Douglas County: Make hay while the sun shines — cut your alfalfa in the forenoon and put it in your barn in the after - noon with -plenty of salt and you Have the finest kind of hay. MR. MAGEE: Of course we all recognize that there are different ways of handling hay under ' different conditions. Here is a story of how an engineer who made a success of himself in the steel busi - ness went out to run a 600 acre alfalfa farm. He wanted, to cure his hay quickly, so he cut it young while it had the maximum protein content. Thirty minutes after the hay is cut it is passed over a fire and is dried to a point where it goes to the granary and is sacked. This work is done with eighi. men and when they have finished with the year's work they have landled 600 acres of crop and produced a product worth $60,000 at an expense of approximately $20,000. He has done what we tried to do. here, put his farm in alfalfa and pro - duced the best quality of ha/ that can be produced. It is the result of" fifteen years' experimenting by a man who makes no claims to being a fanner but has attacked the problem with the mind of. a business man. This system simply takes the hay from a special mow - ing machine! lifts it into a truck, dumps it onto a traveling cable where it goes through a large oven and comes out dried at the other end. It produces larger reti rns per acre and produces a better pro - duct, feed more animals for Lhe farmer, makes him more money, and </seg>

AI.KAIiKA VARIETIES FOR NEBRASKA ARTHUR ANDERSON College of Agriculture Alfalfa Is Nebraska's most important hay crop. According to the lii25 Nebraska Agricultural Statistics, 28 per cent of the entire hay acreage, including both tame and wild hay, was in alfalfa. The 1,300. - 000 acres in altalfa produced somewhat more than one-half of all the hay which had an appraised value of 60 per cent of the total. The great economic importance of alfalfa, in regions "where it is adapted lies in its large and unequaled yield of palatable, high-protein forage, and in its soil building qualities. The growing of alfalfa, sweet clover, and corn in regions where these crops are adapted is well suited for the extensive production of livestock. Altho Nebraska now ranks first among all the states in the acreage of alfalfa it would seem that this acreage might be profitably extended wherever this crop is now being successfully grown. As is shown in Fig. 7. alfalfa is grown more extensively in eastern than in western Nebraska, due largely to more favorable moisture con - ditions. The sub-irrigated valleys and irrigated districts farther .west are well suited, however, to the growing of this crop. The mainten - ance and extension of the alfalfa acreage in Nebraska within recent years has been greatly interrupted by frequent premature loss of stands. This is well illustrated by the material reduction in acreage following the winter of 1817-1918 and serious losses in stand which have occurred during the past two or three years. Han]}- Alfalfa Important in Nebraska A series of tests begun at the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station in 1922 has proved conclusively that the variety and source of seed are very important factors in the successful growing of alfalfa. The winter survival and productivity of this crop may be largely in - fluenced by the seed that is planted. The commercially grown varieties range from unhardy to relatively hardy and productive for Nebraska conditions. Striking differences have also been found in these respects. </seg>

'• Just what constitutes winterkilling or the Inherent differences associated therewith are not fully understood.

Much of the seed produced in Nebraska, which for the most part is relatively well adapted, flnds a market in the adjacent states. This materially increases the amount of seed that is shipped in. Since domestic production has not met the demand for alfalfa seed, large quantities arje Imported annually. Much of this foreign as well as domestic seed is not adapted to Nebraska conditions. Recent federal seed legislation which requires the staining of all imported alfalfa and red clover seed should be of material assistance in avoiding the use of unhardy alfalfa. The color and amount of the stain varies with the source of jthe seed and its adaptability. It is required that alfalfa seed imported from Africa and Turkestan be atained red because of its general inadaptation to this country. Due to its likelihood of being inadapted, seed of unknown origin must also be Piained. red. Canadian seed which may ordinarily be regarded quite suitable for use in this State must be stained violet and all other imported seed stained green.

IMI'OUTAXT 1XSK(T VKSTS OF FAKM CHOI'S MYRON H. SWENK Chairman of the Department, of Entomology, University of Nebraska State Entomologist of Nebraska And Entomologist of the Agricultural Experiment Station The subject which the Secretary or the Nebraska Crop Growers* Association has assigned to me for discussion at this point on your program, is a very broad one. 1 1 might, for example, discuss at some length the chinch bug problem, which has been very much in the forefront during the past two i.summers. Or, I might take up quite fully the corn ear-worm and discuss with you its life history and habits— I hardly dare say Its control, for we have as yet no very satisfactory means of controlling this pest— since it has been more destructive in Nebraska during the past summer than during any summer Tor nearly two decades.; Again, the stalk-borer and other cater - pillars boring in the stalks of jcorn that might be confused with the European corn borer, and that during the present year have been frequently sent in for identification by anxious farmers, might be made the theme of a timely discussion. But I have decided to use the time available to me at this hour tolpresent to you a very serious situation of quite another sort. It will be quite generally idmitted by informed persons that the agricultural prosperity of the ktate of Nebraska depends to a large degree upon the continued successful and economical production and marketing of its enormous crops of corn and alfalfa. But it is not as .yet very widely known am &gt;ng our farmers that Nebraska today finds itself in the undesirable position of having steadily advancing in its direction the most destructive known insect pests of each of these two fundamental crops, (neither pest now being known to be present within the state— the European corn borer from the east and the alfalfa weevil from the west— and each most seriously threatening the future production and •marketing or its respective chief host crop within this state. To the person who is at all skeptical of the reality of this menace one needs onl&gt; to point out the Ontario corn fields </seg>
            <seg id="p154">Rrport of Nkiikaska State Board of Agriculture devastated this past summer by the European corn borer, or the fields of alfalfa in Utah or Idaho that have been destroyed by the alfalfa weevil. Recently the dangers of the threatened invasion by the European corn borer have been quite forcibly presented, to all of the corn belt states, including Nebraska; so now,, without minimizing in the least the enormous destructiveness of that pest and the great necessity for its effective control. I wish to draw your attention to the, for Nebraska, much more immediate seriousness of the alfalfa weevil menace to the growers of alfalfa in this state. Spread of the Alfalfa Weevil The alfalfa weevil ( Itiytonomus posticus GyllenhiU), like the European corn borer, is undoubtedly an unintentional importation, either from Europe, where it is not as a rule either abundant or markedly destructive, or else from some other portion of its range, in western Asia or northern Africa. It is not known, and now probably never will be definitely known, just when and how it gained its foot - hold in the United States. The most plausible theory is that it was brought in with household goods, packing material or nursery stock that was shipped to the district near the eastern edge of Salt Lake City, Utah, where the destructiveness of the pest first drew the atten - tion of farmers to it, in the spring of 1904. In 1905 and 1906 other centers of infestation near Salt Lake City were discovered, and sub - sequently the spread of the pest continued year by year, until in lMO the greater portion of seven Utah counties, with Salt Lake County as a center, were infested by It. In 1911 the weevil had spread to Bear Lake County in Idaho and Uinta County in Wyoming. In 1917 Delta and Gunnison counties, Colorado, were found infested, thus bringing that state into the infested list. In 1919 an infestation in Malheur County, Oregon, added that state. Also, in 1D20 Washoe and White Pine counties, Nevada, proved to be infested, and in 1923 Sierra County, California, brought the seventh state into the list of those infested with the alfalfa weevil. In th^ meantime the spread had continued in all of the Infested states, so that, by the close of 1924, just twenty years after the pest was first discovered in Utah,- the following counties were Infested: Utah, Salt Lake (1904), Davis (1909), Summit (1910),. Utah (1010), Weber (1910), Morgan (1910), Tooele (1910), Box Elder (1911), Rich (1911), Juab (1912), Cache (1912), Carbon (1917), Wasatch (1918), Duchesne (1918), San Pete (1918), Millard (1918), Sevier (1918), Emery (1920), Beaver (1920), Pinto (1921), Iron (1922), and Washington (1924) counties; 22 counties: Idaho, Bear Lake (1911), Oneida (1914).

But all of these sixty-six counties were west of the Continental Divide, and it seemed in 1924 that, barring some improbable great jump In its spread, the alfalfa weevil would not be likely to reach Nebraska for a number of years to come. However, in, 1925, the pest not only .spread into Plumas and Lassen counties, California, but was found in Converse, Fremont, Laramie and Natrona counties, Wyoming, on the eastern side of the Continental Divide. The present season (1926) has brought it to Carbon and Goshen counties, Wy - oming, thus .within a few miles of the line of Scotts Bluff County, Nebraska. Although a careful search in Scotts Bluff County, in June, 1926, failed to reveal the presence of the weevil, its entry into the •state is without question immediately at hand, and the whole situation demands our most careful attention. West of the Continental Divide, in 1926, it spread into Moffat, Rio Blanco, Ouray and Routt counties, Colorado; Esmeralda, Mineral and Ormsby counties, Nevada, and Union county, Oregon. Iiijuriousness of the Alfalfa Weevil The question that first comes to our mind in this connection is, just how .does this pest injure the alfalfa plants, and how serious and destructive a pest is it? j In answer to the first part of the question, attention must first be drawn to the fact that this insect attacks the alfalfa in two different stages of its life— as the adult weevil and in the growing larva or so-called "worm" stage. The danger done by the. larvae is very much the more serious of the two. The alfalfa larvae weevil is a light green colored 'worm' with a black head and a light stripe running down the middle of the back. When fully grown it is about a quarter of an inch long. These larvae may be found, in greater or less abundance from early spring (1. e., late March, April and May) on through the entire growing season (1. e., until in early September), but are usually most numerous from early </seg>
            <seg id="p156">Report or Nrbkahka State Board ok Agriculture June until the first crop of alfalfa hay is cut. At first they feed on the tender tips and developing leaf buds of the alfalfa, often pre - vent ing any further growth by them. But after they become more numerous the larvae attack the developed leaves and stems, where they teed until they are fully grown. Often the injury by the larvae to the first crop of alfalfa is very severe. By the time for the first cutting of hay has arrived, an infested field has its leaves largely eaten away, until only their woody fibers remain, and the whole field has at li ast the tops of the plants whitened, as if they had been frostbitten. The injury spreads downward, involving a greater or less portion of the plant according to the degree of infestation. In badly infested fields, countless ncniibers of ravenously feeding worms strip the whole plant of its leaves, and even the green stem-like covering (epidermis) of the stems is eaten away. When the field is cut, large numbers of the larvae make their way to the stubble where they feed on the stubble epidermis and the developing, tender shoots of the second crop. The amount o'f this later food is. however, so limited that the larvae devour the shoots ;&lt;s rapidly as they can develop, and further growth is impossible in i he infested field until the larvae have become fully grown and entered the pupal stage, which they gradually do all through July and August. During the period between the first cutting and the pupation of the larvae the infested field maintains a brown, dead appearance, . but it i; not dead, of course, for just as soon as the larvae quit feeding so heavily in it it starts growth in the normal manner. But by that time the season is so late that only a Iignt cutting of hay can be secured liefore cold weather arrives to check the growth of the alfalfa plants. Tlie adult weevil has a long, strong beak, provided with biting mouth parts, projecting downward and forward from the front of the head. By means of these mouth parts the weevil is enabled to feed on the green alfalfa leaves and stems all through the growing season, thus supplementing the injury done by the larvae. However, their most serious injury is apt to be in new fields of alfalfa to which they have migrated by flying in when some nearby field of older alfalfa has been cut. Such young fields are frequently killed out by the adult weevils. Its Life-History Tlit- alfalfa weevil survives the winter in the adult beetle stage. Tht- adult beetle is about three-sixteenths of an inch long, oval in form, and varies in color from brown to black according to the degree to which tlie small brown scales, with which freshly transformed specimens are covered, have become rubbed off, thus exposing the black ground color of the body. As winter approaches the weevils descend to the ground and creep into crevices in the soil or under dt-ad vegetation in the fields, where they remain as long as the weather </seg>
            <seg id="p157">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association is cold. They cannot be said to truly hibernate, however, for at any lime that warm conditions return they promptly revive and start egg - laying. Zero weather is fatal to large numbers of the weevils. As soon as warm spring weather arrives, often quite early in the season and before feeding to any extent the weevils resume activity and begin to run over the ground and deposit eggs scatteringly in the dry dead stems lying there. As soon as the plants start growth they begin climbing them and feeding upon them. Later on they deposit their eggs in .large numbers in the living alfalfa stems. The period of spring egg-laying depends upon the general char - acter of the season itself. If storing opens early, egg-laying develops gradually, the weevils resuming activity early and for several weeks running over the. ground and d ;positing their eggs scatteringly in the old dry stems lying there, bef &gt;re the period of heavy egg-laying in living alfalfa steins begins. ' tnder such conditions the earliest laid eggs may hatch before the rnaj jrtty of the eggs have been laid. But if the spring is late and the (jhange from cold to warm weather i3 abrupt, egg-laying is likely to begin suddenly. Heavy egg-laying does not, as a rule, begin until several weeks after the first eggs were laid. These are largely laid in the living alfalfa stems. The larvae appear in large numbers during latter May and early June and feed or the alfalfa leaves as I have previously described. Toward the end of J une the bulk of the larvae have ceased feeding and have spun their nocoons; but a decreasing number of the larvae remain in the field until much later in the season. During July and August the adult beetles are very active and fly about from field to field, It is at this tin e that the natural spread is greatest. As fall comes on, in September, the new generation of adult weevils frequeht the alfalfa plants less and less. Fall egg-laying by the new .generation of beetles begins in October, but few of the eggs then laid hatch before the following spring. The Quarantine Situation in Nebraska Important as it is that we should be prepared to effectively com - bat the alfalfa 'weevil when it invades our fields, as it is apparently destined to do, another problem of even more immediate and equally serious consequence is before uk at this moment — this second problem involving no less than the maintaining of our out-of-the state market for Nebraska alfalfa hay and alfalfa products during the immediate future. One of the ways in which sieveral states hope to delay the advent of the alfalfa weevil within thi ir boundaries is by an absolute quar - antine of alfalfa hay. and a c uarantine of alfalfa products, except under special conditions. Reali sing the dangerous nature of this pest, before the fall of 1923, the sta:es of. Washington, Oregon, California, </seg>
            <seg id="p158">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Nevada. Montana, Colorado and Arizona had placed quarantines against the areas then infested by the alfalfa weevil, even when it included parts of their own states. Then, in September, 1923, the inspection officials of the states of Wisconsin and Illinois learned that alfalfa hay and other products capable of carrying the alfalfa weevil were being shipped into the Mississippi Valley states— especially to Kansas City and St. Louis— from Utah, Idaho and possibly other western stales infested with this pest. The inquiries of the Wisconsin and Illinois officials indicated that while the infested states provided protection against the exportation of the alfalfa weevil Into those states which had a quarantine against them, they did not provide such protection against the importation of the weevil Into those states which did not have such quarantine. In view of this situation, a conference of the plant quarantine officials representing seven of the Mississippi Valley states, was held at Ames, Iowa, on September 14, 1923, at which time it was agreed that it would be wise for these states to put a uniform quarantine on the areas infested by the alfalfa weevil, the quarantine to at once forbid "the importation of alfalfa hay and other hays of all kinds and cereal straw which has been grown or stored in the infested district," and later probably also forbid the importation of alfalfa meal or other finely ground meals made from alfalfa hay except when certified as to certain conditions by the official inspector of the state of origin.

F, G . 14.-Nebraska needs a law allowing certain infested areas to be quarantined should the need arise, thereby preventing the whole state from being quarantined against by other states. Minnesota promulgated a quarantine to that effect on September 20, 1923. Wisconsin followed with a quarantine on October 1, Illinois on October 15 and Kansas on November 1, 1923. Iowa, Missouri and Nebraska later did the same. These quarantines all forbade- the importation of alfalfa hay and other hays and straws grown in the infested districts, but did not cover the matter of alfalfa meal which was also regarded as dangerous by some of the states. Later these </seg>
            <seg id="p159">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association states revised their quarantines so as to include alfalfa meal, except under certain conditions. The quarantine against Colorado, Utah, Idaho, Nevada, California and Oregon were against only the counties in those states actually known to be infested with the alfalfa weevil. But in the case of the state of Wyoming the entire state was quarantined. No alfalfa hay or alfalfa meal could be shipped out of Wyoming into any of the Mississippi Valley states. Very! shortly thereafter (on Nevember 17, 1923), Wyoming quarantined her infested areas, forbidding the move - ment of hay from them to otheV parts of the state. The quarantines of the states mentioned were then modified so as to take in, not the entire state of Wyoming, but only the infested counties. The example of what happened to Wyoming in the fall of 1923 when she did not promptly quarantine her infested counties serves as a warning as to what will tiappen. to Nebraska when the alfalfa weevil reaches us and we do lot promptly quarantine our infested counties.. But with us the situation is even more serious — for we do not have a law on the Nebraska statute books that by the greatest stretch of possible application would give any state agency the auth - ority to declare an intra-state juarantine. Realizing this, when the forty-third session of the Nebraska Legislature convened early in 1925, a bill was introduced that would provide an adequate quarantine law for Nebraska, including in :ra-state quarantine, and the enforce - ment of the law was to be witr the State Department of Agriculture, where such regulatory matter belong, and where they are placed in practically every other state. :;t was felt that this bill would easily pass on its merits, since so mush of importance to the state was in - volved. However, the bill evic ently had met with opposition, or at least was not well sponsored, for it was indefinitely postponed in committee. • The discovery of the sprjad of the alfalfa weevil in eastern Wyoming in 1925 and 1926 has revived very keenly the whole ques - tion of quarantines by the Mississippi Valley states. With the weevil so close ■ to oiir western bordt r;; a quarantine will undoubtedly be placed against Nebraska just as soon as the weevil is actually found within the state. In the summer of 1925 the alfalfa weevil was found in Wyoming on this side of the Continental Divide, being widely distributed in Fremont, Natrona and Converse counties. It was not yet abundant enough to be complained of, bin in some places was quite numerous. The farthest east it was found in 1925 was in Converse County at Careyhurst, which place is along the North Platte river and on the F. E. and M. V. railroad, proWably 25 or 30 miles west of Douglas. At that place it was numerous tenough that it could be caught in the alfalfa fields at the rate of morte than one weevil larvae to the sweep </seg>
            <seg id="p160">Rkpokt of Nkiiraska Static Board of Agriculture i)l a ni-t. That brought the weevil to within about a hundred miles of thp Sioux County, Xebraska, line and somewhere around 125 miles up the North [Matte river from the Scotts Bluff county line. Then in l!)2fi it was found in Carbon, Platte and Goshen counties, the latter adjacent to the productive irrigated section of the North Platte Valley in Scotts Bluff County, Xebraska. It was in fact only 40 or 50 miles away in June. 1326. We made a careful survey there thai month and failed to find it. But it is not unlikely it made its way here the present summer and may be discovered there next spring. Now. as I have stated, we have before us the problem of main - taining our out-or-the-state market for Xebraska alfalfa hay and alfalfa products during the immediate future. If the forty-fourth session of the Xebraska Legislature, now convening, does not enact legislation that will enable the legal declaring of intra-state quarantines, just as soon as it is known that the alfalfa weevil is in Nebraska the several Mississippi Valley states will notify Xebraska of their intention to place the infested county or counties under quarantine; or, if Nebraska does not quarantine ihe infested county or counties, to . protect the other as yet uninfested counties, a state-wide quarantine against Ne - braska will be declared by them. Having no law enabling the quar - antining of the infested county or counties, Nebraska must submit to a quarantining of the entire state; and, just as was true in Wyoming, for a lew months in the fall of 1923, it will not be possible 10 ship alfalfa hay or alfalfa products from any part of Nebraska until adequate laws are passed and intra-state quarantine declared. This is a matter of such great importance to the welfare of the state, that I think it well worth your time and mine that I should have .taken this hour to present the matter completely, in order that you may take any action concerning it that you regard desirable. -MR. YOUNGS: I think we are all interested in the introduction of an intra-state quarantine measure so as to prevent the spread of this weevil, and I would like to suggest the appointment of a com - mittee to present to the House or the Senate for introduction a bill for such a quarantine measure. K. K. CHASE, Stanton: In this field of mine" that I suspected of carrying the alfalfa weevil the plants seem to be decayed about one or two inches from the top down into the root. My alfalfa had all the symptoms presented here this arternoon, although I never saw any of these bugs that have been passed around. I would like to ask if one symptom is the rotting of the crown in the fall right in the middle of the mot, decaying an inch or so down from the top. MR. SWENK: When the weevil gets numerous enough to be destructive you will have no difficulty in finding the insects. We tion't consider the crown rot as being tbe work of the weevil although a similar one may be partly responsible. I don't think you have </seg>

Thire was a great deal of it in your section of the state in 1925 and I think that is the situation there; but that has nothing to do with (he root rot condition. MR. HALL, Douglas County: This is so serious that I think it might be well for the gentlemen interested In this to appeal to the Fair Board in every county in this state and have them urge their representatives in both houses to report a very strong bill along this line.

SWENK: That is likely to be taken care of by nature. The chances are that when it gats numerous enough its parsites will reduce it. In 1026 there was a set of conditions not often duplicated. The entomologists have been woiking for twenty years on that problem, and when you get down to the question, "Is there a remedy for the corn ear worm?" 1 will say there is riot. If we could plow the fields in' the fall we could control it, but we can't; if we could get dust between the silk of the «ar we could control it, but we have not found any machine that will do that.

            <seg id="p167">Nebraska' Crop Growers' Association in this section was fifty-three bushels per acre, varying from eighty - flve to nine bushels. The average yield for all of the counties in which there was one or more contestants according to federal statistics was twenty-six bushels in 192G. A striking result of high fertility and drought was shown by one field on sod which made the lowest yield in the contest — only nine bushels per acre. In spite of dry weather, however, the records showed that the ten fields which were highest in yield had been farmed on the average three years since they were seeded down. Mr. Mortimer, the winner, who grew eighty-five bushels per acre, broke his field out from sod three years ago. Mr. Frischie, who was second, has cropped the land three years since it was in alfalfa, and O. L. Legg, who was third, had his corn on sweet clover land. A study of column three of the table3 in this report, which gives the number of years since the land was seeded down, shows that nearly all of the contestants in the Eastern Region had legumes or grasses dn their fields within the last few years. In Northeast Nebraska where the practice is now very common to plow sweet clover under in the spring of its second year, it was observed in several cases where a heavy growth was turned under that the yield of corn was reduced considerably. We must remember in Nebraska where rainfall Is on the average none too plentiful, that we should not let the. sweet clover get too large before it is plowed under, else the crop which follows is likely to suffer for lack of moisture. \ • Some Cultural Factors Fields which were planted late of which though planted early were of later-maturing varieties, made the best yields, having benefited from late rains and the relatively more favorable weather of the last part. of the. season. The dry season made it possible in most cases to keep the corn fields clean with a minimum of! labor. Not one real weedy field was found in the contest. • Since the contestants are widely scattered, it is difficult to make comparisons which are of value relative to cultural practices. The average yields of listed and surface planted corn in the contest was figured up, however, for what it is worth. These figures show that 21 men who listed averaged 50.8 bushels per acre compared to the average yield of 54.7 bushels for the 29 men who surface planted. '■-.'.■ r ■■ ■■.■!'

            <seg id="p169">■ Nebraska Chop; Growers' Association - bushel. The following general; summary given in Table I shows the average figures for the 1926 and also the 1925 contest i ■ . It will be noticed that there is a very close agreement in man and horse costs per acre as shown by the records of 1925 and 1926, the average man hours per acre being 7.9 and the average horse hours 28.3. The average cost per bushel for the men in the contest for the two years is 39 cents, leaving a profit after paying two-fifths rent of $7.76 per acre. ' ' I As a matter of general interest the last two columns of Table I were figured to show the returns which might be expected by a land - owner without making reductions for rent or for taxes and up-keep of buildings, fences, etc. As an average for the 1925 and 1926 season the 88 men in the contest have had an acre return of $22.24 above labor and seed costs. .This would pay 6 per cent interest on $370.00 land. Although no allowance is made in these figures for taxes or up - keep, the interest rate (6%) is considerably above what is normally figured on investments in land and besides there is the value of the stalks and cobs. The fact is appreciated that the corn yields of the men in the "contest are considerably greater than the average, due chiefly to the fact that the contestants have; entered their best fields, particularly those which have been seeded down to legumes or grasses rather recently. It is thought, however, that the labor records of the con - testants accurately represent the average man and horse labor used in producing an acre of corn in the various parts of the state. It is believed, therefore, that by using these labor costs and the average yields of corn in a county or in a certain region that average costs of raising corn can be quite accurately arrived at. With this thought in mind Table II was worked out using" thp average yields of corn over a 10-year period as a basis for yield and the man, horse, and seed costs as shown in the contest as a basis for the costs per acre. The effect of yield on cost per bushel is shown- in. Table II. In Eastern Nebraska as shown in Table I, an average yield of 55 bushels made a bushel of corn cost 41 cents, whereas with a 33 bushel yield the cost was 58 cents per bushel. In other words the profit per acre above labor and seed costs after paying two-fifths rent was $6.04 where the corn yielded 55 bushels per acre as compared to an acre of profit of $.45 where the yield was 33 bushels. Usually profits are in propor - tion to the yields. Farmers sometimes argue that Agricultural College men, county agents, and farm papers make. a. mistake to talk so much about yield, pointing out as proof Of their stand that big yields of crops make a low price. They point out that when the United States has a very large corn crop the price is low so that figured at the market price the cash returns from a big. crop are smaller than the returns for a small national </seg>

            <seg id="p171">Nebraska. Chop Growers' Association crop sold at a high price per. bushel. From a national standpoint this is probably true, altho with corn one "must consider the fact that since more than 80 per cent of the crop is fed to livestock, the price or cattle, hogs and sheep' really more nearly determines the returns from corn than does the market price of corn itself. For the individual farmer, however, the yield per acre is very important. It affects to a great extent the profit which remains from growing, the crop. We might use this formula in determining the profit from corn or any other crop: — Income or profit (I) equals Sell - ing Price (S.P.) minus Cost (C.P.) price times the yield or quality (Q.), or briefly the formula would be: I=(S.P.— C.P.)xQ. If corn brings 60 cents per bushel either on the market or when fed to live stock, andcosts 40 cents per bushel, then a 33 bushel crop would make an Income of $6. GO per acre. On the other hand, if the. corn yielded 75 bushels, the income would be $15.00 per acre. If one could reduce the cost of raising corn or raise the market price then the profit or income would also increase. The profit from a crop is therefore determined by the three factors "cost per bushel," "selling price per bushel," and the "number of bushels raised" or "yield." The individual farmer cannot do much about price but he can very greatly affect the cost of raising^ corn by using efficient methods and T?Mation orlABoe Costs and Yields to Promts '^)^X*L,???-^.-?-- i7i m M 4fe0 aCre return*,- ; :i ss? &amp;y,.!£ta ptttf a*? r '""few 1 F4^ r vi^ T ySlvi . ■■'■' *• 'S n WIV 'y.yJyiy/.J. yiyij, „^immI 1 7 5 *** Crop - » ' • • &gt; -,- loatern Mobr«^k.a Cont«^finW To ih&lt;? larvd ovner qroto rrturns 4'Pv.

The following diagram brings out these points in a striking way. Contestant No. 35 and 36 had the same yields yet their profits varied greatly due to the fact that contestant number 3fi listed his corn and tended it with lower cost. Contrast their returns with, those from contestant Xo. 1 with the 8 5 bushel yield. Here again is a splendid example that profits depend nn big yields secured at reasonably low costs. From the labor saving standpoint, it is interesting to compare listed and surface planted corn. AHho surface planted corn out - yielded the listed corn, the net profit after labor and seed costs wero deducted was $1.20 per acre, or 17^ in favor of listing. This, as is shown in Table III. is due to lower man and horse labor require - ments in growing listed corn.

What ppr cent of the costs of growing corn are fixed charges and what per cent are subject to the efficiency or managerial ability of the farmers. In the following diagram this was worked out using a 33-bushel yield of corn, and labor, seed and rent costs used in the Eastern Nebraska S-ctlon of the contest. Approximately 5fi per cent of the costs of raising corn are subject lo the methods used by the individual farmer. What about the efficiency of the average farmer? Have we increased our efficiency to the limit? It is estimated that farmers have decreased the amount of time necesary to grow a crop of corn about as follows: Early Colonial days, 300 man hours (use of hoe) per acre 1 8 n ft 30 man hours per acre l;tftf) 20 man hours per acre '920 10 man hours per acre 1fl2fi (Nebraska) 8 man hours per acre 1!»26 (West.

It is my pleasure this morning to present the medals which have been won in this Corn Contest to the respective people who have grown the banner crops of corn under the rules established in this contest. I want to congratulate all of you upon the apparent progress -which lias been made in the growing of corn and in general farming activities as indicated by the chart presented by Mr. Stewart. I was thinking as he was mentioning the particular chart dealing with the percent or corn costs due to seed, "labor, etc., in which the yield per acre is indicated as thirty-three bushels, that possibly one manner in which the farmer could influence that chart ' more than another is in the yield per acre. I think it . wouid be safe to say that if you would chart the cost of growing the crop or corn of any or these men who are to be given- medals here today, those percentages would vary from the chart in proportion as this yield per acre varies from the figures which are there used. I think it would be a very inter - esting thing if Mr. Stewart would have a chart made of the per - centages of cost of each of these Several men who are the banner corn growers in this. contest, and see how the question of yield affects this question of percentage of cost. Coin Price on Mnrket vs. Livestock Prices But I am interested in corn also for the thing which it means to the State and the Nation. It !3 our great money crop here in Nebraska and it is the crop which perhaps more than any other has determined the degree of prosperity' in this state; but that degree of prosperity has not been determined so much by the aggregate yield or the yield per acre as. by the manner in which that crop has been used after it was produced. It is really the determining factor in the degree of prosperity to us individually as farmers and to our state at large. For example I remember last year, the United States Depart - ment of .Agriculture undertook lo determine the value of the corn crop to this State or Nebraska, based upon an arbitrary price, or rather upon the market price of that corn on December 1 of that year. While perhaps no better estimate could be made of the value of that crop than to take its market price at some particular timp that didn't very well represent the revenue which the fanners of this </seg>

I rented it out for seven or eight years previous to the last two years and the last crop grown was 30 bushels to the acre, which was largely instrumental in influencing me to return to the farm. I recognized the need of building up the soil fertility and turned to sweet clover which I. consider one of the greatest soil builders that we have. I seeded this field to oats and sweet clover and' a year ago last fall after harvesting a very satisfactory crop of oats, I put up a crop of sweet clover hay making about a ton per acre. Last spring I plowed the sweet clover under at a medium depth the last of April and first of May with five horses on a gang plow, and believe me, it takes five good horses to pull a gang plow in turning under a crop of clover. The. ground was then harrowed and the corn was listed. It was cultivated twice with a two-row machine and laid by with a single row riding cultivator. I spent 21 hours of my time cultivating the 10 acres. The corn used was a home-grown, smooth, dimple-dented, yellow variety which we have been growing about fifteen years. HOW I WON FIRST IN THE CENTRAL SECTION OF THE IO-ACRE YIELD CONTEST George Seaberger, Cozad, Nebraska My corn was raised, on medium sandy loam which has had corn grown on it for twelve years . following alfalfa. It had not been fertilized since the alfalfa sod was broken up and owing to the rolling conditions of the land, has not been irrigated at any time. I double disced my ground the early part of April and listed in corn about May 20. I listed about five inches deep and covered the corn about two inches, making close to a 7-inch depth. This deep planting gets the corn where it does not depend on the surface moisture alone. I find this practice far superior to shallow listing, although the corn, owing to the soil being colder, does not grow as rapidly the first month as shallow listed corn. I planted one kernel to the hill from 22 to 26' inches apart, which may sound quite thin to most farmers. One bushel will plant a trifle over 11 acres of corn. As soon as the corn was large enough to see the rows easily, I went over it with a two-row listed corn cultivator (go-devil), throwing the banks out and running a. two-inch shovel on each side of the corn about 11 inches apart and deeper than the kernel was planted. </seg>
            <seg id="p178">Ri-.i-out of Nkrramka State Bo.\nn of Agriculture Then about a week later I harrowed it and waited until about July 1, when I got a three-inch rain. I then used the same cultivator and threw the dirt to the corn so that the ground was about level. This is all the tending I gave my corn as it was free from weeds and had no rain to park th&lt;&gt; soil. I spent 12 hours cultivating the 10 acres In addition to the harrowing. HOW I 1VO.V FIRST IX THK WESTERN BRCTION OF THK I0-AORE YIELD CONTEST Roy Hill, Edison, Nebraska I live out in Furnas County, and while it is not spelled quite like a hot furnace, it was pretty nearly that hot out there last summer, and our corn crop was pretty short The farm on which this corn was raised is in the Republican Valley and is rather a sandy loam. I have hogged my corn down for three years and find it is a good way to keep up the fertility of the soil, and save labor, iis time isn't worth much to a hog anyhow. It was lather late when we started to work this ground and the weeds were getting a pretty good start, so we just disced it at an angle, with six mules to the disc, about the middle of April, and didn't cut the corn stalks. There wasn't very much moisture, just enough to •sprout the corn in good shape. I listed this in rows three feet three inches apart and one and one-half inches deep. After the corn was up there was quite a discussion among the farmers of our locality as lo what to do. I let the corn go until it was probably four inches high, it being so dry no weeds started. Then the boys harrowed it (wiee. The second time was after a nice shower of rain, and so we covered the water in the rows. It grew quite rapidly and then it was dry again and we didn't do anything to that corn until after the middle of June, when we threw the dirt in with a two-row cultivator. It kept dry and extremely hot so I did nothing more to this corn. Ordinarily we aim to cultivate our corn more but that is one reason we cut down the cost of production on this corn as we spent only six hours cultivating it in addition to the six hours spent in harrowing ihe ten acres. .

I believe it should be put back to alfalfa after it has been farmed six or seven years. The land on which the 100-bushel yield was raised was in beets last year. I put 20. loads of manure on the field in April; The corn was shallow-listed and was cultivated three times with a two-row machine. The first time over is the time to get the weeds if you are going to get them. I spent 24 hours in irrigating the 10 acres. I figure that the cost per acre for water was $1.00. We are under the ditch north of Cozad and do not use pump irrigation. ; QUESTION BOX '■'■■'.■ ■•. Professor F. D. Keim Gentlemen, I brought no speech with me and I do not intend to make an impromptu one. I hope to act only as your leader and yet you do the talking. I notice we have a goodly number of master farmers with us this afternoon. This kind of a meeting will give everybody a chance to tell what he knows. Now the first question is — what is the best crop to follow alfalfa? Can we hear from some - body? E. P. NOYES, Valley: In our section of the state we use corn to follow alfalfa nearly altogether. E. E.' BENFIELD, Prosser: Would it be out of order to ask another question? How nuiny years should the ground be left iu alfalfa before it is plowed up? I will say in our locality we have found that corn is decidedly the best crop to follow alfalfa. When we try to follow It with wheat, the wheat makes such a rank growth that it nearly always meets with some kind of disaster such ac rust, or a big rain comes along, and causes it to lodge. Oats gives almost the same result as wheat. Listed corn, we think, is decidedly the best crop to follow alfalfa. A. N. FRAMPTON, Holmesvllle: I never followed alfalfa with anything but corn, but in a dry year even corn does not do very well. I think a great deal depends upon the available . moisture in the soil. MR. CECIL CROWELL, Webster County: We have found that corn burns out following alfalfa, so we plant a hay crop such, as sudan grass or cane. MR. B. J. JOHNSON, Mead: When we have plenty of rain or available moisture, corn does fine. But this year my corn burned out and only made about twenty bushels per acre. MR. KEIM: Would another crop have done any better? </seg>
            <seg id="p180">Report of Nkhimnka State Board of A(iRirtr.Tr R R MR. JOHXSON: I hardly think so. MR. GEUDES, Custer County: I have a field that I don't know ■-ow long it has been in alfalfa, but I made up my mind I would sow wheat In it last fall. A neighbor told me I wouldn't get my seed back, but [ got twenty bushels per acre, and that is pretty good loi up there. Available moisture undoubtedly has a lot to do with t. I think a hay crop is a very good crop to grow. Wheat or rye is an earher season crop and therefore it seems to me would be better than corn. MR. BERGER. Cass County: We plant corn following alfalfa generally, and it seems , 0 do very well. I was in this contest and that is where I raised my corn. I made seventy-one bushels per acre. Part of this ground had been cropped one year and some of it two years. I considered this a good yield because we had an unusually dry season this year in our part of the country. MR. KIRKWOOD. Rock County: Everybody seems to answe - rs question by "if we had plenty of rainfall." The truth is we never know how much we are going to have. MR. BENFIELD, Prosser: We didn't have enough to raise a decent crop of anything out in our country. A lot of the wheat didnt head out this year. It makes no difference what crop you Plant, il ,i does not rain you will not get much of anything. MR. MOORE.

FENDER, Madison: We follow alfalfa with corn and use a loose ground lister, and find it very good in an ordinary season! MR. KEIM: I believe we can draw the conclusion from this discussion that corn over moat of the state is probably the best cash crop that we can grow following alfalfa. Shall we go back to Mr. Denfield's question as to whether it makes any difference how long we leave alfalfa before we plow it up on 2 ZstionT r0U0W ' ° an ' hear frOm S ° meOne ° n lMS ' angi; » f MRS.

KEIM: Mr. Davis, what about this? MR. DAVIS: I just want to refer back to a previous question and one point which is very important. Before following an alfalfa </seg>
            <seg id="p181">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association crop with anything it is necessary to plow it in the tall and not in I he spring. In my scheme of rotation I use alfalfa for both up-building the fertility of the land and for hay. From my experience I would say from 3 to 5 years is long enough for a field to remain in alfalfa. I don't think it would be good judgment to put a field into alfalfa that has blue grass in it,; because you can't get a good stand. I would raise one good corn crop bafore T put it back into alfalfa. MRS. SOLLERS: I thought perhaps there was enough alfalfa to inoculate the seed. ■ : , MR. KEIM: ir that alfalfa has a lot of blue grass in it and it is seven or eight years old, it might be fifteen, I don't know, the chances are you have two serious limiting factors present for good .alfalfa production. You have, blue grass and you have a lack of subsoil moisture. I think that land should be farmed for several years, unless we have a series of wet years so that the subsoil will be soaked up again.' E. M. GORUM, Cozad: I think the solution of the drought question on alfalfa is, as Mr. Davis says, fall plowing. I would also suggest fairly shallow plowing rather than deep plowing. MR. KEIM: When land is. irrigated, or on sub-irrigated land you can put alfalfa back because the moisture is not a limiting factor. MR. HALL, Douglas: | I would like to give a little experience of mine. I have had some experience with sw.eet clover, which is along the same line. One year I planted nine acres of oats and sowed sweet clover with it and that summer I got a very good crop of oats off the land and in the late summer I sold the crop of sweet clover for $65, making approximately $7. an acre off of. that piece of land that fall over and above the crop that year. The next year I put the whole field in corn and raised 16 bushels' more corn per acre off of that nine acres' of land that had sweet clover on it than I raised on the rest of the land right alongside. The following year I got ten bushels of corn more and then 1 put it back into swent clover. ••-.;, MR. KEIM: Here is the point; is it not better to plant alfalfa and run the risk of these crops that follow rather than not plant alfalfa at all? ANSWERS FROM ALL OVER THE ROOM: Yes, it is. MR. BENFIELD, Prosser: I "wanted to know whether the exper - ience over Nebraska generally is the same as this. We believe if we had moisture enough we could produce one hundred bushels of corn to the acre with alfalfa, but we find after it has been in for ftjur or five years at the most you are then making your land so lich and light you can hardly -gel enough moisture to grow a good crop of anything for a few years. Still, in the long run it pays </seg>
            <seg id="p182">Rkpokt of Nkbiiaska State Board of Agriculture and unless we do something of this kind the land will not be a good heritage to our children. MR. HEWITT, Saline County: I had alfalfa that had been in for thirteen years when I plowed it up and planted it to corn. It all went to stalks. I had another piece that had been in quite a long time and I tried deep plowing and planted wheat but it all went to straw. Two or three years is all alfalfa should be left on the land no matter what the weather conditions are. • MR. GARDNER, Pawnee County: This last year I had a field of corn part of which had been in alfalfa for about ten years. Where the field had been in corn we got fifteen bushel to the acre without much moisture and where the alfalfa was I think it would have taken about fifteen acres to make one bushel of corn. There is a lack of moisture so often following alfalfa. • I used to think alfalfa was absolutely indisputable in (he southeastern part of Nebraska, but I found farmers who said it would take up all the moisture if the alfalfa was in too long. If the sub-soil moisture is lacking I would put it In corn. MR. McELFRESH: These fellows who all have alfalfa and have had fields for ten or twelve years, I wonder if they couldn't send us some good seed. Good alfalfa seed is pretty hard to get. MR. KEIM: Can we use sweet clover instead of alfalfa? Am there some men who propose that we use sweet clover instead of alfalfa? That involves hay, of course, and we are all rather partial to alfalfa hay. Let me ask as far as rotation is concerned, can we vubstitute sweet clover for alfalfa? MANY ANSWERS: Yes sir. •■ MR. KEIM: How many say we can substitute sweet clover for alfalfa hay? Not so many, but there are a few. Personally, I think we have to hang on to alfalfa, but I think sweet clover Is a real crop when it comes to increasing the fertility. For pasture I believe we would all vote for sweet clover, but for hay we would vote for alfalfa. ' Now let me ask another question. Is sweet clover hay dangerous lo feed to cattle? MR. OLMSTEAD, Lincoln: Last year a man from Lincoln County (old me they had a number of cases of bloating on sweet clover. It made me nervous because I like sweet clover pasture. I tried the sweet clover hay proposition a few years ago, I sowed it in the spring and if you get a stand it makes good hay, but the next spring it will grow so coarse that it must be mowed early if one wishrs to use it for hay. MR. KEIM: Our veterinarians think it is serious to feed sweet clover hay and nothing else. Some claim that it causes the blood </seg>
            <seg id="p183">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association to become so thin that cattle will bleed to death during dehorning and other operations. This is not serious if animals are fed on other hay with the sweet clover. I have heard the remark that sweet clover is always mouldy, but I don't think that is always true. I think there Is a good deal of value In It and I think I would cut it lor hay rather than do nothing with it. MR. KEIM: I. wish Mr. J. M. Tollman would give us just a little idea on this sweet clover and alfalfa problem from his country. At Hemingford and Alliance how long, can you leave a field in alfalfa and what crops do you follow It with in that country? MR.- TOLLMAN? My experience has been mostly with potatoes following alfalfa, and I have decided it is not worth while. I gave such a field a thorough plowing as early as possible and planted the potato crop abbut the middle of June. The ground was in excellent condition and we got a good stand, but when a dry spell came on there was not moisture enough to develop the crop. I will not try potatoes again following alfalfa. We use some sweet clover for hay. MR. KEIM: Can we plow up the old permanent blue grass pas - tures and use temporary pastures such as sweet clover, sudan grass rye, etc.? MR. NOYES: I have been on the same farm since 1883 and have fourteen acres that has been in blue grass all that time. I ' have pastured every year on that land anywhere from eight to twelve head of cows, and we keep six or eight work horses and we turned them in nights and when we are not using them, and the hogs run on it, and it is always a good pasture, and I don't think I could afford to plow it up. That is valley land between two rivers. Some of the ditches have water in them six or seven feet deep. MR. KIRKWOOD: I drove over the state considerably last sum - mer and in the' eastern half of the state I didn't see a pasture that looked to me like a cow could live on it. I would like to know how many had good summer pastures with blue grass and white clover last summer. In Brown county we had good pastures all summer, but in the Loup and Elkhorn valleys they didn't look very good to me. The Elkhorn valley is better, but south of the Platte river I didn't see anything that looked like a living for a cow. If you have a pasture of that kind in white clover or blue grass I think it would be well to plow it up and take your cattle and horses where you can get rain. R. W. BURK, Hlckman: I have ground that has been in blue grass pasture for six or seven years and there never was enough pasture on there to feed six cows. It is on bottom , land. IT you get lots of rain you get a good pasture, but if it is dry the first hot day the blue grass dries out. </seg>

Nehraska Cnor Growers' Association be along the^ine of the subject just previous, and I will say I have forty-five acres of alfalfa ground that has been in alfalfa about fifteen years, and this last season I brok &gt; it up intending to plant it to corn providing, when late corn planting time comes there is sufficient moisture in the soil to indicate that I am liable to get a crop. If not I shall let it lay. until there is! I shall not plant corn until I have a reasonable chance of enough moisture to make a crop. If I do not plant.it to corn, and ve do get some moisture I shall sow it to millet. MR. KEIM: I am thoroughly convinced we have lands that are strictly pasture lands, maybe sandy, rocky , or hilly, but we should not break them up, primarily ft r the reason that It is difficult to seed them back again to tame grasses". I think we should rejuvinate the old pastures and keep them up. first taking off part of the stock and giving them a chance and then apply good pasture improvement methods. MR. DAVIS: I would like to hear some experiences in using scarified and unscarified seeds.; - MR. MOORE, Hamilton Cou lty: We sowed unscarified seed in the spring with rye, and we obtained a good stand of sweet clover. We sowed It good and thick. The next spring both crops came up from the old stock and from tie new seed and we had the seed running right along and didn't have to re-seed for several years. MR. BENFIELD: In discussing the comparative value of sweet clover and blue grass, white clover, and those things, do I understand correctly that one seeding of sweet clover will last only two years? MR. KEIM:. The seed that germinates and makes a plant lasts two years, but if you have seed that doesn't come up it will be left over. Sweet clover is a biennial plant. I believe if we plant sweet clover in the spring early it is a good scheme to scarify sweet clover seed. You don't care to plant something that will not come up. QUESTION: Is it necessary to inoculate it? MR. STEWART: I would not. MR. KEIM: The bacteria that works on alfalfa and sweet clover is the same and I doubt if it is necessary to inoculate the sweet clover in Nebraska because most, of it is so common the land already con - tains the bacteria. MISS MORRIS: There certainly is a difference between scarified and unscarified sweet clover 'seed. The gentleman said he didn't experience much difference in plkntiiig the two kinds. I think per - haps the seed he planted was scarified after a fashion. In sweet clover seed hulled by hand you get a vfery low germination, and I think on the whole if you want seed to germinate the first year it had better be scarified. </seg>
            <seg id="p186">Report ok Nkhraska State Board op Aoricixture MR. KEIM: When planting small seeds such as blue grass, sweet clover, alfalfa or anything else you should by all means send a sample of the seed to Miss N'orrls and ask for purity and germination ti-st. It costs almost nothing. Send the sample to the State Depart - ment or Agriculture at thp Capitol Building. QUESTION': How about sweet clover along the road? Mil. KEIM: They scarify themselves by freezing and thawing. MR. DAVIS: I wish Miss Norris would give the difference in germinating in scarified and unscarified seed and the time required. MISS 1 XORR1S: A great many sometimes plant sweet clover seed in the hull. Perhaps six to ten per cent of that seed will germinate. Fresh unscarified seed will give a higher germination and after it is scarified we expect seventy-five to eighty per cent and perhaps there is eight per cent of hard seed in the scarified. Of all the sweet clover sent in last year I think twenty to twenty-two per cent of hard seed was found in some three hundred samples. That is the average. Some of them are scarified and some unscarified. But in the hull you will not get a very good germination test on it. Another thing about scarification, don't grind it all to pieces if you use a grinder or other form of scarifier. There is too much rough treatment in scarification. MR. OREGG: What about seeding it in the winter? I get away from scarified seed by planting it in the winter. MR. KEIM: If you throw the seed on the snow you are more or less hogging it in. and personally I am not much in favor of that practice. Once in a while you will get away with it, and you forget that. I like to seed it like alfalfa. There are times when I might sow it in the winter time, but in my experience it has not been practical. The chances are it will come up the second year. MR. KEIM: Here are a few questions mentioned that I want to run over briefly. "What about treating seed corn to prevent, smut and other diseases and to protect it from rodents." MR. KIRKWOOD: We have had trouble with the cut worm, and some claim that putting turpentine in sweet corn will prevent the cut worm. I have done it for mould and other things, but will it affect the cut worm? MR. KEIM: No. It will not. How many of you think treat - ments of corn for smut and the like are very good? What has been jour experience, Mr. Stewart? MR. STEWART: The experience of Mr. Kiesselbach and others briefly is that these tilings have not been of much value. No treat-' ment you can give the seed will prevent insect damage. </seg>
            <seg id="p187">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association MR. KIRKWOOD: I used to think flat land was where the cut worms worked but they work up in the sand knolls worse than any other place, and it doesn't; make lany difference what the lay of the land is, or the kind of seed or anything, they seem to take hold of certain sections, and other sections they don't bother. MR. KEIM: I think the best suggestion I could make would be rotation, don't keep any crop in any one field too long, but keep changing the land. This is probably the best way to get rid of these pests. Fortunately most of them like one thing, and if they don't get that they starve to death. On. golf greens they tell us they don t put on heavy crops of manure as this encourages cut worms. Now another question here on our program: "How early in the spring should oats and barley be planted?" I would say about as early as you can get in there in the spring. All the experiment data available in Lincoln and North Platte show this. The next question, "Which is the best paying crop, oats or bar - ey?" I would say oats weighs a little less per bushel and has a little higher per cent huJI. Pound for pound barley will yield a few more pounds of edible grain than the oats. Another question, "Should) oats be drilled or broadcasted?" Broadcasting seems to be in the minority. Ten years ago it would have been different. Now most people say drill, and you know the reason. If I was planting ten or fifteen acres of oats and that was the only small grain I was planting would I buy an expensive drill to plant oats? The answer to that question is no, we don't want to be machinery poor. "Should land for oats be plowed or disked?" It depends upon. a lot of ithlngs. I have an idea that most of our farmers are double-disking, and as a matter of fact I don't believe it makes very much difference if you disk carefully and plow reasonably shallow. How many say it is practical to have a definite rotation on the average Nebraska farm? How many gay you rotate as you please? That is about the way it is, we do the best we can. We follow as near a rotation as we can and I think the more we can get of the idea of rotation, the better. But it is a little like making the brown alfalfa hay. The idea is to make green alfalfa hay and there you will have enough brown alfalfa hay left. Adjdurnment was then taken to 1:15 to meet in joint session with the Livestock Breeders Association. </seg>

In oriel it assures the trade that if hay is bought and sold according to Federal standards it will meet certain specified require - ments ol the grade named regardless of its source. Federal Hay Grades The grades of all classes of hay except the class Midland Prairie arc. No. 1, No. 2. No. 3 and Sample grade. Midland- Prairie has cnly the one and two grades. From 15 to 20 per cent of the hay produced in Nebraska will made No. 1 and should demand a premium on the larger markets. Crade No. 2 is intended to include the bulk ol tin- market hay as it is the grade most generally produced on the farm, while grade No. I! includes hay which is inferior, due to discoloration, excess foreign material or lack of leaves in the case of alfalfa or other leguminous hays. Hay that meets all of the requirements of the No. 1- grade and in addition contains 1 r&gt; per cent or more green color than is required lor No. 1 is put into a super-grade, as for example: U. S. No. 1 Alfalfa High C.reen Color which signifies that it is a choice product nnd should demand a "fancy"' price. Sample grade hay is all hay which does not meet the require - ments for trades 1, 2. and :s, or hay which is musty, moldy, caked, hot or ol otherwise distinctly low quality. This type of hay is gen - erally unlit for feeding purposes. (•rnile Factors Crade factois are used to determine quality and condition of market hay. The grade factors for alfalfa or other legumes listed in order of their importance are: (1) leanness, (2) color, and (3) foreign material. The grade factors for prairie and other grass hay3 are ill color, and (2) foreign material. </seg>
            <seg id="p189">Neoraska Chop Groovers' Associatio.y Leaflness is the most, important grade factor in legumes becaus-.o the leaves contain more than 70 per cent of the protein found in the entire plant, and in addition are the most palatable and digestible part of the hay. The leaves. of the leguminous plants will shatter as a result of late cutting and over-curing. Grass plants retain their leaves; consequently leafiness is not a grade factor in such hays as timothy and. prairie. Color is the most important factor for grass hays and is the second most important factor in. leguminous hays. It oftentime hap - pens that hay of poor quality will sell well if it has a good green color. . Foreign material which is a secondary grading factor in hay refers to weeds and. other coarse plants not suitable for feeding pur - poses, also corn and corn stalks, stubble, chaff, and other objection - able matter found in hay. Foreign material is pure waste or dockage and is usually rejected by livestock. The price of hay is lowered according to the percentage of weeds or other foreign material present. Points to Consider in .Meeting Grade Requirements • To prevent loss of leaves by shattering it is best to windrow legumes as .soon as the moisture content is sufficiently reduced lj prevent damage from moulds. Legume hays should be handled as little as. possible after the leaves are dry to prevent loss by shattering. Good green color indicates that hay has been cured in such a way as to' have received practically no damage from sun, dew, or rain. Sunlight destroys the green color in plants and when accom - panied by heavy dews or rain discoloration is more pronounced. Rapid curing will decrease the loss of color. Also windrowing partially cured hay to decrease the amount of surface exposed to the sun will help td preserve color. .1 Foreign material generally occurs in hay cut from meadows that have not been properly cared Tor. Pasturing meadows during wet weather or extremely dry weather will reduce the stand of valuable grasses. Burning is also detrimental to valuable hay plants in any kind of meadow. The clipping of weeds to prevent their seeding, and clean raking after each cutting or hay will also reduce the amount of foreign material in baled hay. It is well to remember that unfav - orable conditions tend to reduce the valuable hay plants in a meadow and premit weeds to get a start. Two day schools for the purpose of teaching the Federal grades have been held at Elm Creek, Overton, Alfaira Center, Cozad and Gibbon: Alfalfa grades were presented in these schools. In the Elk - horn Valley, schools for the study of the prairie hay grades were .held at Inman, Atkinson, Stuart, and Bassett. </seg>
            <seg id="p190">Report of Nebkaska State Board of Agbicultubb At various limes schools are held by the Federal Department at Kansas City for the purpose of training and licensing Federal, hay inspectors. Three of these inspectors are now located at points in the Platte Valley where local inspection may be had on alfalfa liay. It is worth noting that large orders for inspected hay are being received from Wisconsin, Minnesola, and other deficit areas. Several points in the prairie hay territory are considering sending men to the grading school to be held in Kansas for Nebraska men in January. MR. K. S. WALLEEN, Ceresco: What is the cost of inspection? MR. BOOMER: At Kansas City, $1.00 a car and up; for Platte Valley hay I think it is |2.00 a car. That is left to the discretion of the local growers. They have sent some men to Kansas City Hay schools from the Platte Valley and these men are now inspect - ing hay at shipping points. They have passed an examination and are licensed and are under the authority of the Federal Hay Inspector. The Secretary of Agriculture made an agreement with the Federal Department to make the federal grades the state grades, and the certificate is prima facie evidence in any court of the quality and condition of the hay. QUESTION: Where is this hay inspected? MR. BOOMER: Where they have local inspection they inspect it as it is being loaded at point of origin. This is now being done at shipping points in Dawson and Buffalo counties. QUESTION: Wouldn't it be rather unhandy if you had two or three carloads of hay to inspect and the inspector was a hundred. miles away? MR. BOOMER: Yes, it would not then be possible to inspect it at the shipping point, but you can ask to have it inspected at the important markets such as Kansas City. QUESTION: Do you have to buy this through the dealers at Kansas City or can you buy it direct? MR. BOOMER: You can buy it direct. That is one of the desirable features. QUESTION: Has there been any action taken by the Govern - ment inspectors who grade this hay certifying that it is free from insect pests so these pests can't be carried by bale from one farm to another? THE PRESIDENT: The safest thing is to buy ia areas free from thp weevil. The weevil has not yet been found in Nebraska, the State Journal of this morning to the contrary. </seg>

It was a short job after you got at it. Some of my neighbors are still filling that way, and to my judgment it is proof that silage is almost indispens - able.. The way I get away from this work and worry now is to cut the silage in the field. Two men and three boys large enough to drive a team can put the silage in as fast as one binder can cut it. The machine I used is called the Teeman, made somewhere in Iowa. It is run by a regular Ford engine pulled by horses. We used to cut our silage in half-inch lengths while our neighbors cut theirs In inch lengths. They used the same style cutter that we did yet they could pull their cutter with much less power than we did, so when I got a new machine I set it at a one-inch length, and with a few stalks going into the cutter at a time, a good many leaves and sticks will go through without being cut up very much. It makes rather coarse silage but it keeps just as well and the stock eat it just as well, and it- is nicer to handle with the fork. I would rather have the coarse silage than to have it cut too fine. I run a small bunch of cows and feed out as baby beef, about one lot of calves a year. I keep silage before them all the time but clean the troughs out every day and give what they leave to their mothers. I also keep silage before the cows all the time, and give what they leave to the horses. I have' given my horses nothing but. this silage and they come through better than if they had grain. It doesn't cost any more and the silage is cleaned up. I feed these horses and cows with this as long as the silage lasts which is usually the last of June or the first of July. Then I don't have to worry about feed till the snow flies again. I give the calves alfalfa hay. I feed corn and sprinkle a little oil meal or cottonseed meal in it and I have a ration that I don't need to look any farther for. The commercial mixtures don't interest meat all. If I had to do without the silage I would have to reduce my feeding. I have a gray tile silo. I had </seg>

We .commence feeding silage rather sparingly and increase it to about fifteen pounds. I believe that as you finish the cattle you should cut down on the ensilage and reed more corn, cottonseed meal and alfalfa hay. I think Nebraska should have more silos. Of course you will be governed somewhat by the manner in which you are running your farm. If you have plenty of alfalfa hay it is not as essential to have ensilage; but we find the better feed you have the better your cattle will do. 1 think the silo pays b(gger in years of short crops, when the corn doesn't yield. QUESTION".: What do you figure that silage costs you in an average year? MR. STAHL: It is not as cheap as some people believe it is. The cost of labor in putting it in is considerable.

OLMSTEAD, Lancaster County: What I know about silage from personal experience with it is nothing at all. I never owned one and never use silage, and while I am not going to say Nebraska needs more silos, I. think it does. I think anything we can do to encourage the people to raise their feed on their farms is an advantage. In this part of the state where alfalfa grows like weeds if we give it any chance at all I don't see why we should go to all this work and expense when alfalfa itself .to feed cows is as good a thing as we can get. In a dairy experience of fourteen- years I never had a cow that went off feed eating all the alfalfa sh'e wanted. Professor H. R. Smith, who used (o be here, 1 said you- didn't need any scale's, all you needed for measure was a pitchfork and a scoop, and let them have all .they .want and they will balance the ration themselves. A cow that will not pay for her feed in milk is good only for beef; that is our policy and we have a herd of cows second to none in Nebraska. Last year from a bunch two years old to which I fed alfalfa for : roughage entirely and which made an average of 412 pounds of butter - fat, the profit above the feed cost was $119.40, 'and I used no com - mercial feed at all.' The cost of roughage per cow, including pasture, </seg>
            <seg id="p194">Rkpoht of Nkhkakka State Boakd of Agriculture was $65.55 and the cost of grain per cow was $40.24. I don't have to figure on cottonseed or oil meal or anything of that kind Tor protein, all that is In the alfalfa hay. I am strong for alfalfa. I lived in (he shorl-grass country a good many years ago where we couldn't raise alfalfa. One day I picked up a farm paper, I believe it was the Breeders' Gazette, and found a letter from a man who told of weighing his hogs and pigs in the spring. Then he fed them on alfalfa pasture and he weighed them again in the fall and the gain was sur - prisingly high. I resolved that if I was ever where I could raise alfalfa, it would be my principal crop and that is practically what I am doing now. On this rolling land while you have it in alfalfa there is ihe advantage that it doesn't wash. Another thing that made me strong for alfalfa was an article in the Country Gentlemen telling of a farm in New Jersey where they kept 1900 dairy cows. They buy their alfalfa mostly from Kansas and they claim it is the cheapest feed they can get. They experimented with it and they are now raising alfalfa that they cure in a mechanical dryer. They claim during the alfalfa season this dryer will dry it in an hour, when it is ready to go in the sacks as ground meal or as ground hay. They say they can do that cheaper than to buy the bag here. When we can do all that without the labor and expense, what is the idea of silos? I am not speaking of beef cattle, but dairy cattle. Three men will handle thirty or forty cows, and from nine o'clock in the morning till lato in the afternoon they haven't very much to do. You don't have to call on your neighbors to help you; with alfalfa you are doing your work all the time yourself and holding the expenses down. The first thing we have to think about in any kind of farm labor now, if we are going to make a dollar, is to hold the overhead down; that is the only way we can make any money. Should Nebraska Have More. Silos? F. A. EGGERS, Martel: On farms on which livestock consumes all of the feeds grown on the place, at least one-half of the feed given lo stock cows, dairy cows or feeding steers should be silage. Twenty- ■ five acres of alfalfa, twenty-five acres of corn in the silo, with other clean-up feeds of the place will, without doubt, produce more beef or milk than the same fifty acres handled In any other way. In the face of a short hay crop and the corn almost a total failure in many localities, the remark was often heard last July and August, that you men with a silo can save your corn crops and get something out of them, which, to a large extent, was true, but that doesn't make silage any less valuable next fall with a normal corn crop of ten or twelve tons per acre than it was last year with half the tonnage. The better the corn the better the silage, the more economi - cal the feed per acre basis. With a shortage of alfalfa hay and the </seg>
            <seg id="p195">NtURASKA Crop Guowers' Association present surplus of cottod-seed meil. stock cattle or beef cows can be wintered very nicely on a liberal ration of silage, a little other roughage such as straw, cane or sudan hiy, one pound of cotton-seed meal per day, and If a little alfalfa is available so much the better. One of. the most common objections heard to silage is the cost and labor of filling the silo. As to the cost and labor of filling on our own place, on two silos the last thj-.ee years, working about a nine-hour day, we put in at the rate of eight or nine tons per day per man with a crew of eight men, or about seventy tons per day. Figuring labor of eight men at 53.50 per day and overhead on cutter and tractor at $15.00 or $17.00 per hay makes a tonnage cost of about sixty-five cents; and help is not hard to get. A part of the corn crop, or in case of emergency, such as drought or short hay crop, all of it, cannot be stored more economically, put into a handier package or put up so it will be relished more by cattle and made more feed per acre', than putting it in the silo. One of the very nicest ways \o test the value of silage is to add to and take away from the milk cow ration and note how the produc - tion will fluctuate in its favor. I would like to tell Mr. Olmstead that I would like to loan him a load or two of silage. Should Nebraska Have ..More Silos? C. B. NOYES, Douglas County: My object when I built a silo was two-fold: one was to changej the land into winter wheat without going through the process of a crop of oats which hardly paid the expenses, and the other, was that we could feed it at a profit to fattening cattle, and that is what we used jit for at first. And it worked out pretty well in that line. We found that was the best way to get our winter wheat in, and it yielded as heavy as it would by putting- in a lot of extra work, and then, as I say, I was very pleased with it in fattening cattle, and if I were feeding now I would not attempt to feed without a silo. • Briefly, you can put an animal on feed and he will never get off. You can always keep him full of silage and he will do well, and be contented. As to how much corn you should mix with the silage, you can reduce the silage as you increase the corn. I used to buy steers and winter them through. They would get pretty fat on pasture, then I would put them on silage and cotton - seed meal. They had no corn except what was in the silage. We had quite a neighborhood feeder who looked at my cattle and would hardly believe but that I had not corn-fed the cattle heavily. Since then he has added silos to his feed yards. We have six heavy feeders in our vicinity and now four are using silage., If you use silage for beef cattle you should let it get much more mature thai; for dairy cattle. For six years we have fed it to dairy cattle. Without </seg>
            <seg id="p196">Rkpoht of Nkiiraxka Statk Board of Agricli.tuuk silage we would have had nothing because the alfalfa killed out the last six years, a thing that has never happened before. It killed out as last as we could Ret a stand and we have had to ship in alfalfa to feed and depend on silage for our principal feed. We don't pasture n , uc h now, just a little in the spring, but silage is fed winter and summer just the same. We feed about ten tons of alfalfa hay und silage but if the alfalfa has to be bought it makes it pretty expensive, this year especially. I believe one trouble with the silo is thai we have tried to run outfits which are too large. I was in Wisconsin during the silo filling season and I was surprised to find thai just about every silo had a cutter beside it. They changed work, perhaps some, but they just kept filling the silo all the time themselves, perhaps changing with one neighbor. But they certainly didn't run any hie gangs as we do down here. Now that cutters have been improved greatly, and are not so expensive, we should not try to do too much with one cutter so that part of the silage goes in rip,, and pan too sreen. We have just put up about nine hundred tons a year the last three years and run just our own outfit. Killing Silos Hard Labor Perhaps yon would like to know how we handle our labor. We have several men of our own and Tiave to hire about as many more. It is heavy work and you have to pay extra money. If your hired man is working by the month and an extra man gets more money hy the day, soon he is sore. We give our hands $1.00 a day extra for silo filling and harvest, and that brings their wages to about what Hie extra man gels. We pay about .$4.50 a day for labor. We use just one man in the silo lor distributing and packing. We read in the papers thai a man was unnecessary in the silo, so we tried it out and n worked fairly well. But it doesn't distribute the corn and leaves and stalks well. I think if the silage is real dry moro than one man is required to pack and level it. 1 want to speak of our racks. I built one the first year and I lave never had cause to change it. Now the neighbors use the satiw kind a great deal. Lots of farmers when filling a silo take one side off of the box hayrack and use that, but it takes too much time to '!o it 'hat way. and is too hard. Somebody always finds fault with the silo filling because it is too hard work. 1 bought some low wheels for our rack wagon, about 24 to 2fi inches high for the front wheels and 2K or :id inches for the back ones. Then I took two 4xG's, 16 feet long and laid them across the bolster. I then nailed inch boards six feet long, cross-ways. That made a rack sixteen feet long and mx feet wide. We laid a four-inch board across the edges to keep the boards stiff and put up standards at each end. That makes a low iark and you can just walk up and lay a bundle on it without any </seg>

            <seg id="p198">Report of Nebraska- State Boaro of Agriculture SILO CONSTRUCTION IVAN D. WOOD College of Agriculture, Lincoln I ibink perhaps the best thing I can do is to bring to you the experiences of several hundred men with whom I have been visiting each year. I may perhaps be able to give you a few ideas on Silo construction and something regarding the cutting of ensilage in the field. Mr. Xoyes lias referred to the Ronnlng ensilage cutter invented by two brothers in Minneapolis. They worked for many years and never seemed to exactly perfect tills machine but now that the Inter - national Harvester Company has taken over its manufacture I presume we can look for considerable improvement in its operation. I believe there is a future for the cutting of ensilage in the field and for those who do not know how this machine works I Will say that it is a cross between a corn binder and an ensilage cutter. It is attached to the side of the tractor and has only one wheel. The power take-off is at the rear, directly on the end of the drive shaft. Just what the future of this machine is remains to be seen, but I believe it will eventually be practical for the man who has a pit or trench silo. I think them has never been so much interest in silos for the last fifteen years as there is at the present. You men in eastern Nebraska have no conception of what conditions are fifty miles west of Lincoln. In one county this fall I saw four herds of cattle being driven out liecause there was no feed. These men should have had silos. In some places there was not sufficient feed to fill a silo. I have yet to find a man who says ensilage is not a good feed but on the other hand they always mention the labor factor. The disappearance of the silo has been largely due to the matter of labor. Consequently, if labor is the big factor perhaps here is the point to begin our work. Trench Silos In this discussion I will deal directly with the trench silo, inasmuch as interest seems to be centered around it. Several trench silos were used with good success in Nebraska in 1925. In Canada and North Dakota good results have been obtained by storing ensilage in oblong pits for winter feeding. These trenches vary in size, depending upon the size of the herd and the length of the feeding season, but on an average they are made 8 feet deep, 8 to 10 feet wide and from thirty to fifty feet long. Some were dug in the clay and used with no lining or cover with good results for an emergency job, while the more expensive nnes were lined with concrete or 2-inch plank. The advantages of the trench silo are: 1. Cheap first cost for emergency use. </seg>

Ksts which have been made in Kansas and Texas indicate that lor rattle and lions the grain sorRhuins have about 85 to 90 per cent or the feed value oi corn, pound for pound.

If corn was selling for Tile per bushel the grain M.rghums would he worth about K?," lo fi5c per bushel. Grain sor - ghums must be [.-round before reeding. This would increase some - what the spread between the relative market values of the two feeds ■ since it is usually not necewary to mind corn. Th- Kansas Station has conducted a three year test or feeding mound sweet sorghum seed to dairy rows as a substitute for corn. In this i xperlmenl alfalfa hay. corn or sorghum silage, and oil meal wen- fed in connexion with the ground corn or sorghum seed. The results showed that the cattle maintained the same weight, and gave the same amount of milk on both rations, but those fed on the unroot sorghum seed nave a 5.5V, tnrrea.se in butterrat production. This is rather startling information, slncf sweet sorghum seed has usually not I n thought of as a valuable grain feed, on account of the presence ol considerate quantities of tanin in the ripe seed. It is all the more unusual when it is considered that the sorghum seed is lower in fat than is corn. In these tests both corn and Horghum silage was used without making any apparent difference in the results. The Kansas Station linds that silage from coin, sweet sorghum, and kaffir have about the Minn- feed value. The Bwi'i't sorghums usually produce more tonnage per acre and would for that reason have an advantage over corn.

The sorghums on the other hand revived and iiiadc a much greater forage yield than did the corn. Should the fiost have stayed off a little longer large {{rain yields would have been obtained. This illustrates quite well why grain sorghums are a l)ior«' profitable crop in Kansas than in Nebraska. The longer growing sea - son in Kansas allows time for the grain to mature after the fall rains rnme. Knse of (ivowinjj Sorghums vs. Com Altl.o ilie yield of grain sorghums may be satisfactory, another factor which must be considered is that of problems involved in pro - duction, harvesting and stoting. One of the first difficulties in pro - duction is the matter of getting a stand, drain sorghums must bo planted slightly later than corn for the best results. The seed is likely to rot in the ground if the weather is cold. It is harder to get stands with some varieties than with others. Feterita in particular seems to be the poorest in this regard. Germination is usually better when the seed is surface planted. Planting after June 1st is usually too late for most varieties. It is usually necessary to plant the seed considerably thicker than the stand desired, on account of the low germination of the seed and tin- high mortality of tin young plants. For the grain sor - ghums a stalk about every 4 to 5 inches usually gives the best yield of grain. The sweet sorghums will yield better with a slightly thicker stand. Th" sorghums make a lather slow growth during the early part of ih« season, which makes them difficult to cultivate without cover - ing; otherwise the cultivation is no different than that for corn. For the average grower in Nebraska the harvesting and threshing of the seed seems to present the biggest problem. The most common way is to cut the Whole crop with the corn binder. The heads are later cut off with a large knife, and threshed. In the large grain sorghum producing areas, headers are often used which make harvest - ing o,uile rapid. The threshing is done with the ordinary grain separator. The cylinder is usually run at a slower speed or part of the concaves are removed. Otherwise the seed is likely to be cracked badly. Cracked seed moulds finite easily and causes storage troubles. S'orghum must be very dry when threshed or the grain will heat in the bin. 1'iice of Sorghums Kansas riiy is the largest market for sorghum seed. The prico is usually slightly higher than thi-.t for corn. The present price is quoted at around sue while corn s s around fi8c.

Board of Ar.Rlcri.TrRK and which can be made available at a fairly reasonable cost per unit of protein as In (he main they are highly concentrated products and contain relatively large amounts of digestible nutrients. For hogs, tankage is probably the most satisfaclory supplement. This contains 60 per cent protein which is in a very highly digestible form. As a general rule, tankage can be procured at a price not to exceed $fiO per ton. Upon this basis each .pound of protein in tankage costs 50 cents. Shorts, a by-product of wheat milling, is used to some extent as a protein feed for hogs, however, shorts contains only 17 per cent protein and consequently where a freight haul is necessary the relative cost of the protein is apt to be excessive. Shorts usually sell around $35 per ton hence the protein costs $1 per pound. As a feed for cattle, hogs and sheep cottonseed meal is worthy of consideration. This has been available at a relatively low price during the past two years. Cottonseed meal contains varying amounts of protein, however, prime cottonseed meal such as is usually sold in Nebraska contains 4 3 per cent. During the past season this com - modity has hold at from $30 to $-10 per ton, consequently a pound of protein in cottonseed meal has cost from 35 to 50 cents. Cotton - seed meal has been used for hogs in a mixture with tankage. Experi - mental work has tended to ?how that the use of equal parts tankage and cottonseed meal supplies a rather cheaper protein addition to the farm ration than tankage alone. For cattle of all kinds cottonseed meal or cake has been a won - derful help in cheapening rations during the past two years. This if especially true where very little alfalfa or other legume hay has been available. Cattle receiving a ration of one to two pounds of cottonseed meal or cake per day in addition to corn and non-leguminou? roughages have made practically as satisfactory gains as those re - ceiving corn and alfalfa hay. In fact, the addition of cottonseed meal to a corn and alfalfa hay ration has proven advantageous at the Experiment Station in a number of trials conducted during the past year. The addition of cottonseed by-products to the fattening lamb's ration has likewise proven to be highly successful as it has resulted in slightly higher gains and at the same time one that is somewhat cheaper. Ijinseetl Meal vs. Cottonseed Meal Linseed meal has been one of our major sources of protein ill Nebraska during the past. However, at the present time, linseed meal is selling so much higher than cottonseed meal that it has lost its prestige. When linseed meal is procurable at a price of not to exceed five doHars per ton more than cottonseed meal, one probably is justified in using it. Most animals relish linseed meal rather more than they do cottonseed meal. While it contains only 34 per cent protein, this is somewhat more highly digestible than that of cotton- </seg>
            <seg id="p207">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association - seed meal and stock seem to do rather better upon it. Inasmuch as. linseed meal, has sold in Nebraska during the past two years at from $50 to $60 per ton, the protein which it contains has cost upwards of a dollar per. pound and consequently from the standpoint of Its iise as a protein supplement the financial advantage has been all but extinguished. It is just possible that linseed meal will not in future years be available to Nebraska feeders at as reasonable a price as cottonseed meal. The total production of cottonseed meal in the United States will probably be large while indications seem to point to a reduced production of linseed due to the fact that flax is not grown as extensively as. in former years. In summarizing, it would' seem best that our Nebraska livestock people try to produce their own protein feeds; This can be done by util - izing alfalfa, sweet clover, red clover, and alsike clover to the fullest advantage. Any of these . crops will produce a splendid hay that is quite high in protein. Some, such as sweet clover, require con - siderable more skill in handling as hay crops, however, considering that conditions in most parts of Nebraska are favorable to the pro - duction of these legume crops, it would seem that our safest bet would hinge around their utilization to a fuller extent. It is just possible that the highly concentrated protein by-products enumerated above will always sell on a relatively high basis per ton and should such be the case, the cheapest protein available will be that derived from the legumes. • -. r Vl*fS3Ll itM '"' *'^'^"iEJ^S8B»Nr^~^5iig^sAJMiifi &gt; r&amp;£ mm '*|J Fio. 34.— Professor P.

The purpose of this train was to stimulate interest in better seed, more legumes, weed con - trol, and in treating wheat to control smut. The organizations which assisted in the work of running this train werf the College of Agri - culture, Nebraska Crop Growers Association, Omaha Grain Exchange, and the Union Pacific Hailroad.

There were three exhibit cars; one showing the methods used in developing new varieties of grain, the importance of certified seed, how to prevent leaks in the production of wheat, and practices which' mean greater profit to growers of small grain. Another car carried exhibits which emphasized the importance or legumes, the proper source of alfalfa seed, and the control of soil moisture. A third car prepared by the. Omaha Grain Exchange showed the methods that are used in handling grain at the terminal markets. Exhibits in this case also stressed the importance of producing wheat free from' rye and smut. Fi.i. 36.-At.the last stop at Buslinell the key to.tlie town was presented. Farmer Hippocket and Senator A. H. Miller are looking it over. At each stop two buShels of Certified Nebr. No. GO winter wheat were given to each of two selected farmers. This wheat was cer - tified by the Nebraska Crop Growers Association and was donated to the farmers by Carl It. Gray, President of the Union Pacific. Each farmer who. received this wheat agreed to grow and thresh it sep - arately and to report as to its yield and other qualities in comparison to his other wheat. • Many of these farmers have requested the Crop Growers. Association to have this wheat certified in 1927 so that they may becsme producers of certified seed. All of the wheat that was given away was treated with copper carbonate. This treatment was done on the flat car which was a part of the train, and was used in the public demonstration of the proper method of seed treatment. A" total of 22,923 people passed thru the exhibit cars of the train at the 43 stops. </seg>

This association, like many others is lefi pretty much to the president and the secretary to run and very often they do not get many ideas from the members as to 'what they would like to have done. There have been some suggestions rroni the members that we drop the corn show that we have been carrying on for about seventeen years. All of you have seen the corn show this yar. There are about 77 entries. Some say if we put in more money we can probably have a larger show The pre - iiiluiiw are fairly liberal and I doubt whether by increasing those we would increase the show much in size. It costs us three or """ liundrf&gt;fl (l ""'"-s each year, and some have suggested that it would do the state more good if we would put that money into a wheat contest, or some other line or activity. If any of you have any suggestions we would be glad to hear them. This year we did drop the small grain part of it because it seemed so very small I would like to hear from Mr. J. D. Hasik on this. MI!. HASIK: I don't know whether I can throw any light on this corn show. I remember in if)03 when we put on the first corn show we didn't have tables enough on these grounds to spread out the corn we had, and every year for about ten years the show was mat big. nut it seems to be that no matter what it is. we get tired nl these things and want to start something new, so I think Mr Stewart's suggestion of dropping the corn show entirely and spendin-' the money on ten acre yields, or something like that would probably .stimulate interest among the farmers. If we do that I would not make it on corn and wheat alone but would include oats and some "ther things like sugar beets. I would not tie it down to two crops MR. DeLONO. Oloe County: We usually send up quite a number or exhibits to the State Corn Show, but I can see where the interest certainly sort of lags al this particular time. We usually, have one or two corn shows in our county and our people patronize those shows fairly well; and then when you ask them to pack their samples and •send them up here they don't evidence a great deal of Interest </seg>
            <seg id="p219">. Nebraska Chop Growers' Association* . MU. STEWART: Is it because ; the. money is not high enough or. because they think they can't win? MU. D.eLONG: No, it is more that they are tired of it because of our shows. there. THE PRESIDENT: It occurs to me that perhaps one reason the interest in this show is lacking is because it is spread over the entire state. It is pretty hard to get men in the western part oE the state, who can't come and see it, to gro.w corn for a show five hundred miles away. They, might take more interest in a sugar beet contest put on at home. MR. GROSS: I think one reason a good many people do not show- corn is because (hey think they can't win, and there is some - thing to it. We come back every year and see the same fellows win the premiums, and it is pretty hard for new fellows to get in when they can't raise and select the kind of corn it takes to win. This corn show has been going on long enough to develop certain fellows who know how to pick out winning samples. .MR. LEGG: . In some organizations they have an amateur class and a professional class, and after a man has won a prize in the amateur class he advances into the professional class. MR. ROLAND SMITH: I am interested in corn and practically nothing else, and I would like to see the corn show continued; and I am in favor, if we. do continue, of changing the classes and making a professional and an amateur class,. as the gentleman has just men - tioned. ; . It was moved, seconded and carried that the matter of. deter - mining whether the corn show be put on or not, be left to the executive committee. MR: PRESIDENT: We are now ready to hear the report of the Resolutions Committee, for which I believe Mr. Kuska will report. REPORT OF THE RESOLUTIONS COMMITTEE WHEREAS, The Nebraska Crop Growers Association are in An - nual Meeting assembled at the College of Agriculture, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska; and WHEREAS, the handling of alfalfa as a major crop of Nebraska has been threatened as we have, during our annual session, learned, by the presence of Alfalfa Weevil on the borders of Nebraska; and WHEREAS, there does not exist on the Statute Books of the State any provision for the quarantining of an infected section of Nebraska, should the weevil infest it; and . </seg>

            <seg id="p239">233 Nebraska State Dairymen's Association - iltt Memtim IN APPRECIATION OF A LIFE OF SERVICE OF OUR FRIEND AND CO-WORKER, HON. S.'c. BASSETT OF GIBBON, NEBRASKA • In behalf of the Dairy Industry ot Nebraska we hereby express our appreciation of one of our great leaders, Hon. S. C. Bassett of Gibbon, Nebraska, who on March 14 1926 was called from this life. We regard Mr. Bassett as the father of Nebraska dairying. Coming to the State in April, 1871, he labored faithfully and well in the great field of agriculture, and has given his best service; especially to the development of the Dairy Industry.. From the early seventies, as a homesteader in Buffalo County, he took a leading part in matters pertaining to agriculture and edu - cation. He and a few of his friends were the founders of the State Dairymen's Association in 1885, and he was Its first president. He was a member of the committee that petitioned for an. Agricultural College and was successful in bringing this about. He played an important part in the development of our great State Fair, . and he served in the Nebraska Legislature. He was granted a Degree of Distinguished Service in Agriculture by the State Univer - sity in 1920. We wish here to pay tribute, to a man who has given a life of service to his fellowmen; and we trust that his example will be an inspiration to those now working in the field of agriculture. As friends and co-workers, we here express our highest regard, and our deep sense of loss. </seg>

            <seg id="p250">Report of Nkhuakka State Board of Agricli.tiuk Tomorrow morning will be the meeting of the Dairy Development Society, held here in (he room where we meet this afternoon. The program at this afternoon meeting revolves largely around the Cow Testing Association Work, which is one of the two big major efforts of the Dairymen's Association. Tomorrow morning as I say the pro - gram is built around the Dairy Calf Club, the second of the big projects that the Nebraska Dairymen's Association is fostering. When one assumes any obligation or joins any movement, one of the first questions that he asks himself, is,- "What is this thing?" What is it supposed to do? What is it trained to do? So in that line may we ask, "What is the Nebraska Dairymen's Association?" "What is it trying to do?" This is the Forty-second annual meeting of the Nebraska State Dairymens" Association. It was started in 1885 by Mr. S. C. Bassett, whose name is going to be honored tomorrow. The purpose of the Society as he founded it, I find in talking to those who have made an effort to build it up, was to make it the Central Organization in Nebraska around which all Dairy Breeding and all Dairy Manufac - turing interests and activities should center, and in the main it is doing that. For the last three years there has been an organization grow up in the State, the Nebraska Dairy Development Society which was organized for a minimum period or five years service, which has two years yet to go. Whether that will continue or not we do not know, but they have done much to stimulate dairying interests in the State, but should they go out of business at the end of that time, the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association, a society organized by law and subsidized by our State Legislature will be the one left to carry on the work. Now then what has this society done since it met here a year ago? They have done something to advertise the Dairying interests of the State. They havo done this by exhibits for one thing. May I pause here a moment to pive credit to the Committee on Exhibits and Awards, the personnel or which committee we mentioned a few moments ago, ( E. N, Hansen, L. K. Crowe, H. P. Davis). They have done a very superior service. It was their designs and different methods of advertising that were done on the trips which carried out the suggestion of the Northwestern Railroad last year. They furnished fine advertising ideas to many County Fairs. It was this Committee that prepared the Booth for the State Fail - last year. Then in the Educational Program, the work of the Dairy Depart - ment with the several educational institutions of the State with whom they have cooperated with and the Nebraska State Dairymen's Associa - tion has been successful in promoting Dairy information through this source. Now in the matter or sanitation, the Dairymen's Association </seg>

"» lu k«' re *™'-" 1" this connection you " co" Dlished t " 0W that " lany ° f lhese thln * 8 hav * been accomplished Many or you people perhaps have this report, which we do not have here at this time. There will be anew supply. Then in the past year two thousand one hundred and eight lots and herds have been inspected for tuberculosis in Nebraska, covering thirty thousand and thirty-six animals. ""enng mirt&gt; Kebrfskflf IT' " me are el6Ven accre dited counties in of the^ 5 v ! a VelT won , derful record when you consider some of the impediments that the sanitation program has encountered. ™Jf l ° r T V , m ° rning (KC P'T^ram of the Nebraska Dairy Develop - ment AMocla ion is going to be given over to the Calf Club worS L , ' nSt ° kn ° W at his time what the Calf Club people have done. There are fifty-eight clubs in the State with 550 members. That means there are 550 boys and girls in Nebraska working this ast year, each of them caring for Dairy Heifers that are growing nto Dairy Cows. This movement is growing greater every year in le°ctt rty "I 111 " S SC0P^ The C ° W teSting Work -HI be tn subject that we will mainly listen to this afternoon. There are now !ton n prog£m Undred "^ °° WS '" the Dalry Testlng Associa - ,nH A ,m^ ary ° f the W ° rk ° f 1hose wh0 have S»ven so much time and skill this year, shows thitty-flve members in this work of the , !!u" g Association wh0 h f v e gone into the three-hundred pound class That is for the average production of herds which were three Hundred- pounds up. It may jange all the way from cows running as low as 250 pounds. So Mr| Flack advises me that some went as high as 800 pounds fat. It is hard for us to believe that a grade cow can deliver 800 pounds of fat in two or three milkings a day. But the Cow Testing work in. Nebraska did that very thing this year: • So. we are rendering a service in this Cow Testing work with an increasing interest that is! gathering in ffie -work. One of the finest things about that, work bat I see is the interest it developes n both agriculture and education. One of the finest things is for (he boy or girl caring. for the: calf to have it remain there and to own it. . Some of the greatest [ discouragement that has come under my observation is where the boy or girl owns the cow and their father appropriates the calf, or maybe the other way round That is not the proper course. That is something that this society has done in stimulating the interest of the parent. thing that our society has done is to stimulate an inter - est In judging and dairy contests. This has been accomplished by such contests as wehad this morning and also at Farmer's Institutes and also at Farmer's gatherings. So far we have only had such con - tests during Organized Agriculture Week. It is probable that with </seg>
            <seg id="p252">Rkpokt of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture ' the promise of the State Fair Board that our society may be able to extend that feature to the State Fair. Anyway the Interest is being stimulated in dairying by this judging and should receive our approval. Then in regard to students judging, or Student Judgings, the College of Agriculture here worked under a cheerful handicap In the student judging. I am sure these college teams are promoting interest in this. A boy or girl goes out with a judging team, they get to travel and work in different herds and can gain considerable benefit. But this work in order to be profitable should be carried on in the proper scope. We can help pay the expense of judging teams to the National Show. That means that there will be many boys and girls in the College of Agriculture who are compelled economically to do judging to the net loss of the entire industry who will be compelled to forego economically the benefit of doing judging for the net loss of the entire Industry. Then there are some very finished minds in the school who are not equipped with such particular endow - ments to do this work for the benefit of the entire State. The same is true in the other schools of agriculture and in the various Smith- Hughes schools if the State would offer Dairy Judging work. We' hope in another year that we may make it possible for every school in the State, and for each Smith-Hughes school particularly, to ha.ve a Dairy Judging team of its own and that these schools may compete with each other. Then there should be a second group open to any others and making it possible for Dairy Judging to those who carry on in the secondary school as well as in the College of Agriculture. Many other forms of competition come out of the State Dairymen's Associa - tion work of fostering such projects as the Babcock Test work in the care of milk. One big thing that this Legislature here should have given con - sideration to, whether action Is taken or not at least we should not be afraid to bring out in the open and to stress some of these problems and I mention them among other points that should come up for consideration before your Legislative Committee. If any of you people here have in mind any Legislative announcements that should be made or given and referred to the Legislative Committee for consideration, I am sure all of the members of that. Committee would be glad to receive your suggestions. Now as I started to say, among other suggestions, I would like to see recommended: First, that we have at this time a better Cream Grading Law. The question naturally raises as to what kind of a Cream Grafting Law should we have and are we ready for it yet. Second, are we ready yet in this State to have a law requiring cream buyers to keep composite samples for several days and be subject to re-test of those samples? </seg>
            <seg id="p253">Nebraska State Patbymen's Association Some such a law Is now in successful operation in the State of Vermont. But are we ready in this State to have a law for making specific grading of milk so that if a man wants to sell Certified milk he will have to have a grade for his milk, "A" or "B", he will have to meet a minimum standard. It might not require him to specifically sell under a label but lie must meet a certain standard in order to put it under that label. ■ These are some of the things that I believe our Legislature ought to consider and that our Committee ought to think as worthy of con - sideration. ' Then there is one other thing, I think, it might be well to con - sider. Is there any logical reason why milk from a dairy of more than 5 cows should not come under State Inspection when those five cows or more have to have a license to. operate? Now it is true they have to meet certain requirements but it is also true that they are practically never fit. Is not the man who has one cow and sells milk to someone else {a dairyman, the same as a man who might sell it from 100 cows? When that product is used for human food is it not important that the product should be inspected as well •as any other such a product that comes under the requirements of this inspection? These are some of the matters that I think should be considered by the Legislative Committee. Our program this after - noon is now going to be on Cow Testing Association work. This will be in charge of Mr. M. L. Flack. . When the cow testing work first started in the State of Nebraska! the prospect was not very optimistic. The men who are going to speak to you this afternoon were not very optimistic or so numerous in this State either. But they have been great factors in carrying out this work and so I am glad to introduce to you Mr. Flack and he tells me that we are going to hear from some mighty fine people on this subject. MR. M. L. FLACK: Mr. President, I believe I can safely say that I can look into the faces of about all of you and say that I know most of you. I think I can also safely say that we are going to have some mighty fine reports this afternoon. Now at least I am going to try to make myself acquainted with every man who is in Cow Testing Association work in Nebraska. I know most of them now. If I have any" difficulty with them I think perhaps they had more difficulty with me. We have had quite a time with Cow Testing Association work in Nebraska. I think Cow Testing Associations are doing as much as anything else to put our State on the map in Dairy Work. I asked Mr. Holden last night why he had believed in Cow Testing Association work; He says, "Well how would you keep a dairy herd unless you tested?" That would be hard to answer. He just put it right in a few words. He is. a pretty good Yankee. There is no use of owning a dairy cow unless you test her. We know that </seg>
            <seg id="p254">Rkpobt of Nkhiuska Statk Board of Aoricci.tubk is true. I will just suggest that you each go out of this meeting and ask yourself if you know the pecularities of nine out of ten of your own herd. There is hardly anyone of you that could tell me which is really your best cow before you test them. Mr. Becker out here has a cow which in his Cow Testing Association made 886 pounds of fat in one year. I believe he will tell you what I am going 10 say is true that he had a notion to sell that cow because she milked just a trifle hard, but he says she don't milk nearly as hard now. That is one example, folks, that I want to bring to your mind just exactly what Cow Testing Association will do. I am not going to tell you myself about all of this because everyone whom I have had put upon this program here Is a man who has had an actual experience in this work and I am going to let them give you their own experiences. I believe I better let them tell you themselves about this Cow Testing Association work. But I do want to say that our herd work in Nebraska is making men see the dollars and cents viewpoint. They may think at first that $3.50 a month for testing is too much and that it would be cheaper and easier to test them for themselves. I just want to consider what our Cow Testing Associations in Nebraska are offering. We have a gentleman here from Michigan who is going to speak to us later in the afternoon. They have in that state over 100 Cow Testing Associations. That may make our little ten or eleven groups in N'ebraska look rather small. But it is not numbers always that count. It is the kind of work that we are doing that we want to point to with pride. We have always had to spend too much time heretofore doing educational work. In one Gounty where I helped to organize a Cow Testing Association I had to make fourteen visits in one day and when we had not secured a single one of them at the end of the day it was rather discouraging. I made such a remark to the County Agent and he says, "Well you can't always tell. You are doing lots of educational work." Now, N'ebraska has eleven associations. There were only ten reported this year because one has just started here on Monday, the third. I want to report that Association today as started because we never report or count an association until it is actually started. We sometimes get them all lined up and have them interested and some who are elusive then get away. Mr. Morse, our President, mentioned the herds that reached an average of 3(10 pounds of fat. Later in the afternoon we will have the presentation of medals for those who have reached this mark. Hut now we are going to turn the program over for a little while to those who have accomplished this purpose and we want to have these speakers here tell us how they did it. I would like to have </seg>
            <seg id="p255">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association each of these men come forward and give five or ten minutes talk on how he did this. First I will introduce Mr. R. C. Johnson a •member of the Saunders County Association, and a breeder of Hol - stein Cattle. •MR. JOHNSON: Honorable Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen. I sure deem it a great pleasure to represent the Saunders County Cow Testing Association. I think I could talk quite a lot on the Saunders County Association but I will leave that out. When Mr. Flack asked me about a month ago to talk a few minutes here today, I told him that I did not know that I would be here, in fact I did not think I would. So I just took it for granted that I would not have any place on the program /until I found my name there, R. C. Johnson. Then I kept puttng it off until last night I sort of jotted down a few notes. In my few remarks I shall endeavor to give you a few pointers on my experience. I shall try to guess at the reason for him asking me to talk five minutes. If you will just look at this bunch of speakers listed on the program and notice that there are ten speakers to follow me you will plainly see that no speaker should talk over five minutes without robbing some or the other speakers of their time. If the first speaker should rob very heavily he sure would be the most guilty. I am going to try to start on my subject assigned to me, "Why Have An Association?" I might answer this question, "Why Have. An Association?" by asking you men a question. I might ask you, "Why have this Nebraska State Experimental Station?" I think the Experimental Station here with its different methods along every different line to determine the best and most efficient methods serves a purpose that you all recognize. First, we have : a Cow Testing Association : to determine which cows can be kept at a profit, to determine the feed tests and every farmer and dairyman has been more or less guessing at our cows, and many times we have thought that they paid us a profit and in reality they have lost us money. So if a farmer or dairyman is going to keep up with others we musjt determine where our source of profit lies. The Cow Testing Association will help us determine where this source is and will leave us not just trusting to luck. Second, we have Cow Testing Associations to establish a record on each of our cows. You men in- the daiiry business realize and know how much it costs to secure official record of your herd outside the Cow Testing Association. The cost is so great that the average farmer or dairyman under present conditions cannot afford to pay this cost. The cost will [be discussed later by different speakers and perhaps treated more in detail. Buyers and people looking for good cows are going to try Gow Testing Association animals more and more than they have eve* done before. If you will pardon a </seg>

It was not long till I decided that two </seg>
            <seg id="p257">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association more should go and they did. In the meantime I learned that I was feeding unprofitable Some of my cows were given only half as much as before testing. About this time I began to notice that some of my heifers were dong as good as some of the \ older cows, also that a couple were doing nearly as good as their; matured dams.. I could, place only one reason for this. "Better Sires." as they were all getting the same Cafe. When the tester asked me about testing another year, I was S y it a pa I id Wanted f0U0W S ° me oE these heiters - &lt;&gt;n some I found In my second year's work it was my aim to study the new heifers and see where, they increased or where they dropped below their sisters of the previous year. In this comparison I found a variation which I lay to a difference in sires, ad conditions were practically the same, if any difference the second years has the advantage. &gt; I might say right here that many a good sire goes to the bloc* before their worth is known, and the only .way to determine this is to test, not only one year but to keep on testing. Another reason for testing more than one year is that many imes when a man comes to buy a cow. heifer or bull, he wants to know the production of dam. how many daughters (in case of a cow) or how many sisters you are keeping in your herd. What their records are in heifer form over their dam's record, how much of an increase over the previous year's record. None of the questions can be answered when you test only one year. . I'm for the Cow Testing Association and more than one year's testing. ■ ■■ MR. FLACK: The next speaker on the program has been assigned the topic. "Is the Cow Testing Association Suitable for Nebraska?" That is to be discussed by onk of the best authorities and most efficient men that we have had in this work. Mr. O. D. Bolster of Hall-Howard County Association. He has had charge of the wonderful herd up at the Old Soldier's Inst tution at Grand Island. MR. 0. D. BOLSTER: Mr. Chairman, and members of the Cow Testing Associations of the State of Nebraska. I am afraid that Mr Flack is in the position of the tailor that I once read of. A rather corpulent gentleman came in to have a pair of trousers measured. The measure was taken and after the gentleman had gone out the tailor found that he was short of material. I think Mr. Flack is short of material and has just run me in to fill in. In discussing this question I might myself ask a number of questions and then answer them. The first question that I Will ask is, "Do you care to increase </seg>
            <seg id="p258">Kki'oiu ok Nkiikanka St.vtk Board op AGRICULTURE thf standard (if the herds in the State of Nebraska?" Second, I would ask would you care to increase the future quality in your herds in the State of Nebraska? Third, do you care to have any increase in the price that should be placed on your sires or dams and the herds in Nebraska? Fourth, do you care to place Nebraska on that pinnacle that she should be on in the dairy production? Fifth, have you a civic pride in placing Nebraska on that pinnacle where she will he looked up to rather than looked down upon by other States? When il comes to the matter of cost, it would cost each farmer !o join a Cow Testing Association, a minimum of $3.50 per month lor a herd I believe from 10 cows; up to 30 cows it ranges around $5.(M1. The average farmer does not keep books to determine what tiis farming does cost him. He doesn't feel like spending the time to keep a herd book. So he is fortunate to have a Cow Tester to do that for him. Then when a man comes to you to buy a cow, if you can show him the books, you then have a record on these cows for two or three years back. Then another thing men, I don't believe in going out of the Slate of Nebraska to get sires and dams. The State of Nebraska is big enough and can have good enough breeders right here in the State of Nebraska to produce sires and dams and we do not have to go to Wisconsin or Michigan to get good sires and dams. Our Cow Testing Associations are bringing our own stock up to a point where we do not have to go out of the State for it. Two or three years ;igo when I took charge at Grand Island I went in for a little Cow Testing Association of our own. The County Agent was up there ;ind organized a few herds and found out what each one should produce. I'p to the present time you might be interested in knowing what we have done. We figured up for nine months of this year that our herd has averaged better than' 325 pounds of butter fat. That is one thing the Cow Testing Association is doing to benefit the State of Nebraska. Yes, it is producing better herds. If you men take a real pride in placing Nebraska where she should be in I he dairy business and if you care to bring her up to that point due to Cow Testing Association no matter whether it costs you $60.00 or $5.fiu per month, it is well worth it. MR. FLACK: Now our next speaker will be Mr. Shelby Ramsey of the York County Association who will respond to the topic, "Its Influence on My Community." He is a very splendid man. He has been around a good bit and can well respond to this topic. Mr. liamsey is a Holstein breeder. MR. RAMSEY: Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. Flack is very daring i his forenoon when he will go so far as to put me on the program, even to take this topic, "The Influence of Our Association in Our </seg>
            <seg id="p259">NkbkabkX Statk Dairymen's Association- Community." That is a rather ! hard subject. You ju 8 t can't exadtlv lell how much influence we do have. Before we had our testers in our locality I noticed Uiat most of the people had been feeding corn fodder and some corn stalks and on the main were not getting verv much milk. After we had an Association some of the members got o looking it up and trying to find out what they really were spending hat money for. Now it is a different story, they will ask you about the different feeds in your ration and how much your cow is giving That changed viewpoint in itself is a benefit in this Cow Testin K Association. In the last few months I have had a number ask me such questions. We are gaining ground with the Cow Testing Associa - tion. One speaker who preceded me mentioned the cost of belonging to the Cow Testing Association. I would not so grant them That is a reasonable cost. So far as the price charged for being a member and have this Cow Testing Work is concerned, I say it is too low especially for a breeder of pure-bred cattle because I feel for my own special benefit . I would much rather have a cow testing record These records show what the cows are and what they are doing In the Cow Testing Association record, it goes further and not only shows what the cow is doing, but what it costs for her to do it There you have both sides of the story. That influence is spreading quite rapidly among the people in my community. I think we have been very fortunate in having splendid testers." Our testers have been Princes among men and have been quite a benefit in arousing interest. But we hope that in a short time our further advance will be shown and that our present association is just commencing to. wield the influence that it can in the community. It is pretty hard to tell what its future is going to be but we have that hope of producing an influence which will keep up and will spread until we stand second to none in the United States in the Cow Testing Association work. MR. FLACK: Now' I think Mr. Ramsey can make a pretty good speech. What Mr. Ramsey has said is very true. I want to mention one thing, Lincoln and Seward County have been in together and running for about two years that way. Lancaster County got to where it felt it. had enough members. to be by itself so they separated rrom Seward County and then put that in another Association, or they put it with another County. Lancaster is running its own Associa - tion now. Seward County not having quite enough dairy interests to remain by itself went in together with York County and helped them out. But if Seward County had not come in; York County could hardly have supported an Association withbut Seward,. so this Associa - tion started" at Lancaster-Seward has really developed into two Now that is what Mr. Bolster has been going to do and that is what the Hall-Howard County Association can do. Now I will next call upon </seg>
            <seg id="p260">Rkport ok Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Mr. Ira Hepperly of the Madison County Association to give us a few remarks on the question, "Does the Tester Give Service?" MR. HEPPERLY: You might think that one graduating from the University would know better than to milk cows, but I just want to say that we enjoy it. There is an idea among farmers that hired men don't like to milk cows. Most of their operations are carried on by means of hired men because we have to have quite a number of them. They do a large part of the milking of cows. We haven't had a hired man on our place for four or five years that doesn't like to milk cows. They do like to milk good cows. But they don't like to milk poor cows. My subject is, "Does the Cow Tester Give Service?" I rather believe that the service that the cow tester gives is of as much importance as the testing work that he does. Experiences in other states and at other Associations have proven this. First It Is proven that a larger majority, or at least a large number of our producers who separate their milk and sell the cream lose considerable of their butter fat. through the separator. A good tester will see that a separator is taken care of and properly adjusted and test the skimmed milk every month. In this way you can save a good many dollars every year on cream testing. In Iowa in one particular Association one member was losing more than $100.00 per year just because his separator was not working right. He found this when an exami - nation was made when he carte to his skimmed milk. The testing found that that was the difficulty and thereby it saved him not only considerable because of the work of the cow tester, but he gained a confidence and went ahead with the services of the tester he gave him a good deal of further service and advice along the feeding line. There is no one other thing that a tester can do to be of more aid to a successful dairyman, than advice along the line of good feeding. We have found in our Association that the high pro - ducers are all good feeders. The low producers are generally poor feeders. It takes considerable time to educate these farmers to feed correctly and to feed enough. They seem to think that If they can devise means of saving a little on the feed that they are that much ahead. But instead of that they are losing considerably on their production and are cheating themselves out of what they might have produced. I think that is perhaps one of the big things that, the testers will eventually bring about, better feeding. . Now as a third point, the tester can give service In the selling and buying of stock. No one of the producers can have as much information as he can and they eventually can have the benefit of the Information he has gathered as to the stock for sale and as to how it should be sold, where it should be sold and what it should be sold for. The bulletins put out by the Dairy Department each month on Cow Testing Association work gives these testers a very complete </seg>

I said to him, "What is the matter Jim?" He said, "Nothing, why?" I said, "I thought there must be some - thing wrong." "Well," he said, "I was over to see my girl last night and she kind of found fault with me in general. She was making fun of my big hands. I couldn't help that because it is caused by milking so many cows." I said, "What^then?" He said, "Well to top it off she wouldn't believe that so she says, 'How about your feet?' Well 1 couldn't say anything more, so. I went home." Now to increase the production of the dairy cow requires sonu? rotation of feed. Much investigation work has been done in refer - pnce to the discovery of the necessity of an ordinary balanced ration. To keep the cow going at maximum production, and especially during pregnancy, we keep a very well balanced ration in the silo. We do this a year or two in advance so we have enough balance between clover, good corn, and pea silage. We must have our cows well fed. So we feed them most generously. We look at our cows just as you would at a task of operating anything in a factory. We look at the efficiency and results. No cow that will not produce more than 350 pounds of butterfat in a year can remain in our barn, neither a heifer that will not produce 300 pounds of butterfat stay with us. Some of you may think that is putting it pretty strong. But I will try anil show you my point of view. It requires a good acre of land to produce enough feed lor a cow.- We charge the value of the land for products, against the acre of fodder and other feed that is pro - duced on the land thus charged. Sometimes a serious mistake is made in the Spring of the year and the roughage gets low in having just so much feed for them. You have to keep a close watch and help along to see that you don't, leed these cows too heavy with the result that a large part of the leed is simply sacrificed. Any cows that are capable of high production and cows that are good breeding cows don't be afraid to feed them properly. You will get a profit thai is worth tile money expended. You may have them go on the wrong side of the ledger for awhile but do not bo afraid to buy additional feed for them. Close your pasture until it is ready for use and there is a good opportunity to thoroughly use it throughout the entire summer. Provide a good fence so that you will not be interrupted three or four times a day during your work. Usually a good strong wire fencing will be strong enough. We have cows that do not come up to our barn once a month. There is nothing particularly strange about our feeding. We feed regularly so that the cows become accustomed to their feeding time and continue alone regular habits. We like to see our cows lie down and stretch. Follow the course and this way you overcome some of these feeding problems. When you have cows that are able </seg>

Association to consume feed you produce and you can keep them properly respond - ing to the tuberculin test, and you keep; them fenced up it is paying a return to .every member or the Cow Testing Association You benefit and get that return in the use of your alfalfa and silage on hand. You ascertain not only the proper feeds, but the use of the proper amounts. The result you want is the proper product whether you are using a pure-bred or a scrub animal. MR.. FLACK: All of these men who are talking here today cer - ta.nly have something to say to us. Now we are going to hear from one more of these men, Mr. Charles Rosacker of Douglas County on "Before and After I Was a Member." MR. UOSACKEU: Gentlemen and Mr. Flack. I am glad to speak on the topic that Mr. Flack has asignea to me. Before and after .sounds like I was reporting upon my experiences with some sort or type of medicine. All I know about cows when it comes to testing and some of these other points is the knowledge that I gained when I joined the Association. I found really tfiat I didn't know very much about it before then.- But of course I was inclined to think • hat I did. Now I knew a cow when I saw one. I knew that a cow had to be fed in order to keep, her alive and in order to get her to Rive milk. But how much you should feed her was a question. We always had our cows in good shape and always managed to have a few that were milking, but get. right down to it we really didn't know what to do. Finally when Mr. Maxwell, our County Agent, came around and urged me to join the Association, he seemed to be especially anxious lor me to take up this work, I really didn't see any reason, for it, but I finally decided to try it. As time went on we finally developed our first Association in Douglas County. As we started out on our first round or work and the tester came around the first time we didn't have much to go on as we were not running on a very elaborate scale. But later we began to see results. For one thing we noticed that the milk given by the cows from a certain sire that we had in our herd began to show up better. 1 think we had six- old cows and- their daughters and we had them on test. We started them on the test at the same time and. we found they were actually doing better the second year, they milked 50 per cent better than their. dams had. We began to know the influence that one sire had on the herd, or course we thought a lot or this might be theory but we better use it. Of course I had a lot of theory before I joined the Testing Association. But my theory toward feeding a cow was just give her a lot to eat, and give her a lot of water and just let her produce. Now I- know it is a fact that it pays to do these things.. One thing in particular that I want to emphasize I used to think it cost too much money to feed a common herd. Well I tested out and one year when I did not raise too much oats I just mixed up our ration according to the prescription I got from the </seg>
            <seg id="p264">Report ok Nebraska State Board of Agriculture tester. In two months time I had more milk on this balanced ration and It was costing me less money than it had before then. I want to give J. T. Pierson credit for helping me along that line. I tried the prescription to find out what the results would be and they were very satisfactory. MR. FLACK: I want to make just one statement. I do not. want anyone to think that here in Nebraska we are stealing something. If you can get an idea and use it alright. We have borrowed here in Nebraska the Michigan plan of running our Cow Testing Association. It is a fact that we like the plan very much. I have talked with a number of men in the Washington office who have the idea that the Michigan plan was just ideal. So we tried it out. So in all of our Associations we have relied on the Michigan plan. We don't depend so much on the number of cows as we depend on the number of herds. Now I will not introduce our next speaker of the day but I am going to ask another man to perform this task. I will turn this back to Mr. C. K. Morse of the State Agricultural School at Curtis, our President. PRESIDENT MORSE: Each year the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association attempts to bring to the State someone who has been in the forefront of the movement and most prominent in some phase of dairying. Now I am going to ask fhe head of our Dairy Depart - ment, Professor H. P. Davis, to present the main speaker of our program this afternoon, his friend from Michigan. PROFESSOR DAVIS: Years ago I used to go to College. Of course I probably don't look like it now. But when I went to College there was a man down there from whom I was able to gain consider - able knowledge in experimental work. He was a good fellow. Now this fellow whom I then had this struggle with was Professor O. E. Reed. He has been around the country quite a bit. Just now he is head of the work at the State College of Michigan. He went into Michigan, the place where cow testing first started in this country, where the first association started. He went in there with about eight or ten associations. Now he has had a wide experience in selling this idea to the people of Michigan and they have found Cow Testing Association worth while undertaking and have continued it until they have more than a hundred now. It Is with great pleasure that I introduce to you Prof. 0. E. Reed of the Michigan State College. PROFESSOR O. E. REED: Mr. Davis, President and friends, I am glad for the opportunity to come out here and appear before your dairymen. This subject that I am listed on the program to speak upon, of "Cow Testing Associations Bring Dairy Development," is one very near to my heart. I know that we have got to get men to milk cows, the man who holds a future in the palm of his hand in this line. The dairymen </seg>
            <seg id="p265">Nebraska State Daibtmkx's Association on the farm have got to get him to thinking along this way, if we are going to accomplish very much for the Dairy Industry. Now I am not a stranger out here in the West. I spent eight years of my life In the State south of you. I have some children of my work down there that I think more of than anything else. Our Cow Testing Association, the first one in Kansas I helped organize five years ago through my own efforts. There was a week's solid work from early in the morning until the farmers could get to their beds at night involved. in that task. That association is still. alive. Some of the ;-.ame members are still doing business. Undoubtedly it has had more to do with the development of the dairy industry around Abilene, Dickens County, than any other factor. I could tell you many stories that have come out. of that county dairying and around that Cow Testing Association. So that Association from that standpoint alone after its organization. So that Association from that standpoint alone had good influence on that county because it prepared for the county some wonderful dairy men who might have not come in there had ft not been for the Cow Testing Association organization. Cow Testing Associations do bring about a Dairy Development. I know of no other single factor that has had so much to do witli the development of the Dairy Industry. Now I know of nothing else that has had so much to do. with the stabilization of the Dairy farm, and toward its proper organization, or developments within the Dairy Association. I think that is a promise that I can stand on that I am going to be able to prove. Now a good many people don't believe that. The only reason those people who are in that class do not believe it is, they do not know what Cow Testing Association is. If you are going to sell a Cow Testing Association to all of your neighbors and friends, first of all you must be able to tell what a Cow Testing Asosciation is. I have tried to describe it in my" own way a good many times, or at least to make it somewhat understandable. I am going to give you a little definition of what it is. ; "The Cow Testing Association is an organization of farmers and dairymen, twenty-five or twenty-six of them, who helieve in co-opera - tive efforts, and to demonstrate for themselves and their community the proper procedure in the selection, management and feeding of the Dairy herd under their own conditions." I would like very much if Cow Testing Associations as they exist today were not called Cow Testing Associations at all. I would like to name them this way, "Herd Improvement Association." I would consider that something that would more nearly describe the purpose that we have in under - taking the organization of such an association and of putting It into the community. To me that is the proper function of such an association. ' • </seg>
            <seg id="p266">I RKVOKT OK NkIIRAnKA RT.VTB BOARI. OK Af.ItlCII.TluK Now «••&gt; hu\&gt;. people come In and ask us about the Babcock &lt;esi. A good many today don't believe in it, so we have simply got to get this point over to people today. We will say the people in your communit) are going to organize the Cow Testing work. The question comes up of course as to what the benefit will be. You will find that a good many have the idea back in their minds that the only benefit derived from a Testing Association is to find out how much milk the cows will give, to find out how much that milk will test and operate the Babcock test. That is all of the necessary part 0/ the work, it is true. But if that is the only thing that the Cow Testing Association did, certainly I would not spend another minute's effort or thought in trying to foster the Cow Testing Association movement. But I know that it goes considerably deeper than that. Now I want to take up a lew of the things that Cow Testing Associations are really doing as organizations. If they are properly organized they are carrying out some things on the farm that are worth all of the time and effort spent on them, and one of these is in making men think. I have heard some excellent talks here today, on what Cow Testing Associations are doing, or just the experiences that have been related by these men here today go to show that they are think - ing about what the Cow Testing Association means. I want to tell you folks that the Association work has borne fruit and it has accom - plished thai. In attending your Master Farmers Banquet and listener to th» talks there I have heard men get up and tell their own stories ;.nd we also find a result well worth while. I understand you have selected your Master Farmers in Nebraska. We have our Master Farmers in Michigan. After all the fellow who gets ahead these days is the fellow who thinks and works out problems. All the Master Farmers I know and I know all the Master Farmers in Michigan personally, are men. every one of them, who keeps the record of 'their operations. Every man who was made a Master Fanner in Nebraska last night keeps a record of his operation. The man who keeps the record is used to thinking, the record causes him to think, if he has got any gray matter to think with. There has been a lot of talk as to what is the matter with Agriculture and a lot of talk about tlie condition of Agriculture. I have my money invested in farms just as you men have, and have had since 1917. I won't tell you a lot of remedies or give you a lot or suggestions or a lot of Ways out. but I do want to say that in my humble opinion the best way out is for a lot of right thinking to be done on the part of the live young men who are coming into the work and that is what is going to bring us out. We need more education and more infor - mation about our work. We need more of these plans of organiza - tion. The Cow Testing Association, such as you have heard abour this afternoon, brings people together. They need to know each </seg>
            <seg id="p267">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association other better through such organizations as the Cow Testing Associa - tion. We need to find out more, about the cost of co-operation. It is education in these kind of things that is going to help us. We have a Master Fanner in Michigan who is quite a potato man. Last year his gross income from 160 acres was $18,Q00. You would never pick- him out as a Master Farmer, just to look at him. But during all these years he has been putting through his efforts to better agriculture and in that time he has come through more than one single year where his little farm has not turned over the gross income of $18,000. Last fall he had potatoes and instead of having 100 bushels an acre his return has gone to 500 something. It is nearly always over 400 on a patch of 13 acres. He has not tried to grow all of the potatoes in the country, just a few but to produce as many on an acre as he can. It is a dry farming method. One man said here that he would not have a cow on the place unless it ran over three hundred pounds of butterfat. A man who handles stock like that hasn't, time to whine' about conditions, tc whine about this or that. He must be busy! I know such a man who never went to an Agricultural College. We have one who wishes that he could spend some time there but he just worked up about ten years ago. His Association, as he told me, is the County Agent who has been a wonderful help, to him. That got him to thinking and got him to keeping his record and got him to digging. That, is one thing that a Cow Testing Association will help a man to do. So one big thing in the development of our industry is teaching people to think. Some reference has been made here i today to our work in Michigan. I trust you will pardon me if I make any further personal reference of five or six years ago. It was along about six years' ago last spring and five years ago last fall that I started out to work toward putting Michigan dairying' and agriculture on the map. I will start, with that responsibility. The .first thing that we took up was the Cow Testing Association. Most of our men recognized that it has contributed more to the development of the Dairy industry than any other single factor. We had one man who was interested in the Smith-Lever farm department of agriculture. He came to my office' and said, "Well you are here in Michigan now, what are you going to work at?" I said, "Well we have got to get busy on Cow Testing Associations." He said, "Bosh, you can't do it. We will just have to have you cut that out because you can't work it out." He said, "Well we haven;t done it yet." I said, "Well we are thinking about.it. That is the program 1 in Michigan and it is what we are going to carry out. If necesary, we are going to find some way out whether we get the money or not," The next thing anyone knew a group of our Extension Agents had co-operated and we had five Cow Testing Associations. The first one was organized in March, mnfi. That was the first one that was organized in the United States </seg>

That is we would have tour Ol Te dunng he day and then run in about three more until late that night Then at night we would hold them where we could put on moving Pictures We told the farmers the story about the Cow Sil g Association and we told them the story about alfalfa. This brought the men across. If you are going to keep cows you have got to have something to feed. When we had worked along this line for fl«e n minutes or longer and with this kind of a plan we generally found hat we had sold the idea of the Cow Testing Association. In spite ■&gt;f the fact so many of .hese pure-bred breeders and you might consider </seg>
            <seg id="p269">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association them against it, you generally find them coming across. Most of them were a little luke-warm though toward it. We went in with a little group of Extension workers. We told people what the Cow Testing Association was and then we told them what it would do. They be - lieved it. The people will believe you if you go out and tell them what the exact facts are and confine yourself to the facts. So we went out and told the people. The result is that today in that State or rather during the last year we had 308 Cow Testing Associations in operation in Michigan. We have gained steadily every year in the last five years. Five years ago we had five. Six years ago we had just the idea to start with. Six years ago we had about 79,000 acres of alfalfa there in Michigan. During the past season where they just made an average the figures showed, as I looked them up just before I came out here, Michigan has 495,200 acres of alfalfa. I think that is a recommendation that we were able to go out and put this work over. There is a good deal of information about work like this that can be sent out so that the farmers and their families can read about it. Of course men will come Into a meeting who are not used to reading. But there are a lot of people -who can and do enjoy reading and then there are. a lot who have never got the habit except they will perhaps read the County Newspaper. So we used that exten - sively. Just give them something that reads well, get their atten - tion so you can tell them the story.. That's what you fellows have got to do in this kind of work. That is a story for business men. From these instances I could give you a list about a mile long that would, create quite a write-up. ■ The bankers came right along. We .have a lot of community meetings. There is sometimes a solution of things. You have got to tell the people these things. You have got to have a Cow Testing Association which is an association pri - marily to help Dairy Development and you have got to get all of the people in who ought to be in. We haven't completed our first job. We have got to get them interested. We have our doubts convincing them, but we will .do it. I told you that five years ago we had five associations. The average production of those Cow Testing Associations five years ago as it was given in my annual report in December, 1921, we had eleven Cow Testing Associations with something like three thousand cows. But this gives you an idea of what the Cow Testing Associa - tion was doing. The average fat was 274.8 pounds. Now you say as a natural proposition, I don't believe the men that you have in your Cow Testing Association in Nebraska were always at first the leading dairymen as the men we got in the Cow Testing Association In Michigan were not so prominent at first. Now in Michigan five years ago they were not so well experienced. This year out of 104 associa - tions that were recorded we had a record showing 7,634 pounds of </seg>
            <seg id="p270">Hi-roiii ok Nkiikaska Statk Boahd ok AoKICl'l/rrRK milk, 302 pounds for an average on twenty-eight thousand cows. Now what has that meant? It meant nearly thirty pounds increase on tile cow. The average prie.' that we would get for butter fat makes that mean $12O.on for an average if butter fat stayed at 40c or that is just about 300 per cent. I don't know where you can invest money any better than that. I cannot see anything that we have done that cannot be done over again. 1 believe that it can. I would say that your average per farm is about the same as it was in Michigan. Your cows are about the same. The average member of a Cow Testing Association In Michigan would be about the same as in Nebraska. We would run right around ten or eleven. That is usually what a Cow Testing Asso - ciation will do. That is all, but when it comes to feed I believe that five years ago the average man in our Cow Testing Association in Michigan grew about :s/10 of an acre of alfalfa per cow and this year they grew Hfi/idO of an acre per cow. We have had a slogan of 'an acre of alfalfa per cow." All but twelve out of eighty-three counties in Michigan now have Cow Testing Associations. One has had as high as ten. several counties have had four, there are One. or two who have six and another has five. Now I claim that we are showing you results in ' dollars and cents. Now when you get an institution of this kind it shows what it is doing for the community. As I said five years ago I went out with the boys. We had to get acquainted. You always have to get acquainted with a territory, no matter what you are doing. T went out with the boys and made these acquaintances with them. This year there were nearly forty per cent of re-organizations worked out. It is a worth while thing when people will work out their own problems like that. The first thing we have got to do is to go out and give the people the right slant to the idea. I say that when you get Cow Testing Association work scattered all over the State as we have it now it is one of the greatest helps to the whole Dairy Industry why we have men who buy milk, men who distribute it and dairy - men in all phases who are in our Cow Testing Associations and some of them use their own time, money and efforts to go out and spread the idea of this thing. They do it like real business men. Of course we have some other kind of men in just as you would in any business enterprise. Most of them are real business men like you enjoy doing business with, fellows who think, fellows who do business honestly and object to the other fellow who does not do it that way. I remember there was one instance around Flint. I remember the first time I went up there to meet a bunch of dairymen. They wanted to organize a Milk Producers' Association. They had just got skinned on some sort of deal and they wanted to organize a Milk Producers' Association. I could cite this as applying to the bright red radicals. I did there in the last five years. I said. "I can't talk to you about </seg>
            <seg id="p271">Nkiikaska State D.muymkx's Association that folks. 1 can't tell you how to do that or how to organize a'i association of that kind. I am not going to help you in that. I will talk to you about a Cow Testing Association." Then the argu - ment was raised . that there were a lot of - pure-bred cows. I said, ."I can only talk to you about Cow Testing Associations. Finally, we, got them convinced to operate along the line of a Co»v Testing Association and we do not hear any complaints any more. They do not say that the other fellow is robbing them. We have developed these associations to be fair among themselves and to be business men who believe in each other and to get business men to believe in- the milk farmer's affair. We bring about a development like that by all working together. The Association started to work to - ward raising the standard and that is what .they have done steadily for six years. I was quite gratified with one meeting where I heard a discussion by the boys and girls as to what it had done for them. There is always quite a lot said at these meetings even when Cow Testing Associations are discussed as to what, the different associa - tions have done. Now I could go on and tell you a lot of things about this development, and specific instances concerning the work. One of the biggest factors I think and one of the most important sections of a Cow Testing Association is its relationship to the pure - bred breeder. The pure-bred breeders in our state have materially changed their ideas. I was never so much chagrined as at one National association meeting at Grand Rapids, I think it was the Holstein people, I think (he question came up about the organization of Cow Testing Associations. The report came up as not very favorable to just move - ments for grade stuff. There were some at the banquet* that were not very favorable, particularly toward men. engaged in Cow Testing work. The contention was that we think it is a good thing for the man with grade cows. : I just want to assure you that when I had an opportunity I got up and took the hide off of that bunch at Grand Rapids that made such a .statement and I knocked some of them so cold that it took some of them about six months to get up. They have gotten up now. We emphasized that we could only have one record in doing the work of a Cow Testing Association because it is not an advanced register record irregardless of what breed. Some of our fellows already recognized that and others came to it. That is the position we have taken. We just put that thing right through. Five years ago we had less than 5% of the cows in the Association which were pure-bred. Today we have over forty per cent that are pure-bred. Now a matter that I would like to refer to again. I was talking to a ■ pure-bred association, down near Charlotte in Eden County. They had four there. In three months we had gotten in there with a little fellow, a Dane, wonderful cow tester. He talked there about thirty minutes and he made one very valuable suggestion. He said </seg>
            <seg id="p272">Rkport of Nkhhaska State Board of Aouicrt.TURE vou know we keep a record of all of them, both pure-bred and grade. Thpre are twenty-one herds in this Association and they have in them both grades and pure-breds. This is what he meant that the pure-bred fellows have gone on about their business about like thic. If a heifer doesn't come in twice a year he cannot test her as a pure-bred. Some pure-bred breeders find they have got grades. He says that he has gone over some interesting herds where they have different animals for sale. Xow here is one that will sell for $250.00 and one that will sell for $150.00. She is as thrifty as this other one, they come from the same line, but they have not been" able to show an equal record. A man decides on the $150.00 one and she is priced at that in making the record. A pure-bred fellow doesn't want her. So he put her in as a grade and records her as a dis - appointment. Later this farmer embarks in the pure-bred business and it so happens that maybe in twenty-one animals that he has got twenty-one disappointments. I say to all breeders if you are a pure-bred breeder, just breed pure-bred animals, but you must know about what your herd is and what they are going to do under similar conditions. I don't care anything about what herds they come from. I want to know What they are going to do in giving milk. I am not so interested in whether they make 800 pounds of butter fat or not. I do care what kind of bulls they come from and what sort of animals are going to be transmitted from that herd. You want to know about the bull if you are going to buy one, you want to know what that bull's mother has done and what her record has been. We don't care whether she is always milked until they get a certain number of pounds of milk out of her. We don't care so much whether she would milk 90 pounds if she was milked four times a- day or 60 pounds if milked three times a day. It is good business if you own those cows that you do have a record on and know. Some of our breeders do that. We do it in our institutions. At the same time you get a maximum production if you know what the animal is doing and can correct conditions that work against maximum production. If you will just let me know about what the herd is doing, then I will know about what the herd is. In our institution we have gotten the records down on our animals so that when December 31st comes we know just what they have done for the year. We have a pretty good record now. We have got it so that it will average around 500 pounds of butter fat. We can take the record of each one of them as we have if made. We know the lactation over their whole life. We have got them under good Cow Testing Association records. We have that record so that we know the positive average of more than 500 pounds of butter fat every year where without the Association records we would not know of that achievement. And further the pure-bred association records did not give them. We have these records for </seg>

The Cow Testing Association will have great influence, we must just raise, up the shutters and let the -light In A year ago when X was across the seas I bought some cattle in southwestern Scotland. I studied the situation there, and other pL s where I could and I got some new impressions on this thing. I went through southwestern: Scotland and was over in the County of Ayr and around there in that section and thought something like wenty-one head of cattle. I was driven here and there and 4 ted some mighty fine farms, in order to buy twenty-one head of cattle My friend who .traveled with me introduced me around here and </seg>
            <seg id="p274">Rkport oi- Nkiira.ska State Boaiui of AoRICULTUHE there. There I found thai they used some little books. Those books were Cow Testing Association books. Their average is a lot higher than ours because they have been at it so much longer. The thing that is appalling to me is that these fellows go on with a point of view that there is a heifer that looks good to me, bnt I want to know what she is doing. If you take the record year after year then you know what she is doing. They can turn to the record and look for that. I was particularly interested in their showing of cows that tested \n, O r more. Unless they tested that, there was no place at all for them. In my judgment I would look for them and then I wanted lo know which is her mother, is she in this book: Have you got her mother's record? Yes, they can give you that Maybe they have the record not only for her mother, but for three, four or five generations. Very often I would say there seems to be a wonderful cow. what became of her mother? They would say, ■Well she was sold to butcher. She was killed last year." We would ask why and they would say, "Well she lost a little bit." They call that good management. Do you think if a cow lost a quarter "or so that they would have that cow any longer? Not the Scotchman. He is not going to put his .feed into that cow for another season. That is the reason they have developed the Cow Testing Association idea so well. I have been around a good many breeders of pure - bred stock when' I hey have some old animals sticking around -where she hasn't had a test for a couple of years, but they just figure that if they can get one more calf out of her by holding her awhile that it will pay to do so. If they would ever stop to figure the cost and not hold a lot of these old skates and have them sticking around the barn just with the hopes that they can get one more calf or bull out of her. So then the question comes as to whether the pure-bred fellow needs the work of the Cow Testing Association. Talk about being able to distinguish grade and pure-bred herds. Are you going to be able to show the production of a pure-bred herd? A pure-bred breeder ought to be able to tell just what the production of his herd is. I know some fellows who cannot do so. They don't know whether they have got 25l&gt; pounds of butter fat a year or whether the animal can produce 5H0 pounds of butter fat. What I want to know is straight facts. You can tell me without any record on your herd as to just what your herd's condition is and what it is doing. You haven't any record that is beyond question unless you have some record to turn to. So the man who is in the pure-bred business needs the Cow Testing Association. They need them very, very much. We have been working to change a good many of the best breeders minds about their organization and they have como to see it for themselves that it is the very best kind of business for them to work wilh a Cow Testing Association. </seg>
            <seg id="p275">Nkiihaska State Damymkn'k Association Once, in a wlillu wivhGtir a whole lot. about the surplus of pro - duction of milk, we don't seem 1&lt;J know what it is that causes the surplus.- The surplus of milk production is brought on by inferior production of cows. That does lower the production in quality. Cows that are not- making any profit are the cows that are surplus, you can figure that out. It is a fact. It Is the pure-bred breeders that is the cause of the surplus. There are so many of them for one thing. I remember one time in our state when two men were talking about the Cow Testing Association. One man who was Master of a Grange at one time got up and said that this is a lot of bunk. He was talking about the over-production of stuff all the time, and he says, "You fellows have got to cut out this business of Cow Testing Associations. If you get all the cows to producing 300 pounds of butter fat you will have more milk and butter fat than you know what to do with." The fact in our state is that they have got about as many people on the farms yet and, we .'have got just about the same number of cows as averaged with the natural increase that we had five years ago. Once in a while we had, just as you people have had, the cost of cleaning up. That has been continuing for the last five years. Last year we- sold 105 carloads of scrub cows out of our Cow Testing Association. The. year before that we sold 12? carloads. Now when you get that money out of the state what arc you going to do. Why we are going to cut down on the production. You know the result when the supply goes short. The inevitable result "is either you are going to pay more or you are going some place where you can get it, so that is one of the things that result. There are many other things that I have set forth in my annual report that just happen to be available now. I could give you many other advantages of such an association, and the relationship it has to the dairy .industry. I think one of the best things that we are getting out of this work in Michigan that would recommend it to you is that we are training young men who are going out to do this Cow Testing work. We are giving those fellows a training and an opportunity for learning that is of incalculable value. It is a chance for four years study, and if you fellows want to learn some - thing about the dairy business and agriculture, here is an inval - uable four years course in the University or College that you can go out and learn a great deal about in Cow Testing Associations in a year and a half. " I know what I am talking about; All through the last four or five years we have had more than a dozen young fellows who have spent a year or two years in Cow Testing Association work. These fellows of course got interested and wanted a course in the Agricultural College. I want to mention something about cow testers. Mr. Davis asked me where we got our testers. This last year seventy of our young fellows came in on our Smith-Hughes agricultural courses in high </seg>
            <seg id="p276">Rkport of Nkrkask.v St.vtf. Board op Agriculture schools where they were planning a course this year in dairying. These young men expect to take this work and be trained for Cow Testing Association work and then come up to the College and we can give them two weeks intensive training there. Now when I get to sectional meetings I never lose the oppor - tunity to bring out the Cow Testing Association work very strongly because you can bring out an appreciation of the value of the individ - ual development. Then there are many who are inspired from the teaching in their short course or short term of study who want to pursue a long course of study. We know there is a future in agri - culture if we keep these young fellows. We have got a lot of respect for these young fellows who leave the farm just to study and intend to go back. When a boy can go away and study with all things that will make him a practical success and when such a fellow can get the vision and hold it through the long course and go back to the farm, that is one of the big things that can be accomplished in the Cow Testing Association. If we can inspire this vision and keep it with him. But we must get in and sell the same idea to our business men, to our banker, to our community club, to all of these organizations. Some of our counties have Cow Tester's meeting reg - ularly. In several instances we have had short courses held by these cow testers. We teach them to cull poultry and do a good many things in the community. Each individual farmer In the Cow Testing Association makes a personal contact with the Extension Division of the College. They talk about bulls. A number of our tester's organi - zations put out 385 bulls last year and the testers themselves have succeeded putting in 385 pure-bred bulls. But someone measures that work in value and in its relation to the development of the dairy indus - try in Michigan or any other state. Now my final shot is, if every man who is milking six cows would just be a member of the Cow Testers Association, not for one year but for life or as long as he is in the game, just what do you think the result would finally be? If they all should be a member not for just one year, but while they are in the game, we would not have to question whether you can afford to join, but a question would soon become whether you could afford to stay out.

HAECKER: This Committee in making its report just wants to say that It is a pretty hard job to give to a committee to nominate officers under the circumstances. This Association sinco establishment something like forty-two years ago has come to cover a pretty broad field in the various industries, so we always try each year to help the whole industry. Now we like to pass these things around and recognize some of the men who have given such a long service, and who come down to the meetings. With some of these things in mind we present this list of nominees: President— Mr. Emery T. Peters, St. Michael. Vice President-Prof. H. P. Davis, of the Agricultural College. Secretary— Mr. L. K. Crowe, Lincoln, and who is now in this Department. Now for Directors: E. W. Frost, Woodlawn— representing Holsteins. L. H. Daft, University Place— representing Jerseys and Guernseys. E. T. Rector, Omaha— representing Creameries. Gilbert Eldredge, Omaha— representing Ice Cream. Prof. C. K. Morse, Curtis— representing Education. I move the adoption of this report and the nomination of those names. Motion seconded. All in favor of the adoption of this report and the election' of those nominated signify by saying "Aye"; contrary "No." Same is adopted and approved. Those nominated are elected. PROFESSOR FLACK: In representing the Cow Testing Associa - tions we wish to thank the Nebraska Dairymen's Association for giving us this co-operation and this opportunity to present our work that has been extended to us here today. We have a fine trophy here that has been so kindly furnished as an award this year and that is to be retained by one Association that wins it for three years Now this was won by the Lincoln-Seward Association this year. In - asmuch as it has been won by Lancaster two years and inasmuch as this Association has been a part of Lancaster-Seward in the past a question comes up as (o who should take charge of it. The sugges - tion has been made that it is to be retained six months by Lancaster County and six months by Seward County. I think Mr. Pfelffer deserves much credit in this matter. MR.

Stating It In another way — when the Extension Service has been given the support which we all think it should have, so that it can carry its activities into all parts of the State, then there wouldn't be any use for such a system as we've Kot. We've tried to pick it up and augment the work of the Exten - sion Service. That has been our mission. We have had certain clearly defined policies, which were that if we end up our five year period, or whatever the extended period may be that the subscribers of this Society shall decide to have, if we end up with less cowa in the Slate of Nebraska, but with a greater production, we will have aided to a very great extent. Now, in our report, which I will read to you, there are certain statements of accomplishment, and we don't want to convey the Im - pression that this Society is claiming the exclusive credit for any of these. It would be very hard to say just where the activities of one of these three organizations have ended and another begun. They are sometimes parallel. Possibly sometimes there is a duplica - tion of effort, but that has been avoided wherever possible. The credit belongs to all of the agencies that are working in this State. ANNUAL KEPOItT OP THE NEBRASKA DAIRY DEVELOPMENT SOCIETY By CARL R. GRAY, President Summary During the year 1926, the Nebraska Dairy Development Society's manager, 0. H. Liebars, and assistant manager, M. N. Lawritson, discussed dairying at 338 meetings in 72 counties in the state, at which there was a total attendance of 122,078 persons. One hundred seventy-six of these meetings were in the interest of boys' and girls' dariy calf club work, 71 for the discussion of feeding and management, 39 for the value of pure-bred dairy sires, 38 for the discussion of general dairying and 17 were devoted to cow testing associations. On request for service on some particular dairy problem or demonstration, 1,066 farm visits were made; 310 of these were in the interest of cow testing association work. Out of 310 farmera interviewed on this work, 102 additional cow testing association mem - bers were secured. Four hundred ninety farm visits were made on </seg>

Cooperated with lh^ Burlington Railroad last October in mak - ing a follow-up tour or the Burlington Sire Special which was run two years ago al which time a pure-bred sire was traded for a scrub sire in each ol 31 counties traversed in the state. The follow-up tour was conducted by the Burlington Agriculturists, an Extension Department representative, and the managers of the Nebraska Dairy Development Society. All of the 31 communities were visited and the sires and their offspring inspected. 7. Cooperated with the Northwestern Railroad on their success - ful Cow and Hen train conducted over their lines in this state. 72 stops were made, where 117,204 people passed through the train to inspect the exhibits, and a larger number listened to the lectures given from the platform at each stop. 8. Numerous reports indicate that the combined efforts of these various organizations and institutions cooperating has resulted in a general improvement of tlu- dairy industry in Nebraska. Through better methods of feeding and management, more careful selection of dairy cows, the use of more pure-bred sires, elimination of unprofit - able cows through testing, the equipping of dairy barns for comfort and convenience all have a tendency to make dairying a more profit - able industry. Hoys 1 and Girls' Dairy Calf Hubs Dairy calf club work offers the greatest opportunity for perma - nent and proper development of the dairy industry in Nebraska. Through the most cordial and effective cooperation of the University Extension Department, the railroads, State Dairymen's Association, Nebraska Creamery and Butter Manufacturers Association, Dairy Breed organizations and the Nebraska Dairy Development Society, a very satisfactory growth has been made in this work during the past two years The greatest results obtained during this time are perhaps not shown in the actual number of clubs atid club members but establishing the value of this work, and obtaining a general appreciation on the part of both farmers and business men of the great good that comes from club work. This better understanding of club work is indicated by the numerous requests coming from many communities for assistance in organizing dairy calf clubs for the coming year. The Dairy Calf Club work received Its greatest impetus and state - wide recognition of its value as an important factor of the dairy industry through the Dairy Calf Club Special conducted by the Union </seg>

This standard assures the proper type and also a profitable cow. It is very important that the club members, many of whom become breeders, be impressed with thi" importance of good breed, type, and also that 300 pounds production per cow should be the minimum. These standards will make the dairy business more profitable from both the breeding and milking standpoint, as a 300 pound butterfat cow will make a $100 profit per year above feed cost under ordinary Nebraska conditions. The Nebraska Dairy Development Society appreciates the oppor - tunity for cooperation with the Agricultural Extension Department and because of the importance of this work has arranged to devote a great deal of time to it the coming year. Increased Production Through Cow Testing Association Work During the past year the Nebraska Dairy Development Society has cooperated with the Extension Dairy Specialist of the Agricultural College in increasing the number of Cow Testing Associations in the state from six to ten with an increase of 1080 cows on test.

The following statements from Cow Testing Association members indicate their altitude toward this project: 1. Mr. C. E. Olmstead, Koca. Nebraska, a member of the Lan - caster-Seward Association, says, "I am very- glad to send you the figures on in v herd, taken front the Cow Tester's report: Butterfat Feed Profit Produced Cost Per Cow Average for the :!4 rows.. ., 400.9 lbs. $113.51 $10.5.74 1 high cows average 547.7 lbs. 112.71 175.42 4 low cows average 270.4 lbs. 89.80 49.40 1 high cow 605.8 lbs. 128.18 200.83 1 low cow 227.1 lbs. 86.17 35.99 "The feed was strictly "larm feed," no commercial feed of any kind being used. Alfalfa hay made up a large part of the feed. During November, December, January and February ground corn and cob was the grain feed. During the rest of the year we used ground corn and oats. During the fall and winter, corn fodder, fed whole in th" pasture, was us u d for part of their roughage." Dairy Development Through lletter Sires Two years ago the Burlington Railroad cooperating with the College of Agriculture, Nebraska Creamery and Butter Manufacturers Association, State Dairymen's Association, Breeders of Dairy Cattle, local organizations and the Dairy Development Society in running a purebred Dairy Sire special over their lines in Nebraska. The train traversed thirty-one counties, making a stop at a central point in ( ach county, where a purebred dairy sire was traded for a scrub. With the close cooperation of all the above mentioned organizations and individuals and the effective publicity that had been given to this movement, the effects of this train was almost state-wide, and was i he first big dairy development movement put on in Nebraska. Over 1 (10, 000 people passed through the train and inspected the splendid educational exhibits. In addition, a great many more listened to the lectures given at each place. Since the running of this train, hun - dreds of purebred fires have replaced scrubs, many new dairy herd3 have been started, and evidence comes to us that it resulted in a general improvement of the dairy industry. Last October, tw» years after the movement had been launched, the cooperating parties made a follow-up tour to check up on the results in the thirty-one communities. The report of Mr. H. L.

In every case, a decided improvement in quality of the offspring could be noted their 6 herds' 1 "^ made remarkable advancement in building up "The average gain in weight of the bulls was 825 pounds A total of 995 females have been bred to these bulls, 99 o f which were purebreds. Four hundred two of these cows, or 40 per cent, belonged to neighbors of the recipients, tp to date, 503 calves from these bulls ha e been dropped, 236 of which were heifer calves. Ninety of the SW ? r\ T bee " S ° ld f ° r Veal a " d ten sold for breedln S P^Poses. Six of the bulls were exhibited at fairs and won first place and several were awarded grand championships. In 90 per cent of the cases, th.s was the first purebred sire ever owned by the recipient, but in every case the men stated they .were well satisfied with the trade and they were convinced of the value of a purebred sire. Eleven of th° men are ready to trade for another bull, but seventeen prefer to wait one or two years. One hundred thirty-three cows, eleven of which were purebreds, have, been purchased by the recipients, since thev received the bull from the Purebred Sire Special. "Fifty-two carloads, 1200 head, of cows have been shipped into the communities and fifty-nine purebred sires have been imported since the operation of the train. It is estimated that butterfat production has increased 37% per cent in the territory- covered by the special. "The committee found dairy calf clubs existing in eight com - munities and plans are under way for organizing six or eight more. 1 here are ten cow testing associations in Nebraska at the present time, where only two existed before the Purebred Sire Special was operated. In nearly every community, there is a strong demand for good dairy cows and a very noticeable interest in better sires and better stock. Our committee saw some wonderful demonstrations as to the value of purebred sires and we feel that this agricultural prin - ciple has been sold 100 per cent in these thirty communities."

The purpose of this special was to increase interest in dairy and poultry production in Nebraska. The method of emphasizing these projects was through the use of practical exhibits, demonstrations and illustrated lectures. It was extremely practical in its conduct and purpose and was run for the express purpose of assisting Nebraskans, particularly the farmers, in their agricultural development. The "Cow and Hen Special" traversed twenty-seven counties of the state, stopping in seventy-two towns. A two or three-hour stop was made at each town and instructive talks and demonstrations by competent speakers were given. After the talks and demonstrations the people were invited to inspect the exhibits on the train. These exhibits included and emphasized practical dairy and poultry man - agement. During the twenty-four days the special was out, it covered 2037 iiiiles of the Northwestern lines and was visited by 117,204 people, who inspected the exhibits. The following comments are typical of many who visited the train and indicated their attitude toward this kind of work. One farmer near Cody said that in his opinion the meetings and demonstrations held at Cody were the most valuable for the people in that community that he had ever attended, and he felt that the Special would do a great deal of good. Another party ill Kilgore in commenting on results of the visit of the Special r.O </seg>

The only complaint I heard is that they were unrfble to spend more time in gotag over the exhibits. In addition it has led to more thoughtful consideration ot some phases of both dairying and poultry that have been recognized as belonging to good practices but have not been used One neighborhood where they have been following the feeding practices, the local poultrymen are switching over to the Nebraska ration recommended in one of the exhibits. This is just one case T I"/!," 16 ™ are many more that P rob ably will now show up, but undoubtedly, similar experiences will continue to come to light I have really been surprised at the ■ uniformity of satisfaction on the part of those who went through the train for I usually consider that it Is impossible to build an exhibit covering two large fields without missing some of the tastes of some people." Such comments indicate that a train such as the "Cow and Hen bpecial can accomplish much in- emphasizing agricultural education in Nebraska. It has shown the farmers and business men the need for thought and education. It has given them respect for advanced education and. at the same time it has done much in the way of developing a good feeling of the people toward the University. Assisting l)ree&lt;!ers in Securing Dairy Cnttle The Nebraska Dairy Development Society's slogan has been from the beginning, "Not more but better dairy cows; not the size o{ the cream check but a profitable cream check." We have an averago of one request per day for assistance to buy dairy cattle. It is our policy to always make every effort to secure the cattle ordered from Nebraska breeders. Very often it is impossible on account of other work scheduled to personally make the selection, so we refer them directly to the farmers and breeders having good cattle to sell This policy gives the breeders in the state the first opportunity to sell their surplus to those in the market for dairy cattle. As in every state where dairying is developing rapidly the demand for good cattle is greater than the local supply. This makes it necessary, especially when groups of farmers from. a given community request us to help them buy from. one to several carloads of cattle with certain definite </seg>

We are pleased to state that each succeeding year more of the requirements can be supplied with local rattle. We look forward lo the time when it will not be necessary to bo outside of the state for additions to our herds. The society has made a vigorous effort from the very beginning to discourage ihe bringing into the state of inferior dairy cattle. We suggest that all (hose needing dairy cattle get m touch with any of the following organizations who are m a position to advise them where they can secure good dairy cattle to the best advantage: Dairy Department, College ol Agriculture, Lincoln, Nebr.

We are able to trace the beginning of a good many splendid dairy herds directly to the influence of some good exhibit of dairy cattle. Because of the importance of this -work in stimulating profitable dairying, the Nebraska Dairy Development Society offers the services of both its manager-, O. H. Liebers, and assistant manager, M. N. Lawritson, throughout the coming year in assisting at Fairs, spending one day at" each of as many county fairs as their time will permit, to judge the dairy cattle and dairy products, give demonstrations for Boys and Girls' Dairy Calf Clubs, conduct Dairy Judging Contests and participate in any other work that will promote the dairy industry in that particular community. There will be no charge for this service, if the local communities will cooperate In giving adequate publicity lo the. special dairy program so that all the dairy interests in the county can be brought together for effective results. The rapid and substantial development of all phases of Nebraska's dairy industry is due to the splendid cooperation of the many organ - izations and Individuals contributing both their time and money. This is expressed in the following quotation from the address given by Mr. E. T. Rector, President of the Fairmont Creamery Company at the dedication of the new dairy barn, October 21, 1926. Mr. Rector, who has been, an active manufacturer of dairy products for thirty-six years in this state and a close student of the dairy industry, said ax follows: ■"I feel that I can further say- that the entire population of Ne - braska is now interested in some way, in increasing the dairy produc - tion. We have our University and all its departments, we have all these various associations mentioned, together with all the railroads, business men and banks', all contributing not only of their time, but their money to further and be'tter our industry. All these forces, working together, with a united front, assisted by these new fair trade practice rules and regulations, must result in a continued increase In our production; and may I now predict that nothing can prevent our State from soon going to the third, or possibly second place in the production of butter and other dairy products in the United States, a goal certainly worthy of our best thought and efforts." PRESIDENT GRAY: Mr. L. I. Frisbie" will address us now on "The Why and How of Dairy Calf Clubs." Mr. Frisbie is the State Extension Agent of the Boys' and Girls' Clubs of Nebraska. Mr. Frisbie. . - </seg>
            <seg id="p296">Rkport of Nkhkarka State Board of Agriculture THK WHY AXD HOW OK DAIRY OAJvF OIATOH By L. I. FRISBIE State Extension Agent, Boys' and Girls' Clubs, Nebraska. After hearing the report of President Gray, it hardly seems neces - sary to attempt to answer the two questions which have been assigned to me to discuss for a few minutes, the "Why" and "How" of Dairy Calf Clubs, but I may be able to add just one or two more "whys", which will be of interest to someone. When we realize the fact that we have in the State of Nebraska 150,000 rural boys and girls o£ club age who have only an opportunity of receiving agricultural in - struction through boys' and girls' clubs, we readily see one of the ' whys" for not only dairy calf clubs, but for a number of others. These are in and out of school. We have 50,000 of those who are out of school, past the age of 14, who In all probability will Never enter school again unless some unforeseen thing comes up that will bring them back. When we realize those staggering figures, we immediately see one of the "whys" for boys' and girls' club work. 1 might go on and (numerate a great many others of the "whys," as related to the dairy industry, and to calf club work. Perhaps the greatest "why" is the building for character in men and women that will be outstanding In the dairy business. Perhaps that may seem just a little strange, but if you had had some of the experiences that 1 have had and a numbei of others have had, you would readily see again why it is necessary to build for character among those that deal in dairy cattle. We have had a few experiences, very sad experiences, I am sorry to say, President Gray, that bring this thing home. Boys and girls must be taught that honesty is not only the best policy, but it is the only policy that will stand. And dairy calf club work attempts to do that very thing, train for honesty. You say "How?". In the first place, the boys and girls when they start in the cal{ club, start with the idea that they are going to keep records, are going to know what the cattle cost, what it costs to feed them, what they are going to return them. They are taught the very desirable results of knowing what each individual animal will return for the investment made. And then they are taught not only that, but to pass on the figures which they have, and that the figures are absolutely true. You know - some of the confidences in people as a whole are absolutely destroyed in boys and girls when they deal with a breeder, an older man or older woman, when they find that the calf that they have bought isn't as represented. And I am hoping that if we can't do anything else, that we may emphasize that point, that the boy and girl must be honest. Some - times we tell club members that there are two in the dairy calf club </seg>
            <seg id="p297">• Nebraska State Daibymen's Association that they can't fool. We generally ask them to name those two, and It isn't long till a hand will go up and someone will say, "I know who it is." We'll come back with, "Who is it?" and the boy or girl will say, "They can't fool me and they can't fool my calf." That's right. These boys and girls that are buying calves may be fooled for a little while, but when they keep records on that calf and it becomes a cow, it isn't long till they find out whether you are an honest-lo - goodness man or just a breeder of live stock and don't care very much about the live' stock at that. "Those two things are two outstanding reasons for "whys" of calf club work, aside from those given in President Gray's report. I think perhaps that is enough to add as to "whys." Let us just enumerate a few things. Increased production of individual cows — (hat is fhe outstanding .reason. The matter of establishing records, and the better cooperation, which has been shown by the President's report. If We start that cooperation with the boys and girls we aro going to have a better organization when they get to be men am! women. .We have this morning with us a few of the boys and girls who have been doing calf club work, and I'm going to let them take a good deal of the time, rather than telling It myself— let them teTl something of the "whys" for themselves. I'm going to turn now to the "how" of dairy calf club work, and give as briefly as I can some of the "hows," but before I do that I want to give you a little history of Nebraska calf club work. The first dairy calf club in Nebraska was organized in 1920, as far as the boys' and girls' clubs are concerned. There was a membership of 82, in five clubs. The next year, 1921, there were six clubs, and an enrollment of 55. In 1922 there were sixteen clubs and an en - rollment of 99; in 1923 there was a big jump— twenty-one clubs and 199 enrollment; in 1924, twenty-seven clubs and 229 enrolled. In 1925, as was indicated in the report just given, was a big increase, not only in. the general dairy work of the State, but also, in the clubs, where there were 498 enrolled in fifty-four clubs. With the big increase in the clubs in territory and enrollment, you wouldn't expect quite such. a good completion of the work, every boy sticking to the job, filling his final report and getting his reports in. A good many dropped by the wayside and .we only had 355 that were complete. This last year we had only fifty clubs, a number combined which were previously separate, and there were 502 club members, with a total completion of 422, who carried on the dairy calf club work and filed final reports, all the records for the entire season, which I think is quite a good record for Nebraska. But how were these clubs organized? First, let's give the con - ditions of a standard club. Any club can be organized where five or more boys or girls in the community are interested in that line </seg>
            <seg id="p298">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture of work, and can secure an older person, man or woman, but one who is interested in that line of work, to carry on and lead them in their activities. This club does several things which help in the de - velopment of the individual. First, the individual keeps a record of his work. The club holds at least six meetings during the year, more of th°m will hold ten, twelve, fifteen or twenty meetings. Each one of th^se meetings takes up a lesson which is sent out from the Agri - cultural College describing the phase of the work which is applicable to that age of the calf and the time of year. The first year's work covers from the time the calf is secured until it becomes a heifer. The second year covers breeding, feeding and care until she becomes a cow. The third year's worK covers the period of first lactation, and then it goes back in the cycle again. We are getting very interesting and valuable data on the results, and they are going to be more in - teresting, I think, as we get into the data further, when some of these calves get into the second and third period of lactation, and compare them with the cows on the farm where they are placed. We just had a report yesterday from Holdrege, from a member of the Chamber of Commerce. I want to explain a little about the perpetual calf club mentioned by Mr. Gray. That is the sort of thing that was started at Holdrege. They found that no one was much interested among the boys and girls and their parents in the matter of better dairying. The problem came up of how to get folks interested. This perpetual dairy calf club was presented to them, and appealed to them. They said, if we can invest $50 or $60, or what - ever is necessary, in a calf, and that will stand as a living example, and we can show it to the boy and his parents and the neighbors, and the others that see it, and it will demonstrate to them the possibility of better stock, a ?50 investment in the community is a pretty small investment. I just want to give this illustration from Holdrege. The man in Holdrege said they are ready to start another perpetual club. He said one visit made this last week will warrant that very thing. He said out here — I don't want to give the name of the place, it is a little distance from Holdrege — where a boy received one of these calves, it was the first real dairy blood in that neighborhood. When the calf had been on the place for a little while they noticed that instead of coming up as the other calves had, it commenced to outstrip the others in growth. They wondered why, and watched it. At the end of the first year there was a great deal of differenca. "Dad" said, "Well, I wonder if I couldn't get a calf like that for myself?" Yes, he could, and I think the Dairy Development Society helped him in securing a calf or two. But the big thing came this year, after the calf became a cow and reached the first lactation period, and they lound that it was giving as a heifer more and better milk, and was easier to handle, than some of the other stock on the place. They said that that man has just one of his old cows left, and the rest are dairy stock. Perhaps that is a "why" instead of a "how." </seg>
            <seg id="p299">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association I want to read to you just briefly this dairy contract. There are • three important features in the dairy calf club work, where it is . carried on as a perpetual project. The first is that you find money that can be invested in a permanent improvement in the community, with the idea that, it is never to be brought back in any other way than as improvement in. the dairy industry in the community. There are some twenty-six such organizations that have made investments so far in Nebraska, and I think they are all well pleased with their, investment. Ordinarily it would take an investment to organize ten or more, the calves distributed to the boys and girls under the contract, which reads something like this: rERPKTUAL DAIItY CALF CLUB CONTRACT This agreement made and entered into this _ day o? _ 192 by and between „ , Dairy Calf Club Member, Parly of the first part, and _, County, Nebraska, Party of the second part. Hereinafter, the party of the first part shall be known as the calf club member and party of the second part will be known as CLUB MEMBER • In signing this contract the dairy calf club member agrees: 1. To become a member of a dairy calf club under the super - vision of the Agricultural Extension Service, University of Ne - braska, and to carry out conditions outlined in their three-year dairy calf club project. 2. To attend all dairy calf club meetings outlined in the club program unless excused by the leader. 3. To properly feed and shelter the animal so that normal growth may be obtained. 4. To breed the heifer between the age of 16 and 24 months to a purebred bull, which shall be approved by the calf club committee. The heifer should be bred so as to freshen between September first and March first. 5. To have heifer'tuberculin tested each year or to be maintained as a part of a duly accredited herd. : 6. To carry insurance on the animal for the full insured value until the project is completed. 7.

            <seg id="p301">I Nebraska State Dairymen's Association There is a guarantee that the boy or girl is going to get a real deal, and learn how to take care of dairy products. The calf returned is to be given to another club member to carry on the work just as that member did. You see, there are quite a few things in the contract that are going to teach good dairying. There is one of the important thing? that should be mentioned, and that is that the success or failure of a ealf club depends upon the cooperation given by the local com - mittee, the local leaders and the parents. This gives you just a brief outline. I will leave these contracts down here so if you are interested in such a. project in your com - munity you may look it over and take the matter up in your com - munity. You will be well repaid for any effort put into it, or any financial investment. I want to give just another feature, that we are seeing the boys and girls come into the Agricultural College here who have been former club members, and they are taking a leading part, ' leaders in their classes and in other organizations. There have been larger numbers of them the' last few years. Today we have 49 men and 47 women who have been former club members. I am going to leave the rest of the story to others on the progress of the work. I just want to say that we are anxious to cooperate with any community and any person in the development of calf club work. PRESIDENT GRAY: We were to have had discussions on "Club Work', a Builder of Judges," and "Club Work, a Builder of Demonstrat - ors," by Kenneth Waugh and Harlan Peterson, but they are not present just now. So at the present time we will have the discussion on "Cluti Work, a Builder of Communities," by Miss Byrd Claybaugh of Valley. This young lady is one of the first who won the trip to the Sesquicentennial, which she took last spring. There she was awarded the gold medal as the outstanding rural school teacher in Nebraska. She was the leader of the State Champion Dairy Judging Team and Demonstration Team also. More than' this, she Is the principal of the largest rural school in America. Miss Claybaugh: </seg>
            <seg id="p302">Rkport of Nebraska Statk Board of Agriculture 01, IB WORK, A IU'IIjDISR OF COMMUNITIES MISS BYRD CLAYBAUGH Valley, Nebraska Mr. Frisbie has told me that he thought perhaps I would have to do the talking for my boys, too. I called Harlah and he said the roads were impassable. Just to give you a little understanding, I believe I shall otter this introductory. In the last two years I have coached demonstration teams, the first was at Ashland. I have had lots of fun, and they have lols of fun with me about that, but it has done a great, dea) of good in our community. In Ashland there are more people doing the work. It used to be that if a child brought a bottle of milk to school in his lunch he was ashamed of it, but it is very popular now. They were having some work in spelling in the Ashland school, and someone asked a youngster what he should do if he were not as good a speller as he ought to be. He piped up and said, "Drink more milk!" We have given this milk drinking demonstration a number of times — first in our own community, twice at the State Fair, and twice at Ashland Park. The first was given before about 500 children, and the second before the Parent-Teachers Association. It has been given a number of other places. This year our demonstration was the production of clean milk. This was given before our own people, at the State Fair, and at Detroit. The thing that all who heard it were impressed with was that the health of the cow is very important, and that the feed has much to do with health. Our boys and girls are all impressed with the importance of keeping records. We are all convinced about the covered pail, and we know that clean and cold are the two essentials of wholesome milk production, and I don't think that anybody who has heard our discussion will drink anything less than milk procured by dry hand milking. I feel that the work in Douglas County has been more influential than last year, that it reached more people. I wenl to Iowa and had a grand time. There were three members of the judging team, and an alternate. We visited over there at the Holstein herd and judged there, and the Guernsey farm and the Jersey farm. We enjoyed them very much and gained a great deal. And now. in regard to the talk I have on the work as a "Builder of Communities": 4-H Club Work us a Community Builder Up in the mountains of Montana, there nestles among the pine trees, a one room rural school that is a real community center. Fifteen years ago, this school district employed as teacher a woman </seg>
            <seg id="p303">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association with the essentials of leadership: Integrity, Perseverance, Faith, Ability to Plan, Vision, Initiative, and Courage. She is still there. The school house in which she began her work was a tumble - down shack in an undesirable, inaccesible location. With painstaking integrity and perseverance she worked her way into the hearts of the boys and the girls, and the men and the women of her community, until she had established their faith in her as their leader. She is one who likes boys and girls, and one who works well with them, and one with whom boys and girls will wo.rk. She has the ability to plan. • She caught the vision of what the community life was, and what she could do to improve it. She had the initiative and courage to build a- better community. She persuaded the school district to move the school house to a more desirable location. Clearing the grounds and moving the school house Was made a festive occasion. Men and boys did the work while the women made merry with feasting and entertainment. Gradually pride in. the school was established through frequent community center social activities. Today the school is strictly up - to-date; first, a piano to help out community programs; then pictures, a school library, a school kitchen where hot lunches are served to the school children, playground equipment, and a teacherage where Hie teacher lives a normal life in a home of her own. But what has this to do with 4-H Club Work as a community builder? Bless you, it was 4-H Club work that built the community." The teacher organized a 4-H Poultry Club and she herself was the local leader. They began on a small scale, but now the poultry busi - ness that the school maintains on the school grounds finances every - thing for the school except the teacher's salary.. They have modern poultry houses and keep several incubators running from about the first, of January until. school is out, keeping the first hatch for their own supply of pullets, and selling later hatches as baby chicks. The , work is done by the children under the supervision of the teacher. I met Miss Nellie Redlingshafer at Philadelphia as the Montana teacher of the Sesqui-Cenlennial Award. May I read her citation from the book of -Medalists'? THE AMERICAN TEACHER AWARD THE TEACHER MISS NELLIE REDLINGSHAFER, CRESTON RIVERSIDE SCHOOL . . TWENTY YEARS' SERVICE Citation j Has served fifteen years in small, neglected back-woods district with exceptional devotion, and has made it a model demonstration of what can be done in rural communities; began with rough pine school- </seg>
            <seg id="p304">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture house, no equipment except blackboard and box of chalk; organized school, secured equipment; gathered together unorganized mass of community people, interested them in community welfare and thus secured new school site, new building, new equipment, including kitchen for serving hot meals; interested farmers in clearing land for school, preparing garden plots, chicken yards and playground ■ equipment; caused well to be dug and buildings painted; organized potato clubs, chicken clubs, stock-judging contests. Result of her labors was to bring all the people of the community together to work for the common good; her graduates have always been well prepared for high school and college. To corroborate the statement made here, Miss Redlingshafer showed me a book of kodak pictures which verify the statements in every detail. In addition, she had many letters of appreciation from local and state officials. This verifies the statement I made last year at the Douglas County Organized Agricultural Meeting that 4-H Club Work can be a force to raise the standards of the rural schools. If this can be accomplished in the mountains of Montana, why not in any rural school in Nebraska? The problem is to get the inspired teacher. A good way to inspire the teacher would be to send her to Club Week and the State Fair. She surely would catch some sort of inspiration IF she isn't immune. Some of them are, you know. One remarked to me on my urgent invitation to visit the Club Building at the State Fair, "I was born on the farm and I have nothing in common with a calf." The rural schools are going to have to help themselves to better things. I want them to know that Ag College can help them a lot. Better training, longer tenure, and higher, salaries for teachers will help to improve the rural schools. It pays to get a good teacher and keep her, even if you have to double her salary to keep her. A cheap teacher, like a cheap anything else, isn't worth much. At Philadelphia I met William Penn — the boy from Georgia. William little resembled his quaint Quaker namesake. He was an hilarious reveler. But there was about him the same instinct to build better and for the future, as in the founder of Pennsylvania. His cilation reads: THE AMERICAN YOUTH AWARD THE BOY WILLIAM MARTIN PENN, THOMASTON BEN HILL SCHOOL BORN JULY 6, 1909 Citation Tenant farmer boy, formerly backward community; In competitive examination on knowledge of farm crops and live stock, 1924, was one of two boys from his county selected to attend Southeastern Fair </seg>
            <seg id="p305">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association School. • The experience inspired him; after return home he enrolled as a club member, then set about getting a larger enrollment. County agent felt possibilities were poor in that section and did not encourage the lad's' undertaking. After three trips to the agent the boy asked for some enrollment cards and in a few days was back with twenty-six cards signed by new members. Then the boy decided the community needed wholesome social activities as well as agricultural study, so he helped organize a community club of farmers, farm women, girls and boys. He was elected secretary. The county recognizes that the community has waked up and became most progressive in spirit and development. And the Georgia girl shared equally with the Georgia boy in - recognition of services rendered to her community. She, too, is a 4-H Clubber. Her citation indicates a brilliant future: THE AMERICAN YOUTH AWARD THE GIRL LILLIAN KNOWLTON, R. F. D.

Will train to teach home economics or become a County Home Demonstration Agent. You'll agree that Georgia may well be proud of these two young - sters. As long as they live, and wherever they live, they can never lose the interest in their community aroused through 4-H Club Work. They can't" be individualists, and it's going to be hard for the folks bumping elbows with them to be individualists. As to Ashland Park, we admit that much of our favorable news - paper publicity has come from our connection with the State College of Agriculture. . . . We have two 4-H Sewing Clubs. For two years our Mothers' Club worked under the Vocational Department. As an Outgrowth of that first year's work, our Mothers' Club began a library project which has been steadily progressing. They have financed their project </seg>
            <seg id="p306">Kkport ok Neiiraska State Board of Agriculture through school movies, paper sales, hot lunches, an operetta, a bazaar. The original object was to furnish the right kind of reading material to help take care of the child's leisure time. The school movies are always the better type. For instance, tomorrow night, we are having the Iron Horse. It correlates well with the teaching of history! Thrift is stressed through the paper sales. The hot lunch is a health program. We don't serve hot lunches regularly to our two or three hundred lunch people, but an occasional hot lunch is a step in the right direction. We'll conit to it some day and maintain a lunch room after the type of those in the city high schools, not as a money making plan, but as a health program. At our next P. T. A., we are presenting Cho-Cho, the Health Clown. Our P. T. A. has always stressed Health. We have received many suggestions for our pro - grams through the National Dairy Council and the Dairy Department here. Our children learned the eight health lessons from the wheel of health. Our Mothers' Club also made use of It. This year our Mothers' Club is doing the Convenient Kitchen Project with Miss Muriel Smith. This I think will help pave the way to the lunch room for our school. Our second year sewing club has done very creditable work. Two members attended Club Week here last June. I'm sure they plan to be back next June, and we hope to send some of the first year girls along. Mothers who now feel that the work done with the girls in posture is worth the price. (Miss Claybaugh exhibited some articles made by the girls in her sewing classes.) The Dairy Calf Club of which I am local leader has no members within my school district. I just fell heir to the Calf Club, when it was pretty well developed. I don't assume credit for anything except the Dairy Demonstration Work. I have given considerable thought, time and effort to the writing and coaching of dairy demonstrations the last two years. I believe it was Mr. Turner of Washington who said that he who measures up to the essentials and ideals of 4-H Club leadership must assume responsibility, give generously of his time, accept con - structive criticism in the right spirit, and WORK. The rewards are personal satisfaction, gaining the confidence of young people, personal acquaintance with college folks, approval of folks who know, and the improvement in conditions in your neigh - borhood. These are self evident truths: No community will go farther or faster than the majority wants to go. None will go farther or faster than local leadership will take it. No leader will go farther than the point to which he is inspired. </seg>
            <seg id="p307">Nehraska State Dairymen's Association- I like to come often to Ag College because of the inspiration I get here, and I'm sure all Club Folks feel the same way about coming. I particularly owe a debt of gratitude because it has been my privilege through 4-H Club work to attend the National Dairy Show the last two years at Indianapolis anti Detroit where I met the 4-H Club boys and girls from different sections of the United States, as well as the State Club leaders and the Extension people. And in addition, largely through the influence of the Extension folks, I was the recipient of the American teacher award of the Sesqui- Centennial. • Because of these contacts, I feel that I am more capable as a teacher, and as a 4-H Club leader, and as a builder of better community life. MR. GRAY: I am sure that talk was an inspiration to all of us. We are how to have a talk on "Club Work as a Builder of Herdsmen," by Robert Bushnell, of Woodlawn. He represented Nebraska on the Dairy Judging Team, college and club. He is President of the Uni - versity 4-H Club, and is now Herdsman at Woodlawn Dairy. He is the winner of the first Union Pacific Scholarship in Adams County, that enables him to finish college. Robert Bushnell: CLUB WORK, A BUILDER OP HERDSMEN ROBERT BUSHNELL, Woodlawn Mr. President and Dairymen. I suppose, the rest of you are won - dering the same as Mr. Frost did, when he. saw I was to be on the program and asked me what I was going to talk about. I told him about ten minutes. It gives me .pleasure at every opportunity to talk about, club work, because it has done a great deal for me. Before going any further, I want to say that there is a little misprint on the program. I am not a herdsman out at Woodlawn. I'm just working there, but I intend to be some day. Club work has done a great deal for me, and does for everybody. Every farm boy or girl who enters club ■work benefits by it. It helps to keep them on the farm instead of going to the white lights of the city, and that is one of the big things club work is doing, and the biggest benefit, I feel. Another thing is getting away from "my calf" and "Dad's cow." Club folks are supposed to own their own animals. If they are in a live stock club they do their own purchasing. It gives business training, club work does, in that you have to go out and select your own material for live stock, in case you're in a live sUmk club. I was in a dairy calf club in Hastings, and feel proud of It It influenced me in taking up the work I'm in now. . • </seg>
            <seg id="p308">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Another thing is the business training in keeping records, figur - ing up the profits and losses. You strive to have profit rather than loss. In case of a loss the club member is helped to locate the reason. This practice that the young boy or girl gets in club work will last throughout life. They don't leave you. Naturally, it helps them as they grow older and are in their own work. Another thing, is that it gives a fellow practical experience. He gets right out and does the work, and gets a working knowledge of how to do it. There is another thing, that Mr. Friable brought out, and that is honesty in club work. It should be emphasized. You are taught that In club work. That is another thing that lasts through life. There is another thing that is of value, at least it was in- my case. I was on a judging team going to Atlanta, Georgia, and I might say that the help I got was cultural rather than agricultural. I was eating on a diner. Of course we ate the meal, and the porter brought the finger bowls. I didn't know what they were for, and watched to see what other people did. But I didn't notice exactly how it was done, that they just dipped their fingers in, and I did more than that. That lesson was a help for a future time, when it might be a little embarrassing. Club work has helped me a great deal iu my college work, and will help anyone else that way, because you have a sort of working knowledge before you come to the theoretical part. And I think any professor in the College of Agriculture will admit the same thing. The other things in dub work that influence the club member to attend college, are the inducements offered by various organizations in the State. For instance, the scholarships offered by the Union Pacific. I might say that I have never had the opportunity to thank Mr. Gray personally for the scholarship I had, and wish to take this opportunity to thank him and the railroad for the scholarship I re - ceived. And these inducements will bring a fellow to college. Free club trips and Club Week are others. You become acquainted with the College and the professors. And if they are more or less familiar with college, they automatically come into the college and take up the work more or less as club work. It is just a continuation of the club work. I feel that my experience in club work has helped me a great deal in the work I am doin* now, in taking care of calves or feeding live stock. I was taught not to feed just what I had on the place, but to buy stuff to supply the missing elements. It has been a great help. Another thing I was out with the Woodlawn Show herd, and showing my calf in the calf club has helped my work with the Wood - lawn dairy. Club work is more or less an evolution all the way through. </seg>

I want to say to Robert that he Is under no obligation to anyone for it. He won it himself, and is entitled to it. Harvey Volger,' of Mead; is going to talk to us now. He is a member. of the Wahoo Chamber of Commerce Perpetual Calf Club.' In 1926 he was the champion of the Club, County and State, in Dairy Calf Club Work. He has been in other lines of Club work previous to the Dairy Club. Harvey Volger: WHY I LIKK THE DAIRY CALF CLUB HARVEY VOLGER, Mead I am a member of the Saunders County Dairy Club at present While a member of this club, I have had many note-worthy exper - iences. It was started by the Wahoo Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Lelbers was hired to go to Wisconsin to buy calves. It wasn't possible in Nebraska. Five were bought in Nebraska in accordance with the requirements of the Chamber of Commerce, and the other five in Wisconsin. In 1925 the Chamber of Commerce distributed the calves. I received one; and found out that it was real luck that gave me this- calf. After that I found that my experience was worth while. We had regular meetings and lessons, and the help of. leaders — Mr. C. M. Moyer, Mr. Plack and Mr. Frisbie — and have accomplished very much in our community. The Wahoo Chamber of Commerce started another club, a Per - petual Dairy Calf Club, and distributed ten more calves. Our old club" has been increased to 12 members and the new club has 10, a total of 22. The Dairy Calf Club enrollment is larger than the Baby Beef, so most of our time is devoted to that. While in Dairy Calf Club work, we found that by studying and practicing what the lessons gave us, we could show our calves suc - cessfully at the fairs, and when the Union Pacific special train came through our calves were present and shown on our own ability as showmen. The County Fair calves were judged according to the calves themselves. We didn't take any of them to the State Fair, because we were handicapped, so we have . just been working in Saunders County, but we have received comments from people on our work. </seg>
            <seg id="p310">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture that they have profited by it, people that we never expected to help. In most cases the calves went to communities where people were not previously interested, and some thought it rather foolish. In fact the Chamber of Commerce spent over $300.00, and people thought it was unnecessary. But people who said that have apologized, and have praised the Wahoo Chamber of Commerce for starting this work. Now most of our calves have become cows and started the first, lactation period. The first female offspring is to be returned. This year we have purchased 10 more, but In 1927 we expect to have calves of our own, from the club members, and in that way save the expense of starting a new club, or combining it with the two now started. I was secretary one year and vice president the next, and received a free trip In 192 G to the National Dairy Show at Detroit. Each year this organization selects a calf club member, I don't know just what basis the selection is on, one from each of the 14 middle western states. It was my first experience in any such trip, and I profited much, not only by the show, but by the trip on the way and the time spent there. We spent most of our time at the show taking in the demonstrations and judging teams. We took trips about' the city not connected with dairy work, but which were most Interesting. We found after returning home, and talking over what we had seen that most of us individually thought we had profited more by attending this than we would have gained in knowledge in school during that lime. We thought we had profited, probably not in the same line, but in a different line, and more like club work than our school work. Of course, our school work was made up later on, so we felt that we had gained a great deal. We feel indebted to those of you that have helped make club work what it is. And as members of the Dairy Calf Clubs we wish to extend our clubs,' increase our enroll - ment, and do more for those that helped us get started, so we may help future clubs, and look back and see what we started. We will probably see what has been accomplished by Club work, even if some people do think it is just to have a good time and get a calf free and feed it and let it run with "Dad's" cows, and brush it up a little for the County Fair. But if they go at it this way they usually fail, and the people in the community think calf club work is not what it ought to be. They probably would have won a prize if they had worked as they should, and have been members of some demonstration work or judging team. The community would have recognized the boy as an outstanding member of the group, and In that way tried to help their boy or girl to become members of the club. In this way the club enrollment could be increased, and could do a great deal of good in the community. PRESIDENT GRAY: No introduction is needed for the next speaker. Everybody knows Ex-Governor S. R. McKelvie. Hon. S. R. McKelvie-. </seg>
            <seg id="p311">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association daihy calk clubs and • future dairying HON. S. R. McKELVIE, Lincoln President Gray and Members of the Society: You have a double advantage of me. You are not obliged to speak following two young club boys, thus suffering by comparison. I noticed also that you had your speech written for you, and I haven't. But I have this ad - vantage over you, that I have the inspiration of all that's gone before, and that will more than make up for the advantage you have of me. Unfortunately, the climax of my speech must come first. Mr. Chairman, I was going to finish my talk off, and it would have been a very short job, too, with the introduction to you of boys and girls who have benefitted by your Union Pacific scholarships, since offering these scholarships for successful candidates in communities where the Union Pacific passes, $100.00 for the long course and ?50.00 for the short course. I understand that about 30 of these boys and girls are down here each year. I have. invited them over here, and am going to ask them to stand— the boys and girls who are here on Union Pacific scholarships. (The boys and girls stood up In various parts of the room. Applause.) I know that you will appreciate more than we can tell you how these boys and girls feel about the contribution you have made to their success. It's a fine demonstration of the service being rendered by you and your corporation. As I listened to these talks this morning, and heard about ths progress being made, and then looked at the subject assigned to me, two texts offered themselves to me. I am going to speak upon them very briefly, I notice first that my subject might be subdivided. It reads "Dairy Calf Clubs and Future Dairying." The first part, "Dairy Calf Clubs," just represents a sermon that comes down through the ages.— tne thing that a boy said to his mother, "Wist ye not that 1 must be about my Father's business?" It means this in my mind, that every boy asks himself this question, and asks the older people, "Do you not want me to begin to think for myself?" The question was asked 2,000 years ago by a Boy 12 years old, and boys throughout the- years following have asked the same question. They expect us to answer it. We say, "You're too young." That is not tht&gt; answer. We cannot discharge the obligations we owe in this manner. Wo must say, "Yes, we want you to begin thinking about things that interest you, along the right lines." The first thing I do at the State Fair or County Fair is to go to the boys' and girls' exhibits. You can get more inspiration out of an hour there than you can in a week at the rest of the State Fair. You can see the results of their labors, with the answer to this </seg>
            <seg id="p312">Rkport ok Nebraska State Board of Agriculture question asked 2,000 years ago. They have begun to think about iheir father's business. This year I passed among the buildings, and finally came to a tent with exhibits of swine, boys' and girls' pigs. I saw a little boy, and lie was certainly Riving the side of one of the pigs a good polish. In my youth it would have been more difficult to get me to wash myself on Saturday. I saw in another pen a boy giving a shine to a black, sleek pig. I said, "How are you making it?" He said, "All right. I guess." What do you feed him?" "Everything." He added, "She is not doing as well as she should. After the Fair I'm going tn give her a good turning out with the others." I said, "This other pig is a better one." He said, "Yes, and do you know that pig didn't get a prize at the County Fair? The judge didn't know his eggs, that's all." As Mr. Frisbie says, you can't fool a boy. I'd hale to be a breeder who sold a calf^br pig to a boy feeling il wouldn't turn out all right. I wouldn't want to have that on my conscience. This boys' and girls' calf club work is the biggest thing in the history of our agricultural work today. It shows up along the entire line of agricultural projects. There was registered this year at the College a very fine class or boys and girls, and I believe the principal factor acting for it is the foundation laid in boys' and girls' club work. So much for that phase of the subject assigned me. Coining to the other phase, "Future Dairying." That suggests to me the text of the man who went out to sow some grain on the road and it was consumed by birds, and planted some on the rock and pome among thistles, and some on good soil. That is the answer of dairying in Nebraska. We have here all of those things. You can give your feed to animals that will return a result as though it had been left along the roadside. You may feed it to animals of a character as though it had fallen upon rock. You may keep in your herds the type of animals that are thistles; or you may combine all the elements of good feed, good care, good animals, and good judgment, and it will Increase your results many-fold. These (wo maxims have come down to us through 2,000 years. and they are still true, and will be true throughout all the ages that follow. Thus we find the combination between boys' ana girls' club work and every other agency that's working for the improvement of dairying. We may not have the finest condition for dairying in Nebraska that may be found anywhere, and yet I'm not sure that there is a place that's better. Wisconsin has far outstripped us, but we are making gains upon them. I don't know what they have to enable them to be a better dairy state. I believe they have nothing </seg>

May I say in closing that I think all of us have certainly realized by this time that .Nebraska is essentially limited to an agricultural state. We haven't those natural resources which have benefitted so many of the states, but the soil and the climate we have, certainly in the greater part of the state, is a tremendous asset when you add to that the intelligence and industry and genius of a people. And so, we've got to deal more generally, more largely, in things allied and related to agriculture, than they do in states more happily situated, with respect to natural advantages. We can do that because we have the foundation here, I feel very confident. I think this when I see the gathering here of people interested in every phase of agriculture. In enthusiasm and interest and intelligent application, there is an inspiration which I certainly have enjoyed, as I'm sure you have. Any member of the Society here who has anything to offer as to comment, criticism or suggestion, we would certainly be glad to have you speak. The work has been developing along the lines we thought were best. We have steered an even course, and have sought an oppor - tunity to get into the boat and get hold of an oar and do our share along with the rest. </seg>

At the Lincoln Hotel JANUARY G, 1927, EVENING : .; . SAMUEL R. McKELVIE, Toastmaster Lincoln, Nebraska ' I ■■•■■-. PRESIDENT CHARLES GRAFF, of the Nebraska Improved Live - stock Breeders' Associatioh: I hope that the dinner that has been served will not make you feel any the worse and I know the balance of the program will not have a tendency to do that. You know, my friends, this evening is practically the closing of this Wonderful week's program of Organized Agriculture. This evening we are meeting here at a little banquet offered py the Dairymen's Association of this State, and Improved Livestock Breeders' Association. Before I introduce the Toastmaster of the evening, I wish to thank the ladies who com - posed that orchestra. Now; I want to say this that in the past at our banquets we have had music of the kind that grates on the farmer. The farmer is not accustomed to standing for any jazz or any crazy stuff. The farmer is used to looking at life more or less seriously and the music of this evening : agrees with us fine for that reasoh. We. like this serious music that stirs up a man and woman and makes their memory go way back in their lives. For once I want to express my thanks for that kind of good music and I want to thank those who had charge of the program for showing us for once that it wasn't necessary to endure a lot of that jazz stuff which we escaped this evening. Now we have some very prominent speakers here. I want those speakers to feel that their itime is not limited. We are going to cut </seg>
            <seg id="p316">Report ok Nebraska State Board of Agriculture out all preliminaries and give the balance of the evening to those speakers. We have several here, each one of them I know has a message for us that is well worth while, so I will proceed now to introduce the gentleman who will act as toastmaster for the evening. When I first became acquainted with this young man he was just a young pig slopper out here in Clay County. He has been successful since then in breaking into politics, and into most everything else, so I take the pleasure now to introduce to you our old friend Roy McKelvie. not just Samuel R., but Roy. EX-GOVERNOR S. It. McKELVIE: My friends, I have assumed you are prepared to give us your attention for a little while and be ready to enjoy what is in store upon this program. I appreciate the introduction that was given to me by Mr. Graff, not just Charres Graff, but Charley Graff. He has taken some liberty with me so I think it will not be amiss if I told you that not long ago he asked me if I had ever seen one of these machines that knows and registers. it when you tell a lie, and he said, "Did I ever see one, why man alive. I married one." Sb I believe we can. say that Mrs. Graff knows a iot. Now a definition that I heard recently of an after-dinner speaker is one who is a patriot who is willing that his listeners should die lor his country. Now I am not going to ramble on here and deprivo you of what is to follow and take away from the speakers, I don't, want to take advantage of the time they should have on the floor by taking it for myself, so I am not going to take very much of your time. It I were to be in a reminiscent mood I could unduly prolong this banquet. I can remember when these banquets were first attendee by myself. That was quite a long time ago, though they Were held long before that. The banquet of the Improved Livestock Breeders' Association has become a very important institution. Now during these years, the industry that is represented by the people gathered here has had its ups and downs. The curve repre - senting the tr«nd In livestock business has not been level by any means. I think the fluctuation in livestock has been rather pronounced, but I may also ?ay that I believe we are facing a rather hopeful prospect of the future. You may or may not know that at a disper - sion sale of Jessie Ingalls held yesterday and today at St. Joseph that the first fifty Hereford cattle averaged over 1750.00 and the next 75 head averaged over $500.00 a head. Now I am not going to go on speaking before you this evening. My business is to present these other folks to you. Now I am certainly glad to be able to introduce the husband of Mrs. Carl R. Gray. This is a gentleman who is certainly able to speak for himself though I know we are all proud to recogniz* both Mr. and Mrs. Gray. Mrs. Gray stands foremost among the women of Nebraska and is known far and wide for the work with her Sunday School Class which she conducts from WOW </seg>
            <seg id="p317">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association once a week. Now. we are -glad to have Mr. Gray here and he will address you on "Nebraska's Greatest Opportunity." We are glad to see him here to speak and we are proud of the interest he takes in our industry, and proud of the fact that the head of one of the great Railroads in this Country would take time to bo with us this week. Mr. Carl R. Gray, President of the Union Pacific Railroad. "■ NEBRASKA'S GREATEST OPPORTUNITY MR. CARL R. GRAY I suppose. that I nave got to speak in the. third person here and start out by telling you that Mrs. Gray's husband says so and so Now I think I have only had one other such experience. Sometime ago I was down at Princeton University attending some occasion and someone pointed to me and said, "Do you know who that fellow is?" and upon inquiry of the other person remarked, "That is Howdy Gray's father." I probably can say to my friend, the Governor, that some - thing like this is coining to him some of these days so I will then have a feeling of sympathy for him. Now I realize it is hard to do justice to the subject you have given me, "Nebraska's Greatest Opportunity," because "greatest" is some word. It sort of reminds me however of one of the stories about old Governor Bob Taylor of Tennessee told one time, concerning an old slave that his father owned, who was a preacher. Now Taylor's father was. a preacher and on Sunday morning the old darky came around to get the old minister's text, then he would go and preach on the same text. So he came around one Sunday morning and asked for.the text and was told that the text was, "I went forth among the multitude- and healed divers | diseases." So the darky went homo and told his people, "My text; loday is about dangerous diseases that can reach people. I went forth amongst them healing divers disease. There is smallpox and yellow fever. The doctors can cure them both, but if you ever get th'&lt;s divers disease you am sure gone." X rather imagine in this free Western country we use superlatives rather freely. I really would feel that I was rather presumptious in endeavor - ing to outline the greatest opportunity Nebraska has, but I' think I can outline what I would consider to be a very great opportunity, and when you advance anything I think you should be in a position to believe it. One time some years ago before aviation had become a real - ity, I was out on an inspection trip down in Kansas. I came to a town . called Girard and it seems. that there was a flying machine there and there was quite a crowd in town to see it. When we got there it was beginning to get dusk. This was an- awesome thing that we saw. </seg>
            <seg id="p318">Rkport ok Nebraska State Board of Agriculture I remember it had a beak something like a bird and they say individ - ually that it was a bird. After looking at it for some time with a degree of skepticism that I hardly wanted to admit, I said to the old banker who had accompanied me and he stayed with me pretty close. "Do you believe in that thing?" He said, "Do I believe in it, Great Heavens man, I have got my money in it." 80 what I am going to advance to you this evening as one of Nebraska's Greatest Opportunities is that we have our money invested in it and have other people's- money invested. It is a great deal more of a responsibility when you invest other people's money than it is when you just invest your own. That is what some of these companies call, "0. P. money" when you have money invested that belongs to other people. Now I want to speak of the boys' and girls' club work which has been stressed upon by the speakers this week. I want to particularly emphasize the boys' and girls' club work in this state. I think all of us realize that it is only a short time until the generation that is coming on is going to replace us in the worth while activities of this State. We know also thai this is especially a first class agri - cultural state, probably more so and more exclusively than any other state I know of. Nature has been very kind toward us in a great many ways. It permits a high type of agriculture, but it is incumbent upon us to adopt and impress the best methods of looking after what we have received and to bring about the highest type of agriculture. Now two years ago our railroads financed a special train which went into twenty-two counties in this State. It was a condition worked nut that before the train would stop at a point the business men of that community should evidence their support of the boys' and girls' club. They should take their proportional cost and provision made for fine pure-bred animals to be given to the individual boy or girl or children. Thus in twenty-two towns, through the generosity of the Breeders' Association, a fine pure-bred animal was left with some individual connected with their respective clubs. This year we made a follow-up survey of that work and all of the individual boys and girls who have been selected for these clubs interviewed and the results of their years work was gone over, the club activities were reviewed. That brought us up-to-date in that phase of the work. A most grat - ifying result was reported. A greater degree of interest was created in dairying at all these places and a stimulation of pride and initiative among the individual boys and girls in their calves. It was not my privilege to see all this, but I saw two of the particularly interested ones and if I have ever had a thrill since I have been in the State it was in those youngsters. The pride they had in each one of those animals, although they had them in hand and had worked with them such a short time they already had what you might call a great deal of knowledge and had a wonderful idea of the necessities of caring </seg>
            <seg id="p319">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association for high grade animals. The pride and grasp of business that had apparently been aroused in these alert young minds left an impression on my mind that I never will forget. Now another thing which appeals to me was that the animal is the boy or girl's own property It is not a case of raising their animal until it becomes a good cow or good animal and then have the father appropriate it, which seems to be a little unfair and thoughtless of parents; It is the individual property of the boy or girl and must be so rated within their own names and in that they are protected. That is in my judgment one of the greatest opportunities in one of the greatest businesses in this State. We have fifty-eight boys' and girls' Dairy Calf Clubs now with 550 members. That is just the beginning and when those remarkable potentialities are surveyed for this State, it is a liberal education. It is a process of selection that makes the individual boy and girl stand out; as the person who can represent some particular superiority of mind or character in connection with a work which represents an attractive idea of what these boys and girls can become and merits the attention and support of the men who finance these clubs. It is a challenge to the child who enlists to attain the superiority which he or she has been marked for. We gave a scholarship in each county through which our railroad runs and is offered to members of .the boys' or girls' club, who are recommended by the extension service of the College of Agriculture. I have received letters from a good many of the boys and girls who have succeeded in getting these prizes. Some of them send 'me their pictures. They come into my office and they give" me a great thrill of pride, some of those boys and girls who have written me very splendid letters and told me' about their products, and how they have worked and why they have succeeded in getting to this point. Now I get them not only from Nebraska but from the Western States out from Oregon, Wash - ington and Idaho. They would make a valuable volume that some - body else will inherit some day who can make a proper record of them. SoTne pyschologist could learn a great deal from a deliberate attention to the letters. We do not have any thought of espionage, but we do intend to follow up each one of those boys and girls and see what they accomplish in their lives. That makes a won - derfully interesting study, if you could follow up their particular accomplishments and see what the mental effect of their work is, and have the boys or girls influenced by it in' their entire life. I have tried to co-operate with them just as I would with any business man in the State of Nebraska. We are. glad to take pride in. our Agricultural College. Now I don't need to tell this audience or any other audience in Nebraska that in this College we have a great. asset. I don't like to think of it just in the terms of a plant even though we have a good school here, and an asset in our work. . . ■ </seg>
            <seg id="p320">Report ok Nebraska State Board of Agriculture We haven't the steel and iron resources some States are for - tunate to have; we know we have to get along with the kind of plant which fits our situation and we do not want to confuse it with material plants but we want to stand on the output of raw material (hat it produces. It is the character that is apparent. Its output is character. Its output is the sentiment and ideal of character instilled into the mind and thought and into the lives of the boys and girls who are going back on to the farms or to those who act of matured consideration have decided to remain in the town or city, those who have brought something really constructive into their lives. It is going to give that wonderful understanding, not only of the privileges which their father and mother have bestowed -upon them, the sacri - fices that they have made for them, and without which they would take a greater burden in living their own lives, it is going to make them better and bigger citizens than their parents perhaps have been able to obtain in their own lives. I don't pretend to say that this is the greatest opportunity that Nebraska has, but I think it is a specifically great one and we can lend our energy to improve it. I think it is well worth the effort of the greatest man in this State who has pride in its future and an interest in its prosperity, to take part in this work, and who wants to see it realized in greater asper - ations. I thank you. EX-GOVERNOR McKELVIE: After introducing Mr. Gray as I did, I think it only fair that you should meet Mrs. Gray. Most of you probably already know Mrs. Gray through her radio Sunday School Classes. MRS. CARL R. GRAY: 1 would just like to know how many of you do belong to my radio Sunday School Audience. Please hold up your hands. (Liberal response.) TOASTMASTER McKELVIE: We will now hear from one mem - ber who is on the program this evening without any special subject. I asked him what he was going to do and he said, "I fiddle," so we will now be glad to hear from "Rudy." TOASTMASTER McKELVIE: I am sure Rudy has given us music on his violin that did not jarr anyone's sensabilities. It wasn't all jazz. I asked Frank Tomson what it was that Rudy was playing and he said he thought it was Mendelssohn's "Spring Song" in B Flat. You have heard of the lady who came tearing down the street in an automobile and came nearly running into a Traffic Officer and he says, "Stop, hold on lady, what do you mean by going down the street forty miles an hour?" She said, "I wasn't going forty miles an hour, I wasn't running thirty, no I wasn't running thirty because this can't even go twenty-five miles an hour. I am sure I wasn't even going 20 miles." The cop says, "Hold on, lady, the first thing you know </seg>
            <seg id="p321">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association you won't even be moving." Now I am pretty sure that Mrs. Needham wm be moving along. She is editor of the Household Department from the Corn Belt Dairyman. She does this work as well as take care of the home and has three young ones of her own. She is going to speak about "White Faces," whatever that is, but it is going to be good. ■;..;,: HOPE NEEDHAM: I have felt like visiting royalty this week. not only because of the wonderful treatment that I have received at your hands here, but because of the number of times that you have nru SPeak ' N0t l0ng ag0 there was an °ther visiting Queen visited. When she was booked to speak at. the Drake Hotel in Chicago she denied the announcement that she hadn't any appointment to speak there, but they announced that remarks would be given by the Queen Finally she said that she didn't need the time but 'they wanted to give her twenty minutes: The people gathered and they said it would be twenty or thirty minutes now before the Queen would speak After a long long time the Queen did speak. This is approximately what she said, "I am awfully glad to be with you in your beautiful city I hope you like me." That was all, as I remember the story. I know I sat there two hours to hear that broadcast from the radio station at the Drake Hotel. But since I have been here this week I have felt kind of sorry for the Queen when I stop to think that she probably had to speak a good many times a day. I can at least say as she did that I am awfully glad to be here. I hope you like me. .1 know that I like you even if I have had to speak repeatedly. I am going to tell you a. little story that came to me and carries a message that I would like to give to you. This relates to a matter of the health of our children. If we expect them to be successful in life. A mother brought into a doctor's office one time a very pretty High School girl and said, "What can you do for her doctor, she is awful pale?". He said, "Yes, she is awful pale." The mother said, "She is in her Senior Year." The doctor said, "We have no right to treat children so they will be pale in the Senior Year." It is our duty to look after their health in such a way that we can turn our children out and send them out in good health and not have them be pale-faces but have rosy cheeks. We at least ought to bring about results in raising our children right that they will correspond with what they accomplish in the field of livestock. I just want to leave this message, with you that the wives, mothers, and teachers from Illinois, Nebraska and the state of Iowa, Kansas arid other states. You can help us In this and you can take hold shoulder to shoulder with us. In a few years we can prove to you that we are going to do a very valuable job. Let's leave rosy faces and not white faces with our. children. TOASTMASTER McKELVIE: Our next speaker has been with us long enough that we know him now. He comes to us from Canada. </seg>
            <seg id="p322">Rkport ok Nkdraska State Board of Agriculture He has contributed a lot to the success of the meeting. His message this evening will be well worth while. You might know that he cornea from Canada, and from some of his other talks here and especially this afternoon we found that he was an advocate of the 8 hour day. That conies right along in sympathy with the farmers of this region for here the farmers put in two 8 hour days usually.. Anyway this man has done a very remarkable work up in Canada. You have heard the story perhaps about the lady who went to the store and wanted some bread at 5c a loaf and she asked how much it cost them and they said 6c a loaf and she says, "Well how can you make any money selling it at 5c if it costs 6c." and the answer was given that they could not do it except they put in such very long hours and' sold so much. However this would not apply to the farmer. -Now I am going to turn you over to this speaker who has a wonderful message to this man who can speak from experience and I present to you Hon. Duncan Marshall, now of Alberta, who was Commissioner of Agriculture for Canada for two. years. MR. MARSHALL: Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, it seems to me that 1 have put in more than 8 hours today in talking to you at the meetings. If you are as tired of the sound of my voiC2 as I am myself I think it would be better for me not to spend too much time with you this evening. I have been working and talking since about eight o'clock this morning, and then talking in the after - noon and now 1 come to the evening, I told them that it' might bo all right to be put on this program but I didn't know just what I would have left that I could talk about and it was suggested that I talk tonight a little something about breeding of livestock in the old land. Now there may be some good lessons that I can bring you along that line, and from those lands across the sea. It has always been my desire to go to the old Country, as a boy I had dreamed about that until 1 got to go with my father and spend some months in that region. 1 had not been born in Scot - land but was born in Canada. I did not hold the privilege of being born in Scotland. My father used to tell us a good deal about this old land. To him it was the most delightful place this side of the Golden Gates. If you just wanted to get a glimpse of Heaven the only thing you would have to do would be to go to Scotland. I began to think that that was as close to Heaven as I would ever get. Well I made this trip over there and found it a most delightful journey from the Port of Liverpool over to Glascow. I didn't need anybody to tell me that I had crossed the most golden land to get to the place of my ancestors. We could look out of the window and f=ee that wonderful country and see where the livestock could stand knee-deep in the luscious grasses and there they stood silhouetted against the sun looking as beautiful as any painter could display. I want you to take a litle trip with me that I made a few years </seg>
            <seg id="p323">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association later, and just visit this country for a few moments. We can get a view of what a boy saw who came from Western Canada. We got a motor car in London and started for Scotland. I won't take time tonight to try and say anything here about the historical panorama that is unfolded as you make that tour on that trip from England up into Scotland. But I can at least say very sadly that there is no agricultural country that can compare with that region as you wind along through there. Past the great splendid town houses sur - rounded by the many acres of the flowery fields against the green it looks as though they were, woven in a loom and had never missed a thread, in the shuttle. When it rains there it rains so easy. It doesn't come like it does in our country where it just spatters down until it washes about everything away. But there it just rains down so easily that it almost makes you think that rain in England and Scotland comes down like a gentle benediction on the grasses and the field. When it finishes you feel like you had come to almost a different scene. The rain has washed all of the dust from the dry grasses and you look over that landscape onto a scene that makes you wonder how It could have 'happened. When we got to the great city of Edinburg a great show was on. I might say it seemed to a very small boy that it was quite a treat to attend the great Agricultural Exhibition and show or livestock that they had there. Then when we got through visiting that wonderful show at Edinburg there was other interesting things to be seen. I can particularly recall a tent - lunch that we had up at fhe George Finkler Farm, there we met Lord Rosebury. He is the great judge of Aberdeen breeds. I sat down with him at the table, looked around the tent and I saw a number of signs that were somewhat unusual. One pointed out that good whiskey was sold at this stand, 30% true at the price of two shillings per glass. It is hard to realize that whiskey would be two shillings a glass from a country that knew so many distillers. Also it is hard to think that any Scotchman could be pursuaded to pay such a price. .. Now on that trip I was introduced to one of the most remarkable characters among livestock breeders, Grant Swath, 97 years of age, and still well informed on the market. In his time he had been one of the greatest auctioneers in Britain. In his early days he had been a real Influential character. When Earl Roseberry was Premier he had dealt intimately with Mr. Swath. There was no class of people that he would rather associate' with than those who were engaged in the breeding of livestock. In .his judgment as to conditions in that business, Mr. Swath was usually found to be correct. Since that time I have on two or three occasions been able to renew the acquaintance of this old patriot. One day he sold 36,000 Igmbs at a stock sale. That will give .you an idea of how this man could dispose of live - stock in Great Britain and other countries he had sales that startled </seg>
            <seg id="p324">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture the world. I just say this to show the wonderful amount of good that could be obtained from talking with this wonderful gentleman. Any stock man from this side of the Atlantic can well afford to go over there and find out what they have done to make the breeds' of livestock finest that they have got in the land. They have studied and secured the best from all parts of the world. In the first place to make a livestock breed such as they have in Great Britain possible, they have secured the best in the United States of America, from the Dominion of Canada, and the Argentine Republic, from South Africa, Australia, and from every country in the world. These are brought into the Aberdeen region and they have the wonderful short - horn cattle and their other breeds to show for It. This they have done in a land that seems to have plenty of rough land as they have in . Scotland but it seems to you as a rugged country. It has not been' a quick job to do what these men have accomplished in developing the livestock breeds. It is not considered anything for the effort to be carried on for over 100 years on the same farm. In Scotland in England and in the counties around there you will find where they have made a good success but they stayed with the breeds for generations. One man, Thomas Bates, who has become one of the greatest breeders of Shorthorn cattle in England explained that one must prepare himself for any such a great enterprise and not feel that two or three generations is too long a time to strive on one farm to accomplish something in livestock breeding. It has been tliis consistent effort that has brought the men to some of these farms to a place where they go down In the history of the particular breeds. You have all been interested in these stories told to illustrate the penuriousness of the Scotch. I believe most of these stories on Scotland are really relished by the Scotch if they do not have a hand in making them. We may dwell at length on the penuriousness of the Scotch, but we should not fail to reflect somewhat upon the untired patience they have exercised and shown in developing such wonderful breeds of livestock. Of course we all dwell upon the grandeur of the Lucky Mountains but let us compare the moments with the grandeur of Scotland as you look upon the wonderful grass and heathers and conceive anything more beautiful than that land. One can look at these wonderful herds of their sire cattle and the heifers. The Scotchman produces more perfect lines in his livestock, the most beautiful animals there are. The people over from this side of the Atlantic are apt to be a little bit skeptical in regard to the livestock. They are the same way with machinery. A South Omaha man was over there and one of the proud Scotchmen pointed to one o£ theiv lakes and gave it's name and the American says, "What, a lake. You don't call that little pond a lake, why in our country we wouldn't (-vtn call it a frog pond." Undaunted the Scotchman then pointed our another scenic attraction and called it a mountain and the Ameri- </seg>

The American says, "You call that little wart a mountain Why we have got mountains over on our side that would make that look like; an ant hill in our country." But when you pass up tha "2 b'u, a "rf °° k ,, at S ° me ° f the beaUUeS ° [ that «»«T»oo cannot help bu admire it with wonderment, but when it comes to getting by' Thorn Tt^t 0^ a " AmeriCan CannOt dCny the id * a by Thomas Bates that if you are going to get a wonderful breed it must take a long time to work it out. I recall that these results of A B v«r 1 ° f J3S - irk P atrick . a breeder in the north of Ayrshire. He had ninety Ayrshire cows, twenty-two of which wer* two-year-old heifers. The records of these cows were kept largely on grass and none of which were milked longer than forty-two weeks and some under forty weeks showed the result of such long careful breeding. These ninety Ayrshire cows milked only twice a day made an average of ninety-two hundred pounds of milk.. That is on forty to forty-one weeks. I could site many more such instances of results from this land that it would only bore and not detract from the songs of their lyric poet, Burns. He was a poet, but he was a farmer too as can be gleaned from some of his lyrics. Now before I close I just want to give you one illustration of the work accomplished by a Scotchman, William Duffy, who was a farmer and became a foremost breeder of his day. Great men of the country have visited the William Duffy farm and been introduced to his Short - l.orn cattle. Boys and girls when they go past raise their caps to him. They always respected him because he called them by the first, name, Willy, Johnny, or Jim, and he would hope they would have a good day for their picnic or for whatever they were doing. This man always had kind words for the youngsters and they did not forget what he would do for a ten or twelve-year-old boy. He would take a boy by the hand and tell him some stories. So it was years after when he visited the king that the king said to him, "Duffy, you have done more for Scotland than many men who have occupied cabinet positions By producing the kind of cattle that you have produced and improving the greatest industry in Scotland, you have made it possible for the men in that industry to be proud of what Scotland has done." Now no greater mark of success can any man ask to achieve in his business than tho records William Duffy made by his simple faithful work in this line. You cannot challenge the pedigree nor question the success of these breeds. Now I could go on indefinitely with the description of the achieve - ments of these Scotch breeders, but I will just close with that sincere tribute to these honest men of Scotland. I thank you.

            <seg id="p326">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture (Dr. Downs then presented his team on Judging of Dairy Pro - duets.) -■ DR. DOWNS: Last year I had the pleasure of taking three members of a team to the National Dairy Show. This contest was entered into by twelve other teams from different institutions in the United States and the members of this team whom I have just intro - duced had one boy, Mr. Crowley, who had won in his work in the cattle judging team, at ten o'clock at night. The next morning he went into the product contest and judged the entire group of products con - sisting of ten samples of butter, ten of cheese, ten of ice cream and (pn of milk and came out second man in the contest on American Cheddar Team. That was the record of Antone Crolick. One of the other members or the team is Harold Klosh of Plainview, Nebraska, and the other member is Mr. Donald Ray. Now Professor Derrick in - troduced the Fat Stock Judging Team. You have heard my story for the last three years. We cannot win the entire line of prize? every time. We were first at Denver last year, first at the National Swine Show, third at the Royal Livestock Show in Chicago and third rt the International Livestock. There were twenty-three other teams from the United States and Canada competing. One of our boys fin - ished fourth out of one hundred and fifteen students from the Agri - tural Colleges of the country. Prolessor Loeffel presented the Meat Judging Team. I know you are all Interested in products on which the Meat Judging Team disr played its ability. You are all interested in meat either from the viewpoint of being producers or ,from the standpoint of being con - sumers. The Meat Judging Team is the infant of the group of various judging teams that are fostered and brought forth from our College. They are getting right to the front in this activity. It took part In the First National Show which meet3 the products for contest this year at Chicago, held under the auspices of the National Livestock Meat Board. Don Ray is the first Meat Judge In the United States. Frank Reese and Peter Pratt of Beaver Crossing were also on this team. The other member of the Meat Judging Team is Russell Kendall of Lincoln. CHAIRMAN McKELVIE: We are certainly very proud of all &lt;&gt;f our judging teams. I am now about to introduce to you a couple young men who are members of the Filipino Club of Lincoln of which there are thirty-five members. They will give us some music. CHAIRMAN McKELVIE: Now as we come to the close of this program, I am about to present Piece De Resistance. Many of you have had the privilege of meeting the next speaker though I have not had that privilege until this afternoon, but I was more than fully repaid then. He has more than lived up to the expectations that have been aroused by Frank Tomson telling about him. It reminds me of a </seg>
            <seg id="p327">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association • story of a fellow who located in Los Angeles and had to have enough money to go Into the business of selling waffles. He went to San Francisco and established a waffle, stand and then he went over to Sacramento and put in another stand. He was doing sufficient busi - ness in towns there and a friend came to him and wanted to know how business was getting along. He says, "Oh, I am doing fine; last week I took In $500.00 and the week before $600.00, yes I am getting alone fine." So the friend said, "Well, can't you make me a loan of $200.00?" The waffle man said, "No, no, I would be glad to do it, but I can't as I am under an agreement with the banker that I wouldn't go into the business of loaning money if he wouldn't go into the waffle business." Now the next speaker made no agreement with anybody as to whether or not- he would go. into the iivestock business. But he has always been successful in whatever he has gone into and he is going to point put some ways for others to succeed who have gone into the business. Mr. Swift is a man who has achieved an outstanding success in his business and is from one of the largest livestock com - mission houses in Kansas City, so I take pleasure in introducing to you Mr. J. C. Swift of Kansas City. MR. SWIFT: Mr. Toastmaster, Ladies and Gentlemen: I am not appearing here this evening as a livestock commission merchant but glad to think that I am to appear as a business man. After six or seven years of activity, I am glad that this title has been given me, but I am not to appear here even as a business man, but rather I am to appear here as a practical livestock man and farmer. I am appear - ing as another Dairying American who considers it extremely fortunate to have been born in this country, to appear here as one who believes absolutely in this part of the country and In its main industry and believes particularly in its agriculture as the main industry of Ne - braska. I am feeling particularly fortunate indeed in being booked here to respond to the toast that is printed upon the program, "Rural Pride Is Justined." . . I am particularly inspired upon that subject by the splendid eloquence of the distinguished gentleman from Scotland via Canada. I am a great admirer ot Scotch. Is Rural Pride Justined? I want to say candidly all of the scenery as well as all of the trips are not in Scotland. But I have enjoyed following our friend from the time his motor car landed in Scotland until he went through that belated country and enjoyed those opportunities and as he carried out the mission to buy the 100 head of Shorthorn cattle. I only wish that every man who tries to become more efficient in dairying as the years roll by might have had the'privilege of seeing that Canadian bargaining with the native Scotch while he was acquiring those 100 head of . Shorthorns. </seg>
            <seg id="p328">Rkport of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture When it conies to scenery no. man is more appreciative of Scotland than I am and no man is no more appreciative of the Scotch man and the Scotch women, or Scotch scenery. Of course I know nothing about Scotch whiskey. I am privileged to know one of the greatest characters that any man could ever claim as a friend. The Scotchman with whom I have been privileged to break bread at our table. I have been privileged to enjoy his Scotch courtesy and he is a character from whom we may all learn. I am just going to relate an instance about this man who is outstanding in the live stock industry of this country. But I want to tell you because to know this Scotchman is to admire him. This man had become a great leader in the ranch interest and he at one time had an appointment with a then President of the United States of America, one of the greatest and most interesting Americans who ever lived, Theodore Roosevelt. I know that most of us appre - ciate that great character as one of the great students of the whole American people. At this time this Scotchman had ah interview ar - ranged for one-half hour. When they had been in there about ten minutes the President arose from his chair as if to terminate the interview. He said, "1 have been allowed an interview for thirty minutes." It looked as though the President was going to terminate the interview, but this is what happened. This Scotchman simply and directly said, "Sit down, Mr. President. We have an interview arranged for thirty minutes and only ten minutes of the time have been con - sumed. I want to talk to you of the great industry that I represent lor twenty minutes. Sit down Mr. President." Mr. President did sit down and this Scotchman did talk to him for twenty minutes and from that time he became one of the close friends of that great Presi - dent. Whenever the great President of the United States of America wanted to turn to some source for absolute dependable information with reference to the livestock industry in the United States, he turned to that great Scotchman, and there he got accurate information. You have got to admire either a Scotch man of woman, singly or collec - tively. No man could read the poems of Scott without a great appre - ciation. No one can ever have revelled this fine writing of Scott without knowing that they represent a race of those who are flnp and who have become some of the great fine citizens of this country. If you have any pottry in you, you will see that from this race has come many of the great among the millions of our western continent. If there is any poetry in you, you will hear it. What Is more beautiful than the pictures some of these poets have drawn. They have taught us to love the country. What is a more beautiful picture you have sf en than when you can see wheat in the shock. What is more' beau - tiful music than you could hear than the rustle that comes from acres of corn. You know, my friends, you don't have to go back to an old country where you have lived or to a former home. If I can say anything tonight that I would like to impress upon you, it is the answer to this question, Is Rural Pride Justified? .Yes, </seg>
            <seg id="p329">Nebraska Statk Dairymen's Association thank God, Rural Pride is Justified. You people who are inclined to measure as some of us are, to measure things in a material way, we can. hardly ask whether Rural Pride is Justified. I can only say tnat we can take pride in the fact that most all of our great leaders came from the rural district] I don't care whether it is in Lincoln Kansas City, in Omaha, Chicago or New York, practically all of our great leaders come from some particular rural section If I should call the roster of the leading business enterprises in Kansas City you would nnd that most of them come from farms, some of these men would respond if you would say from Leayenworth, or from Lawrence or from Topeka, or from Boone, Howard, or Nodaway county in Missouri none of them are far from the land. But that same would be witnessed if you called the roster in Omaha or Chicago or any other great center of population. The answer would be practically the same. Js Rural Pride Justified? I would say that your rural pride can well be duplicated and has been for many years before us. Now there is another thing to be considered by all of those who live in the larger countries. We must associate the dependence of our life upon those people who are engaged in the activities of rural life. You and I who live in town are absolutely dependent, upon these splendid men and women who live in the country. We must depend upon what they produce.. When I tell you that Nebraska produces over $300,000,000 from her soil every year and then I tell you that she has only about one and a quarter millions of people, can you realize what will be the contribution she makes to the lives of those who live beyond her borders and in the great centers. We are accus - tomed to look at things in a big way and to talk in big terms and to think that everything will be well. Everything will be well, my friends, if you and I will come to and continue to recognize the obliga - tion we owe, the call of the hour to recognize the Scotch. Just at the present time we must declare that. Rural Pride is more than justified. But on the other hand rural sources are not receiving their claim nor their due, because at your hands they are not receiving in the measure that is justly theirs. I am not putting forth the plea of poverty on the part of agricultural interests. Rather, I am just simply replying to many of my friends who have 'been advancing such a doctrine. We American people have always been inclined to recognize the just claim. But we have not been entirely fair on this occasion. In a few years those of us who have been fortunate enough to create some means, in my judgment, and in that of the recognized leaders who are active in this great western country will have to bring about a situation toward which the tide is beginning to turn. It begins to show that the agricultural future is important and unless remedied those of us who are left to take an interest in rural affairs will be reduced to the state of urban dwellers. It is Hot going to continue, however. We cannot continue under a </seg>

The radio has described any isolation, and lias been conveying a message, and a gospel to the farm people and bringing them practically into our midst. We are living in a wonderful age and these wonders ha\e .not begun to cease. I would say that you and I owe to the civilization, we owe to the community of which we are a part, we owe to the community which produces so much for us in our property, we owe for the safety in our municipality and wp owe a duty to our State, and if we can only stop to ask if we are discharging those obligations and duties. I wish I might feel that in the hearts of every man, woman and ihild who live in Nebraska that there is the same dear love of native land as you have seen manifested here tonight, as we have heard and felt from across the border through the presentation of our distin - guished speaker from Canada. I think maybe there is more love of nature than often is visibly expressed. I think a good deal of this manifestation of regard for material things is the careless way of ours, and is more or less super - ficial. We all remember that it was not so very long ago that we had our attention brought to these things seriously and solemnly in the great crisis and tiie affairs of the world and we responded. We might say thai America has always responded. I believe that we can sincerely answer all criticism of our motives by saying that we an - swered without asking for any soil and we simply did our duty as we saw it. I believe that has been our history in the past and will distinctly continue to be in the future. As far as world pride in Nebraska is concerned there is no ques - tion about that. Nebraska is distinctly a rural state. It always will be. Such few cities that it has are dependent upon the villages. Whatever we have in Nebraska it is distinctly rural in its final analysis. You haven't any coal mines, you have no oil, you have no forests, you have no minerals, you create and produce your products right out of the soil. You have no foundries to fabricate the ores that might be shipped in from distant points. You have no gold mines, but you have gold in a way that no man can measure. . You have production of a kind that no man can measure. In the western part </seg>
            <seg id="p331">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association of your state you have sugar fields and no man can establish their value to Nebraska. You are in a leading rank in the number of acres of food produced in. the United States, and we might say in the world. There is no danger of r.unning out of a market when you consider the number of mouths that are consuming that food and that are increasing «by the millions every year. There isn't anything that can co.me before the law or supply and "demand.- There is a pride justified n those who are playing square and who are meeting the calls on this demand for a production. These are men who can meet their consciences and know they. are meeting the laws of God. My friends such men and such women can live freer than any king or queen There is no greater satisfaction that can come to anyone than to feel (hat they are mastering their own destiny and that they are producing for the needs of others. That response and recognition creates a wonderful satisfaction that can come to you. There is a great potent satisfaction that can come to one who holds in the palm of his hand thousands of dollars to enjoy but that same power in its manifestation can come to the" man or woman who brings into the world great children, educates and developes them into wondrous men and women and gives them to the community. They have done the greatest work that it is possible to do. I-kave been seeing and hearing here today rriends, how you are doing the greatest work that can be done as I have seen your boys and girls pass. We have seen these splendid examples of this work. I have asked a question and received its answer and we, can say in Nebraska that as long as youth, eternal youth is recognized as it is here that there is nothing going to fail for Nebraska. Rural pride, civic pride, state pride are all that might be expected and more than justified if you can go on hand in hand working in this State as you are working with the young folks. If you men on the ranch, on the farm, and you business men in town can come together for a united Nebraska, 1 can see in the future nothing but a favorable place in the relationship of a united nation in the future. Yes, this pride is justified. All 1 ask is that you shall be true to your faith, live as yoi( are living, do as you have done and always remain Irue to this State and hold these ideals in the future as you have in the past and I believe your posterity can be proud of this State and your pride can be justified. I thank you. </seg>

This carrying over of scientific information from the laboratory and the school into practical use in the home is developing a young eager group of housewives, a few of them trained, needing to know certain tacts about housekeeping and knowing that they need to know. And here is great opportunity for the home economists and also a great joy. In working with the housekeeper, you find that what you teach her today about management, about laundering, about cooking. becomes a part of real vital experience in her family life before sun - down. No matter how beautifully we plan the home project for children, it often happens that the things we teach them they do not use for years. It we are to make the most of the opportunity, it behooves us to watch and consider this change in attitude] What is It this young housewife wants to know? She wants to know about marketing, whether, time considered, it is more economical lo run a bill for groceries at the corner store or shop for cash at chain stores. Shall she send the washing to a commercial laundry or have Lizzie come for a day? Cooperative laundries sound fine but can they be worked out? Shall she use linen on the dining room table or these pretty enameled cloths? " How would easing on the. kitchen table effect one's standards of management andi aesthetics? What are the comparative merits of flaked and bar soapl, and what kind shall she use in the kitchen, laundry, and bathroom? How do commercial water softeners compare in use with the olid standby. Sal Soda? When it comes to select new curtain materiali she wants to know which kinds wear and stand the test of time aiid sunlight. She is tremendously interested to learn whether or not thef mechanical devices she sees advertised or in her friends homes will really save hei time and money. It is amazing how general is the use of labor savers. At a recent meeting of some fifteen women, obviously with very low incomes, ton had washing machines, all of which represented a real (sacrifice in money. Other machines about which women want to krtow are the different kinds of vacuum cleaners, kitchen cabinets, pressure, fireless, and electrical cookers: they need to be told how much ihoney, time and labor is saved by using these devices, and how the standard or work turned out compares with that by the old hand method. The question of ready-made versus home-made clothing is by no means completely settled. Some of us have come to belieye that, gar - ment making has been taken out of the home because (f improved style and improved wearing qualities of ready-to-wear garments, but the young housewife seems to devote more of her tinif to spwlng than in the past, finding that she can dress her children better, that her own house dresses are prettier and more durable if she makes </seg>
            <seg id="p339">Nkiiraska Homk Economics Association the garments herself-.. Among the reasons for her greater interest in sewing, are the improvement in commercial patterns and the intro - duction of time-saving methods. A. woman is not so much interested in the finish of a garment as in the effect. One of the most startling changes is the attitude toward house - hold financing. Most housewives of today have a more vital part in managing the money side of the household than their mothers They are very much interested in budgets— not budgets based on some vague theoretical distribution of the family income among various items of expenditure, but budgets corresponding to what is actually standard with other women on incomes like their own. The subject of nutrition, especially child nutrition, always gets a. hearing, but the great query today is not so much what shall be fed as why? The intelligent woman of today wants to know if there is any value in this iodine gait that she sees in grocery stores, and whether she shall serve yeast to her family. Let us note some of (he changes in rural life. Are rural commun - ities advancing and how can this progress be noted? During the past year in 42 county rural leaders conferences in Iowa, 1347 men and women leaders of 360 rural community organizations were repre - sented. There were many discussions which sheds some light on the way farm people answer these questions. Most of the leaders were either officers or members of committees of township farm bureaus. In every one .of the 42 counties, farm bureaus have been active 8 years or longer. Every local farm bureau was associated with the state, and national farm bureau federations and in each meeting the relationship of township, county, state, and national organization was emphasized. Each conference was conducted on the "round table" basis, the discussion in the forenoon session starting with the inventory of past accomplishments. Every person was urged to answer the question, "What are the recent changes affect - ing farming and farm life promoted by the farm bureau which have had the greatest effect upon the people of your community?" Many of the reports were taken down verbatim by a publicity man who also had a part on the conference program. Then at the close of the discussion a vote was taken to secure expression which could be summarized. There is inspiration in the vision of sound, constructive thinking shown by these men and women on farms. First may be given the statement by Frank Yocum, president of farm bureau in Harrison County. He says, "I really think the social life we have enjoyed since the farm bureau has been in existence has materially benefltted our section more than any one thing." • . A woman leader in Jack Creek township said, "I believe we are learning to stick together better in our work for a common cause. </seg>
            <seg id="p340">Rkport (ik Nkiir\sk.\ Ktatk Board of AoRicrt/ruttK In the nutrition work we have learned the value of a balanced ration. More women are becoming interested in keeping home accounts. The introduction of new devices in kitchens has also been most construc - tive. The club girls have learned to sew and are taking more pain3 with their work. They now take the initiative in their meetings and can conduct them like veterans. Social life in rural communities has been greatly henefitted since the advent of the farm bureaju in this county." Many of them mentioned state and national legislative accom - plishments but in every case the leaders agreed that as far as changes affecting farm conditions in their communities were concerned, the local activities which were developed to meet local problems and in their organizations cooperated with County Agents and otljer repre - sentatives of the State College and the U. S. Department of Agricul - ture, would hold first place. The other day I heard of a farm woman who voiced resentment . because farm life is being "so thoroughly spotlighted," as she expressed it. "Why the business world even interviews us to find ou ; whether we wear rubber garters or keep 'em up some other way," she said, "I don't like it. I believe in more privacy. Our business is not everybody's business — even to garters." We had a hearty laugh about it and then I set to thinking and the more I surveyed the matter, the more clearly I saw how and perhaps why, not farm life alpno but the entire world is being "spotlighted." Everyone of Jus is out to learn all that can be learned about what and how the other fellow is doing so that we can beat him at the game. And thej result is we are motoring up the road of progress on "high." I believe it is very fine that the farm home and the farm father and the farm mother and the farm children and the farm business are being scrut - inized from every angle. It is good medicine. When you are before the footlights and you wear your party frock and "do your stuff" the best you know how, and teach the fellow in the audience some - thing, so when the man canvasser or young woman investigator calls on you, tell them all you know and whether you'd like to see things changed or stay put. It all makes for improvement and the Grand March Forward. A new kind of woman movement is unostentatiously sweeping over the prairies of Kansas and Nebraska and the cottonflelds of Alabama to the vineyards of southern France and the sugar beet fields of Germany. It is the farm woman movement which crystalized attention in this country last spring when the conference of farm women met at Chicago in March. The lives and futures of some 7.500,000 women and 16,000,000 children are said to be involved in the U. S. alone. And their ailment was diagnosed as an "inferiority complex." </seg>
            <seg id="p341">Nkhraska Home Economics Association- Now that, same tendency to organize and to consider group pro - blems, collectively,, is said to be making headway in Europe. No inferiority complex seems to bother European farm women and they are scrutinizing many subjects such as sanitation, health, and house - hold equipment, education for children and recreational programs. The United States Department of Agriculture recently sent a representa - tive to observe conditions among rural women of Europe, and this observer, Miss Grace Frysinger, Extension Home Economicst, U. S. Department of Agriculture, was the representative, declares that the movement to organize to promote welfare has already, made great advances there, though a comparatively new development. A conse - quence of social significance that may be stressed is the demonstration of great lady — cottager. It seems as if women in all the world want much the same things, peace, security, an ordered home life, freedom from two monot - onous drudgery. Libraries, better movies, bank accounts, better rural schools, labor saving machinery in the home, good medical care, music, better preaching, closer co-operation between farm and town people, and most of all, recognition of the farm woman's undeniable social and economic utility — these are only a few of the things that dele - gates to the Chicago conference declared they wanted. It seems now that European women want them too. The slogan of tomorrow may be, "Women of the world unite." A posture demonstration by Margaret Medlar and Betty Temple of University Place, champion Home Economics Demonstration team of the state, was next on the program. The girls explained and demonstrated a series of exercises to strengthen various physical weak - nesses and emphasized the advantages and importance of proper posture. . ■' V tj^^^^s^^^^grifcs^^^S^t^ ' ' ■ ."2. \^ -**■■'» jW 1 1 IB' '^r^iHI ■ jH 29 '^H y*r*^K *•' •'•*' B^^a Betty Temple and Margaret Medlar of the Pollyanna Keep Well Club, Lancaster County, State Champions in Home Economics Division of Demonstrations at the 1926 State Fair. </seg>

Miss Rowe said that some of these wants came further down the scale than others because some are individual things. Som« cannot be handled immediately and that some are being done bv other organizations. In the Round Table discussion the women brought out the need of better schools and better trained teachers. Miss Rowe then asked the women: How many were at last school election? How many know Nebraska requirements for a Standard School? How many know whether or not their school measures up to this? How many have a community school day? What they have done to make their teacher happy in the com - munity in which she is teaching? She told the mothers there is a ministering need for mothers . on "the job of the school" the same as in the home. She told them that a school will follow the same trend in which a community leads She said tKat solution of these problems is in their hands and that they could have a revolution if needed. </seg>
            <seg id="p343">Nebraska Home Economics Association- Tuesday AFTERNOON, The afternoon session opened with the following musical number by Mrs. Berenice Heed Mailer, soprano and Mrs. Fleda Graham acconipanjst. "Now Sleeps the Crimson- Petal" . o,,nt^ "The voice and the Flute" .. Nursery Rhymes" , _ _ Curran _.. , "The Eager Age" was the subject discussed by Hope Needham, Editor Household Department of Omaha Daily Journal Stockman. THE EAGER AGE When I accepted the invitation to address this gathering, I did so incomplete darkness regarding the subject on which I was supposed (o talk. But I accepted, rashly and enthusiastically to meet you people because Nebraska is a very near and dear state to me, invested with sentiment and romance from my earliest childhood. My father and mother came to Nebraska in the early homestead days in the nineties, no doubt with the same boldness and confidence with which all of us begin the great adventure of seeking our fortunes. Five of their children were born here in this state, before the pitiless and lelentless powers of nature drove them and many of their fellow settlers back to the East from which they had come— back to Illinois (I suppose you refer to us as The East, which always amuses us very much (here in Illinois, for we consider ourselves good red blooded Westerners. The effect East/to us, is just a bit farther on toward the sea board. I have oftsn wondered just exactly where the West begins.) . - Their parents before them, In earlier years, had treked from the East, Ohio, to what then was the farthest rampart of civilization, Illinois. They endured hardships, of course, but some way they man - aged to weather the storm, and they never went- back. But those Xebraskan homesteaders of the nineties suffered more bitter adver - sities. In Illinois the pioneers contended with swamps and forests and Indians and wild animals, rattle snakes and zero weather in winter and malaria in summer, but there was seldom a crop failure. While here in Nebraska, in those days &lt;I don't know how much circum - stances have changed), there was barrenness and loneliness and danger enough, and in addition to these were disheartening crop failures. The sand storms which mowed down their crops and stung their faces, bit into their hearts as well. I have heard my father tell of those dreary years when the settlers were forced to accept charity in the the form of clothes and fuel and seed from their more fortunate fellow countrymen. He was on the distribution committee and man - ure the human dramas he can describe that came beforn him in that work. </seg>
            <seg id="p344">Report of Nebraska Statk Board of Agriculture But I mustn't make the picture too depressing. There was friendliness and neighborliness and humor in that pioneer life, as there is everywhere if we look for it. I remember (that is, I remember from frequent repetition in the family stories, as I was only two when we. left Nebraska I , that w^ had a pale Jersey cow and a curly black rfog out here, and somewhere within sight of our claim was a sandhill or mountain. The dog I am sure was named Nig, but I am always confused as to whether Old Baldy was the cow or the mountain. But all this has little to do with the teen age. In those days, there were probably few representatives here of that interesting period of life, most of the settlers being newly married folks in their twenties and thirties, with families of small children if they had any at all. I imagine it was when some of rtiose children reached the teen age that Nebraska began to pick up as an interesting and successful place to live for wherever there are teen agers there is action and ebullience and daring. Any of you who read the Omaha Journal Stockman will know that I have no children of teen age myself. Our three are all under ten years. No doubt you are wondering what authority I have to address you on such a subject as this. I must confess that I have not done the sort of research work with adolescents that one woman has done who will address you at this meeting. I am looking forward just as eagerly to Dr. Hedger's message as any of you. As I mentioned in the beginning, I accepted this engagement without knowing just exactly the topic of the meeting, but even when I found out the topic, after a moment of panic, I resolved to come any way. On taking inventory of my stock of information of the teen years, I felt that I had three grounds on which to base a few words to you. In the first place, I was once a teen ager myself, tho I had forgotten a great deal that happened in those crucial years until I took the time to bring them back to memory, and when I had brought them back I felt that many of the incidents were like out-of-date photographs in the old family album, a little embarrassing. In the second place. I have done more or less reading on the subject, partly because periodicals are so full of it nowadays that one can scarcely read at all without encountering it, and thirdly, since I have served as editor of the household department of the Corn Belt Farm Dailies, I have received endless numbers of most intimate and touching letters from those who are in the throes of growing up. In our county at home, some of us who are mothers of children of pre-school age are taking a six months' course in child and parent training from Miss Edna Walls, specialist from the University of Illinois. When she appeared before us for the first lesson, she began by saying: "I venture to say that every one of you came from a home this morning when somebody had made the caustic remark, 'So you're going over to Ottawa to have an old maid who never had any children </seg>
            <seg id="p345">Nebraska Home Economics Association tell you how to raise yours.' " Some of you may- have had similar feelings about me; a woman who has never had a teen-ager to con - tend with In her own household Is going to lay down the law to us who have. If you have had such thoughts, let me use the same answer to you that Miss Walls, used to us: I wouldn't if I could; and I couldn't if I would. I wouldn't because it isn't my job. Every child has a right to be -brought up by its own father and mother. And I couldn't if I would, because I don't know your child, and no rule of thumb will work unless the individuality of the child is taken into account. - Now just a word as to why we discuss the subject, or any phase of child training at all. Not long ago in the course of one of our many discussions in the Household Department, some one remarked (per - haps it was I) that usually an only child, especially in a rural family, was to be pitied, for every child needs contact with other children for his best development. A correspondent wrote in answer to this: "How do you get that way? I was the youngest of eight children and my husband the youngest of six. "We never got any of this con - tact; all we got was to be bossed around. We have one child, and . that is all there's going to be. Believe me, he gets enough contact at school. I wouldn't go too much on this scientific stuff." A great many people- feel that way. They think scientific stuff is bosh. They, believe that the natural parental instinct is a sufficient guide for bringing up children. But many of us, unfortunately, find ourselves so short on that commodity, that we are willing humbly to seek outside counsel. When we get to wrestling with these adolescents, we feel sadly in need of, help. For years, these children, bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh, are more or less docile and understandable. Then suddenly, the adolescent ferment begins to work on them, and they, are strangers, unapproachable and unfathomable. We are likely to blame it on heredity, and we do not make such a great mistake In doing so, for of course every child carries in his blood potential characteristics from an enormous number of ancestors besides his parents. The only unfair phase of this solution is that we are so prone to attribute any oddities at this adolescent age to the other side of the house. Adolescents in the family are a good deal like operations or first babies. ■ They seem so very momentous, they upset us so, and every symptom seems so stirring, until frequent repetition and comparison ' with other similar cases convinces us that our fretting is unnecessary and our operations o'r our first baby, or our adolescent child Is following quite the normal course. With operations, of course, we always hate to admit that our case Is commonplace. But with the adolescents there is comfort and relief in finding that all other parents are experiencing our worries. I wouldn't put it so strong as to say "misery loves company" — but you get the Idea. </seg>
            <seg id="p346">Rkport of Nkhhaska State Board of Agricii.tlrk This teen age problem began to be stressed soon after the war We were inclined at first to blame the recklessness of| modern youth on the war; but really the war has had more than its bhare of blame lor many things. War time developed the term "flapper." That is why we are more likely to deal with the girls than the boys It must be because girla are more articulate and less bashful than boys and they force themselves on our attention. Perhaps they always were, but they used to have the reputation for being modest. It didn't used to be considered good form to display one's opinions and emotions in public. Good form is not much of a deterrent any more. Women's and children's riprhls. I was raised in a house full' of girls with only one lone boy and in their letters the girls unburden themselves more freely. In fact, the extent of the boy's correspondence has. been a few lame and halting requests for help in removing blackheads. It sounds laughable but reading between the lines I appreciate what it cost those sensitive youngsters even to admit that they are beginning to take an interest in their personal appearance. I don't know why we should laugh so freely at the most self conscious and sensitive stage of life, but we do. We make jokes or the boy's changing voice and scoff at the girl's giggles. We might have called this talk the Awkward Age if we had wished to be cruel. It is an awkward age, in trivial matters, but in most respects it is the most beautiful and glowing phase of existence. The outstanding characteristic is an eagerness and enthusiasm for whatever new, strange things may come to pass. "Flaming Youth," It has been aptly called, and the pity of it is that we quench the flames so soon. Age and experience and responsibility dim ardor of youth inevitable, but we might at least do our best, as parents wishing the best for our children, try to learn not to quench H with the wet blanket or sar - casm, bickering, hostility in the home. Let these youngsters have what they most need at their trying time, a home of serenity and sympathy, reassurance and steadiness. But as the babies grow up, it will save us anxiety and heartache if we remember that a time is coming when the children will break away from the family in the natural course of events. If we realize how necessary and natural that break is, we will not mind it so keenly. Every individual to live a full and normal life must make that hard transition from childhood when he is sheltered and pro - tected to maturity where he is expected to take his responsibilities and do his share of the world's work. We are likely to make the mistake of treating him like a child and expecting the responses, the stability and judgment of an adult. Those traits are not normal for an adolescent. The sooner we realize that the sooner we can eliminate the friction which so commonly develops in families when the children grow up. , </seg>
            <seg id="p347">Nebraska Home Economics Association V It is surprising how universal are. the experiences of adolescence. We each reel that our own case is unique. We judge the adolescent harshly because we have forgotten so completely our own experiences. The restlessness, the moodiness, the egotism, the emotional instability the day dreams, are so soon forgotten. The chum spirit, carried o such exasperating limits of loyalty, the giggling, simpering interest in the opposite sex, seem strange to us but the chances are that we passed thru exactly the same phases, whether we remember it or not. Dr Richmond of Washington says: "All the vagaries of young girls which are so trying to their elders, their extravagancies of dress, their high pitched voices, their giggling, and simpering, their emo - tional instability and changes of mood, their defiance of authority and disrespect for age and experience, their boldness and self assertiveness are all part of the age old process of growing up. If these qualities are more in evidence now than they were a generation or so ago it is not due to any fundamental change in the girl herself but because restraint is less and. she has more opportunity to indulge her natural feelings. : Age and authority raise barriers which at all costs she must vault. Nothing could be more unwise than the attempt at this period to thwart the- girl's developing independence and keep her still a child. The parents who attempt forcibly to restrain her, who upbraid her for her indifference to their wishes or gibe at her effort to assert her own personality, only succeed in confirming her opinion o£ their inability to understand and in. widening the breach which must inev - itably separate one generation from another. The mother who is too sweet and loving, indulging the child's every whim and ruling her by appeals to her love and sympathy for her does no better. She is fettering her none the less, even tho with silken cords. It is difficult enough for any girl to break the bonds of childhood, and we may make it impossible so that nervous invalidism or life long failure to assume the responsibilities of maturity may result. If 'at this period the mother is. patient and uncritical willing to put herself and her claim in the background, she will usually be awarded by the girl's confidence and will find in a few years that altho she has lost the little daughter whose loving dependence was so dear to her, she has gained the undying friendship of another woman." That is. why it is important tor mothers to acquire interests of their own apart from the children; {hey can be engrossed with their own affairs, but always ready to help the child when it needs help. We do not own the child, body, and soul, you know. It Is merely our part to act, to the best of our ability as guardian until the child attains the age of discretion. We are to provide physical care while it is needed, we are to stimulate and direct the ambitions, help inter - pret experiences and provide sympathy and fellowship. • We can not manage the earnest, curious, active, eager age by prohibition and repression. We only lose confidence and engender </seg>
            <seg id="p348">Report ok Nebraska State Boakh of Agriculture rebellion by such methods. One little girls wrote to me, "I'm nearly crazy with grk f and worry. My folks don't seem to love me any more. I come home from a party with a song in my heart at meeting some new friend, and at the first word I am shut up by angry or sarcastic remarks and made to foel that I have done something dis - gusting or disgraceful to have such thoughts. If things don't get better soon, I don't know what I'll do." Repression there was only aggravating the condition. It would have been far better for those parents lo listen to her, even tho her confidences seems exaggerated and silly, to have permitted her to meet friends, both boys and girls, openly and frankly, instead of driving her to subterfuge and deceit for friendships of her own age she will be found to have by hook or crook, if we can provide some satisfactory outlets for the excess emotions and impulses we will have the adolescent problem in hand. That Is more than a family matter, hpwever, it involves the community and we'll talk more about it tomorrow. Today our plea is simply for parents to give the Eager Age a chance. The ideal for parents to strive toward was well expressed by Herbert Spencer a good many years ago: "Let the history of your domestic rule typify in little the history of our political rule; at the outset, autocratic control, where control is really needful, and by and by, an incipient constitutionalism in which the liberty of the subject gains some express recognition; suc - cessive extensiona of this liberty of the subject; gradually ending In parental abdication." We provide the autocratic control in infancy and early childhood. Can we train ourselves to permit the youngsters to have a "consti - tution?" Can we let them make some decisions for themselves, can we train them so that we will trust them to make such decisions? I believe we can. We will need to begin young. In fact, we will need to begin by training the parents. Jessica Cosgrave says that by the age of fourteen a child should be grounded In these virtues; order, punctuality, courtesy, preservance, cheerfulness under strain, looking for the best in others, courage under difficulties, responsibility, and generosity. If we can develop these traits In childhood, surely all we need to do at the adolescent period is to keep hands off, to a large extent; keeping control only Indirectly by keeping in touch with all the environment of our children, the church, the school the community amusements. Controlling these factors as best we can, but letting the individual child feel that he has some liberty and freedom of choice in his conduct. Our examples will do more to hold the children on the straight and narrow path than all our preaching. The Chinese say: "Not the cry, but the rising of a wild duck impels the flock to follow him in upward flight." If we can show by our own lives that we are getting Interest and satisfaction out of life, if we can be serene and successful and tolerant, </seg>
            <seg id="p349">Nebraska Home Economics Association we will have a far greater hold on these youngsters than if we are bitter and soured, out of date, buried in work. They are bound to find happiness and they won't pattern after us if they think we have missed it. Hero worship is a good thing for them, if not parents let i( be other teachers and leaders. We will get our reward a few years later, when our children have safely passed the transition period and have settled down in life for themselves. Then is the time when we may expect the gratitude the love and the appreciation which we expect a little too soon. When our children mate and marry, when they begin to try to control a family of their own, they will turn to us as their nearest and dearest. Spencer has said, "It is a truth yet remaining to be recognized that the last stage in the mental development of each man and woman has. to be reached only thru the proper discharge of the parental duties. And when this truth is recognized it will be seen how admir - able is the ordination. in virtue of which human being are led by their strongest affections to subject themselves to a discipline which they would otherwise elude." . Miss Fedde's talk which was scheduled to follow Hope Needham's was postponed until Wednesday afternoon, in order that the women could have the opportunity to hear Mrs. Edith Wager of Carlton, Michigan. Mrs. Wager prefaced her remarks on what farm women are accomplishing in Michigan by reminding the women of Nebraska that a word of encouragement to a boy or girl may be the means for them to go on and try to make the most of themselves. Mrs. Wager said the community clubs in her home district started with sewing, but had branched out to include community parties, magazine exchange, beautifying school grounds, stork showers, and best of all had promoted acquaintance among the neighbors. The latter part of the afternoon was devoted to familiarizing the women with the work of the Home Economics department of the Uni - versity of Nebraska. Miss Fedde explained how this department had three divisions namely, Resident, Extension and Research. Miss Fedde first introduced Dr. Greta Gray of the Research divi - sion. Dr. Gray said that even though homemaking which is the largest and oldest profession, very little research work has been done to guide the homemaker. She has in the past depended on her own experience but at the present time research is being done with the idea of helping the homemaker. Miss Benson of the Art department was then introduced. She says that they aim to help the girls to become good designers in the preparation of meals, designing clothes or in the decoration of home. </seg>

But those frontier days were worth whilo for they were the means" of making our State what it is today. Those frontier days can well be compared with a child's earlier years. As our new frontiers are conquered there is a change in their mariner of living. As our frontiers change we face the problem of adjusting oui old ideals to new conditions. A childs' life is closely related to parents, schools, religion and recreation. ■ . Parents Parental care is not an instinct. We need parent training. When we learn of this training, we will not force children to what we think they ought to be or what we wanted them to do but we will discover what our children are, and using that as a guide we will help them to find themselves. "Our first faith in the universe is derived rrom our parents." Modern Attitude Every person needs direct relation with world, and also needs background of personal affection and support within the home. Af - fection, serenity, comfort of understanding are infinitely more import - ant than discipline (after babyhood the world will furnish the dis - cipline: we need to furnish interpretations of experience). "Fathers the left wing of the family guard." The father: the left wing of the family guard, which generally manages to retreat during my active engagement, leaving the com - mand to the inferior officer. . This left wing is imposing on all full dress parades, out when there is any fighting to be done, it retires rapidly to the rear and only wheels into line when the smoke of the conflict has 'passed out of the atmosphere. Rural parents have au advantage in that they are closer to natural working out of natural laws, causes and effect. This aids in discipline. Schools It is an indictment of education, or of our school system that it is our aim to teach facts or to encourage self-development. Shall we let our children live while they go to school? </seg>
            <seg id="p352">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Fraction of a Boy Remember that the whole boy goes to school but the whole boy is seldom educated after he gets there. A fraction of him is attended to in the evening and a fraction on Sunday. He takes himself in hand on Saturday and in vacation time and accomplishes a good deal, notwithstanding the fact that his sight is a trifle impaired already and his hearing grown a little dull, so that Dame Nature works at a disadvantage and begins doubtless, to dread boys who have enjoyed too much schooling, since it seems to leave them in a state of coma. Xurserj Schools and Kindergartens The kindergarten is a place where all the practices of complete living are made a matter of daily habit. Doing right would not be such an enormously difficult matter if we practiced it a little, like the piano. Do noble things, not dream them all day long. To check, reprove and punish wrong feeling and doing, however necessary it may be for the safety and harmony and this very existence of social state does not develop? right feeling and good doing. It takes . action for development. (Example: Sociology class discussion: amel - ioration or prevention.) Children are tidier and more careful in a dainty well kept room. They are inclined to be ashamed of uncleanliness, vulgarity and brut - ality when they see them in broad contrast with beauty and harmony and order. There is some connection between manners and morals. "Virtue kindles at a touch of joy." Training is not necessarily dis - agreeable. Beauty cannot create a new heart but it can greatly change its disposition. When we train the mind, we are beginning to train the hand, but heart culture is not stressed. Some common mistakes in discipline: (a) Appoint monitors instead of training inward monitor in each child fpxample of boy and chalk), (b) Make truth telling difficult instead of easy (c) Punish trivial and grave offenses about the same way. (d) Practice bribery, (e) Weaken sense of right by rewards for obvious duty. Good actions and self government are the rule in kindergarten. Teach thrift, beauty, harmony, order; all with constructive busy work. In high schools and colleges, we continue body training, hygiene, phy - sical training, athletics. (Are we going too far in atheltics, comparative value of intra-mural and extra-mural competition). Why not pro - vide reasonable activity? Religion We must adapt our religion — get it into practical living terms. Crime can only be truly hindered by letting no man grow up crim - inal, by taking 1 away the will to commit sin. Much transgression of </seg>
            <seg id="p353">Nebraska Home Economics Association law in later years is due to fatal hope in the evil doers mind that he will escape the consequences of his sin. This is a defect of arbitrary punishment or any disproportionate punishment. The sin is in being, found out. (Example, the boy who stole). We frighten them into deceptlveness by being unjust. (Example, of girls with "song of heart"). In the parable of the Sower, you will find the soil is quite as necessary as the seed: indeed the seed is thrown away unless the soil is prepared in advance. I believe in religion, but before I undertake to plant it, I would like something to plant in it. The sowers are too few and the need too precious to be thrown away and lost among the thorns and stones. (Example: Wayman and Binkers — church and school get bad name). Foster religion in every day life. If the child love not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? Love worketh no ill to his neighbor, therefore love is the fulfilling of the law. There is a great deal of practical religion to be breathed into children before abstraction of beliefs can be comprehended. The world is determined to vaccinate children with religion for fear they should take it in a naturr.l way. Connection between morals and manners: beauty, etc., are all. phases of religion. Recreation "The most frequent cause of adolescent delinquency is adoles - cence itself." "Adolescent behavior is but the expression of the con - flict between the instructive . forces of her nature and the restraints society would impose upon them in the effort to make her acceptable member of the social group.'.' Indefinite field of interests; girls un - experienced are safest at home. "The delinquent girl is the unadjusted girl." Normal girl: "The adolescent girl is what she is by virtue of her childhood." Adolescence repeats and strengthens development of earlier years. Wide range of interests. The more things a girl can do, the better is she fortified of the lonliness and boredom that send her to questionable phases of amusement or lead her to take a long chance in the hope of fine companionship and pleasure but just amuse - ments. But work, achievement, and creation is necessary. City girls in factory stand up for this. Rural girls are better for their canning clubs, clothing club projects. There is a wide range of interest in these projects and it gives the girl something definite to do in their spare moments. Dniicing and Petting Petting is one of those fleeting things like puppy love or "crush - ers" on the ice man, according to a concensus of opinion today among the more than 1,000 co-eds attending the first national student con - ference of the Y.

The following report of the five extension projects which are being given in the organized counties. HOMK DKMONSTUATION P1UMKCT RKPORTS KKOM COUNTY CHA1UMKX KOL'XD TABLES Convenient Kitchens MRS. O. E. DAVIS Report of the Convenient Kitchen project as it was given during ltie spring of 1!(2t&gt; on the Project Leader basis, is as follows: In nine counties of the state, 102 clubs enrolled for the work with membership of 1,45!) women. These nine counties were Polk, Coll'ax, Nance, Kurnas. Red Willow, Frontier, Hall, Howard and Valley. lieginnin^ in September, the Convenient Kitchen project was of - fered in nine other counties, Washington, Douglas, Otoe, Keith, Per - kins. Lincoln, Johnson, Saunders and Lancaster. In these counties 10f&gt; clubs enrolled lor the project with a club membership of 1,571 women. This shows that for the fall series of the project there is an increase in the number of clubs and the number of women enrolling as members. At the close of the spring project it was found that of the 1,459 club members, 1,206 reported that they had adopted at least three improved practices as a result of the project work. It is to be hoped that in the longer series which commenced in September that all </seg>
            <seg id="p355">Nkhkaska Home Economics Association members will be able to reach a goal of at least eight improved prac - tices each. The following results are seen coming from last spring's project and from the Convenient Kitchen project now being taken in our nine counties: 1. That a phange in the attitude of the home-makers has taken place, which indicates that they are anxious for any new methods of doing routine housework. . • ' • . 2. That a. saving of time and effort with the usual household duties will give to women more time for the things they like to do. 3. That there is a social benefit derived when women meet to - gether and discuss their common problems of kitchens. 4. That project work has given many women an opportunity, to discover and develop some of their talents and abilities which they had never realized they had had before. Looking into the future it is expected that the project work of .1927 may bring some progress in the following ways: 1. That many homeniakers may. have been assisted in working out definite improvements for her own home kitchen. 2. That the harmony of the home may be made easier by better organized kitchen work. 3. That more new homes may be reached by better local achieve - ment day programs. . .' Kootls for Health MRS. CASSIE RUPP The Foods for Health project was given in Cheyenne, Custer, Dakota, Dawes, Kimball, Madison, Morrill, Thurston, and Scotts Bluff Counties in the spring of 1926 with the following results: 85 clubs enrolled, 1,161 women completed the project. The State Agent held 4 6 training meetings for 168 Project Leaders who in turn held 289 local group meetings. In September, 1926, Seward, Hamilton, Buffalo, York, Howard, Valley, Thayer, Adams and Frontier Counties enrolled for the Food project and similar results are expected from these counties. We find that nutrition project is a piece of work that can not be completed in a year or in two years but it creates new Interests which continue indefinitely in our home life, by teaching us proper food habits and balanced menus, which improve our future health and efficiency. • This project gives us greater appreciation and. respect for out' profession as homeniakers and more confidence in our own ability and creates aii incentive for more intensive education for our children </seg>
            <seg id="p356">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agbicultube In this work we have an aim, a desire and a hope. Our aim is Extension work for all rural women, our desire is that all may be taught to use it and appreciate its power, our hope is that our clubs will supply the rounds of the ladder by which rural people msy climb to the heights of rural progress. Time Savers in Clothing Construction MRS. BOYD JACOBS In this project: 1. The women learn to work with each other. 2. It develops self confidence and courtesies in others. 3. It gives the husbands a better viewpoint of the women's work in the house and thereby the equipment needed in the home. 4. Small children are benefttted by the mothers taking them to the meetings where they learn to play with the other children of pre-school age. This way the mother "learns" the child's social tendencies. 5. It raises the farm home life to a higher standard and makes the home work more pleasant. 6. It creates a greater interest in rural life and helps to keep our boys and girls more contented. 7. Where there is a mixed club of town and rural women it brings them in closer contact and to a better understanding of one another's problems. 8. It acquaints the women with parliamentary law, 9. The rural women reel more at ease since we have studied selection of material and style. The woman properly dressed may mingle with the rest. 10. Undergarments properly made and adjusted aid our chil - dren's health and help to correct (heir posture. 11. Time savers in clothing construction give us more time for reading and other recreation. Following is a brief summary of the work done in 1926: Nine counties were enrolled for the work, Keith, Perkins, Lincoln, Washington, Douglas. York, Johnson, Lancaster and Phelps. There were 444 Project Leaders meetings held with 4,855 members attend - ing. The total enrollment of members was 1,430 with 868 members completing the work. Fifty-one local Achievement Days were held. There were 3,644 garments made and 4,521 improved practices adopted. For the work in 1927, there are 81 clubs with 1,397 members enrolled. </seg>
            <seg id="p357">Nebraska Home Economics Association* Let's Dress the Family Becomingly MRS. S. P. DAVIS We have been asked the question, "Is Project Work Worth While?" Before considering what this work has brought to us individ - ually, let us consider what.it has brought to us in a broader way. First of all, it has brought us friends and we will know that friends are indispensible. Anything that will make us a friend and give to us a friend is certainly worth while. Our president in her opening address told us that her mother remembers that the first meetings of this association were attended by a mere handful of women, that they could all be seated in the cafe - teria at one table and that they had such very good times. As our pro - ject work has increased the attendance at these meetings has increased, until now several hundred women attend each year. It would be hard to calculate the number of tables it would take to seat us all today, but if we multiply the good time had by that first table of women by the number of tables we have today, we would have and do have a big heap of happiness, and isn't happiness the thing we are all seeking? When women's clubs were first organized the work was all literary and comparatively few women belonged. The members were passed and voted on and very few busy country women found time to belong to a club of this kind. The programs consisted mostly of paper? written upon subjects far removed from our every day interests. How different is the work of the rural club of today. Now we discuss topics of interest to the homemaker and learn to do better and easier our every day tasks. We have learned that work done with our hearts and pur hands as well as our heads is far more satisfying, for only where the three are combined do we get the truly worth while. Some women feel that they can not join a club because it requires too much work. Did we ever acquire anything worth while without working hard for it? •'. ' Rural clubs have' helped the rural women to come into her own, they have helped to eradicate the line between the rural and the city woman. Town clubs have seen the value of the work and more and more of them are taking up the project work. We are fortunate in our county to have Mary-Ellen Brown as one of the speakers at our County Federation meeting. After the rural clubs had given their reports and Miss Brown had given her address, the president of one of the Federated Clubs arose and very earnestly said, "I see now why you rural clubs are doing something, look at the leaders you have." Right there lies one of the main reasons for the success of the project work, the fact that the state agents are so human and that they come in personal contact with the women with whom they work. We only hope that the day is not far distant when </seg>
            <seg id="p358">RKl'OKT OK NkHRAKKA STATK BOAKU OF AliKICVI.Tl.'RE - wp will have a Home Demonstration Agent in every county in U\i State, thereby making it possible for the club members as well as the Project Leaders to have this privilege. One of the most valuable lessons that the State Agents bring to us is the lesson of cheerfulness. Did you ever see a State Agent who did not "Keep Smiling?" What a good example to the Project Leader and to us all. As valuable a lesson, perhaps, as any one brought to us in a circular. Fortunate, indeed, is the woman who is a Project Leader, more fortunate still is the woman who is a county chairman, for they derive more benefit from the work than any one else. The County Chairman reaps :i rich reward for her labors, for in meeting with clubs all over her county, her life is enriched by many true friendships. Great benefits have been and more will be derived from organi - zation of rural clubs. Being organized is a means whereby the rural women of the state may be reached and information opinions secured upon many subjects. As for instance in case of the home equipment survey. This also gave the town and country clubs a splendid oppor - tunity for cooperation and only when we cooperate can we expect good results. Being organized gives the rural women an opportunity to reach their leaders or any organization. We have occasion to want to reach, for instance, our legislature or perhaps even Congress. Country women are ever alert on the questions of the day. In one of the counties the chairman has organized the county into rural centers. There they have one meeting each month for pro - ject and one meeting each month for a social time. At the social meetings a special effort is made to have the young married people and the young folks take part in the program and in stunts and games that follow the program. In this way more interest is taken in club work and the young people learn to make their own good time and not to depend entirely upon commercialized amusements. We could keep on almost indefinitely enumerating the good things club work has done for the community but we must pass on to the individual. We feel that the dress selection project is somewhat different than all the others because it is the one thing the busy woman most often neglects. We women on thp farm by the time we divide our time and attention among all our various tasks, some - thing very often is neglected and what easier thing to neglect than ourselves. When some of us women found out that our first lesson of this project would be "Let's Look in the Mirror," we wondered if after its long spell of uselessness, it would stand the strain. But we pulled ourselves together thinking that if our families and neigh - bors could stand it all the time we ought to. When we began to look at ourselves as others saw us and when we began to do something about it and the best part of it was that our husbands and children took notice and seemed pleased. Doesn't a woman value a compli- </seg>
            <seg id="p359">Nkiiha.ska Homk Economics Association menl from her husband more than any one else? And aren't most hus - bands and children willing lor the wife and mother to spend a littk' more time and. thought ou herself and neglect something else, even tho that something else might bring a little more work upon them. The trouble with us was that we had neglected ourselves for so long that we could almost have been put into the class with the woman whose friends said of her that when she walked down the street she looked as tho she had said, "Clothes, I'm going to town, if you want to go along, hang on." ' At such a. time wasn't it nice to have some - thing come along and give us a little jolt, something to make us "Stop, Look" and afterwards. "Listen" to the compliments coming our way. Now, we aren't at all selfish in this project. Our families came in for their share or attention. We learned that a child's taste and individuality must be taken into account when dressing that child if we wish to make her' truly happy and unconscious of herself. A child can not" do good work in school or elsewhere, a grownup can not put l.er best work into other things if they must be conscious o£ their clothes all the time. Perhaps paying attention to dress has done more than anything else to eradicate the line that used to exist between the town and country woman. It has been told that an eastern manu - facturer wished to learn what line of goods he must carry in order - to cater to the trade of the rural woman, so sent a representative to one of the State Fairs in order that he might observe what the country women were wearing. He. returned without the wished for informa - tion, because as he told his employer, altho the country women were there, he could not tell them from tfie town women. We all realize •this is as it should be. The lesson of selecting the clothes to suit the individual was brought home to us most forcibly the day we studied the hat selection. That day we had a large tablefull of hats and we tried them on and you may well imagine the results. It could easily be seen that while one woman could wear her hat and have it suit her perfectly, the next one who tried it on would look like a monkey. Wearing something we like and something suited to us is economy. One woman told how in putting a dress on her little girl that the child liked, she would be more careful of it than if she dressed her in something she did not like. ■ We grownups are the same way; Haven't you ever heard some one say "1 don't care how soon this old dress wears out, I just hale it," and haven't you worn a garment you liked until it was almost threadbare? You hated to give it up because you liked it and because you were conscious of the fact that it looked well on you. There is so much to be said for this and all the other projects that it is impossible to say it all.' Let us just say this in closing, when we told the women who attended the County Federation meeting </seg>
            <seg id="p360">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture that the seven projects that we had taken in our county had made us healthy, happier, and better looking, they of course smiled. We told them that their smiles were quite permissible but they should have Reen us before taking. We are grateful for the Extension work and hope that they will keep on sending us new projects, as anything that improves us in health, happiness and good looks would certainly be gratefully received. Home Attractive MRS. L. J. RICHARDS The following counties are taking (he project, "Making the Home Attractive": Cass, Clay, Fillmore, Polk, Phelps, Lancaster and Web - ster. There is a total enrollment of !)7 clubs with about 1,270 women members. By a study of this project the following results are brought about: 1. A better appreciation of an attractive home. By the study of an attractive living room, an appreciation of a beautiful home is being developed. To have an attractive home it is not so much the costly things but what use is made of the possessions. 2. Development of judgment of what is good and what is poor. By this a better selection is made when buying new and a better judgment of what to believe and not believe in magazine articles and pictures. 3. Development of a greater interest in magazines, articles, and pictures. Because the magazines are a great source of material this project brings out the use of these articles, thus making the women search for articles more and intelligently criticise them. •). Creates a desire for attractive outside surroundings for the house. 5. Creates a desire to have a happy, pleasant home atmosphere. A home is the place where characters are built and where pleasant or unpleasant memories are made. The home is the place for all to be happy and where love is the foundation. By taking any of the Extension Projects, there are certain helps the women receive: 1. Extension work organizes a group. After a group is organ - ized for this work, it is then found there are other problems that can be taken care of because the women are organized, i. e., school prob - lems, county problems, etc. 2. Develops leadership. By being a Project Leader a certain assurance and poise comes to a woman in expressing herself before a group. She also knows how to go about to get other people to working and to organize the work. </seg>
            <seg id="p361">Nebraska Home Economics Association - 3. Develops friendship. While meeting together and discussing one another's problems, true and fast friendships are made. 4. Develops- interest outside the home. When a woman's family becomes grown and leave home a woman is lost if she has :had no other interest. But if she has been working in these groups, her inter - ests while being in the homo primarily, has strengthened that interest as well as given her an outside interest. The last speaker of the morning was Dr. Caroline Hedger of Chi - cago, who spoke on "The Health of the School Child." She said that the health of the child In school depends in a large measure on the child's pre-school health. She also said that the child should come out of school better than lie entered. In developing her subject Dr. Hedger used the following divisions: 1. Growth. 2. Development. 3. Nervous Balance. 4. . Being in line, for a job. Dr. Hedger says that a child is in school about 8 hours out' or each day; should be asleep about 11 hours out of each day and play the remaining hour of the day. Because of a child, being at home more hours than in school, much of the responsibility of a child's health is in the home rather than the school. Dr. Hedger says there are seven things which we can give to a child, to promote health. They are, air, water, sunshine,, sleep, food, play and happiness. • . WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON . After community singing led by Mrs. E. H. Wescott, Mrs. Berger appointed two committees. Mrs. J. J. Donahue, Inland, was appointed chairman of nominating committee with Mrs. E. A. Burnett, Lincoln, and Mrs. L. L. Fink, Hastings. The courtesy committee was Mrs. S. P. Davis, Syracuse, Chairman, Mrs. W. W. Burr, Lincoln, and Mrs. Lulu Hudson. Miss Fedde, chairman of the Home Economics Department talked on "What a Girl Trained in Home Economics Can Do." Miss Fedde's talk replaced Mr. Lefler's talk, who was unable to appear. Miss Fedde said that since 1910, 500 girls had graduated from the Home Economics Department.. Out of the number 200 are home - makers, 170 teaching in high schools, 24 teaching in colleges, 2 dietitions in hospitals, seven directing cafeterias, 14 in extension, two nurses, two missionaries, and one interior decorator and a journalist. </seg>
            <seg id="p362">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Miss Fedde then introduced Mrs. True Jack Colbert who will have charge of the radio home making program this coming year. She ia to be known as Mrs. True Homemaker. Mrs. C. B. Noyes, former president of the association, gave the following: MAKING OCR DREAMS OOME TRUE MRS. C. B. NOYES Waterloo One of the marks of distinction between man and beast is the ability of man to dream. The dog by our door has no vision beyond his Juicy bone, while man is always looking into the future and dreaming of great things to come. Youth dreams of manhood, the bride sees visions of undimmed happiness, the young parents build aircastles for their babe. The old story of a young father and mother whose first quarrel concerned the college their week old son should attend, hides behind its laughter, a common truth. We dream for ourselves in early life, then for our children, and count ourselves happy if our dreams come true. Yet the world has always laughed at dreamers, not knowing that in their visions lie the hopes of the ages. Thus, Joseph's brothers cried in derision, "Behold, this dreamer cometh," of the one who later saved the most highly civilized nation of the day from destruc - tion and held the highest office within its gift. For, intangible tho they be. the power of dreams fulfilled is tremendous. Napoleon's dreams of conquest, vitalized in powder and shot, changed the history of the world; while Wilhelm's effort to realize his vision of world dominion shook civilization to its founda - tion. On the other hand, there is nothing good and ennoblying, nothing that increases our comfort and happiness, but is the result of some - one's dream. Our wonderful modern Inventions, our schools, our churches — everything that comes to making this the most glorious age the world has ever known, all are the result of the determination of practical dreamers to make their dreams come true. The worst disaster that could befall the world would be to lose its men of vision, and no greater calamity can come into the life of anyone than that he should lose his power to dream, and so descend to the level of the group that knows no hope. It is a tragic thing to go thru the physical world with eyes blind to its beauty. To have the dawns spread their [gold and silver in vain, and the sunsets fade unnoted. To miss, because we will not see, the dainty beauty of the spring violet, and the radiant splendor of the autumn goldenrod and aster. Never to see the fleecy beauty </seg>
            <seg id="p363">Nkbkaska Home Economics Association of a drifting cloud across the deep blue of the heavens, nor watch Us shadow soften the unshaded green of the field and lose Itself In the uplifted branches of the trees which line the horizon. Never to hear the morning psalm of the brown thrasher, nor the evening liquid note of the catbird— prince of warblers. And so, missing the beauty of sight and sound, to lose the distinctive joy of country life which should be ours. But a much deeper tragedy is to miss the beauty of life itself. To go on our appointed way, seeing only the grayness of common - place tasks, and never lifting our eyes to the rose prints of the dawn, to let the trivalities of life blind us to its splendor. To so busy ourselves with the daily necessary tasks that we neglect the niceties of life until it is too late to grasp them, and our days grow dull and gray. And so to lose the power to dream, to refresh our souls and nerve our arms with visions— this is the common sadness and tragedy of life. "Where there is no vision" cried the seer of old, "Where there is no vision the people fail." Every mother owes it to herself and to her family to keep her perception of beauty, to keep her mind keen and alert, and to have before her at all times a clear vision of her noble calling, and seeing, to make her dreams come true. But it is the translating of our dreams into terms of everyday life with the materials that are given us, that the greatest difficulty presents itBelf. The architect dreams of majestic domes, and they take form with massive stones and rich carvings at his command. The artist dreams of a beautiful picture — and it lives in paint and canvas. But when a homemaker tries to translate into reality her dreams of an ideal home, she finds her material commonplace—dish - washing, cooking, sweeping, settling of childish disputes— is there any magic touch that can transmute these into the shimmering rich - ness of her dreams? Many a woman has come down from the raoun - taintop of vision to find her zeal abated and her hand unnerved by the commonplace trifles of life. Yet these very trifles become beau - tiful when rightly understood. Preparation of meals is not common - place when we understand the properties of the different foods and prepare them with a view of promoting the health of those under our care; housework is not drudgery when done for the comfort of those we love— and health and comfort are two of the essential things In our ideal home. "Who sweeps a room as for God's law Makes that and the action fine" and we have a right to take a pride In a wellkept house. Some housekeepers, however, fail by placing too much emphasis here. When a house becomes so neat that it is not a home, when </seg>
            <seg id="p364">Report ok Nebraska Statk Boaiiu of Agriculture the children's playthings are banished to the backyard, and the husband tiptoes about or sits on the back porch to avoid disturbing the care - fully arranged furniture, then comfort, a prime essential in a home, if gone, and so our vision palls. There are times when it is more important to lend a sympathetic ear to a child's sobbed story than . to polish a window, tho there may be still time to polish the window - after thr sobs are hushed. The woman who finds herself trying to fill the position of general housekeeper, seamstress, laundress, cook and nurse, finds some things are bound to be neglected, and just how she chooses marks her character as well as decides the fate of her home. Cleanliness is next to Godliness tho it should not take its place. Doubt-' less the washing machine must be kept full, but if the neat folding of a few clothes out of fresh air and sunshine will give a mother an extra hour to recreate herself in the great out-of-doors or a chance to live with her children we have no right to criticize. It is the mother's right to choose, in the light of the vision she has seen. "All things are lawful for me," cried Paul, "But I will not be brought under the power of any." He wasn't thinking of house - keeping, but as members of the largest and most popular profession in the world we have a right to appropriate his words. We often hear people complain that a child never appreciates what is done for him but this is true only in a degree. Look back for a moment into your own childhood and you will understand. No normal child thinks gratefully of life's necessities — food, clothing and shelter are taken as a matter of course; he has always known them, and they are too much a part of his life to cause remark. But the things which impress him and which we find cherished in our own memories are those which to the mature mind seem trivial — the mother's smile of greeting on the return from school, the evening's story by the fireside, the birthday cake with its lighted candles, the joyful moment when the parent entered into the child's play — all these we remember long after food and garments are forgotten. The wise mother with an understanding heart leaves many of these precious memories in the light of her child. Yet the same mother knows that this is not all of life, that the guiding hand must be firm as well as tender, and that the steady firmness must be that of everyday, living and not merely on occasions when her pride is affected. The mother who dares not rebuke her child's boisterous behavior in public lest the matter be made woise, reveals that in the quiet hours in her home she has shown herself weak. Line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little — and the child life Is molded day by day into the form seen in our vision. Many a child grown to years of independent life and thrown into new and strange environments, has remembered gratefully the teach - ings or self-control and courtesy which have smoothed his way and helped him to make good his standins among strangers; and many </seg>
            <seg id="p365">Nkwiaska Homk Economics Association another, learning by contact the principles of good-breeding has re - belled bitterly because of the unintentional neglect which allowed him his own unchecked way in his youth. A diamond in the rough may be precious, but it takes a keen eye to discern its value, and it is never a thing of beauty. Years ago I read a letter written by a pioneer on the frontier, far" from the refining influences of life. She wrote, • "Our table napkins are made of flour sacks, but we have them and the children know their use." Long afterwards when I met one of the daughters it .was no surprise to find a woman of refinement and courtesy of manner in all things. The little refinements of life cost us nothing, but they supply much" of the delicate tinting of our picture. The average woman docs not consciously neglect her child. She makes many mistakes, but she has his welfare at heart. But there are many homes where the rights and comforts of the husband and father are sacrificed daily to the pleasure and convenience of the. children. Yet he is by common consent the head of the home and as such should have an honored place. I have always betn interested in the derivation of words and I found something quite novel in the dictionary the other day. It seeing the word "husband" is derived from two Anglo-Saxon words meaning housu and farmer. It at first has no relation to matrimony. But as in the common tongue a woman calls her consort "my man" so in time she came to speak of him- as "my farmer" or the "farmer who lives in my house," and so the word husband was formed. You will note that the derivation of the word is possessive. He is ours', a resource or a liability as the case may be. The most, successful wives make • the most of this possessive attitude, and extend their maternal care to their husbands. Men are only boys grown tall, and they all like to be mothered, vigorously as they would resent the implication. You know the old story, when a man has a cold his wife gives him a hot lemonade and tucks him in blankets with a mustard plaster on his chest. When she has a cold he says, "You ought to do something about it." But the wife recognizes the cause and for-, gives for she knows it . is not indifference but helplessness, so she nurses him back to health and takes her own quinine. But, whatever his failui - es may be, the husband and father has liis place in the scheme of the home. He should never, however, be used by the mother to conceal her own failures in the discipline of the children. .The woman who threatens her disobedient boy with what will happen when the father comes, not only weakens her own authority by the implied confession of her inability to cope with th,e situation, but. breaks down the cordial relationship which should exist between father and son. Edgar Guest. expresses the resentment of this treatment which every normal father must feel when he says: "I want him tb.be waiting for me at night With- eyes that glislen with real delight, </seg>
            <seg id="p366">Rkvort of Nkukaska State Board of Auriculturk When it's right that my boy should punished be I don't want the job postponed for me. I want to come home to a round of joy And not to frighten a little boy." There is something about human hands that fascinates me. I like to study them — the nimble fingers of the musician, the firm yet delicate hand of the skilled surgeon, the browned and roughened hand of the self-forgetful home-maker. But there is none that so touches me as the calloused, toil-worn hand of the husband and lather who labors daily for his loved ones, asking little for himself if they be content. And I often wonder when I see them just what is his reward. It is said that the women spend nine-tenths of the family expense money. Just how are they doing it? Many a happy dream has been shattered by the cold touch of domestic financial difficulty, sometimes because the wife is ignorant of the value of money and unwise in its spending. One of the most promising homes I know is one in which the wife is putting into daily practice the principles taught her in the Home Economics Department of our State ■ University. The study of food values teaches her to feed her family properly, the study of textiles and artistic lines enables her to clothe them suitably and attractively yet without extravagance, and her knowl - edge of budgeting teaches her to so divide the family income that necessities and pleasures are given their due proportion, a contribu - tion made each month to work outside the home, and something laid aside regularly to swell the reserve fund. There is yet another side to our vision of homemaking which is seldom mentioned. Sometimes at women's meetings, I find myself sympathetic with the men because they are so ostentatiously ignored; and Mother's Day always arouses resentment in my breast because the remarks are so one sided. Where did the idea originate that the vision of the Ideal home is only for .the' mother? We hear of various meetings for the men, they meet to study hogs and cattle, corn and wheat — but who — ever heard of a father's meeting? The nearest approach Is the Father and Sons banquet now so popular, but there the speakers are hampered in their remarks by the presence of the sons. Is it any wonder in the face of this systematic ignoring, that so many men have come to feel that the making of a home is a woman's job? Poets sing of a mother's tenderness, but rarely of a father's strength, yet the home needs the one as much as the other. No right minded boy as he grew to manhood ever took his mother as a model. He may love, honor and respect her, but he never copies her. His ideals are entirely masculine, and rightly so. There comes a time in the life of every mother of a boy when she finds her influence diminishing and she knows that the crisis in her son's life has come. If the father has caught from the first the vision of what fatherhood </seg>
            <seg id="p367">Nkbraska Home Economics Association should be, if lie has won and held the confidence and respect of His sons, if he has walked before him in ways of honor and unrightness, then, will the heart bf the mother be at peace, for she knows that her son has still a dependable guide in the new maze which he is to enter. And I use the word guide advisedly for the boy will go where he is led, and not where he is sent. A worker with boys was once asked how to keep the adolescent boy in the Sabbath School and his reply was, . "Put his father in a class between him and the door." But too often the father is not there and the boy goes to walk in other ways. . • . Our poets and sentimental writers are responsible for many errors of popular thought, but none so serious as that which makes religion a feminine matter. Years ago one such writer cried, "A woman without religion "is like a rose without perfume," and we have put religion in the perfume class ever since. We dwell upon its beauty and tender - ness but say too little of its strength. We picture the Christ with the face of a weakling, forgetting that He was an out-door man with a power of eloquence and such tliat held the multitude enthralled and confounded his enemies. We speak of the love of God but rarely of his majesty and thus we belittle the strongest and most varied element of human life. And then when we have robbed religion of the very elements which make an appeal to manhood, and so have taken from our boys the one foundation upon which, from earliest history, the strongest characters have been built, we stand amazed at the ruin wrought as frivolity and crime claim those who should be the strength of our nation. When fathers and mothers together catch the vision of ideal parenthood, when they build the home upon the one eternal founda - tion of love and fear of God, when together. with sympathetic under-, standing, they themselves walk, then will our homes be built in the light of the vision we have caught on the mountain top, and the words of the ancient seer will be fulfilled, "That our sons may be as plants grown up In their youth and our daughters as corner stones polished after the slmiltude of a palace." Following community singing led by Mrs. Wescott, Duncan Marshall, former Minister of Agriculture for the Dominion of Canada, was introduced and spoke briefly of the Importance to farm life of everything ■ that can Improve conditions' for the farmer's wife and daughters. Dr. Hedger spoke on "The Problem of the Adolescent." Dr. Hedger said her talk was concerned with the boy and girl between 12 and 25. After 25 she said one has fully completed the growth of all organs and bones. Dr. Hedger says that some children during </seg>
            <seg id="p368">Rkvort or Nkukaska St.vtk Bn.Miii of AuHicri.Trm; this period experience a very rapid growth which is very hard on a child. Such a child should be watched carefully so as not to be overworked because rapid growth is a drain on ones system. Dr. Hedger spoke of this period as being characterized by motor and emotional instability. This is because ones nerves do not keep up with the rapid growth. However, with proper care a child soon overcomes this. THURSDAY MORNING The last session of the Home Economics meeting opened this morning with community singing led by Mrs. Muriel Smith, Mrs. S. P. Davis gave the following report of the courtesy committee. "We wish to express our gratitude to the efficient officers who have carried the responsibility of this association and provided for. us this good program which has been so full of joy and inspiration to us all. "We wish to express our gratitude to the -speakers and musicians who have given so generously of their time and talent. To the Board of Agriculture which has so generously financed this association; to the College of Agriculture for this new building where we have been so comfortably housed during this session; to the Extension Workers; to Miss Elwell and her able assistants who have served such splendid meals; to the women of Lincoln who have given us a hearty welcome; to the women from this and other states who will carry reports of these meetings to their various papers; to all who have in any way contributed to our comfort and entertainment; to the women them - selves for their jolly fellowship which has prevailed throughout this session." Submitted by Courtesy Committee, MRS. S. P. DAVIS, Chairman. LULA KURTZ HUDSON. AURAL SCOTT BURR. Mrs. J. J. Donahue. Chairman of the Nominating Committee, submitted to the audience the following ballot: Mrs. Ida Wilkins Berger, President. Mrs. A. It. Leavitt, Vice President. Florence J. Atwood, Secretary. Motion was made and seconded the recommendations of the nom - inating committee be accepted. Motion carried. In thinking of health Dr. Hedger said it included beauty, posture, vitality, unconscious body, nervous balance, and ability to get along with folks. She says that all of these are brought about by right living. </seg>
            <seg id="p369">Nebraska Home Economics Association Following this the Home Economics Section joined with the other organizations for a mass meeting. * The total registration for this section was 430. The Nebraska Home Economics Association is interested in the" promotion of homemaking. We find that one very fine way to do this is to help to train our girls in standards of home. To encourage the girls of Nebraska in this training, the association gave ?1 00.00 for the promotion of judging contests. The aim of judging contests is to establish and recognize stand - ards and enable the girls to carry the characteristics of high standard . in their memory. There are two distinct activities in judging; one placing and the other the giving of reasons. . Judging contests were held at the State Fair in clothing and foods. The money from the Home Economics association wa--. used to send the high ranking clothing girl and the high ranking food girl to the National Boys' and Girls' Club congress which was held in Chicago, to enter in judging contest there. The following letter shows some of the value the girls receive from this trip: '::■'■. Hastings, Nebraska. December 15, 1926. Miss Florence Atwood, Secretary Home Economics Section, Organized Agriculture, Ag.

I know that you. will be interested in/knowing some of the things that we did on our trip. It seemed as if there was something new and interesting around the corner of each tall building. , Sunday morning we * registered.' at the Palmer House, where we stayed during the week. Then some of us went to church. In the afternoon we went for a bus ride. The lake I think was about the greatest sight that we saw while we were in Chicago. We also visited the Chrysanthemum Show, which was being held at the Garfield Park Conservatory. Monday morning we rode on. the elevated train to the Inter - national Livestock Exposition, where over twelve hundred club folks were welcomed .by Mr. Hiede, General Manager of the Stock Show. That day I entered in the health contest, bread judging contest and the canning judging contest. </seg>

This store is one of the greatest places o£ interest in Chicago. We visited their pantries, then we were served a luncheon in the Walnut Room. In the afternoon we visited the different departments of the store. Then we went to Lincoln Park, where we visited the tropical gardens and the zoo. Wednesday night we were guests of the National Livestock Pro - ducers Association at the banquet at the Congress Hotel. Thursday we all went to the International Harvester Company where we watched them make machinery. In the twine we watched the process from the time the hemp was combed until it was tied up in sacks. Thursday afternoon the health girls and their leaders had a meeting with Doctor Hedger who examined us in the health contest. That night we had our final banquet, but I think it was one of the best of the week. We were the guests of eleven railroads that night. I thought that the address by Edgar A. Guest was the most interesting part of the program. The trophies, ribbons, medals and honors were presented that night, but we had to leave before that time to catch our train. When we got on the train and started for home we were tired but still full of 4H pep. I have given a report of my trip at community club and I am going to give a report at the Rotary Club luncheon. I also plan to give three or four other reports. I hope by these reports we thirty - five delegates from Nebraska this year can stir up a lot of pep and make next year's Nebraska delegation larger.

B. Banning, of Union, was called to order by the First Vice-President, Mr. J. R. Davidson, ot Aurora, at 2 p. m., Tuesday, January 4, 1927. ' CHAIRMAN DAVIDSON: In the absence of our President, I will do the best I can until he arrives. The first thing on the program is "Dusting as a Means of Con - . trolling Vegetable Insects," by Mr. E. M. Page, extension specialist, vegetable crops, of the Missouri College. of Agriculture. "DUSTING AS A MEANS OF CONTROLLING VEGETABLE INSECTS" E. M. PAGE, College of Agriculture, Columbia, Missouri. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: It certainly is a pleasure for me to be with you here at what I understand is the first meeting of the vegetable men in this series of meetings. We have been con - ducting a similar program with tlie vegetable men in Missouri for a number, of years in connection with our annual Farmers Week, usually held about the middle of January. We are located at Columbia, a little far from our principal vegetable centers, and the attendance has ' never been quite what we would like it, because Columbia, in the center of the state, is half way between our principal vegetable pro - ducing centers. Conditions in Missouri are no doubt somewhat different from Nebraska, but some of the things certainly would apply in both states. I am reminded of the story I heard told of a Baptist preacher. At Christmas time one of the members of his congregation, wishing ■:; ..' "' : ' ■' ■•: ; ■ A ::■■■: '. ■ ,-■ /; . ■ ;;•' </seg>
            <seg id="p382">Rkpokt ok Nkhrakka State Board of Agriculture to remember (lie pastor, sent him a jar of brandied cherries. TJi.b preacher in thanking his good people for their gifts said it was not so much the rhprrips hp appreciatpd as the spirit in which they were sent. If I do not tell you exactly the things you would like to hear, please consider the spirit in which it is given. My subject is "Dusting as a Means of Controlling Vegetable In - sects." We have had quite a little to do with that subject in the last five years. We have given it considerable thought and attention, particularly in connection with the vine crops — melons and cucumbers' and cantaloupes. We believe dusting is gaining favor with the grow - ers of the vegetable and truck crops. It seems to have greater possibilities than the liquid spray for insect control. This is largely due to its methods of action. In dusting we have not only a means of controlling the insect through stomach poisons and contact sprays, but also through suffocating and gassing, and a combination of all of those effects. We take advantage of those different methods in dusting. In many cases dusting is easier and faster than liquid spraying, and the equipment is less expensive. The amount of material required is less for dusting, particularly those crops planted in hills and not in continuous rows. It requires more of tho essential materials when we are dusting continuous rows — for instance, potatoes require more arsenicals when dusted than when sprayed. I want to take up this subject relating first to the vine crops — to the melons, cucumbers, and cantaloupe's. The first insects I want to mention in connection with these crops are the striped cucumber beetle and the spotted cucumber beetle. I presume you have those insects. Judging from the smiles on your faces, I think you have had experience with them. I think we little realize the extent of the damage done by them, although we see them feeding on leaves and stems. We think now, that this is only half the damage they really cause. The striped cucumber beetle is blamed with carrying watermelon wilt in its stomach over winter, and inoculating the plants the next year. We know a great deal of trouble from wilting of the vines is directly attributable to the work of the larvae of the cucumber beetle feeding on the roots. Now they are being blamed with carrying the bacterial wilts from plant to plant. Certainly it Is a serious insect, and has been given a great deal of consideration by growers for a long time. The Ohio Experiment Station Bulletin No. 388 lists about twenty - one so-called remedies for this beetle which have been UBed in the past, most of them with very poor success. Liquid sprays have never given the satisfaction desired in the control of these insects. Their </seg>
            <seg id="p383">Nebraska State Horticultural Socicty habits of eating are such that they find places least protected, and most of the arsenicals act as repellants-arsenate of lead and Paris green. That is i ess true of calcium arsenate than of the other arsenicals It is hard to reach the under side of the leaves with a spray For that reason, dusts have been used rather extensively. The first dust mixture which we used is one which we arrived at rather arbitrarily and used for three or four years. We conducted tests where we dusted a part and left the other part undusted. In nearly all ™ses the first three plantings of the dusted part would be eaten by the beetles, while the other would be left alone to a Pretty fair degree. However, when the whole field was dusted so that there was no undusted part for the beetle to go to, there was considerable injury, That was the best method at the time, and it was used extensively until 1923. One of our county extension agents in southeastern Missouri where we have ten to fifteen thousand- acres of watermelons, made the state - ment that over 90 per cent of the acreage was dusted by this formula up until 1923 or 1924. At this time we had some experiments ai Columbia and at one or two of the other stations. Ohio reported experiments with calcium arsenate and gypsum mixtures. We found as they did, that calcium arsenate was less repellant than lead arsenate The beetle would feed more readily on plants dusted with that than on plants dusted with other arsenicals. Gypsum, instead of having an unfavorable effect, was rather favorable. The mixture which we have used since then has been one pound calcium arsenate to fifteen pounds of gypsum. The latter is available at, all times in the lumber yard. Ohio recommends one to twenty They have had as good or better results using that proportion We find one to fifteen more satisfactory. The material is cheap In addition to this fact, calcium arsenate is not as great a repellant the beetles will eat it more readily than other arsenicals, and its low cost recommends it. It is the cheapest source of arsenic we have for use in either dusting or. spraying, and perhaps the finest arsenical we have. It was. developed primarily for the dusting of cotton for the boll weevil. In the South they realized that an extremely fine dust was. necessary.. That is perhaps the reason we can buy it at such a low price, because it has been manufactured in large quantities Even with the little cotton grown in southeastern Missouri, they ship it in by the carload for control, of the leaf worms. (We do not have the boll weevel there). That is why it was primarily manufactured however. • This mixture can be applied freely either through a cheese cloth bag or by means of a perforated can or by hand. It can be used more economically through a regular duster. It should be applied on an average of once a week, starting when the plants are still quite </seg>
            <seg id="p384">Rkpokt of Nkhraska State Board of Agriculture small. On watermelons the average application is ten pounds to the acre. On cucumbers and cantaloupes perhaps thirty pounds will be required. I have mentioned these arsenical mixtures which can be mixed at home. I want to talk now about the nicotine dust. It was first recom - mended for control of the striped cucumber beetle in 1920, after two years' tests conducted at the. Columbia Experiment Station, and the United States Department of Agriculture co-operating. This material was found to be an effective insecticide in the control of the striped cucumber beetle. There was considerable controversy at first, because different strengths had been used and the results secured were quite different. Some were enthusiastic and others were skeptical about its value /or the control of any insect. We started using it in the spring of 1921. I think we were fortunate in starting out with the strength which subsequent tests have shown to be satisfactory, containing 4 per cent actual nicotine. To get this strength it is necessary to mix one pound of commercial nico - tine sulphate solution with nine pounds of some carrier like hydrated lime. It is made by adding liquor nicotine sulphate to a dry dust car - rier, and mixed so thoroughly that it is just a dust. The killing effect on insects comes from the liberation of nicotine gas from these particles. Our first experience was in the use of the 4 per cent dust, in sulphate form. The carrier is a substance composed largely of hydrated lime. Subsequent tests in a number of states have shown that kaolin, which was used originally as a carrier dust, ties up a great deal o£ the nicotine so that it is liberated slowly, and this material has been discarded as a carrier. Some of the better carriers are hydrated lime, gypsum, and calcium carbonate, or ordinary limestone, if it can be ground fine enough. One of the stations finds magnesium carbonate is still a better carrier. These more crystalline substances do not seem to enter into chemical reaction with the nicotine. Some o£ the tobacco companies have manufactured and put out nicotine dust containing \, \ Vi and 2 per cent nicotine content, and have recom - mended it for use in the control of the striped cucumber beetle as well as plant lice. We have never obtained satisfactory results from its use for killing the cucumber beetles. I believe the other stations have now also recognized the fact it is not satisfactory for control of the cucumber beetle. Nicotine dust at best is an expensive insecticide. Our present attitude on its use in control of the striped and spotted cucumber beetles is to use it in case of emergency. Frequently beetles come in great numbers. They can be killed with 4 per cent nicotine dust, providing the temperature is 70 degrees or above. Below that tem - perature the gas is given off so slowly that it has no effect. That is another eliminating factor. We expect to do most of our control </seg>

Socicty of this cucumber beetle with the calcium arsenate and gypsum mix - ture, using the nicotine in case of emergency, and also when aphides are present, because it is an effective control for plant lice. In mixing these dusts, they must be mixed in air-tight containers There is a Government Bulletin on mixing these dusts. If you are •interested, I am sure. Professor Werner can get these bulletins for you. A group of market gardeners at St. Joseph, after using the prepared dust for two seasons, decided to make the mixture themselves A mixer costs about $200. It is air tight. When they bought it, the onlv satisfactory source was Los Angeles. The nicotine sulphate was mado largely in Louisville, Kentucky, and shipped out to Los Angeles, mixed with dust, and shipped back. As a result the cost was so high we could not recommend it. By mixing the dust themselves the growers have eliminated a lot of the freight. It used to cost around thirty cents a pound, and now they can mix it for fifteen. Then, too, they are sure of the percentage of nicotine. This association has sold' some nicotine dust to other growers in Missouri. One group of watermelon growers last year bought something over a ton of it. In addition to being mixed in air-tight mixers, it must be applied with a duster, which is practically air-tight, to keep the material from losing strength by evaporation during the dusting operation. Any ordinary duster is satisfactory. I had intended to have a set of slides to show you some of the types of dusters used in Missouri, but the University photographer who makes them took a Christmas vacation and didn't get back in time to get them out. It was my fault fo'r not getting them to him earlier. I will show. you some photographs instead. We have a type of duster with an air-tight container for the dust.. The lid screws on with a rubber ring. The air is brought in by means of a bellows operated by a lever. This type costs from ?15 to ?25 apiece. We have added a little arrangement of our own, although, it is being used in other states. It was thought of by one or two other states at about the same time. It is the idea of attaching a funnel to the lower end of the discharge tube. The dust - ing for cucumber beetles is usually done while the plants are small, which is the time the beetles can be most effectively controlled, simply setting the funnel over the hill and giving it a little puff ol dust. The funnel is left there above twenty seconds so as to allow the dust to settle around the plant where beetles like to feed, and on the under side of the leaves which it dusts quite effectively. (Passes around photographs showing: (a) the funnel on the end of the spout; (b) the container being used on a little piston type of hand duster; and (c) a bellows type without a funnel.) Using a duster such as iMiave mentioned, we find it takes from two to three pounds of nicotine dust to go over an acre of watermelons </seg>
            <seg id="p386">Rkwiht of Nkiikaska State. Board of Agriculture and from seven to ten pounds to go over an acre of cantaloupes white the vines are still small. That is the only time we have tried to do a thorough job of dusting with nicotine dust. If we have done a good job at that time, it is not necessary later. I want to mention another method of controlling these insects which has been developed in the last three years, which we have tried in a preliminary way. I refer to the use of sodium fluosilicate, which was described first by Markovitch, of Tennessee, in Tennessee Circular Xo. 2. The plan is for the dust to be scattered on the plant and around on the ground underneath. The insect gets the dust on his feet in walking through. The dust irritates his feet, and he has the habit of drawing his feet through his mouth when they become irri - tated. He gets enough of the poison in his system to cause his death. It seems to work. It has the drawback that sodium fluosilicate will burn the foliage if not used with extreme caution. The commercial form must be diluted with two parts of lime to one of sodium fluo - silicate. It kills the beetles and seems to have a good deal of promise as a means of control. I want to give you our experience and an idea of what methods are being considered for control of this insect There is one other. That is calcium cyanide, which gives oft cyanide gas when exposed to the air, and has been used in control of other insects. The plan which' has been followed in attempting to control striped cucumber beetle with calcium cyanide is to make a small box 12 by 6 by 8 inches, and cut a hole out of the bottom of this box; turn the box over, and put a small handful of calcium cyanide in a cheese cloth bag hanging down through the hole. Set the boxes on the hills of melons and leave them half a minute. One man operates ten of these boxes as fast as he can move them. It was reported good control could be had in this way, but we have not been able to get that control. We have left them on until it killed the plant without 100 per cent control of the beetles. Unless they are killed outright, they recover and are just as hungry as before they were gassed. In summing up the control methods which we now find practical, we recommend the use of calcium arsenate and gypsum mixed, used regularly once a week, because it is inexpensive and has been found effective; and t(v» use of the nicotine dust in cases of emergency, for instance, if a migration of these insects comes into the field, or in case of an attack by plant lice, we find the nicotine dust is very effective, more so than the liquid nicotine spray. When the lice attack the leaf, it curls downward and protects the lice from the ordinary methods of applying the sprays. A 2 per cent nicotine dust will control most of the plant lice. Perhaps the pea aphis is an out - standing exception to this rule. A 4 per cent dust is required for it. If you are interested in it, the Maryland Experiment Station has tried different strengths, and decided that a 4 per cent strength </seg>
            <seg id="p387">Nebraska State Hokticultukai. -Society is the minimum for the pea aphid. They have compared that with calcium cyanide and find thirty pounds of 4 per cent nicotine to the acre is more effective than fifty pounds of calcium cyanide, if applied with a power duster and an 18-foot stretch of canvas to hold the dust onto the vines until it has a chance to settle on the leaves. The squash bug I will mention, because we have tried' all these methods and have failed to control it. A 4 per cent nicotine dust will kill a few of the young or small bugs, but not a great percentage of th.em. . The blister beetle is an occasional invader of cotton and potato fields. We have tried nicotine dust on them, but again we have failed to get practical results. We tried calcium cyanide dust in suf - ficient strengths to kill the plants, and still did not kill the beetles, in spite of the fact that they fed where the calcium cyanide dust was located. The same thing was true with sodium fluosilicate. We have had no results there, although we killed the plants. In the case of the Colorado potato beetle, a 4 per cent nicotine dust will usually kill the young, when the temperature is 70 degrees or above; but it is unnecessarily expensive and it is not a practical means, because we can control them cheaper by the use of arsenicals. We still prefer a liquid spray for insect control on Irish potatoes from the point qf view of efficiency. Because the dust is so much less work and because the field can be covered more quickly,— which is sometimes important with the Colorado potato beetle,— many growers are buying dusters operated by tractor power and using them in the commercial potato growing. One of the materials used in the past has been straight Paris green, where two and one-half pounds are applied to the acre. Ws have had trouble with that. It is not a desirable practice. It causes occasional burning of the leaves and misses many of the beetles. We have not been able to get perfect distribution of the material to all parts of the plant. From two to three pounds to the acre of the arsenicals— either Paris green or calcium arsenate or calcium cyanide —are being used quite a little/mixed with hydrated lime to make a total of ten pounds to the acre. . It has given excellent results. We have tried nicotine dust on the cabbage with fair success for the aphids. However, they do most of their damage early when the .temperature is low, and for that reason we can not always use nicotine dust effectively. In general, we have found the liquid mixed spray with: soap added, more satisfactory for cabbage lice than the nicotine dust. We can get results from dusting the cabbage for worms with a pound of arsenate of lead to ten pounds lime. One of the things which has recommended nicotine dust on leafy crops has been the supposition that it was non-poisonous. We hesitated to use other insecticides on leafy crops because of their poisonous characteristics. We had one case where greenhouse lettuce </seg>
            <seg id="p388">Rkpokt of Nkiik.\sk.\ State Boahd of Auricu.tl'Kk was infested with plant lice which were easily killed by the applica- - lion of nicotine dust. The lettuce was used the next day and several people were reported to have gotten sick from eating this lettuce. Therefore, a word of caution if you are trying to kill the lice shortly before the lettuce is to be eaten. As I wrotp Mr. Werner in accepting the invitation, we think we are quite a ways yet from knowing the best methods of controlling all of these insects, as you can see by the number of methods tried out and the few still in use. I am not giving these as anything that is final as the best methods, but simply our experiences with them. If you care to ask questions about our results or experiences, I would be glad to try to answer them, although I am certainly not in the class with one person I heard of, who happened to be a colored newsboy located at a railway station where he had to answer a great many questions. This time four people came up one right after the other. The first one said, "What time does the train get in?" The next one said, "What time does it go out?" The third asked him, "How deep is the mud in the country here?" and the fourth said, "How do you sell your papers?" His reply was: "In at eight; Out at nine; Vp to your knees; Three for a dime." Discussion (.Answers by Mr. Page) Q. How do you control aphids on the roots of plants? A. We have no practical method of controlling aphids on the roots of plants. We have seen the method of pouring liquid nicotine solution around the plants, used with doubtful success. Q. I used that some in my garden and did not have very good success. A. It is pretty hard to control them. They are frequently carried to the roots of the plants by ants and cause considerable trouble. The only control we know of is to kill them up above the ground before they are taken down to the roots. It is always important in combating aphids to get after them as soon as they show up. Under favorable conditions they multiply extremely rapidly. Q. On the new plants early in the spring the roots are alive with little aphids. They have come from the ground. A. They live over sometimes in trash, or they may have been brought from your ho* bed. In transplanting, sometimes we dip the </seg>
            <seg id="p389">Nebraska Statk. Horticultural Society plants into a nicotine solution, or a solution of tobacco stems soaked in water, to kill the aphids. That is frequently done by cabbage growers before transplanting them. Q. Is there any possibility of control by fumigation or gas treatment? A. I presume that could be worked out. We have not had any experience with trying to kill them by gassing. It should not be dif - ficult because they are easy to kill that way. In the last year our greeenhouse. men have come to. the use of cyanide compounds scat - tered on their walks to kill all manner of insects, and most of them say they have had little trouble, since Us use. Q. Is dust or spraying more effective for cabbage worms? A. We have used dust mare, although both are effective. With your liquid spray it is necessary to use a spreader. We have used arsenate of lead in both the spray and the. dust. There are con - flicting opinions as to the danger of using arsenical sprays or dust on cabbage. You have heard the old statement made by one worker who analyzed cabbage that had been dusted, and he said it would be necessary to eat a barrel of kraut in order to get enough arsenate to make you sick! Several Wrs ago you remember the statements about the mysterious cabbage worm of the south causing deaths, and they were probably due to PaHs green. They quit dusting with Paris green in the last few weeks of the growing season. Most of the damage. by worms-is done ear y in the season when there is no danger from using the arsenic dust. Q. How do you control the large squash beetle? A. It is one of the unsolved mysteries. I presume you mean the so-called "stink bug." Q. What do you do when there are a million on one vine A. Spray the vine with kerosene. It will kill the vine and the beetles. That method can be used when the bugs are centered on a few vines. ' . Q. Do you use Paris green for cabbage? A. We are using arsenate of lead instead. Q. I have used Paris green for forty years, and never knew of. a funeral in our neighborhood caused by it. A. As to the relative effectiveness of the arsenicals, magnesium arsenate is probably the most effective; calcium arsenate next; then Paris green, and then calcium cyanide; and lead arsenate would come to the bottom as far as the effectiness of a. given volume of the arsenical i3 fconcerned. Arsenate of lead sticks better, and there is not much danger of burning from its use.. Q. I believe it is better for potato vines than Paris green. </seg>
            <seg id="p390">Report ok Nebraska State Board of Agriculture A. In regard to the squash bug, I have had experience with using bran or shorts mlved with Paris green. I can not remember the proportions. I barely dampened it and put it around the hills. They fed upon that and I had no trouble with the squash bug. A handful of bran with a little of Paris green; mix and dampen it, and put it close around the root of each hill. Wherever I have done that, I have had no trouble. I got it through "Better Homes and Garden." Q. What if your vines are twenty feet to the root? A. There is only one root. My experience has been they begin early and are on the first root and not the runners. Q. I have had them eat the squash after they are ripe. A. It Is a sucking insect with rather a hard shell, so a contact poison is ineffective. We can not get it with an arsenical poison, because it does not eat the leaves of the squash. That accounts for the difficulty in controlling it. We have no practical method of control, to our notion. Q. Isn't there a mistake about the squash bug? I wonder if she doesn't mean the squash vine borer? A. We call them black stink bugs. Q. Did you ever use any mechanical mixer and duster for nico - tine dust? A. We have not. You mean to mtx and apply at the same time? Q. You pour in liquid sulphate and dry magnesium carbonate, and the two are mixed and applied just as soon as mixed. A. Some have made home-made mixers out of barrel churns and put in round stones to do the mixing, with good results. Q. They are using these machines in California to some extent. A. We have eastern companies manufacturing these nicotine dust mixtures who deliver them at a reasonable price, perhaps because they buy their materials in large quantities. CHAIRMAN DAVIDSON: This has surely been a wonderfully in - teresting talk we have had. I, myself, believe in dusting. I have used it three or four years. I am using hydrated lime and black leaf. It works well on blossoms, roots, and vines. It is mighty expensive, though. Q. Does the squash bug bother squash more than pumpkin? A. It will eat almost anything. In our field experiments this year, we had different kinds of squash and pumpkin together, and the only one not bothered was this little Thomas squash. Q. We have grown pumpkin several years, and never had the squash bug until this year when we planted squash. </seg>

            <seg id="p392">Rkport ok Nkhiiaska State Bo.miii ok Ahltloui.Tt'RE desirable. This last year the Horticultural Department made a survey of the truck sections in eastern Nebraska, and at the same time in - formation was gathered on the presence of diseases in those sections. From these different sources we, therefore, have Information as to the prevalence and distribution of the diseases causing the most dam - age. I want to mention one or two of these diseases on the chief crops. Cabbage is one of the most extensively grown truck crops in this state and it is susceptible to a considerable number of diseases. Not all cabbage diseases occur here, but one or two cause a varying amount of damage year by year. The first disease I want to speak of is black rot of cabbage. It is rather common in the state. Our records show losses running from a trace up to 50 per cent of the crop, due to this one disease. This disease affects the plant at any time from the seedling stage to maturity and even in storage. If infection occurs early, sometimes the seedling is killed or if not killed, the plant will be dwarfed and the head may not form, or it may be misshapen. If infection comes later in the season, the first symptoms will appear on the leaves, and the typical appearance is characterized by this specimen. (Exhibits it). There is a distinct blackening of the veins of the leaf. This dis - coloration can be traced down the. leaf vein into the stem. If you cut across the stem at the surface of the ground, you will find a black ring in the vascular region. This disease is bacterial in nature and the organism causing, it lives over winter, both on the surface of the seed and in the soil, in old cabbage leaves, and plant debris in the field. Infection coming from the seed first affects the cotyledons; then (he organism gains entrance into the stem, progresses up the water conducting tubes of the stem, and finally reaches the veins of the leaves, giving the symptoms I mentioned first. The infection coming from old cabbage leaves in the field often affects the leaves directly. The organism is blown about with the dust or is carried by insects lo leaves, where in the presence of moisture, it penetrates through the natural openings getting in to the vascular system in that way and going down into the stem. We thus have two distinct sources and types of infection. ]n both cases, the veins are the location in which the organism develops and where the most distinct symptom appears. Other symptoms such- as wilting, stunting, and so forth, are the result of this invasion of the water-conducting system. Inasmuch as the disease lives over winter in two different ways, we are capable of controlling it by two different methods. If it lives on the surface of the seed, one way of control would be by seed treatment. That treatment is simply using a solution of cor - rosive sublimate at the strength of one to a thousand parts of water. You can buy it in drug stores in tablet form. If it is bought in </seg>
            <seg id="p393">Nerbaska State Horticultural Society bulk, the proportion is one ounce to seven and one-half gallons of water. Treat the seed thirty minutes and wash thoroughly in run - ning water. If the treated seed is planted on infested soil, the treatment is wasted. It will not prevent Infection coming from the soil, so that other control measures are necessary. Remove the old diseased cabbage leaves, instead of usine them for a fertilizer. You should have good, healthy soil in the seed bed, because this is an ideal place for the disease to spread, especially with an abundant moisture. It is then carried to the field and transmitted to healthy plants any time during the season; the head may form and still be infected so that damage occurs in storage. Another disease of cabbage not as common in Nebraska, but which does occur and sometimes causes severe loss, is cabbage yellows, or wilt. It is due to all organism that lives over in the soil. It will increase in cabbage land year after year, and it is necessary to use a long rotation to decrease the disease. The organism infects the plant through the root and' works up the "stem, resulting in the death of the plant. The disease is characterized by a yellowing and wilting ot the leaves; very often the plant will be killed before the head forms. If it forms, it will often be misshapen. When the stems of infected plants are cut across there will be found a discoloration of the vascular tissue which can be distinguished from the previous disease, black rot, by its brown color. The organism invades the vascular system, and by plugging up the water-conducting tubes or secreting injurious substances, it produces a wilt. This disease cannot be controlled by seed treatment. It will be reduced by long rotation — not planting on old cabbage soil which has grown a crop of infected cabbage. One of the best methods for control has been worked out in Wisconsin. The disease was causing so much loss in the truck sections that they could not raise cabbage profitably. The pathologists developed a variety resistant to- this disease, by selection and breeding. Certain strains have thus been successfully selected and propagated for their resistance. The Wisconsin Hollander and the Wisconsin Brunswick are both resistant to yellows. There are a number of other promising varieties. In regard to the use of the resistant varieties in this section, I might mention that last year one man planted Wisconsin resistant cabbage and lost his crop, due to wilt. I had the same thing happen to me once in Delaware by planting Wisconsin resistant cabbage seed in infested soil. A clear explanation of this is apparent from the work of the pathologists in Wisconsin in their study of the relations of environmental conditions to this disease. These strains of cabbage, resistant ; to yellows, were found to be. just as susceptible as others during the seedling stage. After passing through the seedling stage </seg>
            <seg id="p394">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture they were resistant. They also found the organism was not capable of producing the disease at soil temperatures below 60° F. There - fore, when the soil temperature was above 60° and the soil infested, ihese resistant strains would show disease in the seedling stage. In Wisconsin the average soil temperature during this stage of growth would be below 60°. Under our conditions the temperature may be above that point and therefore, the resistant varieties may become infected. You can not control temperature except possibly in the seed bed. or by time of planting, but you can use healthy soil in the seed bed If you do not have the organism present in the soil, the seedlings do not become infected and they are afterwards resistant when planted in the field. Those are the two most important diseases of cabbage . in this state. The other crop I want to mention is tomatoes, which is increas - ing in acreage every year especially in the vicinity of canning factories. There are two or three very severe diseases of this crop. The most important is tomato mosaic. The symptoms are somewhat sim - ilar to those characteristic of mosaic diseases of many other crops. The main foliage symptom is a mottling of the leaf, from which I he disease gets its name. There will be areas of light green or &gt;e!lowish tissue surrounded by areas of healthy dark green thus giving the leaf a mottled or mosaic appearance. There are other symptoms such as dwarfing and the appearance of dark streaks of dead tissue on the stems. The leaves may be curled and roughened or wrinkled. Sometimes long, narrow leaves, perhaps four inches by one-fourth inch, will occur. Mosaic plants do -not produce much. The chief damage caused by the disease is in the reduction of the yield, rather than a rotting of the fruit. It produces spots on the fruit, but that is of minor importance. Usually mosaic tomato plants, infected early, will not produce a crop. Those infected later may produce a crop, but it will be reduced as the season advances. This is a virus disease, which means we do not know the causal factor. We have never been able to find an organism connected with it. We do know certain things about the disease, however. We know it is infectious and that it can be transmitted from plant to plant. We can transmit it to a healthy plant by introducing into it the juice of a diseased plant. It is transmitted naturally in the field by insects, like the aphids, which after sucking the juices of an infected plant can efficiently transmit the disease to healthy plants. The same disease occurs in some of our perennial solanaceous weeds, such as horse nettle, ground cherry, and a number of others. Such per - ennial plants becoming infected carry the disease over winter and the next spring insects feeding on them will transmit the disease to neighboring tomato fields and from them it may spread rapidly in the field. </seg>
            <seg id="p395">Nebraska State Horticultural Society In Nebraska we have found from 30 to 100 per cent infection occurring In some fields. It is not uncommon to find more than 50 per cent of infection in large fields. The yield is reduced accordingly The disease does not live over in the seed or soil. You can not control it by rotation or seed treatment.. It does live over winter in these solanaceous weeds, and one method of control is the eradi - cation of those weeds.. In some of the tomato growing centers of Indiana they have controlled it by eradicating these weeds from the fields of that vicinity. We ought to be able to do so here with similar methods. The control of the insects that transmit it would also reduce it. Another disease, that is severe on tomatoes, especially when being raised for canning, is known as bacterial spot. It produces a spot on the fruit, and also one on the leaf. The chief damage is to the fruit. The disease is bacterial in nature and the organism lives over on the surface of the seed. Prom the infected, seedlings it is spread from plant to plant. The organism not being able to penetrate the healthy leaf tissue, can only gain entrance through natural openings or through wounds. The wounds on the fruit are usually in the nature of insect punctures. The best control method we have at the. present time is a seed treatment. Recommendations from several stations where experiment - al work has been conducted consist in the use of a solution of mercuric chloride with the strength of one part to three thousand parts of water That would be one ounce to twenty-two and one-half gallons. Treat for five minutes and then rinse thoroughly in fresh water for 10 to 15 minutes. The treatment is not entirely effective, because we have been able to detect a little disease even on the seed treated in this way If you use a stronger solution, however, you will injure the seed and reduce the germination. Another disease of tomatoes, Fusarium wilt, is similar to cabbage yellows, and is caused by a closely related fungus. It has a similar life history. The disease is more severe at high than at low tem - peratures. The disease occurs -only slightly in this state, and has not been as important as mosaic and bacterial spot. The only control is the use of resistant varieties. A number of varieties have been developed by the United States Department of Agriculture and the State experiment stations, which can be grown on infected soil and still remain healthy. They are probably not as good as the usual commercial varieties so far as yield and quality are concerned. I would not recommend them except on infested soil. I should like to mention in closing, one thing in regard to diseases of truck crops in general. There, are only a relatively few ways in which these diseases are transmitted and live over winter. They live over in or on the seed, in the soil, or in old plant parts. They are </seg>

            <seg id="p397"/>
            <seg id="p398">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture transmitted by Insects, by wind, wind-blown rain, or by cultural prac - tices. Our control methods, therefore, usually depend on seed treat - ment, the use of resistant varieties, If they have been developed, and proper cultural practices. Disease control is largely a matterof pre - vention. It is not similar to disease control in animals, where a treat - ment can be given after they become infected. You must prevent infection with plants. It is well to follow sanitary measures, regardless of whether or not you use a sred treatment; but it is particularly true In regard to the seed bed. I can not over-emphasize the Importance of the seed bed in truck crop diseases. The seed bed, especially under condi - tions where the drainage Is poor and where the plants are crowded and poprly ventilated, with a resulting high humidity, forms an Ideal cultural plot for all these organisms. They are transmitted easily under these conditions and are carried into the field. Therefore, proper sanitary and cultural practices in the seed bed combined with long rotations and the cleaning up of the old refuse from the previous year's crop, are the best precautions against disease. The use of healthy or treated seed, and, if necesary, resistant varieties/completes our control methods. The next on our program is "Methods of Nebraska Market Gard - eners." by Mr. Moore of the Agricultural College. MKTHOns OF X Kim ASK A MARKET GARDKXERS: IS THF.RK ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT? RUFL'S MOORE. Agricultural College, Lincoln, Nebraska It was my privilege this summer to make trips over the state to various vegetable sections and make a survey of what the men are doing and how they are doing it. I made one to Fremont, one to North Platte, one to Norfolk and Omaha, and one to Nebraska City. These are the main vegetable growing districts of Nebraska. It waa a delightful trip and I found a great many things of Interest. What I say will only cover a few high spots. Everything I saw could not be applied to every locality, because the problems are naturally dif - ferent. The thing that impressed me most forcibly was the fact most growers are decidedly progressive, particularly as to varieties. I found the men had been on their toes to get hold of the varieties that are best, regardless of whether they are old or new. The Washington variety of asparagus is rust-resisting. It was developed by the gov - ernment and has come into quite general use. Three-fourths of the growers have adopted this variety. Those who still have another </seg>
            <seg id="p399">Nebraska State Horticultural Society variety are growing it because it was used before the Washington variety came into prominence. ; .. Another instance of this progresslveness is the fact they have been growing Wisconsin Hollander cabbage. The report Dr. Goss gave you about the man who had a total loss was one of the report.3 I turned In. They are not growing these new varieties unless they are an Improvement over the old. They still cling to the "Country Gen - tleman" sweet corn. ' There Is quite a good deal of machinery used among the vege - table growers. I found a number of transplanting machines said to " be very satisfactory. One grower has a bunching machine which he thinks is the thing to get vegetables to market In a hurry. There was one garden tractor and a few dusting machines. The most com - plete one- was owned by Mr. George, of Dakota City. It cost $190, and it covers three rows at a time. It is power driven. He told me of a duster he thinks is a desirable type which you can carry on your back and dust your crops by hand. The thing I should like to stress is that the men using machinery find it is proving decidedly satisfactory. I believe this is a place where they can investigate further, and doubtless find they can buy devices that will save a great deal of labor and do the work more efficiently than at the present time. Crop rotation, was- practised, although anybody growing vegetable crops knows it is impossible to follow a definite rotation. You can plan a fine one, and have a wet season or an extremely dry or windy season come and destroy your plans. However, the crops are shifted regularly. Nearly all growers change their crops every season. The soil management is good. Most growers are fall plowing. This is not feasible in some sections, so they delay until spring. I found the use of sweet clover in some sections, and manure is used to a large extent because you can manure and raise two crops in one year. Naturally there is room for improvement. I have only been over the state, or certain sections, one summer. . There is room for improvement in the control of insects. There has been considerable discussion about' the use of dusters. This method' has not come into general practice. Dusting for the aphides should be done more, and. I believe it would result in greater profits and greater satisfaction to the grower. Probably the reason there has not been much done is because there are very few dusting machines • in use. They are used most around Dakota City. * Another important point is the recognition of diseases. Some - times the presence of insects may be easily confused with an actual diseased condition. In one case at Fremont I ran across an egg plant leaf which gave the appearance of disease. Upon investigation, </seg>
            <seg id="p400">Rf.pokt ok Nebraska State Board of Agriculture I found it was the work of a leaf miner. One of the other growers reported this as egg plant blight. I think it must have been the same thing. There are other cases in which recognition of disease would be a very valuable thing. You must know what you are dealing with before you can control it. Prevention of disease is another thing that can be done to great advantage. I might mention a case that would be of interest. One of the big melon growers near Norfolk planted watermelons on the same land for two years. The second year he , had 50 per cent infec - tion of fusarium wilt. He had a 50 per cent crop. He reports another grower had grown melons for three successive years on the same land, and had a total crop failure. If they had known this fusarium wilt persisted year after year, they would have rotated their crops and avoided this loss to themselves. Along the line of soil management there is room for improve - ment. Most men are adapting soil management problems to. their particular localities. Around Omaha it is not possible to put in eight acres in sweet clover. 1 found men near Dakota City farming forty acres, with eight acres in sweet clover every year. That allows. a five-year rotation. Another man planted quite a bit of his land in sweet clover and allowed it to grow for a year and a half, and turned it under. It produced an increase equivalent to twelve to fourteen tons of manure. There is quite a good deal of agitation about the use of fer - tilizers, around Omaha particularly. There has been some work done at this Station along that line, but not a great deal. Some work has been done on the use of acid phosphate on tomatoes to increase earli - ness. Each locality has its own soil. I found everything from clay loams to pure sand. The Otoe Food Products Company experimented with acid phosphate this year. It will increase earliness and deepen Die red color. This latter effect Is particularly desirable for the canning factory. Especially for the larger grower, It is possible to use more mach - inery to better advantage. I would advise they proceed with consider - able caution. I noticed they have, and those using machinery have found it to be very beneficial. The thing they could use most is the dusting machine. Possibly they could invest in some other machines such as garden tractors, but that is an individual problem.' There is something to weather conditions. If a person applies dust under rainy weather conditions, he will get poor control. Dusts are more effective if the temperature is 70° F. or above. Diseases have caused considerable loss in the past. Some were not present this year. Some diseases appear one year and do not the next. If a man were regularly employed to make a survey of the state, he could eventually line up these diseases and know just what they are, </seg>
            <seg id="p401">Nebraska State Horticultural Society and in that way suggest methods for control, if available. They are not in all cases. Where they are available, the growers are entitled to these methods of control. At the station in the summer of 1925 we had 100 per cent harvest of the squash bug. We expected a great many this year. For some reason, they did not show up. It is the same with a great many other diseases. Soil management could be worked out in due season, and the test to determine which type of fertilizer' is desirable. That could be settled for several years. Soil management could be more or less a settled problem. There are' several minor things that might be tested out. Each season would bring its own problems. One minor problem is the number of transplantihgs desirable before plants are put in the field. Transplanting a plant once or more before it is put into the field is desirable. It would be desirable to see how many transplanting prove to be profitable. . There are new devices coming on the market every year such as glass cloth, etc., which could be tested out to good advantage; and the so.called "frost proof" cabbage plants. I have reports both for and against. I will not make comments in either direction. We tested glass cloth at the station last year; Mr. Werner is more Qualified to report on that than I am. There are other things bound to come up. Those who are finding things out for themselves are to be commended. If they get good results, we would like to hear about it, and like to help them test these things and find those of value to them and those that are not. . I do not want to leave the impression the Department of Horti - culture or any man it might employ can serve as a Know-Ail for all problems that may come up. Diseases should go to the Plant Pathology Department unless we have the methods of control avail - able. Questions about insects should go to the Entomology Depart - ment. Problems in soils should go to the Soils Department. The ad - vantage of having a man in the field is he would know where to refer these problems. It is impossible for one man to know everything in one line. Horticulture covers a number of fields. A man in this work must have reliable men to whom he can refer In case the problem is not entirely within his field. I might suggest a few things the growers could do at the present, time. They could establish closer contact with the College through letters and through the county agents. Your county agent is willing to- help you in any connection he can. If he can not help you, he will refer to the College and secure the help available. It is impos - sible to answer every problem entirely satisfactorily. We are always </seg>
            <seg id="p402">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture • willing to get all the help we can. We have an extension news serv - ice. One of the men made a request I enter his name for this publication. In this publication there are items of interest to the men growing vegetables. Another thing that could be done is to enthuse men at the Station by writing, and writing again, in case the work you want done is not done. A dozen requests won't influence the work of the Station per - haps to the degree you would like. If you have a problem that has not been solved, write and tell the Station what it is. Are there any questions? I am not like the nigger who can answer questions extremely rapidly. Discussion f Answers by Mr. Moore.) Q. I would like to ask about garden tractors. A. When I was in Des Moines thiB fall at the Mid-West Horti - cultural Exposition, I examined quite a number of tractors there.- They looked like a good proposition — the Boles, for example. They should be investigated quite thoroughly before one is bought. There are doubtless a number of good ones on the market, and I would advise a man to look thoroughly before he invested. Q. Have you a tractor here at the Station? A. No. Q. What kind of a bundler did you mention? A. I will call on Mr. Hepperly to answer that. MR. HEPPERLY: I bought a vegetable tying machine last spring from the American Tying Machine Company. We like it on radishes, turnips, beets, and carrots. It won't tie onions tight enough, how - ever. We have been using rubber bands on onions. This machine won't tie asparagus. If I were an inventor, I would put out an aspar - agus-tying machine that would tie with rubber bands. I do not know how to put it together. You can tie 100 dozen bundles in a little while. It is used in the shed. We always take them to the shed before we tie them. Q. We tie in the field. MR. HEPPERLY: Do you get them clean? Q. They stack and press them. They don't wash them before bundling. MR. HEPPERLY: We wash before we tie. Q. I know a fellow who shipped a lot. He said he could not make money at fifteen cents a dozen bunches. He said he could pet it done for five cents a dozen bunches. </seg>
            <seg id="p403">Nebraska State Horticultural Society MR. HEPPERLY: it would not cost more than that. With the tying machines, I imagine, you could do it at around two or three cents, because you can tie forty or fifty bunches In an hour. We generally put ten or twelve radishes in a bunch. We sell them at forty cents a dozen to the grocers. It depends on the supply how big the bunches are. We' keep the price the same and vary the size of the bunch. They vary from ten to twenty In a bunch. CHAIRMAN DAVIDSON: This is surely a very interesting talk. The next on the program is "Possibilities and Methods With Special Early Crops," by Mr. Werner of the College. i •■ . • ~ ■ ,; ;■)•• ' ■■■ POSSIBILITIES AND METHODS WITH SPECIAL EARLY CROPS . H. 0. WERNER; Agricultural College, Lincoln, Nebr. Mr. Chairman- and Truck Growers: I shall not try to give a set talk, but hope simply to act as leader of a discussion on some phases of the growing of these crops. I will bring out a few high spots in connection with some of the more important commercial crops that are being grown, and perhaps could be grown to better advantage in this state. I will take tomatoes first. I think most of the truck growers in Nebraska, according to the survey made by Mr. Moore, are using good varieties of tomatoes. There are, however, quite a few strains of some of these varieties which do vary a great deal. With the Earliana, there are a number of strains that vary very much with regard to the time of ripening. • Some twelve years ago when I was in charge of experimental work in horticulture in the North Dakota Station, we tried out some thirty strain's, and found that some strains?, (in a season unusually long for that country), produced a little bit better than tons, whereas some other strains produced thirty-five tons to the acre. Up to any one definite day, such as the last of August — that would be equivalent to the fifth or tenth of August here — we had some strains that produced as much as twenty tons to the acre, as com - pared with less than a ton from other varieties. Putting it on a dollar-and-cents basis, with tomatoes selling at a high price, it would make a lot of difference. At this Station we have done strain testing on a small scale. We find a great deal of difference, occasionally three and four pounds of tomatoes per plant from some strains up until a certain day, before we have one-half pound per plant from other strains. One of the old strains of Earliana which is distinctly superior is the Langdon strain from New York. The North Dakota Agricultural </seg>
            <seg id="p404">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture College, as the result of a number of years of selection, has put out a distinctly early strain of this variety. The Pennsylvania State College has put out a distinctly superior strain of Earliana tomatoes which is not so much earlier, but which produces very smooth tomatoes. With the Earliana variety tomato that is out of the ordinary. There has been developed at the North Dakota Station a hybrid variety by crossing the Earliana with some of the smaller and very smooth tomatoes. These have been put on the market in the name of "Red River," and also "Agassiz." Those are superior early varieties, and might be used by growers here in Nebraska. I think you will find them on the market throughout North Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin. So much with regard to earliness. There are several ways of securing earliness. It would be pre - sumptions to asume you do not know them. It is well to -have a good variety, and the best seed of that variety. After that comes the matter of time of seeding. Mr. Moore suggested that a good many growers were not transplanting their plants under glass. With tomatoes, I think we can secure more profit from the use of glass — than perhaps with any other crop. A fine method is to sow the seed in dirt bands, or the plant3 may be grown by transplanting as much as two or three times, with the third planting preferably into a paper or clay pot. The thing we' need to be careful about in growing tomatoe plants is to keep them growing slowly all the time — not to force the growth rapidly, and not to check it at any time. You may have had experience with that. One of the very finest pieces of scientific work which has been done in the last twelve years was done with the tomata plant by two men from the University of Chicago, who found the tomato plant responds very readily to environment. If you check the growth by droughty weather or growing the plant in a soil that is deficient in the elements necessary for good growth — nitrogen, particularly — a plant very full of starch results. Such plants 'will not bear fruit very well. It will set fruit, which would not develop well. If you provide the plant with other conditions, you will have a rank type of growth, but no fruiting. These men conducted quite a number of experiments in connection with the crop. The plant can be thrown into fruiting by checking its growth, but by doing that you may check it.3 growth more than you care to, stunting it so that the plant does not recover for a month. You might get a few very early tomatoes, but the general bulk of the crop would be a great dea! later. So keeping the plants growing steadily and uniformly, but not rapidly, is probably the best suggestion I can give with regard to producing early fruit. If you are going to use transplanting methods, sow the seed in flats and transplant, not using manure in the flats and not much </seg>
            <seg id="p405">• . Nebraska State Horticultural Society -■■. ' ' : -: , I ■■■' . ; in the soil, but using plenty of sand. Transplant again in two or three weeks, and shift into three- or four-inch pots in which plants can be held for eight weeks, avoid; ng 'excessive or insufficient watering. If you have never use i that method, it may seem laborious or expensive; but if you use it and grow a crop by proper methods, you -will find it is quite desirable. Another way which is more expensive of glass space, but more economical of labor, is to sow three or four seeds in a three- or four-inch paper pot or dir . band, which remains where it is placed when the seed is sown unt 1 the time has arrived for shifting to the field. As' the plants grov and get to be about two inches high, thin out the extra plants so that one plant is allowed to remain in each pot. This is really better than any other method, but more expensive because of requiring a larger amount of glass space for a greater length of time. If you sow in dirt pans on the same day as in flats, the -flat grown plants will' be a week later than the dirt band grown plants. To get the same result, it is necessary to sow the plants a trifle earlier than those not transplanted. Some of you may have had experience with pruning. From the standpoint of canning tomatoes, I do nut think there is any place for pruning. We can grow; plenty of tomatoes without pruning them. When it comes to the master of growing fine early tomatoes, it is quite desirable as is also staking. I consider pruning desirable for the production of early tomatces for local markets^say before the first of September. After that they might be too cheap to warrant extra expense. There will be less rotting and larger fruit, and have it somewhat earlier. With regard to hastening ripening by artificial fertilizers, the New Hampshire Experiment Station has done a lot of work in using 500 to 1500 pounds of acid phosphate per acre. They have had nice results in ripening tomatoes earlier, and getting a larger quantity up to any one day. We have carried on tests here on a small scale for two . years. "Last year we got no results. This year we think perhaps we may have secured a slight increase in earliness, but it was very slight and would not ■ have paid for the material used. We had just as dry conditions as any farmer in western' Nebraska, and just as moist conditions as necessary, having grown the crop . with and without irrigation. Evidently our soil has sufficient phos - phate. ■ Discussion on Tomatoes (Answers by Mr. Wer ler.) . Q. Have you any comparisons on the yield of southern and home-grown plants? </seg>
            <seg id="p406">Rkport of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture A. We have not used them in our experiments. We have been a little bit of afraid of bringing in southern-grown plants on account of the danger of bringing disease with them. We think we can grow better plants than we can buy. Q. Haven't they gotten it down so that most are government inspected? A. I do not know about that. Q. We are growers of tomatoes and get a great many plants from Georgia. To our knowledge we have not brought in any disease of any kind. We have no trouble. A. One disease that is prevalent throughout the south which they told me in Kansas is spreading slowly from the southeast to the north and west, is wilt. We have very little in Nebraska. That is the disease I have had in mind which might be brought in with fouthern plants. Q. Why do they pull their plants and hold them so long before they set them in the field Id the Ozarks? A few days ago I saw a wagonbox load of plants pulled forty-eight hours. They said they never set them without letting them stand that long. MR. E. M. PAGE, of Missouri: Tl-at is not a general practice. It must have been an individual's idea. The practice is more nearly the opposite— to water the plants well and take them up with the moisture still on the roots, and put them out as soon as possible. Q. We always thought to get them down as quickly as possible. A. My discussion has been with regard to the growing of early tomatoes. For ordinary tomatoes, you can grow the plants by any method and get a fairly good crop. Those methods would no* apply in early plants. We have not done much with cabbage. I ran a little experiment that is of some interest. You may have seen an article In the Market Growers Journal by a man in Missouri who planted seed In January and raised plants in pots or flats, and then transplanted them into the field in March. Last year I planted seed the 30th of January in four-inch dirt bands, and also in t,wo-inch dirt bands and flats. We planted seventy plants in the field. By June 21st. with four-inch dirt band plants, we had 48 heads out of 70 plants; with two-inch bands, 27 heads, while with flat grown plants we had 26 heads. The plants had been held too long for the flat growing method to be successful. The total yield harvested was even more significant. The Jan - uary planted lots grown in dirt bands yielded 114 pounds of cabbage; the two-inch yielded 57 pounds, and the flat grown plants 38 pounds </seg>
            <seg id="p407">Nebraska State Horticultural Society up to June 21st. The growth of the plants raised in the flats was checked by transplanting. AH had the same amount of space, but in one case the roots had spread and we tore them getting them out. In the other case, the roots were confined to the two or four inches of the dirt band area. When we sowed seed on February 20th and March 30th, and transplanted the plants under glass, by June 21st, we got 37 pounds of cabbage from those sown In January; while from the February lots we' got 42 pounds; but those sown in March gave us 61 pounds. There was a decrease in yield due to too early seeding when the plants were held in flats. I With dirt bands, the early seeding was profitable. By July second, practically all the crop from the January planting with dirt bands hid been harvested; as compared with only one-half to one-third of the ( crop raised by other methods. From the standpoint of getting extremely early cabbage, if you have facilities, - sowing late in January in! dirt pans of three or four inches in a method that might well be (tried out on a small scale. Discussion on Cabbage (Answers by Mr. Werner.) • Q. Were they paper or wooden? A." They were paper pulp pots. Wooden bands would probably be better, because paper pots might go to pieces. With regard to sweet potatoes.. We have grown good crops of Porto Rico, Jersey and Nancy Hall. The Bermudas have not been good. They had a tendency to produce long roots, sometimes swelling for as much as two feet, which produced a strange appearance. Under the same conditions, the Jersey and the Porto Rico gave well shaped roots; and, the Nancy Hall not so well, shaped, but quite desirable. Discussion on Sweet Potatoes (Answers by Mr. Werner.) Q. What is the color of the Porto Rico? A. It has a reddish root. Q. How does it compare with the Nancy Hall? A. That is a sweet potato with a pink tinge. During the last three years we have raised sweet potatoes on a small scale. Each year we have gotten good yields. The last two years we have 50 per cent more yields in pounds per acre from sweet than from Irish potatoes. Three years ago we got exceptionally large </seg>
            <seg id="p408">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture yields from Irish potatoes on our farm here. The sweet potatoes have run between one hundred and two hundred bushels per acre (of marketable potatoes of the several varieties) the Porto Rico and Nancy Hall especially. You may have read about experiments conducted in Jerseys, also a report from the Missouri Experiment Station, that by adding potash fertilizers, the roots will be wider and shorter. In view of our experience with the Bermudas, we thought it desirable to try this out. We tried it on quite a good sized scale, but got no benefit from the use of potash, using from 150 to 1200. pounds to the acre. The larger amounts decreased the yield a little, but did not change the shape of the potatoes insofar as we could tell. The roots were so irregular we did not try to measure them. On the lighter soils deficient in potash and better adapted to sweet potato growing, it might be well to try out the use of 200 pounds of muriate of potash with sweet potatoes. I think it might give some results. It has in - creased the sugar content as reported from Missouri. Q. How about the depth of plowing for sweet potatoes? A. I will ask Mr. Page, of Missouri, to answer that. MR. PACE: The general practice varies with the soil. Usually the land is plowed to the ordinary depth and ridges thrown out. In sandy land it varies from heavy land. In harvesting our plots of potatoes a year ago, "we noticed when - ever there was a chunk of manure that had not been broken by the spreader, under the hill, we had better shaped roots. They were shorter, and more of them. We followed that idea up by a little experiment this year in which we put well rotted manure in rows and threw a ridge on top. With one variety, the manure was harmful. We had a smaller crop of Xo. 1 potatoes than usual with the Porto Ricos. With the Xancy Hall we got a 20 per cent increase in good No. 1 sweet potatoes. This treatment made the soil decidedly loose underneath, but offered less physical resistance to the roots. I think that is why one variety gave better results. Why the other did not I do not know. The variety which gave unfavorable results gave only slightly less pounds in the manure plats. The difference was not as great as with the Xancy Hall which gave good results. I have a few figures from the experiments which we ran on soil management methods. You are familiar with the work done here a few years ago with mulches. We had a number of crops such as tomatoes, potatoes and egg plants in a series of plots. All the way through the tendency was for the straw mulched plots to give </seg>
            <seg id="p409">Nebraska State Horticultural Society better yields than the cultivated plots. What was more striking is the difference between the irrigated and non-irrigated. We had only one-fifth as much under dry land mulch condition as with irrigation. Sometimes irrigation increased the crop of tomatoes five times and sometimes as milch as ten times. In no case was it less than four or five times. This was a severe year for growing vegetables without - irrigation. The straw mulch decreases the nitrate content. We added a small amount of nitrate of soda to try to counterbalance the reduced nitrogen balance. Q. Might it not be explained because it is early in the season? A. There is not so much difference in the nitrate content later in the season. What about the earliness? Straw mulching under irrigation gave 171 pounds of tomatoes up to August 15th; unirrigated mulching gave 26 pounds. Irrigated cultivated plats gave 142 pounds to the same date. Wlth.no irrigation, the returns were 17 pounds from cultivated plats. Those differences ran all the way through the results. You have heard a great deal about cultivation. A few years ago our attention was called to the fact that perhaps we were cultivating too much. Experimenters found that if weeds were kept down and the soil loose so that it could absorb the rainfall, nothing else was needed. They did some work along this line at Cornell University. •With egg plants, the irrigated lot not cultivated gave the highest yields of any of the treatments. With a lot of vegetables such as celery and onions and all the smaller vegetables, light infrequent cul - tivation — just enough to keep the weeds down— was found most desir - able, because the roots are shallow. Most of the main roots are within an inch or two of the surface, for as much as two feet before they turn downward. I started to investigate the roots of the potato plants in the field. I found the tendency was for the roots to grow within two or there inches of the surface of the soil. Practically no roots went straight down. Even when cultivating half an inch deep you would cut off some of- the main roots. Cultivating four or. five inches deep might destroy a big portion of the root system. With potatoes, it is important to secure as much growth as possible early in the season. If you lose the result of the growth by cutting the roots, you will delay the maturity of the crop and decrease the amount of potatoes you will get. Potatoes are high-priced now, and it might be a dangerous time to talk about potatoes. The old rule has been that when seed is high in the spring, potatoes will be cheap in the fall; and when seed is cheap in the. spring, potatoes will be high in the fall. When you </seg>
            <seg id="p410">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture consider a long time, you will find that this holds out quite nicely Prices fluctuate widely year by year. After years of high prices generally the acreage plant is greater, and then when the weather .. favorable the yield will be high. We have now the unusual con - dition of two high-priced years in succession-something that only happens about once in thirty-five years. It is not likely to happen the third time, but one can not tell. Early potatoes are the most profitable crop to grow in the south - eastern part of the state. They can grow more per acre on the cheap land in the western part of the state, and all over the north The question that conies up now is how to get those early potatoes Most potatoes are ready about the first of August. We have not been using the most desirable varieties in eastern Nebraska. The Early Ohio has been the old standby, but it is subject to second growth and not very resistant to heat. The Irish Cobbler is a distinctly superior variety. On our own grounds out near Havelock, a year ago we grew only H bushels per aere of United States No. 1 grade with the Early Ohio, while with the Irish Cobbler we grew 80 to ?4 bushels of No Is per acre. The total yield was very much more. We sold the No- Is at $1.50, but the No. 2\s were sold for whatever we could get; so that the money returns of the two varieties were widely dif - terent. We have used ,he Irish Cobbler in a number of experiments oi er the state. A. North Platte we have found that it out-yields other varieties. The Triumph variety, which is grown extensively i n the western part of the state, concerning which you hear so much in connection with certified seed, we do not recommend in eastern Ne - braska. In hot weather it proves a disappointment in this part of the state. In an exceptionally cold season it will give good yields. The source of seed has not been given as much attention as it deserves. We have been getting Early Ohio's from the Red River )h p h T »? ° ften WS reUed UP ° n the faCt they were e row « in the Red River Valley. Too often attention has been paid only to whether the potatoes looked nice. There are a number of diseases of potatoes. Mosaic is one of these. Spindle tuber, which causes the running out of potatoes you have seen for years, is another disease' Running out" of potatoes is not the direct result of environmental, conditions- not due to heat or irrigation, but to a disease which thrives more under some conditions than others. How shall the seed grower know what to do? Certified seed is the way ou t. certified potatoes have been inspected in the field from oulniVT 6 UmeS - In th ' 8 State there are three inspections by qualified inspectors They can detect these various diseases in the different varieties- some showing up early and some late; some in cold and some in hot weather. They go to the fields at intervals when </seg>
            <seg id="p411">Nebraska State Horticultural Society they are most likely to catch all the diseases. After the fields have passed these rigid field inspections, the potatoes are inspected in the bin. . . Unfortunately, in this state our certification work has been con - fined almost altogether to the Triumph variety. The price has been so good because, of the great demand for them in the south that the growers have not seen fit to grow Early Ohio's and Cobblers which we need here. We can get certified seed of these varieties from' Minnesota, Wisconsin, North and South Dakota. In getting certified seed, be sure you are not buncoed into getting something else. The way to identify genuine "old line" certified seed coming from Minnesota is by the seal of the State of Minnesota. In Wisconsin, seed is certified by the Agricultural College as is also the case in North and South Dakota. All of the states I have mentioned use blue tags with the name of the grower and the place where grown except Wisconsin which uses a red tag. You will find sacks on the market marked "Genuine Red River Valley seed potatoes." You may have dealers trying to sell them to you as certified seed potatoes. That has happened in almost every town I have been in during the potato planting season, in eastern land central Nebraska. \ If in doubt send the tag here so we can tell you whether it is a. tag of the official agency in that state that is supposed to do the certification. You generally have to pay from 50/ to 75 cents more per hun - dred for certified Cobblers, Ohio's and others, but it is worth the price. It is desirable to treat the seed potatoes you get from the Red River valley and other northern points, because they are infected nor only with scab, but rhizoctonia. which occurs in black specks which look like dirt. This situation actually happened in Lincoln. You hear it said that: Red River dirt is black. Some Lincoln seed dealers in the past, not very well informed on the merits of seed potatoes, have pointed to the black "dirt" on the potatoes as full evidence that they came from the valley of the Red River of the North! Perhaps some of it is dirt. If you take a lot of these potatoes and give them a good scrubbing with a brush, a lot of dirt comes off, but much fs left. There are black spots that stick. You can not scrub them off. Some - times they are as big as a black-headed pin, and sometimes much smaller. Those spots are what the pathologists call scleratia. They are the wintering-over stage of this rhizoctonia disease. When the seed dealer points to the Red River valley "dirt," he is often pointing to a disease on the potato. It does not affect the table value, but it does the seed value. The organism In those little spots on the potato grow best in a moist and cool environment with temperatures around 65° to 60° F. That is about: the right temper - ature for good potato growing. The little sclerotla send their growing </seg>
            <seg id="p412">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture stems along the stem that has jus&gt;t been formed. The disease works into the stem from the outside. Sometimes it will cut off the stem before it gets through the ground. Other times it may cripple the stem. If you have a large seed piece and the disease cuts off the shoot, sometimes it will send out two shoots, and not infrequently the same stems are cut off two or three times. That is an extreme case, but being cut off once is common. If you have a small seed piece, or weather conditions are unfavorable, the seed piece may never pro - duce a plant. If it survives the first attack. It is late in getting through. From actual results, we found that rhizoctonia this season caused a decrease in the yield over -a large number of farms of 30 to 40 bush - els per acre. How did we arrive at that figure? The Extension Service put on a specialist to endeavor to get the dealers in seed potatoes in the larger towns to treat their seed potatoes as they re - ceived them, before they were sold, so that the growers who wanted only five or ten bushels of seed could buy treated seed and would not have to go to the bother and expense of treating it. About twenty car loads of seed were treated by the hot formaldehyde method. Then we look the potatoes treated by this method and some which had not been treated, and planted them in plots in fifteen or twenty different parts of the state. With the Early Ohio variety planted with seed from the Red River valley seriously infected with rhizoctonia, we got an average increase in yield of 3 5 bushels from treated seed. With the Irish Cobbler variety which came from different places, there was less rhizoctonia, and the increase in yield was 30 bushels. These methods of treating potatoes are effective in killing the scab which is on the potatoes, but not in the land. They will also kill the rhizoctonia. Corrosive sublimate is a standard material used at the rate of 1 to 1000 parts of water. This is four ounces of corrosive sublimate to thirty gallons of water. This is a deadly poison. Dissolve it in a gallon of hot water, and add to it enough to make a total of thirty gallons. Dip the potatoes for one and one-half hours. .Some experi - ment stations recommend a shorter length of time. If you have facil - ities available for sprinkling or soaking your potatoes, so doing will greatly improve the results you get. If you sprinkle them, sprinkle twenty-four hours in advance, and keep them damp. You can use this solution four times. Increase the length fifteen minutes the second time, and the last two times, two or two and one-fourth hours, and then discard the solution. Treat the potatoes before they are cut, and be careful that everything is kept away from children and cattle. Use wooden or concrete vessels or anything not made of metal. The hot formaldehyde method is practical on a large scale. There will probably be dealers who are getting in seed from the north who </seg>
            <seg id="p413">Nebraska State Horticultural Society will be using this method again, so that you can get seed treated by this method if you do not want to bother with it yourselves. This method is hardly advisable unless a man has at least fifty bushels. Heat the solution and keep it at a temperature of 123° to 126° F. and soak the potatoes in if for four to five minutes. Use one pint of formalin to 15 gallons of water. Build a large tank wide enough to have the sacks go in cross-ways. You can put four sacks in at intervals of a minute. You must be sure to have a good thermometer. A steam boiler is about the best thing to have for heat. The steam is best applied through a coil into the bottom of the tank. You can - use this, solution as long as you want to. The practice is to discard it at the end of the day. That method gives good control. The seed potatoes from the north should be treated. A difference of 25 per cent, in yield often represents the profits on your crop. When it comes to planting, we have found that the earlier we can get the potatoes into the ground, the better the yield will be — generally about the first week of April. There are various things that can be done to facilitate this. You can fall plow your land and cut your seed potatoes in advance. Perhaps you have had experience with cutting seed in advance and have had poor stands. It is a dangerous practice unless done right. It is possible to cut seed from three weeks to five months in advance and get a 99 per cent stand. For three years we have been cutting our experimental potatoes from three weeks to two months in advance and storing in our cellar, and some - times shipping them across the state in sacks. This is the method. Cut the seed potatoes as you would any time, and spread them in thin layers not over four inches deep in a cool, damp, and dark place. Keep them in that environment for a week. Shovel them over once or twice the first day so that the seed pieces will not stick together. After that, every other day will be sufficient, and you can see how the healing is progressing. It may not be necessary to shovel them after the second day. First of all, the moisture evaporates from the cut surface. The starch in the cells- cut in half dries as the moisture escapes. If you continue to keep moist air around these potatoes a fatty material like a. varnish forms a nice coating . over the cut surface. That com - pletely shuts off any further loss of water from the Interior of the seed piece, and preveuts any disease from entering that cut surface from the outside. Practically no disease organism will penetrate the skin. The next thing is the development of a layer of cork under that fatty layer. . The regular skin is much like the bark of a tree, con - sisting of a number of layers of brick shaped cells. It is practically impervious to moisture and disease. We cut through many cells and let the moisture and starch leak out. As the moisture evaporates, the </seg>
            <seg id="p414">Report of Nkhra.sk a StatJo Board of Aobiculture material between the cells has grown toward the surface, so we have the layer of fat forming, and then division in these underlying cells begins. These cells are somewhat brick shaped and comprise a number of layers, just the same as in the skin of- the potato. In the course of five or six days, under conditions I have mentioned, a good skin is formed which is just as impervious to moisture and disease as the normal skin of the potato. You can take such cut potatoes and twist them as much as you possibly can, and the skin will not break. It is as tough as normal skin. When cut potatoes are kept in a dry atmosphere or at a high temperature alter cutting, there is quite a different story. Instead of having a tough, flexible skin, one gets a brittle skin which is abso - lutely worthless. It gives no protection. As soon as the potatoes are moved, the skin breaks. Disease can get under the shell and moisture will be lost. I think when planting potatoes early, it is well to cut them in advance and let iheni heal. If the land is cool and wet, it will probably prevent a lot of rotting, because then you have good protection against moisture (in excessive amounts) getting into the potatoes. Do not pile in deep piles until they are thoroughly healed. After a week or ten days you can sack them up. By cutting in advance and fall plowing, you can have your land and seed ready so that you can plant at the first opportunity during the last few days of March or the first few days of April. Early potatoes arc planted throughout the United States at about the time the average temperature gets to 45 degrees F., which is the temperature at which potatoes start to gro~w. At Lincoln that average temperature is attained during the first few days of April. If planted before that, they will be at a standstill, and there is danger of rotting. If planted later, many good potato-growing days will be lost. The reason for early planting is to get larger yields, because the potato is a cold climate plant. In this region we are forcing it to grow into a constantly hotter season. When grown as a fall crop, the weather is becoming colder as the s«ason advances. One of the men at the Minnesota Experiment Station grew potatoes at different temperatures. He found when the temperature was above 7 5 degrees F., with the Early Ohio variety, the plants did not store up any starch. They used up all the starch or sugar which they formed during the daytime in respiration during the day and night following. Only when the temperature was below 70 degrees F. was any reserve food stored up. The temperature gets to be rather hot about the middle of July. The more plant and tuber growth we can get to take place in June, the better off we will be. We can secure it by early planting; and planting large seed pieces will force the growth providing there Is plenty of fertility and moisture in the soil. </seg>
            <seg id="p415">Nebraska State Horticultural Society Straw mulching will increase the yield about 40 per cent, especially in dry seasons. This year we practically doubled the yield by mulch - ing. At the North Platte Experiment Station, we have planted potatoes at different- intervals. The results there will apply here with a little more emphasis on earliness. Taking 100 per cent as the April, planting yield, we found that by planting May first we got 89 per cent as great a yield; June first, 65 per cent; while the latter part of June planting only gave 50 per cent yield. I think we could subtract 15 per cent from those figures here. Any planting made after the tenth of May I think will gen - erally produce less than 50 per cent of the crop secured by planting before the tenth of April. The time of harvest is a practical factor. Unless the price is high, do not harvest as long as the plants are alive and there is any greenness in the plants, since if the temperature is not too hot such plants continue to increase their yield. If the temperature is high, the chances are that the condition which I told you about is taking place. That is, the plant is using up its reserve food rather than storing it. If the price of potatoes is good and the. weather very hot and the plants are showing signs of lacking vitality, perhaps the best thing is to take them to market. Probably the price will decline faster than the potatoes will increase in yield. As soon as they start to show signs of maturity, they no longer increase much in yield. The amount of leaf surface is being cut down. We have dug potatoes at intervals each year, and increase in tuber development has been slight until the plants have made their maximum of growth. If the weather is favorable, we have had an increase of five bushels per acre per day, and more. . . Discussion on Irish Potatoes (Answers by Mr. Werner) Q. Is the Irish Cobbler variety as early as the Ohio? A. The vines will not die down as early, because it has more resistance to heat. If you dig the two varieties on the same day, you will probably get more bushels per acre from the Cobbler than from the Ohio. Q. Is it more susceptible to spindle tuber? A. I believe the Cobbler is. Be especially careful to get certified seed. Q. Is there any treatment for spindle tuber like you would for scab? , ' </seg>
            <seg id="p416">Rkpobt of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture A. The seed treatments apply only to diseases on the surface of the potato. The spindle tuber and mosaic are inside. You must get seed which came from a field that did not have these diseases. Q. How much difference will it make in growth by cutting and letting It heal, as compared with the potato cut and planted right away? Will the potato start to grow before it heals over? A. The healing over and growing will take place at the same lime. That would be pretty hard to answer. In a wet soil the freshly cut seed would probably start growing right away. In a soil such as in the western part of the state, and here in dry years, the seed piece which is cut and planted immediately may lose a lot of weight in the soil. Q. 1 have cut potatoes two or three weeks ahead, and generally planted about fifteen acres. . I would run out of cut seed and get more and cut and plant them right away, and they were four or five days in coming up. Those healed over were a week earlier coining through the ground. A. That is quite possible. You take potatoes that have not gone through a resting period and they wont grow. They want to buy our western seed potatoes in Bermuda and Cuba to plant in September. We only harvest in September, and the potatoes insist on a resting period. If we cut close to the eye, the eye will grow even when the potato is quite dormant. Letting in oxygen to the eye stimulates its growth. Even in old potatoes, the eye closest to the cut surface will grow first. When you cut through you have exposed the tissues and the eyes get more stimulation. That would explain why you get earlier growth from cut pieces that had healed over. Q. How many eyes to a piece? A. I would not pay any attention to that just so I had one. The thing of consequence is the size of the seed piece. Here is a seed piece with four eyes. The chances are when it is planted,- — re - gardless of the fact it has four eyes — probably only one will grow. It may produce three or four stems. Consequently the number of eye3 has practically no effect on the number of stems. It is the size of the seed piece that counts — the amount of reserve food stored up. Q. Does it make any difference which way you cut a potato — from the seed end down? A. If your potatoes are dormant, it does not matter. As a. matter of fact, then the seed piece from the stem end may be a trifle better than the others. If your potatoes have started to sprout, then the seed piece on the bud end will grow first and have the advantage. If planted in separate plots, the seed end piece will show up best. </seg>
            <seg id="p417">Nebraska State Horticultural Society ■ Q. Does the number of stems have to do with the yield? A. The more stems you have, the more potatoes you will have. You have just about so many potatoes from the standpoint of a par - ticular stem. The way to get more potatoes per acre — a greater num - ber—is to plant larger seed pieces or more seed pieces. Larger seed pieces are better. You- must have fertile soil and enough moisture to grow all those potatoes that will be set. While four-ounce seed pieces give profitable returns in California, where they raise 1,038 bushels per acre field of No. 1 potatoes, a four-ounce seed piece on a farm that has limited rainfall and especially hot weather in midsummer might be too much, because you might have more stems and more tubers set than the .plant could mature. As a general rule, the •smaller the seed piece the smaller the number of stems, but the larger the Individual tubers.. The larger the seed piece, the larger the number of stems, the larger the number of tubers, and the larger the yield of marketable tubers; but the smaller the size of the individual tubers. Q. Do you find any trouble in damaging your germination with the hot formaldehyde treatment? . A. If your potatoes have started to sprout, it will kill the sprouts that have started to grow. This, then, forces the growth of the other, eyes. If you wait a week or ten days the other sprouts will come along. Those treated with hot formaldehyde this year averaged 30 per cent behind the others, but we planted immediately after treating. Had we treated ten days in advance, it would not' have had that effect. The stand was good from all the plots. Q. We found the potatoes we treated were slower in coming up, but the stand eventually was just as good. One bunch covered with a blanket immediately after treatment for twenty-four hours was injured some. ■ A. If subjected to top hot temperatures, there will be damage done. ;'■-.' . . Q. Do you advise planting northern grown seed every year? A. That is a question I can hardly answer by "Yes" or "No." If your northern seed is free from disease and is grown down here where it does not become reinfected with disease, it will still produce a good yield. As a matter of fact, we have taken the same lot of clean disease-free seed and grown it at Union and some in high altitudes in the western part of the state, and at North Platte, and found the Union seed averaged as productive as the seed from the west. We had small plots carefully watched and the diseased plants taken out and our plots were also. isolated from other potatoes. Under those conditions one can grow good potatoes in eastern Nebraska. From the practical standpoint of the commercial grower, my recom - mendation would be to get new seed every year. Later on we might </seg>
            <seg id="p418">Report of Nebraska State Board or Agriculture perfect these methods. Some growers are successful using seed for quite a little while. Q. In Seward County for eighteen years we planted northern seed. Each year we planted a few rows of home-grown seed In the middle of the field. We figured we got 25 per cent more and better potatoes from the northern seed. A. Every time you planted home-grown seed, you Infected the northern-grown seed with disease. Q. Every year it had formaldehyde treatment. A. That does not touch the diseases I mentioned. If you want to grow seed potatoes, you must have them Isolated and take the diseased plants out, which requires technical knowledge, and it Is a question whether it would pay. Q. The ordinary farmer had better let it alone and buy his seed from the seed producing specialist. On motion, adjournment was declared until 9:30 A. M. Wednesday. WEDNESDAY MORNING SESSION JANUARY 5, 1927 The second session of the convention was called to order by Mr. Davidson at ten o'clock on Wednesday morning, January 5. CHAIRMAN DAVIDSON: I see the first thing on the program is the President's Address. Mr. Banning is not here and I do not think I can deliver that part of it. We will listen to a talk by Mr. Yates on "Growing Plums for the Local Trade." GROWING PLUMS FOR THE LOCAL TRADE ' MR. WM. YATES. Doniphan, Nebraska Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen: I feel quite an honor was con - ferred on me in asking me to address a bunch of fruit growers, because I am not a practical fruit grower myself — I have not been for very long, anyway. I live at Doniphan, between Hastings and Grand Island. People generally suppose we are out so far we do not know what fruit is. I used to live in Iowa and got acquainted with fruit. I put lu four years buying and packing and shipping apples. From there </seg>
            <seg id="p419">Nebraska State Horticultural Society I went to Doniphan and bought a farm with two small groves, of about two acres. One orchard was going to pieces and the other at its best. My uncle lived in Doniphan and had an orchard of three acres. He was quite a hand to set out trees. There are several orchard groves around there he has put out. He kept a day book and could tell you the age of every tree around there. He could pretty nearly tell without looking at his book. He got me interested in trees. We took care of those two orchards. They would net from $600 to $1200 a year in apples. Finally about live years ago, my uncle decided to retire, and 1 asked him if he would not put out an orchard for me. We would do the work. He laughed and did not say much, but in a short time he called up and said he had written to different nurseries and found where he could get the trees, and could help me with It. He decided on a nine-acre orchard. I had a high grove, on the north, and he said we would put it on the north side of the grove. That is where we laid off our plot. . We started to pick out our varieties of trees. We were going to put in 315 apple trees, and put in as fillers plums and cherries. We set our apple trees thirty-five feet apart either way, and plums and cherries between. It took us some time to decide on the varieties. We got 300 cherry trees— 100 Early Richmond and 200 Montmorency: On plums, my uncle said, "We will set out 300 Early Wild Goose, |and for the other 300 we will get- Early Wild Goose." He sent an order to Marshall Brothers. Mr. George Marshall called up and wanted to know if he knew what the Early Wild Goose plum was. My uncle said he thought so, as he had been growing them for forty years. Why he did not want to order anything else was a mystery to me, because he had other good varieties in his orchard. We finally decided we would get 150 Early Wild Goose and other varieties for the remainder. I was to go after these trees with a truck. We went to get the trees, and Mr. Marshall again talked against Early Wild Goose, so we only took fifty of them, and got other varieties instead. We took care of them for two years. These Early Wild Goose plums did not. get ripe until September, so that we were out of Early Wild Goose plums entirely. Mr. Marshall said he would replace them. After we had cultivated them for two years, I was glad to get that much out of It. He said he had ordered those trees from another nursery and threw' the hundred away; so he lost money on the deal, but he would give replacement on them. My uncle died a year ago last December and did not get to see this orchard produce very much: but he told me before he died he still believed we made a mistake in not putting out 300 Early Wild Goose plumB. The reason is this: the Early Wild Goose is a red plum" and one' of the earliest we have. It comes at a time people do not </seg>

Whenever your plums are ready at that time, they are an easy sell. You know it is not a very high quality plum. It cracks open when it gets rips and ripens unevenly. You must shake the trees and pick up the plums to harvest your crop. I have several different varieties of plums. My earliest plums are the Opata and the Sapa. These plums are early, but they are a fright to do anything with. They are not red. You must get a thing that appeals to a person's eye. In our country it is different, maybe, from other places. Most of you know what the Wolf River apple is. I have a lot of those trees and can sell the apples for seventy-five cents a bushel on account of the size, when a good deal better grade won't sell for fifty cents. It would probably be the last apple you would buy. In two years these plums began bearing. The Opata plums got ripe and I took them into town, but could not sell them. Next year I had quite a good many of this variety. I picked fifteen bushels one day and took them to Grand Island in a truck. We tried to sell them to the stores and could not. I had a few Early Wild Goose. They took the red ones but would not buy the others. I started peddling but could not get rid of the plums. They would take a peck sometimes. The Opata plum will not stand up so we could not take them home and get rid of them the next day. We started toward home and worked until dark. People were sitting on their porches and I stopped and asked if anybody was interested in plums. Finally someone said, "May I sep them?" I sold all I had on that street and did not have enough to fill the orders. So I found out they sold better after dark. i Laughter. ) 1 said to the ladies, "I will be back day after tomorrow." When I came back, the neighbors had tried them and had quite a number of orders for me. I do not have any trouble with the Sapa any more. I have cus - tomers who know them and will take all they can get. The meat Is the same color all the way through. There is kind of a raspberry flavor alter they are cooked. I told my wife I believed she could mix some sweet clover seed with them and have raspberry jam! I Laughter.) The Omaha plum is one of the best we have, but it is not red though and ripens too late. Everybody is plummed to death by the time this plum gets ripe. Two years ago my uncle had splendid Gold plums. Another neighbor I saw going into Grand Island with Gold plums about Sep - tember first. He could not sell them. That is the reason my undo told me I ought to have stuck to Early Wild Goose, because it was red and ripened early. When it gets late, you will find they have bought their fruit somewhere else. </seg>
            <seg id="p421">Nebraska State Horticultural Society Conditions are different with me than with a lot of the rest of you. We have the world beaten for growing fruit out where we are. You may think you live in a fruit country, but we are ahead of all of you. I drove my car to the Coast and back through Oregon and Idaho, and saw a lot of wonderful fruit growing, but we have them bested by a long ways. I was parked on the street in Portland and a fellow said, "You are quite a ways from home." "Yes, I am." "I am from South Dakota." "You have a fine climate here." "Yes; but when you have said that, you have said it all." I said, "We were quite taken up with the country around Portland and Salem. What objection to the country do you have? Can't you grow anything?" "Yes, we can grow anything. The trouble is getting rid of it after you grow it. I came in a year ago and bought a ten-acre fruit farm. I have the finest Gravenstine apples, but we get about 25 cents a box,- and the box costs 16 cents, and it takes 11 cents to pick and pack, and the papers.. I went down io see if I could not ship some to South Dakota: The freight is so much, I might make $100 on a car, but I am afraid to risk it.". Where we are we can grow the fruit, and likewise sell it at a profit. I live between two of the best towns in the United States, with a population of 15,000 each, so we have a ready market. There are graveled roads from either town to my place. • I have a number of other varieties of plums. We have the Wauneta plum. It is not as good a quality as some, but it is large, productive, and will command a better price than any of the others on account of its size. I have had trouble with my trees on account of their breaking off. Some one suggested I get them smaller and set them deeper. 1 put out forty and over one-half have blown down and broken off. I have an advantage I have not mentioned. You must not expect anyone can come out in that country anywhere and put out an orchard and be as lucky as I am, because I live on the Platte river. I have my trees on the river bottom. Last spring we had frosts late in the season: I always thought it frosted quicker on the.' bottom than on the highland. All around me their fruit frosted. They wanted to know what I did to keep mine from frosting. Being close to the river, the water flowing has a tendency to keep the air stirring, and it won't frost so quickly there. There is a man west of me with an apple orchard, and for twenty years he has never had his apples frosted because he is close to the river. </seg>
            <seg id="p422">Report ok Nebraska State Board of Agriculture If you put out a good orchard next to the river and take care of it right, you will get results. I cultivate these trees up to the middle of July and keep the weeds and grass down. I hoe around them where you can't cultivate. This last year we had a heavy crop, and with no one having fruit around us, we had a wonderful demand: I had 700 bushels of plums and got $2 a bushel, and the people picked them themselves. Discussion (Answers by Mr. Yates) Q. I did not hear about the Wauneta plum. A. I think it is one of the best we have. It is a deep red and the quality Is fine. It is red for a week before it is ripe. It will stand up for days after you pick it. It is earlier than some of the other plums. I have no trouble getting rid of them. I think as far as I have learned it is one of the best plums there is. Q. How does It bear for you? A. Year before last they were thin on the tree, but nice what there were. This year I cannot say as to the maturity because I was gone. The trees were as full as they coulQ hold, but a lot blighted by frost or something. I could shake the limb and a lot would fall off. It is a good hardy tree and stands up well. Q. About twenty-five years ago, when Wild Goose plums were planted more than now, I made some sterility tests on the Wild Goose and found the tree itself was absolutely sterile; so you would have to have it planted in with others. I think that is one reason back of Mr. Marshall's urging you not to plant so many in blocks. It must have other trees close enough so as to cross. A. We have some Wild Goose forty years old and still bearing, f President Banning took the chair at this time.) PRESIDENT BANNING: I am sorry I was not able to be here yesterday afternoon. Most of you will understand it is almost im - possible to organize a legislature without a few democrats. (Laughter.) You will notice I said a "few." So it was very essential I should be at the capHol yesterday to see they got properly organized and started off on the right foot. I am sure you will be relieved of one thing which you will appreciate. I arrived too late to give the President's address, and we will pass it for the present. I am sure these subjects taken up are very interesting to all of us. We who are engaged in the growing of fruit are deeply interested in every subject on this program. </seg>
            <seg id="p423">Nebbaska State Horticultural Society .1 am glad to see so many out this morning, because when you arrive from home and get into the bright lights, it is a harrowing job to get up early in the morning. I am sure we have all enjoyed the address of Mr. Yates, and his experiences in growing plums. The next subject will be "Problems of the Apple Growers . in the Missouri Valley and the Ozarks, by Mr. A. P. Boles, who is horti - cultural field man for the Missouri Pacific Railroad, at St. Louis. We are always glad (o get some assistance from the Missouri Pacific. PROBLEMS OF THE APPLE GROWERS IN THE MISSOURI VALLEY ATVD THE OZARKS MR. A. P. BOLES, Horticultural Fieldman, Missouri Pacific Railroad, St. Louis. Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: I surely appreciate the opportunity to get better acquainted with the fruit growers of Ne - braska, and I also appreciate very much the fact that Professor Wig - gans and Professor Hoppert have seen fit to suggest I appear on the program. I am a little bit surprised Professor Wiggans would be willing for me to come up here, due to the fact that we were In school together, and there are a great many things about Professor Wiggans T do not suppose he has told. I will be like the negro preacher in Texas. Before he was a preacher, they say this negro was one of the lawless element in Texas arid had a good many crimes to his credit; but he reformed and went into the ministry. He went, north and took charge of a colored church. One Sunday. evening he started to deliver a sermon when he noticed in the audience one of his old pals. He knew* if this pal "spilled the beans" it was all over with him. He did not know what to do. He thought and thought while the congregation was singing, and finally hit on a plan. He said, "Breddern an' Sistahs: Ah's gwin' to talk to you from a rather peculiar text, an 1 that is, 'If you knows me, say nothing, an' Ah will see you later.' " (Laughter.) So that will be my text this morning for the benefit of Pro - fessor Wiggans. • I hardly know just what points to emphasize in regard to the different problems. Personally, I have been in the orchard business ever since I was. big enough to have my father send me out to work in the orchard. This period of years covers my experience with the Missouri Board of Agriculture, of which I was Secretary at one time, as well as my work with the University of Arkansas and the University of Missouri, and see and study and become acquainted with the fruit </seg>
            <seg id="p424">REroRT of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture growers and the orchards of the Missouri Valley and of the Ozarks. I suppose you call this territory the Missouri valley. The industry to my mind, men. Is an industry which is funda - mentally sound. I think there has been too much discussion of what we call the "problems" of the industry. -There has not been enough discussion of its forward-looking features. We have in the Missouri valley and in the Ozarks successful fruit men — and by successful fruit liien I mean men who have mastered their problems — men to whom we can point as successes in their particular industry. At the present time — Pardon the personal reference — I happen to he connected with the Missouri Pacific Railroad. Our President, Mr. Baldwin, has shown himself to be a good business man In that he looks into the future; in that he has a large organization under Mr. J. T. Stinson working on agricultural problems, and looking into those prob - lems from a business standpoint. We are not Interested In simply promoting acreage, but in the fundamenetal. business problems that confront the farmer. I feel if I should take a few minutes of your time and tell you something of the stability of the fruit industry, it would give you an insight Into that great industry which possibly you may not have before. It may be when I tell you .some of these things, you will be somewhat like the old New Englander who listened to a speech by a noted astronomer on the many million miles it was to this and that star — so-called "facts" in astronomy. After the lecture he said, "Professor. I certainly did enjoy your talk on astronomy! I am In - clined to believe there is some truth in some of the things you have said." (Laughter.) I hope you will feet at least that kindly toward me when I get through talking of the fruit industry. I had the pleasure last evening of attending a banquet .of the Ozark Fruit Growers Association at Monette and appearing on the program. There were about five hundred of those fruit growers- in attendance at that banquet. There were men making their living out of the fruit industry, which has grown from a small beginning to an industry that ranges between five and six million dollars in that Ozark country. They are a set of men who have met problems that sometimes seem insurmountable. We have had to fight San Jose .scale when it looked as if there were nothing that would control it. Yet they have controlled it. It is not a real big factor in the pro - duction of apples in the Ozark country today; yet it threatened the industry a few years ago. The codling moth is a factor, it is true, and there are losses much too large from codling moth in the Ozark country and in the Missouri valley. But we have enough successful fruit growers — men who are </seg>
            <seg id="p425">Nebraska State Horticultural Society ■ controlling it; who are controlling the blotch and practically all of the insects and diseases- — to say our problems are so far those that can be solved. There has been a movement of fruit — of apples, for instance — in this good United States of over 100,000 cars. When you consider the volume and the value of it, certainly you know we have an industry which is worth all of our study and effort, and one which is supplying a cash income to. thousands of people. . . I am mighty glad to be a part of an organization that is helping to add that much more cash to the income of the farmers of the State of Nebraska through fruit growing, because I believe it Is a legitimate opportunity to add to the cash income of the farmers of your state. I can not go further without saying just a little bit about the extension service not only of your college, but of every college. I have not had an opportunity to get very well acquainted with Pro - fessor Hoppert except through Professor Wiggans, but I am sure you realize the opportunities which your college is giving you of getting, not Professor Hoppert's personal opinion, but giving you the informa-" tion that is available on fruit growing as a result of the study of the men here at the college, and the study of the successful fruit growers in your state and in others. I hope you will bear in mind when you get into the fruit business you will not be left to work these problems out by yourselves. You will have an opportunity to consult with men who can give you the information that you will need to make a success of fruit growing. ' You men are fortunate in that I did not prepare a formal talk. I want to talk to you about the things of interest to me, and I think they wilt be of interest to you. You wonder on what basis a man would be interested in planting an apple orchard and in marketing fruit. I think Professor Wiggans will bear, me out in this state that the growing of fruit is not so technical nor so specialized but that a man who isoperating a good, farm, who is growing live stock successfully, has the experience- and the brains and the opportunity to add some phase of fruit growing to his present system of farming. We of course appreciate very much the specialists — the man who hag '3.00 acres in one particular fruit. But when you look at the industry as a whole, you will find not every man of that type willing to finance a large fruit-growing proposition. Oftentimes they have problems that are not to be found with the small planter in connection with a farm. Professor Wiggans, I am sure, will bear me out when I say that in the days when we were in school we learned a great many things that we have had to unlearn. The development of fruit growing </seg>
            <seg id="p426">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture and the knowledge of it that have come about as the result of research and study and of careful observation of fruit growers have been re - markable. I can remember as far back as 1909 having a demonstration on pruning. I had been taught the open-head method in which we were to go in and cut all of the center out, having an inverted umbrella. I went into an orchard in the Ozarks and gave a demon - stration and pruned to my satisfaction. The owner let me have five trees. The rest of the trees the owner refused to prune. 1 had the pleasure of going back two years later and found all the trees I had pruned were dead, and the rest were doing well! (Laughter.) It is an experience of that kind that teaches us whether or we are on the right track. I think we can pay tribute to our friend, and one of the greatest men in horticulture in the United States, Professor Chandler, now in California, and can afford to give him a great deal of credit for the intensive study and research work he has done that has been such a big factor in changing our methods of pruning and bringing to light facts that years ago we did not have, because no one had worked them out. For an illustration: We were most of us raised on the Idea pruning was a stimulative process. We felt when we pruned a tree, we had done it a favor. Along came the close study made by a research man, and he shows us that pruning is not a stimulative process when the tree is taken as a whole. It has a local effect'. It stimulates the limbs that are left, and you get apparent stimulation. When you analyze the actual growth of the tree, you find when you take a limb from a growing tree you are taking from it a part of the tree's natural function. You are taking away a leaf area. Unless there is a reason, and a good compensating reason, for cutting that particular limb or limbs, then the advisable thing is not to cut. In the last few years there has been developed a system of prun - ing that is logical, sensible, and practical. I will not go into details, because you have men who know your conditions better than I do. Professors Wiggans and Hoppert can give you the details as applicable to local conditions better than I can. I want to call your attention to the fact that the business of fruit growing has had a wonderful change in its fundamental basis. It is a business which has succeeded in spite of all the problems. It is a business which has had the benefit of deep scientific research, which has meant dollars and cents to us in the business. In my own orchard in the Ozarks, I had a difficult problem with scale. I had the pleasure of having one of the United States Department men come to my orchard and develop the first oil emulsion spray for San Josa scale. That was a wonderful development in the progress of scale control. </seg>
            <seg id="p427">•Nkdraska State H6rtici:i.tubal Society When you realize that these problems we are discussing are problems that can be solved and that have been solved and are being solved every day by men in the same business in which we are en - gaged, then there is certainly encouragement to increase your planting of fruit on your Nebraska farms. Just what fruit you should plant or where or when you should plant it, I think is your problem. You will need to get the advice and assistance of not only the men at thfi college here, but of those who have succeeded in each community. I do not want to get started bragging, because some people asso - ciate bragging with lying. (Laughter.) We have men in the Missouri valley country who are succeeding with apple growing In a way we can brag about and tell the truth. They are keen business men, but no better than you here; because I say a man who can succeed on ■the farm today is a keen business man. Those who are not are quitting. The United States figures, which give 500,000 families leaving farms for the cities, are startling, but it is a natural, logical "survival of the fittest." • • In regard to the particular problems of interest to you, I want to say the problems are mostly production problems In that particular sense. I understand you have some problems in marketing. I have been interested in marketing for a good many years. I have had to be. At one time I was manager of the New York store of the American Fruit Growers for two years. I have come to the conclusion the problems of marketing can be solved just as well as the problems of production. When you go into our markets and find the predominance of western-grown fruits, and at the same time a predominance of feeling among the people who buy them that our home-grown fruit tastes better and they would rather have it, but can not get it, then I say we have a situation that looks encouraging. . ; . This fall in the Waverly section, which is fifty miles east of Kan - sas. City on the Missouri River, we had a light, but a good, crop of apples. There were several good crops of Delicious. I have had to change a little bit on the Delicious. I used to say it was an apple we should fight shy of. I have been guilty of that because of some of the things the Delicious has that are undesirable. When you analyze the. years, of experience with the Delicious, you will find the Delicious apple in the section with which I am familiar is one of the standard varieties. I think it will be for a number of years. I am not advocating packing everything in boxes. I have always felt from a marketing standpoint that the man who markets his apples should market on the basis of the demands of the market which he is supplying, whether in bulk or barrels or boxes or baskets or what - ever it may be. I can not lay down any laws as to what you should pack your apples in to get the most money. That depends on the condition in the markets where you are selling this fruit. </seg>
            <seg id="p428">IlKPORT i&gt;K NlKltvsKA SXATl: BOAItll OF Ac.HHTI.TritE Mr. Jurdon, one of our best growers at Waverly, had about a carload of Delicious. I suggested hp try boxing a few, Her packing and wrapping with oiled wraps. 1 got the boxes for him. We could not get a box in Kansas City of standard western make. We had 200 of these standard boxes and packed in standard fashion, sizing and wrapping, following the standards that are forced upon us by the competition of the west; and put them onto the Kansas City market. To my surprise, that market took them readily at about 25 cents under the extra fancy price for western Delicious, which I considered a very satisfactory basis for selling our Delicious apples. They brought around $3.25. That does not mean every box of Delicious you can pack will bring $3.25. I never will discuss price, because if there is any one thing that fluctuates it is the price of fruit. I give this one particular illustra - tion because it points to the fact our people in St. Louis and Kansas City and Omaha and. Lincoln are just loyal enough to their own state they can recognize the high quality of your home-grown apples and other fruit over the quality of this nicely packed, well colored western fruit. They are anxious for you to put on the market apples of the type they can buy, and are perfectly satisfied to buy them 25 cents under western stuff, and so are we. 1 want to bring out a thought brought out by Mr. Yates. When he talked about the price of apples, you did not hear him talk about $2.50 and $3.00 a bushel. He talked about selling from 75 cents to $1.50. When we can sell our apples to the home folks at a reason - able price and a price that moves the fruit, then you are placing your fruit in the hands of the consumer at a figure at which he can use quantities of it. That is what we must do to move large quantities of fruit. The news stand and the peddler and that type of vendors are not going to be such a big factor in the handling of 100,000 cars of apples that move in the United States. I think we have put too much emphasis on the value of a few red apples selling at ten or fifteen cents each. The marketing of your fruit is of vital interest to you. I have no advice that will tell you just how to sell every apple and plum and peach at the top of the market. We can always say when a man gives the consumer value, he is going to be able to sell his stuff. When a man like Mr. Yates goes to the consumer with his product and sells it at a reasonable figure, in the daylight, then our marketing problems are in a way to be solved. I do not know about this night selling Mr. Yates mentioned. (Laughter.) I had a Title experience in southeastern Missouri with a man grow - ing some high-class Delicious and other good varieties. He said, "I have a crop of a thousand bushels of apples, and no market for them. They are moving slowly." </seg>
            <seg id="p429">Nebraska State Horticultural Society "What are you doing with them?" "I have peddled a few out." "What are you getting?" I "The price is very low — only $2.50 a bushel." He was riot playing fair with the consumer. He was selling a few bushels to some one not familiar with market conditions and get - ting rid of a few' of his apples. He was a good friend, and I said this: ''You have 1,000 bushelsj and have sold 300, and will have 400 bushels rot. Who is to blame? I think you are. You are in the industrial section where they have factories, and at a railroad division point. You can sell every apple you have if you put your price down to a figure at which the stuff will move. Maybe it is $1.25 or $1.50. You' have over-priced your fruit and will suffer more by the rots you throw away than you would iE you would take this supply and find what the market would pay and consume them. There is no advan - tage for you to let 4 00 bush sis rot in order to get a little higher price for the balance. It is the consumption of our fruit we want. When people do not consume them, they buy the Del Monte brand of apples." . . • . If I can leave anything. fiat will be worth while, it will be the thought that in order to buili your industry you should, apply the business principles that apply in the handling of any manufactured product; that you have to sel it on the basis of the price to which it will be moved, and at which people will continue to use your apples and other fruit products. It may be I am not discu ssing the problems of the fruit grower, but your marketing problem s worthy of attention. You can well bear in mind there Is a distinct demand for our home-grown stuff, and we are responsible for the fostering- of that. Those of us who are growing fruit have a duty placed upon us to make people believe and know — because it is. true-j-tliat our home-grown fruit is the kind for them to use, and our home-grown apples have a little better taste than those grown . in the Weiiatchee valley. For the production of quality apples and red apples,] I do not know of any place where you can produce any better. When you analyze the actual demand for taste, there is a wonderful field for selling your Nebraska-grown apples — even Ben Davis— in preference to western apples that are getting so plentiful. Recently we ran a "Missouri Pacific Apple Special." We had apples from twenty-one of our successful growers. I had those apples sent into storage in Kansas City as harvested. We kept them until the first part of December, ard then I took them out and sized and oiled and repacked them and put them in this special car. We started at Kansas City and went down to St. Louis and showed that car of </seg>
            <seg id="p430">Repokt of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Missouri apples to thousands of people. We had meetings along the line. We had with us a representative of the University of Missouri, one from the State Horticultural Society, and one from the State Board of Agriculture. After people went through the apple car, we would have them go into our lecture car, and tell those folks they had apples with the quality they wanted right at home; when they wanted apples, to be sure to get Missouri apples. We answered the question as to whether apples could be grown successfully in Missouri because of the fact that twenty-one of our orchard men — men operating large farms in connection with their orchards — were willing to send in the apples for the reason that they were interested in showing the other farmers In the Missouri valley that apple growing had been successful with them. They wanted to see others get into that business, realiz - ing a larger production of apples in that territory meant more money for them. Rather than taking the market away in the Missouri valley, where we have 300 cars, they realized the production of 3,000 cars would give a better market for our Missouri valley apples. The display of apples answered the question quickly. When the men went into the car and saw the standard varieties displayed in quantity and compared them with what he could see in tlje grocery store, we did not have to. make a speech. They were satisfied, Miss - ouri could grow wonderful apples, and that if they could get apples like that, they would much prefer to buy them than the western tier - packed, oil-wrapped, beautifully colored, extra fancy Jonathans or Delicious. We had one of our growers say he sold 47 cars of apples. They had averaged 75 cents a bushel. He stated in his talk he had made money at that price; that he had gotten everything out of them the market would pay. He sold some in bulk; others in barrels and boxes. That is simply the freight from Washington and Oregon to Kansas City. He said before audience after audience: "If I can con - tinue to grow apples in the quantity I have grown in my orchard of one hundred acres and get 75 cents a bushel, I •will be tickled to death, because it has been a profitable enterprise for me this past year, and I can show you my books to prove it." I am not telling you what I think about the apple business, but trying to give you the facts that are outstanding, and to tell you what the successful orchard man is doing. I have reached the age where I am willing to give the man credit for succeeding. I am willing to admit the College of Agriculture, which I know something about, due to my connection with it, is watching the man who is succeeding, and the methods which the College works out experimentally must first be successful in a practical way before it will send an extension man to talk to you about these methods. </seg>
            <seg id="p431">■■•■./■ . . . NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY After all is said and done', when you can find a man who is succeeding with his production and marketing of fruit, then you have a man who is worth watching; .who is worth studying, and you will be' able to get from him opinions and practices that arp just exactly the same you would get from some one connected with the University or from the Railroad,. because the same facts are available to all. We are trying to bring them to the farmer in this particular territory so that he can decide for himself whether he wants to go into the fruit business. Let him make the decision. This old idea in which a man is supposed to tell the farmer how to farm has gone long ago. We never have had a man smart enough to do that. But we have men who give their time to a study of the fundamental prin - ciples and methods and practices, and carry the information from one farmer to another, and from jthe College to the farm. Our Railroad has had a part in that. Mr. Meyer, the director of extension, got up in our towns and told the people: "I am riot here because I like the Missouri Pacific; or because I know Boles; but I am here because these folks' are giving the farmers the facts." That was the most complimentary thing I could have asked him to say. I want to bring out the point first that the College of Agri - culture and the railroads and the agencies big enough to have no ulterior motive in trying to sell you something or direct your affairs, but merely the motive of helping you, are not bringing personal opin - ions, but facts and figures that you need in the study of your partic - ular industry. In regard to blotch and codling moth, I know you can solve those problems. I know we Can control codling moth and curculio and blotch in central Missouri. Professor Wlggans knows it. I know conditions are not so materially different in Missouri from those in Nebraska. We have had so many demonstrations that would be impos - sible for me to tell you this morning of all the orchards where the College and the Railroad, working together, have gone into a section, and taken orchards covered with blotch and practically cleaned it up. Mr. Connett, at St. Joseph, had a lot of Duchess apples 90 per cent blotch. We. went m and with the use of Bordeau mixture at the right time, we cleaned up the blotch in that orchard. We have gone into orchard's literally eaten up with curculio and blotch. In Mr. Crisman's orchard at Waverly we had to cut down a few Greenings. Where a few years ago he lost the entire crop from curculio and blotch and a great many apples stung with codling moth, that orchard was practically clean -in 1926. His crop was not one I could brag about, but the improvement was so great his neighbors said, "How did you do it?" He said, "I simply did it by following the practices and methods that I learned were successful, and by studying the orchard business </seg>

I have not said exactly what I had in mind, but what I wanted to say. The question of the problems of the apple growers is one that can be met by you. When you set out an orchard, if yxm will bear in mind those problems have been solved and you can solve them as readily as the man who is now solving them, I think that attitude of mind will bp a great deal of help. Study out the details as you need them. I want to leave the thought, that fruit growing is an industry that has been stabilized. It is an industry that is fundamentally sound; and that when you go into the business of growing fruit, you are going into a business that has in it a great many successful, com - petent business farmers; and there is a great opportunity for the man ""■ woman who is willing to use the same thought and care and busi - ness judgment in handling an apple orchard he shows in the. handling of a dairy cow or poultry or hogs or cattle.

PRESIDENT BANNING: I am sure Mr. Boles has given us an interesting talk and one that is very beneficial. We are very glad to have him with us. We are going to vary the program a little bit. At this time we ■will take up the business meeting and dispose of that, and after that we will continue our papers and discussions. First will be the report of tho Secretary. RKPORT OF SRCnKTARY E. H. HOI'PERT. Secretary. Agricultural College As to the activities of the Society Tor 1926, we had talks by W. R. Martin of Kansas and Fred Merrill of Missouri. As a result, we had a meeting afterward and resolved to ask the Extension Ser - vice for a similar service in western Nebraska, which has been carried out during the past year, although not quite as thoroughly as we should like to have done. It was successful in getting the growers to spray earlier than customary. Then I shall mention the trip of the Secretary through the Pacific Northwest; which I will report in some detail tomorrow morning. At the State Fair this last fall we sponsored a Flower Exhibit. I am sure those present will agree we had a successful Flower Show hy amateurs. </seg>
            <seg id="p433">Nebraska State Horticultural Socikty I suppose some of you have read of the success of the exhibit at Des Moines. We got first place. There were not very many show - ing, however. We got $150 ;as first prize, and a lovely blue ribbon. The So.ciety sponsored an exhibit at Chadron which was a variety show largely, and a tray exhibit advertising eastern Nebraska apples, as well as some of the varieties which are recommended for western Mebraska. . Western Nebraska Organized Agriculture is on its -feet now. The first meeting was held at Chadron, and the next will be held at another point in western Nebraska. ■ IThey have asked the Board of Agricul - ture that money be appropriated to carry on this particular set of meetings. It has always been felt the western people were interested in that sort of thing, but because of the fact the distance is so great, very few would come to Lincoln; and so we decided — and by "we" I mean a number of different organizations interested, like the live - stock men, and crop growers and potato growers and the poultry - men — that meetings will be held along the same lines held in eastern Nebraska at Lincoln. ■ I think next year will include Home Econom - ics work. I suppose we, will again give them our support. We secured one speaker from Hot Springs to discuss fruit growing in western Nebraska from practical experience. The annual report is ready, and those anxious to see it may have a copy at the present time. ' 1 should like to call your attention to the value of the Codling Moth paper by Mr. Martin. I think all who have large orchards should read it over before you start your spraying. Election of Officers The following officers and directors were then nominated and each' in turn was elected unanimously, by acclamation: For President, J.' It. Davidson, of Aurora. For First "Vice President, Guy Shubert, of Shubert. For Second Vice President, H. R. Henderson, of Omaha. For Director (three years), George Christy, of Johnson. For Treasurer, Frank Shubert, of Shubert. This concluded the business session. PRESIDENT BANNING: We know the worst enemy we have is" the codling moth. At this i time we will have a talk on "Fighting the Codling Moth in 1926," by Mr. Coe of the Agricultural College. </seg>
            <seg id="p434">RkI-OHT OK NhitRAMKA STATE BOAtlD OF AOIUCITT.TUBK KICiHTl.VGI THE CODLING MOTH IN 1920 F. M. COE, Agricultural College, Lincoln, Nebr. President Banning and Friends: I do- not know whether I can say all I want to say about the pesky apple worm, and have you say all you want to, in the time that is left; but I shall try to carry through thp subject and review briefly for you some of the work we have done this summer and some that has been done in other parts of the country. The subject of control for codling moth is always timely to a group of fruit growers of southeastern Nebraska, for two reasons: first, spraying for its control is the most expensive and frequently the least satisfactory of any of our orchard operations; second, in the last two years we have been inflicted with a particularly bad infestation of codling moth. It seems to have bred freely during the hot, dry summers we have had the last two years, and there are many orchards in which the moth was not controlled as much as it should have been, or as we would like to have seen it. In some orchards of the state, from one-third to one-half of the fruit has been stung or wormy from the codling moth, in spite of the application of the customary orchard sprays that have been used in the past. The Missouri valley is not the only region in which this pest has bothered the growers. Even in the northwest, with advanced technique and fine spraying machinery with high pressure, and expert advice in timing their sprays, in 1922 and two years ago in 1925, they had severe codling moth outbreaks. In a number of orchards, in spite of six or seven sprays, they had 25 per cent stings. So we are not the only sufferers, but we do have a big moth problem. I want to go back and review a little of the history of moth control. It was news to me when I found that before 1841 the growers of apples were attempting to control codling moth by picking off the apples and destroying them. After that it was found if you put a band around the trunk of the tree, the mature larvae would, congre - gate under the band and you could kill them that way. In 1890, spraying came into general use, and the methods of banding and killing the larvae and picking and destroying the apples were for - gotten and passed into disuae. For the benefit of these who may not be familiar with our usual spray practice, I should like to say our ordinary spray method of controlling the codling moth consists of the application of three or four sprays. This schedule, listed as "One per brood" on the chart has been the principal one used in the past. When four sprays are used, this schedule begins with a pink spray before blossoming for curculio and scab. The first spray for the codling moth is at petal- </seg>
            <seg id="p435">Nebraska State Horticultural Society fall time before the calyxes have closed. The next spray is put on two or three weeks after the petals had fallen. At that time the moths are laying their eggs and they are hatching. The fourth spray has been recommended for the middle of July. That has been the usual control method in most of the orchards. Some growers have left off the first spray, using what we might call the minimum sched - ule. A good many commercial growers have added later sprays, and. perhaps some earlier ones. Of late years this schedule' has not given as good control as we . need, especially in some of the older orchards where the trees are large and harder to spray well. So the question comes up how we are going to vary this older schedule in order to get better control with the ' minimum number of sprays and at a minimum expense? Shall we .spray more times? If so, at what times? Shall we increase the amount of lead arsenatc or use a spreader, and will it help if we do? Such questions come up and are to be answered. Because of this poor control, the College of Agriculture was asked to interest itself in this problem and help the growers solve It. The extension service, in response to this request, has instituted this spray service which has been mentioned by Professor Hoppert. It consists essentially of watching these moths and studying their emergence and the time they lay their eggs, and warning the growers when to put on the cover sprays so as to be the most effective. In order to do this, we have established a number of observation stations with small moth cages — ordinary fly traps — and in each of them put one hundred moth larvae in early spring. In the- springtime we observed those as fully as we could, to find out when the moths emerged. We had one at Florence, one at Nebraska City, one at Shubert, and one at Rulo. By using this data in connection with the temperature we can tell when the first brood would hatch. Perhaps I may refresh your memory on the life cycle of the codling moth. It winters over as a grub or larvae in a cocoon on the trunk of the tree. About' blossoming time it changes into a pupa, and about ten days afterwards usually it changes into the moth, emerges and begins to lay its eggs. The moths are particularly sen - sitive to cold. They must get "warmed up to the idea" before they lay eggs. It has been found they won"t lay unless the temperature is 60° F., and eight o'clock at night .is the time this temperature is usually recorded. The number of eggs laid depends on how much warmer than 60° it is, and how many moths there are in the orchard. This year' the moths came -out early. The eggs were due to hatch about the 25th of May, which is a week earlier than the usual time for them to emerge. We sent out a spray letter warning the growers to apply their first cover spray at that time. • ■'• Q. What stage was the blossom at that time? </seg>
            <seg id="p436">Rkport of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture A. They were pretty fair sized little apples. The blossoms had entirely gone. The blossoming was over before the calyx spray was put on. The calyx spray is put on at that time because the calyxes close up soon. If you do not get the poison in them before they close, you never will. It has been found that a good many worms try to enter through the calyx. The older works give the percentage as high as 807,. We found mature worms leaving the apples about. June 16th. We had every evidence in the way of apples which the worms had left that the second brood would be early, too. The temperatures had been extremely favorable for egg laying after the moths had emerged. We calculated that the earliest moths of the second brood would lay eggs, and they would begin to hatch about July 4th, which is twelve to fourteen days earlier than the usual recommendation of spraying, July 15th. Notices were sent to spray at that time for the second brood. Another interesting thing we found out by cutting wormy apples in late June, was that tiny worms were still entering the apples even after some of the earlier mature worms had left, .showing that the hatching time of the first brood overlaps that of the second brood. As a result we have worms hatching and attempting to enter the apples continually until cold weather. It seems necessary then to keep the apples well covered with poison during all that time, in order to protect them. That explains why it is we do not get as good control as we feel we ought by putting on one spray for the first and one for the second. This period of six weeks from May 25th until July 4th is too long for one application of arsenate to protect the apples. Hard rains and the normal growth of the apples soon decrease the effectiveness of the one application. Next year it is hoped to better this spray service. I think Mr Hoppert plans to send the letters direct from the station, so that they will reach the growers in plenty of time. As to the experimental side of it: We took a block of 12-year-old trees near Shubert and laid it into rows which we sprayed according to different schedules and methods. This chart illustrates the results. I Fig. I.) I want to emphasize two things about this experiment The first Is that the results from this experiment apply in detail only to the particular conditions under which thfe experiment was per - formed. In other words, the conclusions drawn from this are not applicable to every orchard in the state, but only to orchards having the same degree of infestation and weather conditions this orchard nan this year. All or (he plots were sprayed the same for the first three sprays They had the pink spray and the calyx spray, and the first cover </seg>
            <seg id="p437">■ . ■ ■ ■ • Nkiiuaska Statk Horticultural Sociov spray at the time our moths came out and laid their eggs. After (hat we varied the limes and applications. The first row we sprayed every two weeks following the first cover spray. That took nine sprays. The second row we sprayed every three weeks. The third row we sprayed every four weeks after the first cover spray. The fourth row we sprayed according to the old schedule which has been used quite a little, of one spray per brood. The fifth row we sprayed according to our two-per-brood pro - gram, which differs from the 'one-per-brood' . schedule by the. addition of a second cover spray three weeks after the first, a similar addi - tional cover for the second brood, and one in August for the third brood, when this occurs. We used in this work standard lead arsenate without a spreader, in the proportion of one and one-half pounds to fifty gallons. We used rods for early sprays, and later we used guns, getting good pressure and trying to do as good a job as possible, covering the tree3 thoroughly. . On this chart (Fig. 2) we have the results of the first brood damage as expressed in wormy apples per thousand apples. They are not very big figures, but the most significant we obtained because of the enormous power of the codling moth to increase its numbers when given a start. Suppose we started in the spring with 100 codling moth worms, and one-half were females, we would have fifty pairs. These moths have been found to lay as many as 200 eggs apiece, each of which can hatch into a worm and make a wormy apple. Moths laying from 50 to 100 eggs are not uncommon. If they averaged, only 10 eggs apiece, we would have 500 worms in the second brood. If we have a third brood as in hot, dry years, add another cipher and it is a large figure. That is why these figures are significant. While it is the second and third broods that do the damage, their numbers are directly proportional to the number of first brood worms that escaped poisoning. Notice the unsprayed trees with 31 wormy apples per 1000 in the first brood. In contrast where cover sprays were applied every two weeks, we had a very small number of worms that entered the apples, only one apple out of 3,000 being infested. Where cover sprays were applied every three weeks, there was a larger number (1.4 apples per 1,0.00), and every four weeks a still larger number (2.2 per 1,000). The more frequently we sprayed, the fewer worms we got in the first brood. A one spray per brood program gave 4 worms per thous - and; and a two per brood gave only one-tenth as many. </seg>
            <seg id="p438">I!i:i'&lt;iki 01 Nkiik.vska Kt.vtk Boaiii) of AcMcm/riHK Hows one and two had the most severe test, because the infes - tation was heavier, as they were exposed to moths flying across the road from an older orchard. So we felt considering that fact, the results are even better than the chart can show. This chart ( Fin. 3 ) shows the final results from checking over the 98,000 apples in the plats at picking time. In red are the wormy apples p&lt; r hundred, and in blue the stung apples — codling moth sting. That is an injury that comt-s as a result of late brood damage. The worms die and leave a puncture. That decreases the value of the apple. The live worms show the same relation to the spray we would expect from seeing tlie former chart. Where sprays were put on frequently, there were fewer live worms. Even with sprays every two weeks, we got 7.fi stung apples because we had so many worms to begin with. Coining to ihe orchard with not so many'worms to begin with, using ordinary lead arsenate with a three weeks' schedule, we find only 0.46 wormy apples and 3.6 stings, out of 100 apples. I could not g.-t paper wide enough to show the chart giving results of unsprayed trees. We got 36.7% live worms and 17.5% stings, making a total of nearly ha'/ r injury in these unsprayed trees, even with the worms picked off as well as we could before the mature larvae left the apples so they could pupate for the second brood. Since these were picked off and destroyed the late worms came from moths bred on sprayed trees. We may rest assured that this figure would have been much higher ir the moths had been allowed to breedundis - turbed on these unsprayed trees. What sort of conclusions will we draw on this test as to tha number of sprays necessary? In an ordinary year, six sprays would do just as well as seven sprays did this year. We could leave off the August spray for the third brood. Did it pay us to put on the three extra sprays in this two-per - brood schedule? Where we put an extra cover spray for each brood, we cut down the number of live worms better than 3 per cent, and the number of stings better than 8 per cent, or a total difference in control of something like 11 per cent. It did pay. I figure the cost of spraying to be about $3.25 per acre of 60 trees for that sized treea for each application. Those three applications then, cost us ?9..75 extra. At that rate the orchardist could afford to put on the three sprays and pay for them, and have about $15 left over from the sale of the additional apples saved, figuring the production around 125 bushels per acre. I am convinced the difference in control will more than pay for those three extra sprays; and in another year with only two extra sprays it would probably pay better. Q. What effect will it have on the apples? Will it be found necesary to wipe to get rid of the arsenate? The four sprays might </seg>
            <seg id="p439">• Nkdranka State Houticultuhai. Socicty pass the inspection, while the three additional sprays might force us to wipe them. A. There may be something in that. If you use a spreader, it won't stay on as badly. We recommend a spreader in the late sprays. For this orchard and degree of infestation, my conclusions would be this two-per-brood program would be the most profitable spray schedule. In orchards where there were not as many worms, you might use a schedule with fewer sprays. That is a problem every grower must figure out for himself from his knowledge of the orchard and the worms he has had in previous years. The tests of spray materials, dosages and methods did not give as large differences in control as we had expected, i Rows 6 and 7, sprayed with lead arsenate to which a casein spreade^ had been added, may be compared to rows 5 and 8 on either side. While the spreader gave an' even film over the leaves and fruit and made possible a better looking job, it did not give better control than the lead arsenate with - out the spreader, and so did not justify the increased expense. Row 9 was double-sprayed, that is was sprayed again after the first coating had dried. Contrary to expectations this plat was no better, if as- good, as Its neighbors. Row 10 was sprayed with a heavy dosage of lead arsenate — 6 Ib3. to 50 gallons. While this plot gave the best control of all, it was only slightly better than rows sprayed with 1% pounds to 50 gallons, and so was not practical in this case. 'Colloidal lead arsenate' a new preparation introduced by the Corona Chemical people, was used on row 11 with fairly satisfactory results. I understand, however, that it has been withdrawn from the market because of expense of manufacture and unsatisfactory results elsewhere. This preparation comes as a paste, and is used at the low ' dilution of one-half pound to 50 gallons. It was claimed by the intro - ducers to be ten times as poisonous as lead arsenate. . As far as these tests were concerned, ordinary lead arsenate at the rate of 1% pounds to 50 gallons was the most practical material because it was the cheapest and gave practically as good control as the more expensive materials and methods: However, in an orchard with a much more severe infestation of codling moth, a heavier dosage — say 4 pounds to 50 gallons with possibly a spreader, might give enough better control to pay. Some of you have heard of an oil preparation called "Volck," which is claimed to be very effective as a killer of codling moth eggs. We tested it on a number of Delicious trees at Lincoln, using 1%% every two weeks, beginning with the first cover spray. No lead arsen - ate was used with it. While this material may have some value in control, it was far inferior to arsenate of lead. In fact so many wormy </seg>
            <seg id="p440">Rkiiikt &lt;&gt;k Nkiihaska State Board ok Agriculture apples became apparent in July thai the apples were picked rather than allow (he moths to spread. The company which sells this mater - ial claims excellent results when mixed with lead arsenate but I would recommend using it only in a small experimental way until we know more about it. A tendency of this oil spray to russet the fruit was also noted. I want to speak for a short time on some work done by Dr Smith at the California station, who has been working on this problem of codling moth in a logical and valuable way. He took apples in Augus' and hung them up above a saucer and sprayed them with different dosages of lead arsenate. Then he took twenty-five recently hatched Jarvae and put on each apple and counted the number that went in He got startling results. With the fine mist type of spray, he got 60 per cent larvae entering the apples unharmed. With the coarse coverage and over-spray coverage, he got 33 per cent worms entering those apples unharmed. Where he used 16 pounds of lead arsenate to 100 gallons, uiing a spreader, he got 2 per cent larvae entering the apples unharmed; and 0 per cent where he did not use a spreader. So he came to the conclusion that August sprays were low in efficiency. He makes the statement that spraying is capable of giving only partial control of the codling moth; that it does not make any difference how much spray you put on, some will get through He says two or three out of five worms were prevented from entering the apples by late sprays. He says a good many worms enter between the drops of the spray; even inside the drop, if the layer of lead is thin, lots will get through anyway. They do not really eat the particles they chew off. They cast them aside and make a little pile with them. Fortunately for us they occasionally swallow a few; also pick up the lead on their feet and that is what kills them as much as the lead they swallow. Q. Why won't dust got the worms better than liquid? A. It might if it would stick on as well. Some tests have shown good control with dusting. His other conclusions are that the mist type of coverage is very Ineffective. He finds coarse coverage, where foliage and fruit are covered with large blotches of lead, has the same effectiveness as the over-spray coverage. So it is possible to spray thoroughly and not run the risk of missing any parts. Put on plenty of spray, because if it runs together it will give just as good control. Using the spreader he found the film coverage where the lead makes a uniform film- Betting it by using a caselnate spreader^gave the same control as coarse coverage, with ordinary low dosage of lead arsenate Where you increase the amount of lead so as to get a thicker film, the spreader gave better control. The trouble with the spreader with the small </seg>
            <seg id="p441">Nebraska State Horticultural Society amount of lead is it thins the film. Doubling the amount of poison increases the effectiveness of the spray about 10 per cent. Contrary to the old notion that it does not do any good to use stronger lead arsenate than two pounds to one hundred gallons, where you use more poison, you have more worms killed. Put on this heavy . dosage when worms, are bad. It you had 500 wormy apples per tree and saved 10 per cent, it would pay for the extra lead. If you had only 10 wormy apples per tree, and by doubling the strength you could save 10 per cent more, you would only save two apples to the tree, which would not pay. . It comes back to the proposition of ad - justing the number of sprays and the amount of lead used to the con - ditions that are peculiar to your orchard. Dr. Smith found the sprays for the first brood were more effective and efficient than the late sprays.. He tried a little experiment in which he used apples on the twigs. With some he sprayed the apples and did not spray the leaves. With others he sprayed the leaves and not the apples. He put a large number of moths larvae on the different groups and counted the number that gained entrance into the apples. He found on the ones where they did not spray, only about one-half the worms got to the apples anyway. On the ones where he sprayed the leaves and not the apples, he killed practically as many worms as where he sprayed the apples and not the leaves. He reached the conclusion it is desirable to cover the leaves and bark and every part of the tree where the Worms will crawl before they reach the apple, and suggests that you kill as many worms by spraying the leaves as by covering the apple. That is a point worth considering. Q. Did he figure the lead the.. moth got on its feet killed it? A. I believe, that is true. I do not know enough about the phy - siology of the insect to know how it works. Most of these insects "do not have bronchial tubes and lungs like an animal, but breathe through trachea in the posterior part, and it is possible to absorb the poison that way. Q. That baby moth likes clean feet and licks the poison. off. (Laughter.) Q. Wouldn't there be a possibility of using something stronger, if that is true? A. When you get something corrosive in action, you will burn your leaves. It is necessary to get something that does not break down in .order to prevent damage with your spray. Dr. Smith found when you shake the apples after covering them, you lose one-half the' poison; so it does not pay to spray trees in windy weather because you get less poison on them. He got twice as many worms entering the apples on those trees he shook as on the ones he allowed to remain quiet. </seg>

By working out the program in proportion to the infestation and the weather during each season, I am sure we can cut down the damage from codling moth to a point where it will not make serious inroads on our profits. Q. What is the comparison between spray rods and spray guns in efficiency? A. It is generally considered with ordinary arsenate of lead, an ordinary laborer will do a better job with a rod than, a gun. But an expert spray man, or a careful grower doing the work himself, can do a good job with a spray gun carefully operated at high pres - sure, and get over the ground faster, with a resultant higher efficiency in his work. (Applause.) Adjournment was then declared until 1:30 p. m. WEDNESDAY AFrERNOON SESSION January 5, 1927 The third session of the convention was a joint meeting with the Nebraska Nurserymen's Association. It was called to order at 1:35 p. m., Wednesday, January 5th, by President Banning. PRESIDENT BANNING: I am glad to see some new recruits. I do not know whether or not to give the nurserymen credit for the n?w recruits we have with us this afternoon. We will listen to an address on Perennials, illustrated with lan - tern slides, to be delivered by Professor Volz, of Iowa. I'KKKN.MALS — THEIR USE ON THE HOME GKOliXDS PROFESSOR E. C. VOLZ Agricultural College, Ames, Iowa Mr. President, Members of the Society, and Friends: If we have much more of this beautiful weather, we will soon be able to go Into the gardens and talk about these perennials. You may wonder where I got these violets. They are not grown in Nebraska gardens. They came from a glass house. </seg>
            <seg id="p445">Nebraska State Hortiooltubai. Society . Th » subject of Perennials lias attracted considerable attention during the last ten years. Those who grow ornamental stock will bear me out in saying the demand Has increased within the last few years. 1 think we are becoming more sensible in the way we are growing flowers. There was a period twenty-five years ago when the flower garden consisted of a aeries of plants, mostly exotics, with no bearing on the general landscape effect. I wish to cast no aspersion on tropical Plants in their proper location, but I believe if we will go largely toward the hardy perennial line, we will have more satisfactory results and be able to work out more pleasing combinations. I have a set of slides, and mimeographed sheets of the material given in the talk, making it easier for you to follow the remarks and the pictures. In. case you are interested in the material, you will have some way of connecting it up with the talk. You will notice the list gives the scientific name which is necessary for the profession - for the benefit of those who do not like Latin, they may use the English name in the second column. The third column on these sheets gives the color of the plant and its height. The list is arranged according to season. I h ave selected from our experimental garden at (he Iowa State College fifty perennials. There are three exceptions to this list I will comment on, which will not do well in your location here; at least, they are not as successful as I had hoped they would be in Iowa. In using a list of this kind, we would suggest if your pocket - book limits you to twelve varieties, not to take all from one group Select from the spring, the early summer, the late summer, and by all means some that bloom in the fall. I think it is a fair criticism to say many of our home gardens have consisted entirely of spring and early summer flowers. We have too little that comes in late summer and autumn. If perchance your favorite perennial is not in this list, do not think I do not think enough of it to put it here. I had to use a limited number. There are many others that belong here. I selected fifty that will meet our average home conditions. It you have questions about any of the material, I shall be glad to try to answer them at the close of the talk. I do not know what the fad is in Nebraska, but in central Iowa there has been an epidemic it water gardens. Some people are asking tor information along that line. All I can say about the rock gardeu is, if you have space for one that is naturally adapted to such a thing, it is a fine thing to have; but too many back yards are spoiled by dragging in rocks and making something that is really a camouflage I think we should expect to hnd the background of such a nature that you would look for rocks there. (Shows slide of rock garden.) </seg>
            <seg id="p446">Kkport ok Nkhrakka Statk Board of AoRrcirr.TURE Basket of Gold . ' In many of the slides, the perennials are grouped en masse. Instead of having one kind of this and that, it is better to grow fewer varieties and more of a kind, and plant in large clumps for mass effect. It is simply Nature's form ot painting. You are painting a picture with flowers. This plant is attractive in early spring when we do not have a wealth of material to draw from. • Rock Cress Here is a solid mass of white. After the bloom has disappeared in May, the foliage is still attractive. There are two criticisms often heard of perennial gardens. Some say, "You have the same old garden every year!" I like to look for the old friends each year. The other is, "Most perennials are not long in blooming and may become unsightly." If you arrange your border well and plan for succession of bloom, you won't have much trouble along that line. Mouse-Ear Chickweed This is a very small flower. When planted in a large mass It is effective Leopard's Bane Here we have Leopard's Bane. Lily of the Valley We should use it for ground cover in shady places where grass will not grow. It furnishes a wealth of bloom, or a good ground cover late in summer. The best time to plant it is in the fall. Bleeding Heart Here is another favorite from grandmother's garden. We have (wo other forms that are smaller in size and attractive on account of (heir foliage. Forget-Me-Not Perhaps you will say, "We can not grow them." I agree if you try to grow them in a dry, hot spot. It will do well in partial shade, and especially in a moist place such as a creek bed. Oriental Poppy This flower is in a class by itself. Red is the most conspicuous color in the flower world. If you see a man walking down the street with a red necktie, you will probably turn and look at him. If he wears a whole suit of red, you will wonder whether he is perfectly sane or not. A little goes a long way. A successful way to handle brilliant red is to put it in a place where it will not fight with other </seg>

Clove Pink This is an old-fashioned pink. It may be had in various colors. It has gray foliage which is desirable to give a neutral effect. It makes a good edging plant, growing about a foot high. Madonna Lily This flower is not difficult to grow if you will remember a few fundamental principles. It conves from a country where the soil is cool and moist. Four inches is deep enough to plant, and a cushion of sand under the bulbs will help to start it. Hardy Larkspur Florists arc beginning to appreciate this flower. Someone said the most artistic garden is a color scheme of blue. pink and white. I tried it last year and liked it very much. Here is a good blue perennial. Hardy Lupine This flower when well grown is worth having. Beard-Tongue This is a beautiful pink flower, lasts a long time and has a large bloom. Canterbury Bell This one pomes in white and blue. If some one should give you a potted plant of spirea, do not throw it away. Tut it in your flower garden. After it becomes accustomed to the new place, it will give you flowers of this texture. Its foliage is fern-like which is another advantage. Most human beings are fond of the water. There seems to be a common tendency for people to want to look at water. Here is a water garden that is pretty well done, with water lilies. The blue in the foreground belongs to the sweet pea family and aids to the effect. I do not like a lot of fluffy ruffles, so I will take my Canterbury Uell without the saucer. This must be treated like the fox glove for best results. (Shows other varieties of Canterbury Bell.) The prevailing colors of this variety are blue and white. It must be started each year from seed to b&lt;; sure of having flowers every year. The other varieties are hardy perennials and you can leave them for eight or ten years. Ilorky Mountain Columbine There are many good ones useful in perennial work.

The insects will carry the pollen from the poor specimens to the good ones and spoil the mixture. Gas Plant ' It gets its name from the fact its flowers give off this peculiar gas if you touch them. Ottjer than that, it is pretty to look at. Common Columbine This one comes from Europe and has little short spurs. The flower is not as showy as others, but it has many friends. It is very hardy. • Foxglove This and the common Sweet William are popular. If you want then! in bloom every year, start the seed each year. We have tried to winter these things over, and failed at least 50 per cent of the time because the plants are subject to a rot. It is freezing and thaw - ing and the weight of the .mulch that rots them. Sow the seed in June or early July, and transplant your seedlings to a protected box. Cover them with boards or with glass sash, first sprinkling, and you will be able to winter most of them; and then transplant them where you wish them to bloom the next season. This practice is not as necessary with Sweet William as with Foxglove. "What's in a Name?" The naming of flowers is interesting. They are named for re - markable people and events, and Sometimes people with a lot of sentiment and imagination conjure up a wonderful display of names that may be hard to remember. I wish somebody would invent a system of names we could learn easily. Some plants are only listed by their Latin name. In naming them after people, I wish they would select those with short names. Sometimes a man has a beau - tiful long name in his own language, but it is hard on the plant to be his namesake. Mullein Pink Before coming to Iowa, I had good luck with the Mullein Pink. In Iowa I have not had good luck with it. I will play with it some more. In a rock garden where the soil is not good corn soil, you will ' have better luck with some flowers. K ,'ening- Primrose • ■■• Some people call it a weed, but it is pretty in a background or in a moonlight garden. .

            <seg id="p450">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Water Lilies There are two kinds of water lilies: those that bloom at night and those that bloom in the day time.

Plume Poppy You would never know it was a poppy from the flower. The loliage is the most attractive part. Don't use it- in a small yard. It is too coarse and big Hardy Phlox I think the outstanding perennial, after the peony and the iris. is the Hardy Phlox. This slide shows an edging of Sweet Alyssum joining in with the white of the Phlox. People say, "I can not grow Phlox after the blooms appear." It is an insect which is doing that. It is the com - mon red spider. Confine your Phlox close to the garden hose and npray it some every day during the hot weather. Sea Lavender This may be dried for winter boxes.

All the old countries have trees or some manner of ornamental planting along their permanent roads. I have noticed in the east climbing roses along the road fences. Of course you can not depend cm their thriving as Ihey should if it is turned over to the slock; hut alongside a pasture or meadow or corn field or about the build - ings or orchard, you could plant climbing roses and let them climb on the fences, and you would be surprised what a beautiful picture it would make. I was in Kentucky this year around Lexington. Don't smile when I say Lexington. 1 was there and got away alive, and wasn't drunk, either. I Laughter. I I visited that wonderful Bradley horse farm ihyt has ihe highest priced horses in the known world. I will have to say this: theie certainly were the most beautiful roadways I ever drove through, ornamented with the Excelsior and other climb - ing roses that completely covered the fences, being some eight feet high. We went through avenues of roses that made you think you were in heaven if you could have heaven in Kentucky. (Laughter.) We should give this subject consideration now we are getting pasf Ihe real hard knocks of the early days of the state. We are coming to thp matter of real homes, real driveways and real roadsides; and we must study and work to have them decorated properly. Discussion" I Answers by Mr. Marshall.) Q. What would you use as a spray on black walnuts? A. It is a worm that eats the leaf off. You must spray it when it starts to appear. It is like the little corn worm. Arsenate of lead is the thing to use, pretty strong. They are ravenous eaters. You can kill them in twenty-four hours. Q. Would climbing roses do on wire fences? A. Nine-tenths of these are on wire fences. Q. Do they have hot sunshine? A. Yes; hot blue-grass sunshine. They will do as well here as there, except they might not winter well here. Three years out. of four they will winter. If you take them down in the fall and I rail them along the ground, you can lay something on them and trim them in the spring. That is a litlle bit of a job, but you would be .surprised how quickly you can take care of a good many rods of that kind of fence. I think you will be well repaid for it. I never have seen anything more striking for the cost than those avenues of </seg>

You did not say any hing about the practical side, as regards wind breaks and crop protection. A. That would not be -oadside planting. The practical side is a matter of business. Lots 61 you folks tell me I was a crank, and I hate to have anybody tell me Iho truth. The fact or the matter is, if we had three or four or five rows of trees planted east and west clear across Nebraska every quarter or half mile, we would have a better state than we have today. (Applause.) I have in mind a crop of corn this year. I had two fields- - one half a mile from the trees, and the other was' seventy acres bor - dering along the north side 6t ten acres of trees — an old tree claim. One field made twenty bush sis and the other firty. There was no other cause we could see for the difference in yield. That is not the only time the crops have benefitted by those trees. I think they have benefitted every year. The east 160 acres of bur old farm in Washington county had rows of trees clear around it, and a hedge that grew up tall divid - ing it into fbrty acre tracts. We could take all the loss the neighbors grieved about, and yet we had a better yield than anybody in the country, because there were natural conditions inside of those hedges. The' wind sweep was kept away. ' ' If you would follow that plan along all the roadsides I believe it would pay over and over again in the crops alongside it. Timber and fuel would be produced from it. But the protection of the crops would be wonderful. I do not Ihink we dare lay claim what sum it would be, because you would not believe it. I hate to see them cut down trees because of the belief they injure the crops. They might for three or four rods, but the rest of the field would benefit. We oftentimes have storms that blow down corn and small grain, and the loss is reduced in fields wilth a lot of trees around. I believe it would be a matter or economy to plant trees east and west across this country. I believe in twenty years we would Ihink a lot more of it. Q. J'ut them eighty rods between rows? A. We could not put them closer than that. That would be quarter-mile lines, and from that to half-mile lines. I would rather have them every quarter mile. Even if just along the roadside, there is that much protection, and it would amount to a good deal. It would be every mile east and west. It is not so important north and south. Jt is all right, but jmore essential along the roads running cast and west, because our prevailing winds are north and south, and our drying winds are from the south. </seg>

            <seg id="p456">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture PRESIDENT BANNING: At this time we will vary our program and hear from Mrs. Fred F. Grousemann, of Omaha, on "Garden Clubs Are an Influence to Community Betterment." GARDEN CIA US AUK AX INFLUENCE TO COMMUNITY BETTERMENT MRS. FRED F. GROUSEMANN, Omaha, Nebr. A garden club has come to be the greatest cultural influence of a community. Nothing can compare as an index of civic pride and an influence for community betterment with a Garden Club whose main purpose is lo promote the work of beatification by sponsoring Flower Shows, Garden Contests, Trial Gardens and to carry forward the art of flower growing and to serve as a central authoritative bureau of information in its community on all subjects related to preservation and the conservation of natural beauty. The finest phase of Garden Club work is that once started it goes right on with the work of beautifying the community and its influence never abates. One of the most enthusiastic Garden Clubs in this state was organ - ized in Omaha three years ago this month, when about twenty-four, people interested in horticultural conditions met in the city hall and formed the Garden Club of Omaha, with Dr. Alfred Brown as its first president. The membership has grown to 150 and the interest is increasing. The club meets the fourth Thursday of every month at 8 P. M. in the council chamber of the city hall and the meetings are always open to anyone interested in the programs which are always instructive as well as entertaining. A bulletin keeping the members in touch with the various activities is issued every, month. The club endorsed a flower day, co-operated with important clubs in conducting garden contests and furnished judges for various yard and garden contests conducted by realtors and the Social Settlement members; also contributed plants for the Social Settlement grounds. Among the speakers who have addressed the club at the regular meetings was Joseph B. Huniniell, park commissioner, on "Parks and Park Purposes"; Professor H. 0. Woerner on "Vegetables and Their Place on the Table"; Prof. Edwin H. Barbour with illustrated lecture; Francis Ashbury Robinson, landscape architect; Jacob Sass, hybridizer of iris and peonies, his talk on iris culture being illustrated with an exhibit oT some of the Sass seedlings. Mr. Sass brought about one hundred seedlings, hardly two like in color or form. Leo F. McShane gave a talk on "The Enemies of Plant Life," and brought exhibits of insect pests and poisons for extermination; Albert Huban and J. H. </seg>
            <seg id="p457">Nebraska State Horticultubal Socitjry Marnette gave talks on bulbs and told how and when to plant different, kinds; George W. Hood, : superintendent of Forest Lawn Cemetery gave a talk on vegetables; Helen Fields Fisher of Shenandoah came before the club with a basket of fall blooming perennials and many were sur - prised at the large number of hardy plants that bloom in the fall; August Hansen gave a timely talk on seed germination, Thomas E. Evans told of the Better Delphinums, and Carl Taylor, landscape archi - tect, addressed the club on' "Usefulness as the First Requisite of Beauty"; G. L. E. Klingbeil { addressed the club on Dahlias, bringing a large exhibit of his seedlings; Mrs. M. T. White told of Lily Culture for Nebraska and 0. L. Chester described his lily pool and told of his experience 'with different types of water lilies. Mrs. Lina Ferguson gave an interesting talk on Rock Gardening; Sara Toett gave a talk on Flower- Arrangement and Flower Photography. Motion pictures, lantern slide lectures, garden book reviews, experience meetings, ob - servation of National Garden Week, garden visits, annual field day picnics, and flower shows have comprised the programs and kept up the interest of the Garden Club. The field days are perhaps the most instructive programs. The Maple Road Garden, Jacob Sass, owner, and the Midwest Garden, Hans Sass, owner, are always ' enjoyable gardens to visit. These gardens contain Just about every hardy plant in Nebraska and some that are not. Nebraska can well be proud of these gardens. The field day trip to Arlington was a treat the Garden Club members will long remember. Everyone was much impressed with the wonderful nurseries, the propagation methods, the wonderful condi - tion of the stock, the hospitality of the hosts and the beauty of the town which so plainly showed the influence of the men connected with the Marshalls nurseries. Professor C. C. Wiggan gave a masterful talk on Horticulture and the Garden Club members are looking for - ward to more of these kind of talks and the field days to Nebraska nurseries and gardens. The Garden Club has sponsored four competitive flower shows, three spring flower shows and a summer flower show. A flower show is the most beautiful thing a Garden Club can promote. The first show was a wonderful success and proved conclusively that people do know and appreciate cultural skill, although there was less than fifty entries at this show, it made a lasting impression and the shows hav*&gt; grown in size arid beauty since. In view of these facts the club, with the co-operation of the Mid - western Peony and Iris Society, the American Iris Society, the Highland Park Garden Club and the Omaha Chamber of Commerce, are going ahead with the plans for a regional Iris Show in May. This show, which will be national in its scope, will bring a lot of eastern growers and iris fans to Nebraska and it is the wish of the Garden Club of </seg>
            <seg id="p458">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Omaha that this show will be the greatest iris show the world has ever known. While iris will feature the show, all other flowers and plants will have classes. Lilacs and flowering crabs ought to take up a lot of space and make a wonderful background. It is to be hoped that Nebraska's own horticulturists will help to make this show the outstanding achievement in the Garden Club's attempt to further a better appreciation of the newer and more adapt - able iris. It seems as though every county could be represented with an exhibit of some kind and every nursery in the state should take some space, either for an educational exhibit or a trade exhibit. Taken by and large, the Garden Club is assuming for itself a pretty big responsibility, but with the enthusiastic support of the aforementioned societies and a large and growing membership, it can go ahead with confidence of succeeding. And in behalf of the Garden Club of Omaha I want to ask the co-operation of the Nebraska State Horticultural Society in making this spring Flower Show the greatest exhibit of garden flowers ever staged, and in return the Garden Club of Omaha will co-operate with this society to further horticulture in Nebraska. PRESIDENT BANNING: Possibly you are not aware we can get information on these subjects from the Extension Department if we want it. You will find these different departments ready to co-operate with you at any time and give you any assistance possible. We want to kefp them at work, because we have them here, and if we can not keep them busy, we might have to fire them, and we do not want to (io that. Use them all you can. If you need help in horticulture and take it up with this department, you will find the department here is only too willing to come and give you any help you may need. This i.s your Extension Department, and these people are he.re to further horticulture and anything for the best interests of the state. </seg>

McINTOSH, Omaha: I have been a life number of the Horticultural Society for so long I cannot remember how long. While I have not attended the meetings during the last quajrter of a century, I have always been interested in the proceedings. I am prompted to make the remark because of the pleasant surprise in hearing the efficient secretary of our Omaha Garden Club read her paper this afternoon. I think you may be interested in knowing, in addition to the Omaha Garden Club proper, there is a branch called the Highland Park Garden Club which she is active in promoting, which I strayed into on an ideal afternoon during the summer season. One day I saw an announcement of a meeting. I had not heard of the society before. Since the club was a mile from our place, I strolled over, i had the temerity to approach a private house and I went in and found an assemblage of about thirty enthusiastic ladles for an afternoon of garden study. I braved it out. I felt lonesome </seg>

It was poetry from the beginning to the end, except jwhere it was extremely practical; and the most delightful luncheon was served at the close. You will realize a lone man was rather nervy to break in, but it was a mighty nice place to be. The more ol these garden clubs we can have in the country, I am sure the better it will be for every community. PRESIDENT BANNING : I want to assure Mrs. Grousemann the Horticultural Society will be glad to co-operate in any possible way in their work. The next on our program .will be "An Amateur's Experience with the Dahlia," by Mrs. Sala, of University Place. ■ ■ ' ■ ■ ■'■'.•■■ ■ • ■ ■ ■ ' ■■ '■' "AX AMATEUR'S EXPEKIEXCE WITH THE DAHLIA" MUS..F. E. SALA, University Place, Nebraska I did not expect when I told Mr. Hoppert I would help him out, that I would speak to' a group of men, and especially men who are professionals, as I know a great many before me are. My experience in raising dahlias has not been very long. I am sure what I . can tell" you about my experience would not be of much profit to you unless I could tell' you where I got it. After all I have said, I would refer you to the same sources of information as I have received mine in my study in trying to work with the dahlia. I am not only a lover of dahlias, but of gladiolas .1 presume I have more gladiolas than dahlias. I have enjoyed the little talk this afternoon on "Perennials." I think I have forty different varieties of perennials. When I was asked to talk on dahlias, I felt like saying I would just as soon talk on perennials as dahlias, because I am a iover of everything that helps to make home beautiful. ■ I want to tell you why I raise dahlias and why I love and raise flowers. I have two boys of seventeen and nineteen. I have one older who is twenty-three. The one who is twenty-three, five years ago sent his mother a beautiful collection of gladiola bulbs. That was my first experience with them. About twelve years ago, an old German lady who is a neighbor gave me my first root of the dahlia — one of the varieties, I presume, not. many professionals would even look at, yet to me it is very beautiful. It is the road decoration you see almost every place you go. I presume I have two barrels of those roots. First I want to consider the planting of the dahlia. I stood and looked at the first root that was given to me, and got a catalog from </seg>
            <seg id="p462">Report of Nebbaska State Board of Agriculture one of the older national organizations of dahlia growers. From this ' I got a little information as to how to divide the root and plant it. I divided the root into four and planted it and enjoyed the flowers very much. I had good success with them. My neighbors came by and admired my dahlias. For about five years I raised dahlias con - tinuously from that one bulb. Then I began to read in these different papers I would receive, articles from men trying to give us better specimens of dahlias; saying those little dahlias did not amount to very much. They were branching out and getting hold of different kinds that were more expensive and more beautiful; and in every way it seemed to me I would have to lay aside my old red dahlia. I gave lots of cheer to sick and shut-in people. My prime purpose in raising flowers is for the shut-in and the s.ick. I make no charge and have taken them by the hundreds of bouquets every summer to hospitals and friends. I thought as I was going to talk on the dahlia, I should refer you to the United States Department of Agriculture on dahlias. I was in hopes I would have a bunch of farm women here to talk to. Instead, I see very few of the ladies. My experience with the dahlias has taught me they are free, as a general thing, from any pests or blight or those things that would cause one to give up in disgust. So many say, "I never have flowers. I buy the best varieties I can find and plant them, but they begin to bud in the fall when the frosts come." The first thing I thought of as soon as the frost was out of the ground was to plant the dahlia roots. I would dig the holes deep and mulch and prepare the soil and lay my dahlia bulb in the ground and cover it close to the stem. As it grew, I would tie it to a stick and protect it from the winds and rain which destroy 'such brittle and frail things as dahlia stems. As they began to grow, I did not. take off these laterials or pinch away the buds. In the last five years my experience has been by pinching away the buds except the center one, I have much more beautiful flowers. I have a red da ilia which la just a wonder. I go out in the morning and walk down my garden path or the walk outside the lot and break off all the extra laterals and pinch off the ones on either side of the main bud. The neighbbrs came and viewed them with wonder and said, "What are they?" I thing pri - marily they are decorative. They are the Bon Ton. So many persons have told us we cannot have the early dahlia. Because of extreme hot weather in summer, I have found my earliest plantings of dahlias have given the greatest joy because I planted them so early they would come out during the cold, rainy time before </seg>

It would eat a hole in the body of every one of tVie flowers, beginning with the dahlias, and spread to my marigolds and zinnia heds. I worked hard with sprays and dusting powders. I am hoping we will not have so many things to contend with another year. I want to close by reading you a poem written by Harriet G. Willhide, which expresses my thoughts on dahlias much better than I could. DAHLIAS Dowr. my garden path I'm straying Feasting on the beauty there; Great blush roses, bending, swaying, Spilling fragrance on the air. Here, a bit of sweet alyssum, There, my *oft-eyed pansy beds, While beyond, in rosy splendor, Holl&gt; hocks lift stately heads. But I linger not, enchanted With thf- beauty near at hand, For my treasured flowers are planted, And in kingly grandeur stand By the far wall of my garden, Where each passer-by may see Every line and rainbow color That brings thrills of joy to me. Petals curled, and frilled, and fluted, High-flung heads, in proud disdain, Caring not, since safely rooted, Whether sunshine come, or rain. Flaunting, with a blaze of glory. Every lesser blossom there, Tempting me to be forgetful Of my other flowerets fair. Ah! the shades of bronze and yellow. Purple, lavender and rose. In the evening light so mellow, Ere night conies In soft repose. Dahlias, orchid-tinted dahlias, Crimson, mauve, and snowy white, Blooming valiantly all summer, Till bent low by autumn's blight. </seg>

I would like to know about watering. L have a garden lot in Lincoln, but I cannot raise dahlias. They take up so much room and go 1o foliage and the flowers blight. I use my hose plentifully. A. When do you water them? At what time of day? Q. Early in the evening. A. The dahlia requires quite a little water, but a well drained soil. I have fertilized: The year I fertilized the heaviest, I got my poorest flowers. I think a good garden soil is good for dahlias^ I think the greatest. trouble with our gardening is the fact it is old soil. We do not have enough virgin soil. Last year I went along the road - side and got fresh new sod and tore it to pieces and got the fine dirt and put it in the roots. I think it helped. In planting my gladiola bulbs in late years, I have put a handful of sand around them. I think the soil is pretty heavy for a lot of bulbs. I have had some experience with blighting. I like a partial shade. I would rather put dahlias on the north side of the garage or the northeast corner of the house if I had a little room there, or some place partially shaded at '.the extreme heat of the day. Last year I dug a hole at the north side of the garage, and planted a red dahlia, and It was the most beautiful of all the red dahlias. I could go out almost any- time and find a fresh blossom on the plant, while those along the garden walk were wilted during the hot part of the day. I think that the last of May or the first of June Ts an opportune time. The .Horticultural Department tells us the first of. June is the best time for show flowers. They bloom the first of Sep - tember if the summer is favorable.-. As far as wilting is concerned, I .think that is due to the ex - tremely hot season and watering during the heat of the day. Q. Have you had trouble with the burrowing worm in the stalk? A. I have never had that experience. </seg>
            <seg id="p466">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Q. I bought some roots two years ago, and on one set all the plants broke off about a foot from the ground before they bloomed. This fall when I dug them, I found a ■worm that had spread Into the different parts. It is a yellow worm that looks like the yellow weevil — about an inch long, and jointed. It cuts next to the bud and the stalk will break down and is entirely worthless. A. That worm is prevalent all over Nebraska. It Is not alone in dahlias, but in all kinds of weeds. It bores in the stalk. Generally when you 1 find out you have it, it has done the damage. The only thing to do is to cut off the plant below the worm and kill every one. Q. They stay in the root. If you do not freeze the root, I think they will live over. A. I had twelve or fifteen plants die once, with not a blossom on them, and I could not figure out what was the trouble. When digging time came, I discovered the plain old grub worm had eaten away half the bulbs I had planted, and there was very little life left to grow plant or stalk. That is one reason I- use more sand in planting around the roots. I think it will help to get a root growth easier than in heavy clay or black soil. I did not speak of rooting dahlias from the slips, but I have not done it extensively. (Applause.) PRESIDENT BANNING: The next subject is "Trees Are an Asset on the Nebraska Farm," by Mr". Watkins, of the Agricultural College. "TRRRS ARK AX ASSET OX THE NEBRASKA FARM" C. \V. WATKINS, Agricultural College, Lincoln, Nebraska Mr. President and Members of the Society: I sometimes wonder on occasions of this kind how the people find time to do all these things we come up and advocate. It reminds me of the Scotchman who was conservative on the matter of allowing nothing to interfere with his work, regardless of circumstances. One morning he was out repairing the curb on the cistern, and accidentally fell in. He pulled the rope down with him. He swam around and called to his wife. She ran out and wondered what she could do. He told her not to get excited. She said, "I will get the boys right away." "Just a minute. What time is it?" "It is a quarter to eleven. 'What difference does that make?" "Don't call them in now. I'll swim around until noon." </seg>
            <seg id="p467">Nebraska State Hobticultcbal Socrqry Sometimes I think that is what we will have to do in order to get all these things in. &lt;• My subject is, "Trees Are an Asset on the Nebraska Farm." I am ivorking in the Extension Service in farm planting. We are just organized, and are planning on putting out. we hope, 150,000 trees I believe we can find places' for them if we can get them. We are getting the co-operation of jthe Federal Nursery at Halsey as well u i state nurseries in Nebraska. .-These trees will be sent to farmers willing to co-operate in caring for these trees and trying to get a stand fls a windbreak. We won't have, enough to plant large acreages this year, and I do not know as it is advisable in any year, except in certain cases where a man is in position to give it a great deal of time. Fib. 2.-Jack Pino. and Yellow Pine Seeding*.- once transplanted. Bessey Nursery, Halsey, Nebraska. We are going to further the planting of trees on the plains I think that is where our efforts should be. centered first. We are getting that experience that has been obtained in the Mandan Station work In North Dakota. They have been planting under plains conditions end experimenting for twelve years. Mr. Wilson, in a recent address, when asked what he thought was the most important thing in the success of trees on the plains, said if he were to condense it into the fewest words, he would say "Good Husbandry." He showed the comparison of plantings he has put out in the way they were cared for, and the resulting success. The plantings that lost heavily were the ones planted and given no care. The co-operative agreement in that region calls for a man when he makes his application, to have his ground inspected. They require summer fallow the year before for-moisture storage. . Sometimes we think that would be advisable here, but as yet we can not do it We want to get some plantings out right away. After their ground is inspected, the trees are sent out. I think each co-operator is limited </seg>
            <seg id="p468">Rkuokt ok NKnu.vsKA Statf, Board of Agriculture to 2 50 trees per year. Only varieties adapted to the country are sent out. These trees are inspected twice the following year to see if the farmers are carrying out the agreement. That is nothing more nor less than cultivation. Weeds and grass, perhaps more in the plains area than here, are the greatest enemies of the trees. To put a tiny seedling down -to compete with well established weeds or grass roots is hardly a fair' proposition. If we prepare the ground according to the best system for moisture conservation, and plant species adapted to dry land conditions, I believe we will get results. We have a growing interest in the subject. A great many people are inquiring about this co-operative plan. We are planning, as soon as we learn the number of trees we can obtain this year, to send out application blanks to these people. The species we have available will be listed. Perhaps we won't get all the trees recommended for the state, because they are not available. There was considerable loss last fall due to frost. We will get all we can, and good stock. We would rather not plan any, than a poor quality of seedling stock, because the results would be discouraging to people lather dubious anyway. We find people who say trees cannot be raised on the plains. I am not going out to tell them it can be done, and say, "All you have to do is this." We have tests in Wyoming where the Mandan Station has put out co-operative shelter belts that are really successful. We have a few places where the trees are short-lived. There is no reason to give up planting trees because they will only live fourteen years. We can add to them each year and gradually build up. We are often cited to the Kinkaid district as evidence that it &lt;s impossible to get trees started. I looked over several of those plantings this fall and talked with several people. Quite often you will find that fire has ruined the trees or stock has broken off the little pine seedlings. You will find men successful with corn, keeping it clean and using all the moisture for the crop. Yet when one of these men gets his Kinkaid trees, he laughs and wonders what they sent them for. He finally looks around and puts them in his pasture in a weed patch, and never touches them. They cannot grow under such condi - tions. The soil is not loosened, and the weeds will continue to take what little moisture there is. You ask why he doesn't plant corn there, and he will tell you, "Corn wouldn't grow there. The weeds would take the moisture." He doesn't think the same thing applies to his trees. If you trans - plant a tree, you are bound to injure the little feeder roots to some extent. Those are things we run up against in considering the area with limited rainfall. </seg>
            <seg id="p469">Nedraska State Horticultural Socthty Several plantings were put out last year through the Extension Service co-operating with the Horticultural Department with unusual success for so dry a year. That is encouraging. It is encouraging others to take up that work and look to their neighbor who has been successful, for assistance :or advice. Those are the things we as Extension workers want to carry back and forth. Make use of the Extension Service, as your President, suggested. It is yours. If there is something we can help you on or get help on, we are here to do it. Farm forestry in eastern Nebraska has grown faster than in western Nebraska. It is more needed in western Nebraska. We have trees here. There are men in the audience who have seen this country several years ago when it was prairie. It is hard to realize when one sees the trees everywhere that it ever was practically an open country except for the small patches of trees along the streams. Fl«. 3. — This shows the flumes that carry water for irrigating the seedlings at the Government Nursery at Halscy, Nebraska. • • We are asked quite, often if we are planning on these trees reaching lumber. size. Yes, we are planning on it; but we are not advocating planting for that purpose. I see no reason why they should not, but I have little evidence to back me up in saying they will reach that size. Last week I got a letter from a man in a western county' of this state who would like to have some pine trees. He wrote: "I would, like to ask how many years' it will take these seedlings to reach the size of the trees in the Pacific Northwest?" I could not answer him. He would not believe me if I did. We haven't the growing conditions that they have. Those who have seen the government plantation at Halsey know it will transform some of that sandy land into a garden spot. In twenty-four years, the trees have reached a height of about 35 feet — planted through blow-outs and growing under natural conditions, </seg>
            <seg id="p470">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture and giving the appearance of a little forest. Add to that the number of deer making their home in that little plantation. Those things appeal to you if you drive acros3 the sandy country between North Platte and Halsey. That shows what can be done in the sand hills. Down here I feel there is a possibility for white pine. We are going to make some experiments this year in plantations in the eastern part of the state. One is the roadside planting between here and Ne - braska City — a healthy stand and doing well. I should like to know what the growth is. Trees in a windbreak planting have a better chance for rapid growth than trees under ordinary forestry conditions, such as the natural forests in Colorado. I happen to know the trees of the Halsey plantation and the Bruner Brothers in Holt county are growing at a much more rapid rate than the average yellow pine in Colorado because you have plantings in a narrow belt compared to the dense stand of pines In Colorado. The tree has more sunlight and soil moisture and less competition. Out there it is growing in rocky soil. The need for windbreaks does not need discussion in this audience. We cannot say how many we will send each person this year. We figure two hundred will make a nice planting to start with, and not be too many for a man to care for. If he succeeds, he will be interested in trying out something new. I feel there is a future in newer types of trees for western Ne - braska. We have several exotic species that are doing well on dry land. Then comes the matter of the spacing of trees. Perhaps we have in the past — I think we did at the government nursery at Halsey — planted too closely for the good of the trees to start with. Up there It will necessitate thinning within the next year or so in order to open up the stand and allow a better growth. In western Nebraska, within the area of limited rainfall, trees should not be planted closer than 10 by 10 feet. That may seem far apart. We have two reasons for this recommendation. One is. ease of cultivation with disc or harrow or whatever you use to clean these wt&gt;eds out. The other is guarding against early root competition. Get them far enough apart so that the roots will not come together until they have a good start and plenty of food stored up to carry them. If there is room for more, we can interplant with the tolerant species. Start them far enough apart so they won't draw moisture or plant food from one another. In eastern Nebraska, the distance may be shortened, but I doubt if it is advisable. In a one-row wind - break — to give an example — we have an orchard windbreak planting here at the farm, and it is really ideal. The trees were planted about seventeen feet apart — Australian pine, yellow pine, and some Scotch pine. The row is on the west side and completely grown together. </seg>
            <seg id="p471">Nebraska State Horticultubal Society Why want them closer? If you are planting several rows, you can alternate the trees in the rows. We think the best method is tp use a mixed planting. Take a few of three or four different kinds, and plant in rows;. and windbreaks put out will probably be north and west of the buildings. Get them back a hundred feet, where this is possible, from your buildings in order that the snow won't pile behind them, and don't prune them back. We are working for wind re - sistance. I have a little exhibit some of. you have seen, showing the dif - ference in wind velocity behind a little single row of pine twigs. I think it brings out the idea we are w'orking at. Start your hard wood seedlings this year— maybe a row of ever - greens' if we can get enough to develop them that way. If not, let the hard woods get started, keeping the ground plowed and perhaps. Fig. 4. — Yellow Pine planting 3 years old. Nebraska Forest, Halsey, Nebraska. with cultivation on the row where you will. put your evergreens. In other-words, summer fallow the ground and conserve the moisture this year and it will be in better shape next spring. The ground will be loose and moist, which are ideal conditions. As to the species recommended, that is hard to say. We can recommend a great, number and not get all we. want. But we will get as many as we can, and good quality. To do that, we are staying within our own state. We are using local grown stuff. We know what, it is. We have the local nurserymen helping us. They are behind it, and we will follow that policy. We think the American' and the Chinese elm are two good trees. ' I could name others for western Nebraska, but It is not necessary. </seg>
            <seg id="p472">Rkport of Nkiibaska State Board of AoRirri.TrRE You can play with your trees if you like in this part of the. state. Try the green ash, and the honey and black locusts. While black locus' is subject to borers, I don't believe it would justify us in throwing it out of the number, which is too limited as it is. We hope lo control the borer later on. I could not give you anything on it now. The Russian olive is an excellent western Nebraska tree, and drouth-resisting. The mulberry is a good windbreak tree because ii will spread out. By heading it back, the limbs will tangle up and it makes good windbreaks. The common cottonwood is not liked by many, but it is one of the greatest trees for Nebraska, inasmuch as it is a rapid grower and will grow under unfavorable conditions.

The hackberry is an excellent drouth-resisting tree. It has a good root system. It is a little hard to transplant after it is any size, but it can be done. The Russian golden willow is good on a moist site, even in western Nebraska. The choke cherry grows commonly in that country. I know a man using it for a windbreak. The osage orange and catalpa are both good post (rees. The catalpa is not a good windbreak here, because it loses its leaves early and gets them late, but it is ideal for posts and profitable to raise on middle and eastern Nebraska land. There are jack pines planted extensively through the sand hills which might make an ideal shade tree. The Scotch pines are grown practically all over the state. The Australian and yellow pines are good, except for the tip moth on yellow pines in western Nebraska. Spruce trees are an ideal windbreak. They have a dense crown but are slow growing, and should be started in connection with the more rapid growing trees. A row of spruce in with three or four rows- of </seg>

Then we have the Chinese arbor vita and— I do not know whether I dare mention the last one — the red cedar. It is only planted in western Nebraska- where people demand it. We do not recommend it nor send it out in any fruit section. The care in handling seedling stock is important. A little air on the roots is absolutely fatal. Care must be exercised in handling the stock from the time it is received. We will do our best to care for it in packing and shipping and get it out in good shape.

In practically every case where a man had trees from an outside source, he was disappointed in the way they reached him — maybe due to the distance they had come or the method in - which they were packed and handled — because their growth depends on it. - . As Mr. Marshall said, it takes a life time to grow a nice tree, and if you put out one in the spring and its roots have been exposed, you are disappointed the next year. You say, "I put forth my best c-ffort and had no luck, so I don't feel I am capable." It is not always that. Every report from Nebraska grown and packed trees is good. People notice those things, especially when we are carrying on an educational campaign in tree-planting. The interest has shown us the plan will be accepted and we will get co-operation. </seg>

It reminds mo of the tumble bug in Kentucky near the town Mr. Marshall was visiting, that was rolling a ball of mud along the road. One of those Kentucky mountaineers threw his bottle down. It lay beside the bug. He let the ball of mud lie on the ground while he walked over to the bottle and took a sniff, and it amelled good. Then he took a swallow, and like most of us, he tobk two or three more, and came out feeling fine. He began to look around for his mud ball, but evidently it had rolled down the road. He thought he couldn't find it. Finally he noticed a hay stack although he did not realize what it was. He hobbled over and leaned up against it and said, 'Come on, big boy! Let's go!"

Arrowrock dam was built m 1916. It is 312 feet high and 1200 feet across. There is an auto road across the top of it. The controls and machinery are all operated from the interior of the dam. The small holes, that look like portholes on a boat, are m reality four feet across. The amount of water needed for irrigation is regulated by means of these holes. When the water above the dam has been used up so that the water won't reach these holes then the lower series of portholes are opened. From the vicinity of Arrowrock dam we were taken back to Boise where a banquet had been arranged. It happened to be Sweet Cherry season so at each place was a huge bowl of Bings or Royal Anne cherries. We each had a specimen of Idaho Delicious m addition, to supply iron and vitamines for the meal. After the splendid banquet we had the pleasure of listening to Governor C. C. Moore extol the fruits and resources of Idaho. Then the crowd went for a plunge </seg>

Everyone was refreshed and yet tired out Moreover, the night was hot, especially for those who had to sleep In the coaches. Next morning we were again loaded Into autos to inspect variou - orchards oF interest. The first one we stopped at was a prune orchard^ 1Mb is the region which supplies us with blue plums for canning About 1800 cars are shipped from Idaho each year. We visited the McBirney prune orchard. The crop was looking fine. Mr. McBirney estimated, that the orchard this year would yield ten tons per acre. From here we drove through .a general farming country where dairying seems to be on the increase. Even the people in Idaho have come to the conclusion that it is well to have a source of income the year around rather than depend on a crop like fruit or grain for all income. After about ten miles of this we again drove to an unirrigable rough rocky section, where nothing but sage brush and cactus seems to do well. We kept climbing and finally reached a gap between two ranges of mountains. Here we stopped to get a panoramic view of the fertile valley below. It was quite a contrast, especially to those from the east. Close around us nothing worth while seemed to grow and beyond right to the foothills of the mountains, a very intensively developed orchard section. We went through Freezeout Gap and then down the steep mountain road into groves of fruit trees of various kinds. It was sweet cherry season so we stopped at Mr. J. R Field's cherry orchard. Here we had our fill of B.ings and Royal Annes. etc. Mr. Field has quite an extensive sweet cherry orchard, so large in fact, that he shipped by the carload to eastern markets. He has his own packing plant in the town of Emmet which we visited later on. Since we in Nebraska can't seem to grow sweet cherries success - fully I was not particularly interested . in this crop except in so far as the flavor was concerned. But Mr. Field did have a small block of sour cherries for testing purposes. Early Richmond and Mont - morency. These varieties, however, seemed less well adopted there The .fruit, though large and good to look at, did not have the sprightly taste which we expect in Nebraska. From here we drove through the New Plymouth and Fruitland apple section. Here they grow mostly Jonathans, Rome Beauty, Wine - sap and Delicious. The trees are planted too close. The crop was only fair so far as size was concerned. We made a short stop at an air cooled storage and then drove to the Payette Valley to see more prunes, apricots and peaches. The weather was beastly hot and the road dusty. </seg>

The Hood River territory looks much better to one accustomed to trees. The mountain sides are covered with spruce and fir. Here again the fruit growers met us in cars to show us their country. First of all they took us out on the Columbia River Highway, a most excellent drive. The scenery is beautiful and the road winds in and out among the trees and along side of the mountains on the one side and overlooking the Columbia River on the other. Snowcapped Mount Adams across in Washington adds variety to the landscape and a little consolation on hot days such as we were having.

Although the region is Irrigated, con - siderable rain falls. I think about thirty inches during the year. Ths source of irrigation water is the melting snow and ice from Mt. Hood. Apples are the predominating fruit crop, the principal varieties being Spitzenbergs and Yellow Newtons. The orchards seem thrifty and well cared for and this year loaded with a high quality crop. Most of the orchards are in alfalfa or sweet clover. The latter seems objectionable because it grows too rank. </seg>
            <seg id="p479">Nebraska State Horticultural Society Pears seem to be becoming more and more popular in this valley. Most of the new plantings seem to be pears. Fire blight is not a problem here. The climate is not particularly conducive to pea"r blight, moreover the fruit inspectors enforce sanitation measures as well as eradication measures. Strawberries, too, are grown extensively about 125 cars having been shipped in 1926. Apples ', usually run around 3,000 cars. For lunch that day we were taken to Cloud Cap Inn on Mount Hood. From.

One of the many points of interest shown us here was a seedling apple tree on the Government Barrack Grounds. This tree is celebrating its 100th anniversary, having been brought from Vancouver, B. C., just a hundred years ago by some English settlers. Another interesting place was that of Mr. Quarenberg. This fine old gentleman is the pioneer nut culturist of the Pacific North - west. He is trying out different kinds of filberts and walnuts to find varieties that do well. He has made a trip or two for the Depart - ment of Agriculture to European countries to bring back promising sorts to try out.

A scene in Fred Groner's EnKlish walnut orchard. i Portland, Oregon In the afternoon we were the guests of the Forest Grove and Hillsboro Chambers of Commerce. We saw Mr. Fred Groner's walnut planting. Oregon is getting into English Walnut growing quite exten - sively so much so in fact that southern California is rapfdly going out of this crop. The possibilities in growing the various fruits is unlimited almost. The raw timber country is rapidly being developed. The limiting factor at present seems to be lack of markets to absorb the product. Canning factories help out in this respect but even this field has a limit for its goods. We had a picnic supper at the fish </seg>
            <seg id="p481">Nebraska State Horticultural Society hatcheries near Hillsboro and then viewed some of the beautiful resi - dence sections of Portland and suburbs. The following morning we boarded a special train for points in the Willamette Valley. First we visited Springbrook, the largest producing black raspberry section in the northwest. Loganberries are - an important crop also. Prunes, pears, and cherries likewise are quite common. There are a number of cooperative earning companies to handle the crop. Next we stopped at Dundee to see the principal English walnut region of Oregon. We went jthrough the grading plant which grades and bleaches the nuts; Another interesting stop was a prune dry - ing plant. There were several different types of these, one using oil burners to supply the necessary heat and another using wood for this purpose. Prune growing seemed less profitable than some of the other crops on account of overproduction or lack of proper distri - bution. " . • . Fl«. 10.— Prunes used to be ilrird in the sun. but today prune dryers are used. This is a PuccinelH \n uiw dryn- hrutrd by an ■ oil burner.

Stops were made at McMinnville and Dallas where a large lum - ber'mill was visited. Then some large hop yards were next. This is an industry that still seems to be flourishing in spite of the fact that the Eighteenth Amendment is supposed to be enforced. Here is a picture showing a battery of 3 Cleveland tractors cul - tivating the middles of a 300 acre hop yard with spring tooth har - rows. The vines are spaced! about 10x10 like grape plants. As the new shoots come up in the spring they are tied to heavy wires within '2 feet of the ground. Later on as the vines grow the wires are raised.

A good hopyard brings a very fancy price, some reports crediting sales of $3,000 per acre. Only the richer bottom ground is used for this purpose. From Dallas we drove to Salein, the capital of Oregon. Here the Chamber of Commerce provided cars for a sightseeing trip. Salem is called the "Cherry City," but there are many different fruits grown; loganberries, blackberries, prunes, etc. After a tour about the fruit plantings we were shown the state capitol grounds and the adjoining penitentiary. Excitement was intense here. The previous day one of the prisoners had attempted to escape and in the attempt was killed by one of the guards. Not very different from conditions here . at Lincoln, you see. At Salem we again boarded the special train for Portland. Puyallup, Washington That evening we left for Tacoma, Washington. The next day was spent hobnobbing with Horticulturists of the Pacific Northwest who had a convention at Tacoma. That evening we all got together - for a trip on Puget Sound and a Salmon Bake at Point Defiance Park. The following day the schedule called for a trip through the very intensely developed vegetable and small fruit region of Puyallup and Sumner. Red raspberries and Evergreen blackberries are the prin - cipal fruits. We visited one 65-acre red raspberry plantation that cer - tainly was a sight to behold. The canes were 7 to 8 feet high and covered with thimble-like berries. The picking problem was solved by enlisting the aid of coeds from the Washington University. The coeds are in charge of a matron and they have recreation as well as work. A Y. W. C. A. worker was in charge^_of the girls. The problem of marketing the huge output was simplified by freezing the berries in 50 gallon barrels. As soon as harvested they were placed in these - barrels with M part sugar and then rushed to cold storage rooms and held at 15° Fahrenheit. Later on this frozen fruit found its way to the jan&gt; factories and to soda fountain supply houses where it was prepared for the trade. Some of the berries are shipped as fresh fruit but only a very small part. The larger proportion went to the canneries. Vegetables, too, are grown here in great quantities. Head lettuce is one of the important crops, 1,000 cars being shipped out annually. We visited one of the plants where this product was gotten ready for shipping. It is first taken into a precooling room. Here fans circulate the cold air so as to hasten the cooling-off process. After about 48 hours of such cooling the heads are crated and packed with crushed ice and then placed In iced cars. </seg>
            <seg id="p483">. Nebraska State Horticultural Society Rhubarb and asparagus are also raised here in large quantities, the latter being used by the canneries primarily. The rhubarb is forced, however. The plants are raised in the field and dug in the late fall. Then they are placed in sand in what looks like a potato cellar. Here oil stoves heat the air to about 60° F., forcing the fleshy roots to send out stems which are sold to the eastern trade In car - lots. About 25 cars of force'd rhubarb was shipped out last year. Another industry that is coming to the front rapidly is the grow - ing of tulip bulbs. In the past most of these have been imported from Holland but from now on this can't be done, so this phase of horti - culture has been developed. [The Puget Sound territory seems well adapted to bulb growing and the people have taken hold of the propo - sition on a fairly large scale. From Puyallup we were taken back to Tacoma where we boarded our sleepers for Wenatchee. -Everyone was looking forward to this, the climax of the trip. Wenatchee, Washington Next morning we arrived at Wenatchee where we were met by fruit growers and business men. to be shown over this highly developed orchard section. The first stop was on a high hill overlooking Wenat - chee. Here we got a panoramic view of the valley below. As far as we could. see in both directions up and down the Columbia and Wenatchee rivers were apple orchards just like a forest except that • V_ •' .,;^00^^-' r \- '■'■ ':.: Flo. 12.— The . Wenatchee section specializes in apples to the extent of about 80,000 acres. One of the mistakes made in close planting. These ten-year-old trees have already come together, making spraying and other orchard operations very difficult. </seg>

Practically all of the irrigable land was in apple orchard. There are approxi - mately :S5.O(lO acres in apples and about 3,000 orchard owners, most of whom own small blocks of 10-15 acres of orchard. There are a few companies operating lfiO or more acres of orchard but this type is the exception. Along the railroad right of way in Wenatehee are several dozen large storage plants and packing houses. The next stop was at what is called the Eden tract. This tract was developed by a company and then sold out in blocks of 10 and 2 0 acres. The custom has been in the past to plant the apple trees too close together, 20 to 2 5 feet usually. The Eden tract had been planted 1 his way 20 years ago. Now the trees are touching so that when the apples weigh the branches down it is impossible to drive through the orchard without bruising a lot of apples. Furthermore the lower limbs were being shaded so much that the apples produced Kin. 13.

It was deemed advisable to thin out the stand of trees, but this was done in a different way from the way it is usually done in Nebraska. The entire tree that was to come out was not cut down at one time. That method would have reduced the per acre yield too much. Instead, the trees that were to come out were pruned heavily where they interfered with the per - manent trees. The permanent trees thereby were allowed to develop without any interference. Finally in about 5 years all. of the tempor - ary trees were removed. The orchard we visited had just been thinned </seg>
            <seg id="p485">Nebraska State Horticultural Society this way till only the permanent trees were left. The remarkable thing about this method, we were told, was that there was no decrease in per acre production. In fact the production kept increasing. A number of growers from Wenatchee estimated the production of this orchard at 1,000 packed boxes per acre, truly a remarkable yield. Stationary Spray Outfits Are Used ■ The type of spray outfit used in the Wenatchee section differs radically from that used in most other sections. Very seldom did we see the movable spray outfit. The crowded condition of the trees has made this type almost obsolete. Instead they are using station - ary spray outfits. Here, there is a central pumping plant run either by electric motor or a gas engine. . The spray is mixed in a 1,000 gallon tank and pumped under 350 to 400 pounds pressure through pipe-lines. These pipes are usually placed in the crotches of trees out of the way of all danger. Every 100 feet a stop cock is inserted to which the spray hose is attached. An outfit to handle 10 acres of orchard will cost in the neighborhood of $1,000 including pumps, tank, pipe lines, etc. Over 60 r /f of the orchardists have such outfits in use now. . • Fl«. 14. — Stationary spray outfits arc- used on 60% of the apple orchards in the Wenatchee.

The next day was spent looking over the huge packing plants In the valley like the one owned by the American Apple Growers Incorporated. Here we saw a plant that can handle about 10,000 boxes of apples a day. They have 7 or 8 large Cutler Graders in one building. Labor costs are cut to a minimum by carriers. First the apples are wiped to remove the spray residue, then they are sorted by girls into different grades and finally sized and packed. Then the boxes are nailed up and stamped. The plants were not in oper - ation since nothing but late apples are shipped, but we could see that it was a plant meant to handle a big crop quickly and efficiently. ;-r^^HkfcS^vi|| * «V: : :^&gt; ', : !'~|i«»7^^^^^^*wiDl Be FlC. 15. — Seven large Cutler praders at work In the packing house of the American Fruit Growers, Inc., at Wenatchee. About 1,200 boxes per day are turned out by each machine. Marketing is the biggest and hardest problem that confronts the apple grower in the Pacific Northwest. Production costs and freight costs are high and most of their fruit must be packed and shipped great distances. The bearing orchard, land sells around ? 1,500 per acre. The operating cost per acre exclusive of interest runs $189 </seg>
            <seg id="p488">Rkport ok Nkhhask a Statk Board or AuRldTTt'RK per acre. The liarvesting cost including grading, packing, package hauling, etc.. costs HO B/10 cents in addition. This latter is a fairly* constant charge. In other words to put up a box of apples costs tiO.fi cents irrespective of the spraying, pruning, irrigating, etc. It costs this amount whether the yield is 100 or 500 boxes per acre. But the per acre production cost varies with the yield. For example, if a grower produces 5nO boxes per acre his cost for growing the crop is about the same as if he grew only 200. The $189 per acre on a 5(Mi box crop would be about 37.2 cents. However, if he grows (•nly 200 boxes then the cost per box is 04.5 cents. You can easily see how the size of crop influences the ultimate cost per box. Now in addition before these apples compete with us here in Nebraska they have to be taken there and that costs real money too. The cost is usually about 75 cents per box. So the cost of a box of apples laid down lien is about $1.75 without anyone getting a profit. But of course people who handle apples need a profit or they can't do business. So you see we will never have to worry much about apples being cheap that are shipped nere from Washington. Further - more, the average production per acre will not reach 500 packed boxes, in fact it is more nearly 275. So there are a lot of apples grown at a loss unless the price runs above what it has been in the past 4 or 5 seasons. How long_ these people can continue to produce at a loss it is hard to say. The price per box at Wenatchee has not averaged much over a dollar in recent years. In 1923 it was 90.5 cents. The concensus of opinion of the fruit growers from the east regarding this situation was this "They can certainly beat us at rais - ing apples, but we can usually sell them at a profit and that seems to be impossible here. I wouldn't trade places with the grower out here." Sometimes it seems our lot is more than we can bear but in other sections it is jusl as bad or worse. Here in Nebraska we don't raise so many bushels per acre but what we do raise we can sell at a Tair price, so we can be proud to own Nebraska as our state. MAKKKTrXG NKHHASKA APPIjKS IN NEBRASKA MR. J. F. SHUBERT, Shubert, Nebraska Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: About the only excuse 1 have for appearing before the Horticultural Society again this year is as a punishment. Professor Hoppert wrote me a letter a year ago— ■ it is getting to be an annual thing. He usually holds the fall session at a time when I can not attend — in apple time in Nebraska. So he wrote this letter and said, "As a punishment, you are expected </seg>
            <seg id="p489">Nebraska State Horticultural. Society to appear on the program at the winter meeting." This year he wrote the same kind of a letter. I guess he thought he had worked that too long' and he would fix it up. Sometimes we make a break and under - take to fix it, and make, it that much worse. He said, "As a punish - ment,- you will have to say something about selling apples in Ne - braska." Then he added, "That is not the only reason. We thought you might posBibly be able to tell us something new that would be of interest." (Laughter.) You know Professor Hoppert has been conducting, along with Professor Coe, some experiments at our place in one of. our orchards. One morning he was down there in front of the bank and a lot of school children came along. Mr. Hoppert is inclined to have a little fun, and he commenced to ask a lot of questions. Finally he noticed one little fellow was wearing a wrist watch; so Mr. Hoppert stepped up to him and said, "Say, Sonny, what time is it?" The little chap did not answer so Mr. Hoppert added, "Look at your nose and tell me what time it is." "Aw, look at your own! Mine ain't running." (Laughter.) I am going to depart a little from the usual practice. They say in most any talk if you listen close enough you can get one point. If you manage to get one out of this, I will be satisfied. I do believe if you will catch what I have to say in these few rambling remarks and the little stuff I have prepared in -writing, possibly I will be able to give you a point or two with reference at least to our own state. I- want to give it to you in a little different way and let you draw your own conclusions as to whether the growers in this state would be 'able to market these apples as we increase in production year by year, which we would certainly expect to be able to do. We have a wonderful State. One hears that' wherever we hear people talking about Nebraska but do many of us really stop to think how great Nebraska is? Here are a few facts gathered from press clippings that might be well to keep in mind when we start out to consider the marketing of Nebraska apples in Nebraska. Nebraska is first in the production of alfalfa. Nebraska is first in production of cattle per capita. Nebraska is third in corn and wheat production. Nebraska has the largest hay market in the world. Nebraska stands third as a meat packing state. Nebraska has the largest biscuit factory in the world. Nebraska has two of the largest butter factories in the world. Nebraska has the largest lead smelter in the world, although no lead is mined in the state. Nebraska has the largest broom factory in the world. </seg>
            <seg id="p490">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Nebraska has the largest index tag factory in the world. Nebraska is third in automobile population per capita. Nebraska has the largest horse market in the world. Nebraska is the only state in the Union that has no bonded in - debtedness, or at any rate was up until 1926. Nebraska has the least illiteracy of any state in the Union. The dairy products of 1926 was worth over $50,000,000. Now if someone had discovered an oil well or an oil field that had produced that much wealth or if a gold mine or some other mineral had been discovered that would produce ?50,000,000 per year I suppose that thousands upon thousands of persons would rush pell mell into the slate hoping to get rich quick out of such an industry. The number of pounds of milk produced is beyond comprehension and Will Maupin says that if it was all loaded into freight cars of 40,000 pounds each it would make up a freight train reaching from Cheyenne, Wyoming, to Omaha, making a freight train about 550 miles long. There are five great staple crops upon which civilization depends and of these five most important crops which are Breadstuffs, Meats, Wool, Sugar, and Cotton, the State of Nebraska is the only state in the Union pro - ducing four of these crops in surplus quantities, Cotton being the only important product that we do not produce. Our butter and egg production every year is worth more than all the gold and silver mined in the United States and its possessions. Our corn crop is worth more than the citrus fruit crops of Cali - fornia. We produce more beef and pork per capita than any other state. Nebraska hens produce annually 300,000,000 dozen or 3,600,000, - 000 pggs which placed end to end would make a line of eggs 100,000 miles long or would reach rour times around the earth at the equator, these eggs are worth more annually than all the steel rails made in the state of Pennsylvania. With all these astounding figures some noted authority has said that the State of Nebraska is only realizing about one-tenth of the possibilities from its fertile soil. Will Maupin has pictured some of the statistics in an interesting manner, in his imagination after compiling figures on Nebraska's pro - ducts he loaded all of the grain and grasses, all of the poultry, eggs and butter, all of the live stock and all of the apples annually produced in the State on freight cars of standard size loaded to full capacity. In order to assemble those cars he had to have plenty of room so in his imagination he took them all over to the vicinity of St. Petersburg in Russia where there is an unlimited space, he arranged to have these cars all coupled up into one train with a huge locomotive and he was all ready to go. From St. Petersburg he sent the train down to the coast of the Baltic Sea, then across Germany, Holland and Belgium, </seg>
            <seg id="p491">Nebraska State Hobticulturai. Society thence across an imaginary bridge to England, across England, then across the Atlantic over an imaginary bridge to New York, from New York to Chicago, from Chicago to Omaha, where of course they stopped for coal and water, and then on across Nebraska to San Francisco. Then he started on across the Pacific Ocean on an imag - inary bridge. 1,750 miles westward into the ocean' and the moment that the locomotive tipped off the bridge 1,750 miles west of San Francisco the caboose with Will Maupin and his old battered type - writer aboard was just leaving St. Petersburg. That train was more than 11,500 miles long and every car filled with products of Nebraska soil raised in a single year. If the engineer on the locomotive wanted to blow the whistle of the engine as a signal to the conductor in the caboose he would have had to blow the whistle nine hours and twenty minutes before he tipped off, if he expected the conductor to hear it. Now what has all of this to do with selling Nebraska apples to Ne - braska? It has a great deal to do with it. In order to sell apples or anything else you must offer what you have to sell to someone who has the money to buy. A study of the value of the products of the State of Nebraska will convince anyone that Nebraska people have the money to buy, of course there are localities that have short crops occasionally, but usually not to any great extent. Now granting, that the people of our State have the money to buy it is up to the apple growers of. Nebraska to offer them the varieties and the quality of apples that they wish to buy. That we can do that there is no doubt, in fact we know from actual experience that we can and we do grow apples in Nebraska that are superior to any apples that are shipped in. We know this because many large buyers of apples especially from the larger cities come here to buy Jonathans and Wiuesaps and other varieties as well. It is true that while we sell a portion of our apples outside 'of the State there are a great many apples shipped into the State. I am reliably informed' that in 1925 there-were 747 cars of apples unloaded in Omaha and only one of them from Nebraska. This is all wrong and is due to the careful grading and packing of the western boxed apples and the co-operative advertising and selling by the western as - sociations. As the production of apples increases in Nebraska it ' will be necessary for the growers here to establish more uniform grading and packing rules and live up to them, then by proper methods of advertising and co-operative- selling there is no good reason why we cannot sell Nebraska apples to Nebraska people. There must be some method or plan worked out that will help the smaller growers to sell 'their apples without resorting to the ruinous, practice of price cutting, there are too -many growers who . become alarmed over stories circulated by irresponsible buyers and sell </seg>
            <seg id="p492">Rkport ok Nkiiraska State Board of Agriculture their apples for whatever they are offered, thereby demoralizing the market for others and receiving no benefit for themselves. I believe that if lie could work out a proper system of distribu - tion that we could sell all the apples raised In the State to home people. The population of t lie State is about 1.500,000 and the commercial apple crop of Nebraska for 1926 was about 75,000 barrels or 225,000 bushels, making something like 22.500,000 apples so you can readily see that this amount of apples would only be about fifteen apples per person per annum, so if we would live up to the slogan of "an apple a day" we would eat them all in fifteen days. Suppose we only cat one apple a day for six 'months in a year we would consume twelve limes the present commercial crop right here in Nebraska. It is true that there are a great many apples raised in the State in orchards other than commercial orchards perhaps more than the com - mercial stock, but the yield is uncertain and the quality such that I do not believe that (hey will cut any great figure in the winter supply. There are 1,630 railway stations In Nebraska and perhaps 1,500 of these stations could use at least one car of apples of say five hundred bushels that would make 750,000 bushels, while the com - mercial crop of 102H was only 225,000 bushels, this shows that there is no great dangtr of overproduction of apples for some time to come. Ii seems to me thai the great problem for us to solve is the prob - lem of distribution. One thing that is going to help distribution is the gravel roads. Nebraska, at this time, has about 2,500 miles of gravel roads and within a year or two this will be doubled and trucks will haul vast quantity of these apples all over the state. We sold more apples this last season to be hauled in trucks than ever before and no doubt the traffic will increase from year to year. Railroad rates are probably not much out of line within the state and aboul the only fault we have to find with the Railway companies is that they do not allow selling apples from cars. This is a great hindrance to apple shippers and I believe is unjust to the growers who desire to send their representatives out with apples grown by themselves. I believe this should be corrected by some measure that would be fair to the growers and to the Railway Companies as well. A great many towns take advantage of the ruling. that shippers are not allowed to sell apples from cars and impose an occupation tax running all the way from $2.50 to $15.00 per day which is unreason - able and in many ca&amp;es prohibitive, and some of our best customers have quit buying and shipping apples on account of these charges and the difficulty of delivering the fruit to the buyer. </seg>
            <seg id="p493">Nebraska State Horticultural Socihty ■ . - ■ ■ ■ All of these things tend to make the prices of apples higher to the consumer without any additional profit to the grower and I think the Legislative Committee should try to have a law passed at this session of the Legislature to give a grower the right to sell his own apples and deliver them to the consumer without the extra cost of unloading and occupation tax. ' While we have been very successful in selling our apples grown by Shubert Bros., and the Loess Land and Orchard Co., at Shubert, to Nebraska people, I believe that as production increases growers will find it to their advantage to sell quantities of good stock packed in barrels to the Eastern and Southern trade or to store blocks of good stock in cold storage houses for winter trade; thereby relieving the seasonal market and prolonging the period of distribution through the winter and spring months. We have found this to our advantage in the past, and I have no doubt that it will continue to be good practice in the future. I think Professor Hoppert gave us a wonderful talk and a lot of information on the western situation. I was glad we had that, especially at this time. While I have never had the opportunity to visit the western ■ apple countries, from the information I have on them, we are in much better position here in eastern Nebraska than they. Mr. Hoppert told us it costs about ninety cents a box to grow those apples in the Wenatchee country, and then it costs I think about sixty cents a box to ship them over here. So you can see with the enormous price they pay for some of this land, their overhead is tremendous. I noticed he coughed when he told one or two of those stories about the price of land|. and I am not surprised he did. It is enough to make a man cough. I think he said some fellow paid $15,000 for ten acres. The bj-igl.nal price is so high and the taxes so heavy and the cost of sprayihg and irrigating in that country is so great, it does not seem to me they could have any profit left. I do not see how they could. I have an idea the apple business will go down in those west - ern countries. Their only hope, it seems to me, would be shipping by water and getting them to the European markets, through the Canal into England; but that iis a long haul. It would be a good deal of expense even by water. | With their enormous expenses of pro - duction and the freight cost to this country, it seems to me we growers in eastern Nebraska surely have a great advantage, and can raise apples and sell them at a price so much cheaper than they can sell from the west, we don't need to be alarmed about over-production and that we might not be able to sell our apples. Possibly you might expect me to have a plan of selling apples. We have our own plan at Shubert. I do not know that we have any special plan. We have been in business for twenty-five years </seg>
            <seg id="p494">Rkpokt of Nkiiha.sk a State Board of Agriculture and we naturally have the selling organization you might expeci to he perfected in that length of time — mostly by experience; by trying In every way to please our customers and be square with them so that they would have confidence and come back for more. At this particular time I feel we are very successful partly be - cause we have the champion lady apple seller in Nebraska with us as a customer. We hope to be able to add many more to our line of customers. We have a few customers who have bought apples of us since we have been selling apples. I think of one man in partic - ular who bought some apples of the first good crop I ever raised, about thirty years ago. We are still selling him apples. I do not think I have seen him for twenty years. He always sends an order for a carload of apples every fall. Tuesday morning I received a draft from him on the last car. I believe that is part of the. secret of our success — the fact we seem to be able to hold our customers. You know there is only one way to do that, and that is to treat them in such a way they leel you are absolutely fair, and can too depended upon to ship the kind of apples they like. If you make a mistake, make it right. That has been our plan, and we expect to continue along that line in future. 1 want to give you a little outline of a plan I do have for the selling of apples in the eastern part of our state. As the production increases, I believe we will have to organize some sort of co-operative selling plan. I believe the hub of the apple business is at Shubert, Nebraska. I think it is generally conceded it is. I believe at this time we should have a man who would have charge of the selling of the apples, we will say from Falls City, possibly to Union. I believe the Banning orchard is as far north as any orchard we could have in our district. I think in each town we should have a second man — a "lieutenant, '■ or whatever you wish to call him — to look after the local situation; but have one man at the head of the selling organ - ization. I do not know how they organize these co-operative associations in the west. We want a co-operative selling force that would be able to sell all of these apples on their merit3 and give everybody every cent coming to him. I think we can to a certain extent, so far as wo would want, eliminate any competition among ourselves. We find in our county we have a few growers who along in the fall get dis - couraged and get cold feet — and the first thing we know they have priced their apples so low that there is no profit left for themselves. We want to stay In line. We do not want to get too high a price. We want to produce these apples so that they may be sold as cheaply as possible, with a good profit to the grower. I believe a few years from now we will work out a co-operative selling association in this part of the country. We have had some </seg>
            <seg id="p495">Neiibaska State Horticultural Soctbty associations in southeastern Nebraska that have not worked too well. We did not have the right kind of men at the head. Be sure you have the right man at. the head of a selling association and in each dist - rict — to be divided around the different towns — with a man who can have his finger on the whole, situation and know how many apples we have to sell in that district, what kind, and who needs them; and we can distribute them in this state in ordinary years. Of course we always, have the cold storage to fall back on where we can put a surplus we do not want to put on the market in the fall. I think if the system of distribution is properly worked out, you can see we could sell a great many times the amount of apples produced here at this. time. I look forward with coniidence into the future of apple growing in Nebraska if we will hold together and work together in future as we have in the past. I thank you. (Applause.) CHAIRMAN DAVIDSON: There was one thing not stressed in these last two talks about our Nebraska competition with western apples. Nothing was said about quality. The western apples do not compare with Nebraska apples, according to my notion, In quality. I do not think there is any part of the world that can raise apples of better quality than we can here. • I think it is an important part that ought to be stressed. The next on the program is, "The Farm Storage House as an Asset to the Nebraska Apple Grower," by Professor C. C. Wiggans, of the Agricultural College. • '■• ■ ~T ■- ■ THE FARM STORAGE HOUSE AS AN ASSET TO THE NEBRASKA APPLE GROWER C. C. WIGGANS ; The advantages of common storage- for the apple grower. I have been somewhat at a loss as to just how to start discussing such a subject. I tried to beg off from your Secretary, saying that I was appearing too regularly on your program and also that I knew little about the subject suggested. He replied by saying that no one else knew anything about it either and hence everything I said woulfl have to be believed. On this basis I consented with the understanding that my few remarks would apply more particularly to conditions in the Missouri Valley region than to other sections of the country. Has the apple grower in the central west been developing a reasonable profit or labor income during the past few years? This, </seg>
            <seg id="p496">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture I believe can be answered either yes or no depending upon just how good a grower a man is or how good a business manager he happens to be. In the main, however, the apple grower hasn't any very great grievance about his business when he compares it with other agricultural lines. A very important question with him though is how to increase the profits which he has been enjoying. In order to get possibly a little better idea of the whole situation let's think just a few minutes about the total apple production in the U. S. I want to review very briefly a magazine article I read a few days ago. In this article R. G. Phillips, Secretary of the Inter - national Apple Shippers' association, presents some rather startling figures. According to his statements census figures on apple tree population are misleading since today we are having the greatest apple production and conservation that the world has ever seen. Times have changed. Twenty years ago the commercial production on the Pacific Coast was negligible. New York produced and stored the major portion of the commercial crop. In 1923 the Coastal States shipped over 48,000,000 boxes and in 1924 over half of the com - mercial crop was produced there. The Shenandoah-Cumberland region has also been increasing its production through the maturing of tremendous new acreages. Other - sections, too, have been producing more apples on fewer trees and altogether the production per tree has greatly changed. Shipping figures for 1922-25 were 48% greater than for 1911-14, another sign of increased production. Storage figures show that nearly double the barrels or boxes are stored today when compared with the period 10-15 years ago. Twenty r five years ago box holdings in storage were practically nil, in 1923 25,000,000 and in 1925, 21,000,000 boxes. Turning now to population, since 1000 the total United States population has increased A2 r / r and the storage holdings of apples over 400%. From 1911 to 1923 population increased 18%, the commercial crop nearly 48% and storage holdings 80% to 85%. In other words, during the past 10 to 15 years an increased production of 48% has been thrown on an increased consuming public of 18%. To. be sure exports have increased materially but even so undoubtedly there must be a larger per capita consumption now than in the former period. But you say how do all these facts and figures apply to storage of apples in common storage cellars? Well, I hope I can show you at least a limited application before I get through. Continuing further, the authority mentioned above states "There never was a time when commercial apple production and conservation are so great as they are today. Consumption has increased more rapidly than population. There is a vast difference, however, between con- </seg>
            <seg id="p497">Nebraska State Horticultural Socihty sumption and consumption at a profit. Providence can market an over supply on no other basis than at a loss. Supply and demand govern." • • Mr. Phillips then goes on analyzing the situation further and gives as his solution of. the problem the necessity for better packs. Good apples are never too plentiful even though they are too many good and poor apples. He says it is time to cease searching for the smallest cider apples, the windfalls, the wormy, the diseased and the frozen stock. Such practices eventually will lead to the ruin of the industry. He cites an example of present day practices the record from one barrel, representative of a 5000 barrel lot, secured on a mid-western market. This barrel of 1%-inch Ben Davis contained 1102 apples. Number showing worm stings. ; 435 . Windfalls and bruised i ; 266 Stem punctures, curculio, etc ; 171 . Semi-sound but of poor color 230 Such packs will of course ruin any market. In 1925 similar practices were quite general throughout apple producing sections. The Northwest shipped windfalls, cookers and even 315 size; the middle - west, drops, culls, sun blistered; Michigan, frozen stock, ciders, wind - falls; New England, hall-pecks, drops; and New York, tree run, frozen, windfalls and diseased stock. The effect that these methods had upon the 1926 markets is fresh in the memory of many apple growers. But how and where do such criticisms apply to Nebraska problems is the next question raised. Nebraska growers are always able to dispose of their product regardless of quality, you say. A large undeveloped market exists within a short distance west of the producing centers and dealers there often prefer tree run bulk stuff. You logically ask why not give them what they want. All these statements are admitted and I would not argue for any immediate change of the present methods, and yet I cannot escape the conviction that eventually even the Nebraska grower is going to be forced to pay more attention to his packs and the distribution of his marketing period and it is at this point that storage cellars will become important. Greater utilization of sound, undergrade fruit for cider, vinegar and other by-products will be practiced then also. . ■ , And now let us go ahead on the general topic assigned, namely, Just how valuable would a first class common storage be for the Nebraska apple man? Frankly, I'll have to tell you I don't know. I can see several very distinct advantages for an orchardist who pos - sesses or has access to one. Oh the other hand there are some draw - backs on account of the capital tied up and also because to get the very best results rather close supervision is necessary. First, just what is meant by common storage? The ordinary use of this term applies to the utilization of natural air temperatures to </seg>
            <seg id="p498">RKPOBT OF NKBKAHKA STATE BOAUI) OF AGUICI-I.TURE hold the temperature of the stored product as near the desired point as possible. This is done by taking air from the outside into the storage room when temperatures outside are lower and excluding out - ride air if it is warmer. Successful storage, however, requires not only proper temperatures but also the regulation of humidity and ventilation (to carry away injurious gases). Of course, the lower the temperature, until the danger point is reached, the longer and better will the fruit keep. In contrast to the air-cooled storage mentioned above, we also have the cold storage. This usually applies to storage in which the low temperatures are maintained by some sort of mechanical refrig - eration The cooling in such cases is brought about usually by allow - ing compressed gas of some kind to expand in the storage chamber thus taking the heat out of the air. It necessarily calls for some sort of a pump or compressor and may be combined with a so-called br ne system wherp the expansion of the gas cools the brine and the brine "the storage chamber. Such a system is expensive to maintain except on a large scale and one author states that it is uneconomical to use with less than 25,000 bushels of late maturing fruits, and is therefore beyond the reach of the average grower. Cellar or common storage has been in use. of course, for cen - turies natural caves having been used for such purposes even in pre - historic times. Some of the old long-keeping varieties such as Ben Davis and Winesap can be kept very successfully by such means. Later demands, however, call for other and poorer keeping sorts to be avail - able over longer periods and hence other means have been introduced aside from the ordinary unheated cellar. This accounts in part or cold storage development and also for the improvement of cellar storages. Common storage is most successful where the temperature most quickly reaches a low point. Since inside temperature depends upon outside temperature this means, then, that as one goes north common, storage can be used to a greater extent and especially if one used it for keeping fruits over long periods. Not only should the fruit be kept at a desirable temperature but it should reach this point as soon, as possible afier picking and on this point is where common storage presents its weakest link. When good storage temperatures are once secured then common storage becomes as satisfactory practically as any other type. They can be easily ventilated so as to carry off de - structive gases and arrangements can also be made to properly humidify the air Cold storages also should be planned with these two points in mind although as a matter of fact usually.no suitable arrangements are provided. Now as to tl&gt;e principle upon which cold storage depends. Every - one knows that cold air is heavier than warm air and therefore seeks </seg>
            <seg id="p499">NBIIRASKA STATK HOUTICTI.TL'RAI. SOCIBTY a lower level. When cold air comes in contact with warm fruit some heat is removed from the fruit and the air rises, crowded out by cooler air. If this exchange continues long enough the fruit temperature reaches the same point as that of the air. To provide for such air changes, then air inlets and outlets are necessary. Inlets are usually arranged at the outsides of the storage room and at or below the false floor level, while the outlet is found leading from the center of the room ceiling clear to the top of the building. Specifications are now available showing just how large and how many openings are needed to provide a given number o£ air changes per hour. Installation of fans materially speed up air circulation. This is also affected by wind, difference between temperature of fruit and outside air and by the length of the outlet flue. All openings, of course, are provided with adjustable shutters so that air exchange can be prevented when - ever the outside air is either too warm or too cold. The next question which arises is just what temperatures can be maintained under common storage cellar conditions. The answer to this depends upon not only the minimum outside temperature but also upon the type of building used, method of construction, insulation and the system of management followed. Some experimental work- upon (he relation of inside to outside temperature carried on in Pennsylvania show that the cellar temperature corresponds in a general way to the mean of the outside temperature while from Indiana comes the report that storage rooms cannot be cooled lower than 5 to 10 degrees above the minimum] night temperatures in the early season. Marshall states that Michigan storage houses can be maintained at not more than 5 degrees above the daily minimum or from 3 to 6 degrees less than the daily mean under good management. Temperatures com - parable to cold storage temperatures ordinarily cannot be reached be - fore late November there. Some daily fluctuations were found to occur due possibly as much to introduction of new lots of fruit as to any other cause. The conditions so far as the daily minimum temperatures in Ne - braska are concerned are indicated on the accompanying chart. These are platted for a ten-year period and show the average prevailing conditions at Nebraska City and Falls City, between September 10 and October 30. Judging.from the statements made above one might expect a temperature of about 50 degrees to be available around October 1, which by the first of November would be 40 degrees or slightly below. The proof o£ the pudding is naturally always in the eating and so the next consideration should be, •will apples keep under common storage conditions? Again it is necessary to refer to other states. Workers in the Pacific Northwest report apples in good condition after several months. In Pennsylvania it was found that due to high </seg>
            <seg id="p500">Rkpoht of Nkrraska State Board of Agriculture initial temperatures the fruit softened quickly (ripening as much in cne month as in four months at 32 degrees), but held throughout the season with little loss. In general, it may be stated that apples suitable for cold storage have been held in common storage under good management with as little loss as in cold storage except for the fact that there was more loss of weight due to wilting. 00 3&lt;&gt;pf /O SeprA/p So/it 2V QcT9 ftf/9 Oct. 29 \j\ I \\ A A __ :_vi Y\M|h ' v • &lt;\ ft ' \ Jvrrayf Pa//y AS/n Temperature '• ( ", ; 'l/» ;/*, I from scot. 10 1 1 vo* i /9/7 . 9.?6 \ ; •. : '.v; •, v nustirr &gt;. ; • I V ''\x/A: &gt; V \ 7 1 1 1 L : — 1_ Fig. 17.- -Air cooled storages will be very useful for the late winter varieties. The nisht temiH-raturc-s are sufficiently low when these aru harvested to provide the necessary low temperatures. It is not my purpose to go into details concerning the construction of these storage houses. Suffice it to say that success or failure may be due to proper selection of materials and methods of construction. Insulation against not only heat in the fall but low temperatures in winter is very necessary and there is a wide range of insulation values found among our common building materials. The merits of under - ground versus above ground construction need to be looked into as well as the value of insulated and false floors. Ventilation is one feature of common storage which is very im - portant since upon this, combined with air temperatures, we must depend for getting the fruit cooled off. The use of fans and false floors, number and size of intakes and outlets, the rate and quantity of air-flow, etc., all should be considered. If, as has been done, we assume that an average of 50 cubic feet of air is required to cool a bushel of apples one degree, when there is a temperature difference of 4 or 5 degrees, then 25 air changes are necessary to lower a bushel of fruit one degree. The equivalent of three air changes per hour then, would probably not reduce the fruit temperature over one degree </seg>
            <seg id="p501">Nebraska State Hobticultubal Society per higbt under ordinary conditions. . Thus it" is seen how important some of these factors become. Humidity is another matter. Apples held at 60 to 73% humidity showed wilting in Pennsylvania, but those at $0% were perfect. Var- ' ieties present considerable differences but it is generally considered' that about 85% humidity is necessary. Above 90% mold growths become serious. Sprinkling the floor, use of soaked blankets, etc., may be resorted to if the fruit begins to wilt. Earthen floors are very satisfactory in helping to maintain good humidity but may be a disadvantage from the insulation standpoint. The use of proper containers and stocking them to allow proper air circulation is still another side of the story. Along with these might also be considered the methods of handling the fruit before it. reaches the storage; ways, and means of sorting the fruit at the cellar and. many other problems arising in connection with such i proposition. And now with all of this of just what practical advantage would such an adjunct be to a Nebraska apple grower? Could he afford to invest from 25 to 40c per bushel of capacity in such a structure? A storage charge of 10c per bushel is equivalent to a return of 25% on the investment according to one writer. One grower in Michigan states that in any one of three different seasons his profits equalled the cost of the building while another said it paid for itself the first season. Such cellars are recommended . for Massachusetts and the Pacific Northwest. Why would not they be of value here? I am afraid I can give you no definite information on these points even though I do have some notions about them. When our Union Fruit Farm orchard gets old enough to produce sizeable crops it is our plan 'to install a storage of some sort there using in connection with it possibly a small capacity mechanical refrigeration outfit. Such an outfit properly equipped with coils, fans, air channels, etc., could ■ be used to cool off the entire house or only certain portions of it so that lower temperatures would be available early in the season. Such equipment would be of immense' value if one is producing summer and fall fruits as well as late keeping sorts. When the time comes' we may need some help from this Society to put across our program. We may be mistaken in some of our ideas but we desire to find out&gt; for all of you at one time rather than letting each grower make his own experiment. And just what would we expect to accomplish by such a plant? In the first place let me disabuse your mind of any idea that we would expect to store all of our good fruit under such conditions. Recalling the facts presented at the beginning of this paper it would be our intention rather to keep the poorer sorts out of cold storage. This cellar would become then the temporary storage place of the lower </seg>
            <seg id="p502">Rkpokt ok Nebraska State Board or Agriculture grade stuff, for which it would have considerable value because o£ the better preservation and increased length of marketing season. Also the advantage of having a place where fruit could be placed under cool temperature conditions immediately after picking but before packing would be considerable. The value in connection with berries, grapes, cherries, plums and summer apples has already been men - tioned. And in addition to all of these would be its experimental aspects. To the man who markets a considerable portion of his crop direct the cellar storage would probably prove of greater value than to a large grower who usually sells through jobbers or wholesalers. And rven if one sells in carlots to dealers here and there a place where he might store 10 to 15 cars of fruit would always be a safety valve in times of poor markets or slack demand. Another feature about the common storage house which I have not previously mentioned is the use of the upper floor or floors as a packing house or package or machinery storage. These consider - ations alone might be of considerable value. By this time I am sure all of you will agree that niy opening statement that I knew little, about this subject is undoubtedly true. If I have started you to thinking a little about its possibilities, how - ever, I am content. For further information let me refer you to Farmers' Bulletin Xo. 852 and Michigan Special Bulletin No. 146. Also the last rpport of the Iowa State Horticultural Society contains a paper by Fred Randau of Ames, Iowa, upon his experiences with a common apple storage. I recommend these articles for your con - sideration. Discussion THE CHAIRMAN': I have a hunch that fans would help in stor - age. I had a little experience this fall. I had a good outside cave, well ventilated. I picked a car of Kiefer pears and put in that cave. We had a week of warm, damp weather, and how those pears did sweat. They ripened up quickly. They did not hold up as well as usual. I think they got too wet and warm. If I could have turned a fan on, I think it would have been a benefit. MR. WIGGAXS: Undoubtedly it would be an advantage. MR. SHUBERT: You must keep your pears in a dry place. We have had a little experience with Kiefer pears. I had a big tree that grew fine ones. I thought the best thing to do was to put them down cellar. We would take two or three baskets down, and it would not be more than sixty days until they were all rotted. The last two years we have picked them and carried them on a back porch and covered them with something and kept them dark and moderately </seg>
            <seg id="p503">Nkiskaska State Horticultural Sociotv cool, and dry. I thought the Kiefe'r pear was absolutely no account. If you handle them right, they are a pretty good fruit, after all. Q. My _wife used the last Kiefer pears last week. THE CHAIRMAN: I keep them nicely until Christmas without trouble in an outer cave. The door Is open when the weather is above freezing. This year, a few days after they were put in we had a week of warm, damp weather, and the water stood in drops all over them. I could not control it. Next we have Mr. Guy Shubert, who will talk about selling apples in paper cartons. SELLING EXTRA. FANCY APPLES IX TAPER CARTONS f GUY SHUBEKT, Shubert, Nebraska Mr. Davidson" and Friends: I have no paper prepared, but I ex - pect to make a few remarks: It is getting late. I want to gay one thing. We have been marketing our apples in regular channels — most of them in bulk and barrels. The idea of this small carton is to convey the thought to Nebraska people that we do. have quality, in taste or .flavor. That is one of the reasons we are attempting to place this small carton on the market. We want to find out just what the people want. If they want a package smaller than a bushel box or basket, we will be glad to furnish it. It is an experiment with us. We have had very little experience, and only put up a few hundred this year. We .are trying to distribute them as widely as we can. We have very favorable comments, and some not so favorable. That is what we are after. We want to know what people want, and to sell' the idea Nebraska does have quality, apples. • Discussion Q. What has been your selling methods on the cartons? MR. GUY SHUBERT: We have not attempted to place it on the market commercially. We used the radio station to advertise this . package and our products just a little this fall, but not with the idea of making money in a commercial way. . The idea vras to be able to get a wide distribution. I might say some of them have gone out of our territory— some as far .as Canada and some to New York and Pennsylvania. That is not what we are trying to do. We would like to put them out in Nebraska as widely as we could and get as many expressions as possible, whether favorable or unfavorable. THE CHAIRMAN: I think Mr. Shubert is doing good work in showing people we do have good apples. I often go in the stores and ask, "What have you in good Nebraska apples? I like the flavor," </seg>
            <seg id="p504">Rki-oim of NeiihanKa State Board of Acriculture They say, "We cannot get good apples in Nebraska." I do not agree with them. MR. HOPPERT: Some of the growers on this trip reported they were selling their whole crop in packages like that— not a small crop, but of five or ten thousand bushels. They have lots of prospective customers on some main highways between our cities, so that they have a chance to sell fancy fruit at a high price. It gave me the idea possibly there is a chance for similar selling methods in this section. MR. GUY SHUBERT: You take the big towns, and there is no place in the household establishment for storage of fruit. Now, this idea of the smaller package has two advantages: first, It advertises the Nebraska apple; second, it makes available to people who have little storage space a carton of apples fit to eat. There are very few establishments will handle a bushel of apples. I did expect to describe the package and something of the cost of putting it up, but I thought it was late and I would not take your time. The package I passed around contains one peck in cubic inche3, or about ten pounds, net, of apples. In order to get distribution, we advertised it over KMA at Shen - andoah, as fancy Nebraska Jonathans, Delicious, and Wine Saps. We postpaid them in the first and second zones, for one dollar, which gave us a price of 8 4 cents. From a commercial standpoint, I do not believe the radio would be the thing for us to use In distributing those apples. We did it for an advertising feature and to get them scattered as widely as we could. We have had an opportunity to sell all we have to one place in Omaha; but we would rather distribute them around as much as we could. Last fall the roadside trade would possibly buy two or three bushels of winter apples, and a small package of Jona - thans or Grimes or Delicious. In the fall that carton would be sold for about 75 cents. The count varies according to the variety and size. Our Delicious run around 17 to 19, and our Jonathans vary from 25 to 28, and in some cases, 30; and the Wine Saps run around 28.

We do not wish to be late getting started. You had best come toward the front and make way for those who come in later. The first speaker was recently from the Kansas Agricultural College. Nebraska acquired him, and he now has charge of our sheep. Mr. A. D. Weber, a man whom you should all meet, and a man you will be glad to number among your friends. . THE BREEDS OP SHEEI» : By PROFESSOR A. D. WEBER, Agricultural College Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen. The subject that has been assigned to me for discussion is, "The Breeds of Sheep." It is not my purpose to recommend any particular breed of sheep. I know that some men pref.er Oxfords, and some Shropshires, and others Southdowns. I do believe it would be well to take up each breed and point out a few of its • weaknesses as well as its good points. It isn't the purpose of those of us who are interested in sheep here at the Ag. College to advise everybody to start raising sheep, but if you are interested in sheep, have some knowledge of them or are willing to acquire that knowledge, we are always glad to assist you in any way possible. There are many farms that could handle sheep that are not now doing so. The farm flock is gaining in favor </seg>
            <seg id="p512">Rkpobt ok Nkiiraska State Boaiid of Agricit.tltie iu I was just talking to some men in Omaha yesterday and they tell me that this last year there were considerably more native sheep marketed in Omaha than in the year preceding. That means that there are more farm flocks in Nebraska than there have been in previous years. Each year we receive many inquiries regarding the best breed of sheep. There are a few farmers loyal to each breed of sheep even in Nebraska, if we may judge from inquiries for pure bred rams. Wo maintain flocks of five breeds of sheep and sell rams of all breeds to Nebraska farmers. Men Disagree on the Merits of a Certain Breed Perhaps some of you wonder why we have so many breeds. I might say that the reason we have s.o many breeds of sheep is prob - ably for the same reason that all men could not agree, on the same wife. We have different ideas on the same subject, and those dif - ferent ideas make the world go around. I might say, that some of the men who started these breeds of sheep had different ideas regard - ing the most desirable type of sheep. Then, too, they were developed in various sections of the country and under different conditions. These men tried to evolve breeds that were best suited for their particular conditions. One of the breeds that we are showing you today is the "Ram - bouillet." This breed is suited to some conditions but I do not be - lieve that it is well suited to Nebraska conditions. We will start out by showing you a "Southdown." (A specimen of the Southdown breed was then led out and ex - hibited to the audience.) The Southdown is to the sheep world what the Angus cattle is to the cattle world. The Southdown is not a young breed by any means. Even though you may not want to raise Southdowns, you no doubt, appreciate their outstanding characteristics. The South - downs are probably blockier and lower-set than any other breed. You may ask why there are not more Southdowns in Nebraska. One reason is that the ewes will average about 130 pounds when matured, and the Oxfords will average around 200 pounds. It is true that the Southdown will mature at an earlier age than other breeds but it won't make the weight for the age. They are not as big, and they don't have the substance. That is perhaps the main reason why there are not more of them raised in this state. Now the Southdown is a very easy breed to identify. You will notice they are close to the ground, and as I said, not much daylight under them. The ears are small and if you have any trouble in distinguishing a Southdown from a Shropshire, you </seg>
            <seg id="p513">Nbiiiunka I.mi'jiovki) LiyKSTOoic Bkkkiwrh' Association usually can do so by the color. The Southdown carries its ears up quite alert: The Shropshire doesn't carry the ears as erect but you can telj more by the color, mainly the color over the ears, around the face and in below the knees and hocks. The Southdown is what is called mouse brown, varying from light to dark. The Southdown has a good quality but short fleece so it doesn't shear very heavily That is another criticism. About five to eight pounds per head is the aver - age. This specimen here is the kind that the packer likes, just as he likes Aberdeen Angus cattle and Berkshire hogs. That was a yearling ewe. Now here we have a Shropshire that is a last spring lamb. (A Shropshire specimen was then led into th* ring and exhibited.) You can immediately see some o£ the differences, especially in. size. You will notice its ears. It is not nearly so dark as the Hampshire. The Shropshire is more completely wooled over the head than any other breed. The wooling over the head is a crit - icism that some offer against this breed of sheep. They are noted for prolificacy and mature early. They are criticised at times for not being as hardy and of as strong constitution as some other breeds. They have a very good fleece. They, are not as heavy as the Oxford or the Hampshire but are. lower set and more compact. They are big enough and probably come nearer to being just halfway between what the packer wants and what the producer wants than any other breed. I would say. on an average over the country that if we had 100 Shrop - shire, ewes and 100 Hampshire ewes, we would probably get more lambs from the Shropshires than from the Hampshires. Here is an Oxford. (Another specimen was then displayed to the audience.) Remember how he looks. The Oxford is the result of a cross between the Cotswold and the Hampshire. An Oxford is larger than a Shropshire. A distinctive thing about the Oxford is of course its size. It is a little bit rugged and rough. They don't fatten as easily as some other breeds. Another distinctive thing about the Oxford is that, they wool down further on the face than the Hamp - shire and not as far as the Shropshire. You will note the top-knot. When you see a sheep, that has that top-knot but looks like a Shrop - shire, it is usually an Oxford. The Oxford is perhaps a heavier shearer of any of our breeds that we have here. When you take into consider - ation its size and its ruggedness, it is particularly valuable for cross - ing with ones native ewes or western ewes. This specimen is a spring lamb. A fellow came around the other day and saw these Rambouillets. (Another specimen having been driven out to be shown.) He said, "What the devil dp you want to keep those kind of sheep for?" The Rambouillets have a place on Nebraska farms. There are a few peo - ple who want to keep Rambouillets because of their hardiness and their wonderful fleece. They have a head . that shows quality and they </seg>
            <seg id="p514">Rki'ORT or Nkiihaska Statk Board of Agricui.turk are rugged and very good feeders. The Rainbouillet is used more on the ranches. Sometimes you have heard about "B" and the "C" types or Rambouillet. That merely refers to the number or wrinkles. If they have very lew, if any, wrinkles, they are called the "C" type; if they have some back here (speaker indicating) they are called the "13" type. The Oxford is the result of a cross between the Cotswold and the Hampshire. Here is the top-knot on the Oxford that about seventy - five years ago camp from the Cotswold. I wouldn't recommend the Cotswold for Nebraska conditions. They don't fatten as readily as some oiher breeds. The fleece is long and coarse and resembles locks. They have a good back and are bigger than most other breeds. It is a big sheep yet it is not as good in the quality of fleece as the other breeds I have shown you. I would not recommend it for farm flocks in Nebraska. II does have a place on the ranches, and there is some demand in the west for a cross between the Cotswold and the Ram - bouillet. This specimen you see here is the only one we have and Is kept for demonstration purposes so that visitors may see what the f'olswold really looks like. Hampshire Slieep arc Hugged and Prolific The one now being brought out is another spring lamb. It is the Hampshire. The Hampshire is the blackest in the face and ear, and lias a good constitution. It is really a larger breed as far as weight is concerned. Its lambs are the largest at birth and make very rapid gains. They are adapted to Nebraska conditions for use in farm flocks. I don't know of any breed that will do more good than the Hampshire. The Hampshire doesn't shear as much as the Oxford. In answer to the Question just asked as to what extent the Hamp : Rbire is used in the western country, I might say that our best flocks of Hanipshires are found in the west. The best flocks are in Oregon, Idaho and (he far west and they bring a high price in the sales ill Itah. The best flocks of Rambouillets are also in the west. Tlve best flocks of Shropshires are in the east. For farm flocks in Ne-; braska I would say that we could safely recommend the Hampshire, the Oxford or the Shropshire. Any one of those three breeds can be used with just ordinary ewes of a western breed. The Rambouillet could be recommended for a limited use to build up farm flocks. Those three breeds are all well adapted to Nebraska conditions. To some extent the Southdown is too small, the Cotswold is too rough and rugged .and not suited to farm flocks where you want to get lambs off early in the spring. I am not particularly recommending that any of you go into the sheep business but if you do, these are some of the things that it would be well to keep in mind when selecting a breed. </seg>
            <seg id="p515">Nebraska Improvku Livestock Breeders' Association .PROF. DERRICK, Chairman: The next speaker on our program is a young man, a dyed-in-the-wool sheep man who has had a great deal of experience in the particular phase of the industry upon which he will speak. His subject, "Lambing Out Western Ewes." The man, Aaron J.- Claassen, Beatrice, Nebraska. LAMBING OUT WESTERN EWES AARON" J. CLAASSEN, Beatrice Mr. Chairman and Gentle nen: In discussing the topic assigned to me, namely "Lambing Out Western Ewes," I wish to say right from the start that I anl not 'here to eulogize the western ewe; While we have handled several bunches of Western ewes with success in the past it seems increasingly difficult to get a grade o£ ewes good enough for this purpose at a price low enough to have assurance of an ulti - mate profit. Right here let m; state that sheep raising is one of the most uniformly profitable enterprises that a farmer can engage in. I cannot understand why these young farmers that wish to get ahead do not engage more in this line. It is true that sheep raising takes ■some specialized knowledge arid especially for the beginner, close at - tention to details but it surely is more agreeable to cash in on know - ledge than hard work alone. Income From Sheep Comes in at Handy Time This year was another year when the revenue from our sheep came in very handy. The corn crop in our part of the state was very short, almost a total failure and yet our lambs which we turned into the corn fields the 10th of August came out fat enough the latter part of October, to top the market' at 14c per pound. We had 214 lambs and figure the 50 acres they pastured on would not have made more than 10 bushels to the acre. Our .gross income from our 200 ewes was approximately $2,500. I figure that the feed derived from those 50 acres of corn returned us .close to $20 an acre, which is more than most people will get for their nubbins this year. Wej will go more into detail later on and tel} you how we handled these sheep this year. Buy Ewes Late in August ■• Coming back to our subject of lambing. out Western ewes. We get these ewes the latter part! of August if possible. It is our aim to get the lambs early, say the) middle of January, so that both lambs ' and ewes can be shipped out together in May or June, before the </seg>
            <seg id="p516">Rkport of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture market breaks too much on account of Western lambs and sheep com - ing in. You should get good big ewes weighing not less than 100 pounds, and better 110 pounds, and showing some quality. Put them on good pasture. Plenty of good shade and a cool place during the hot days will facilitate early breeding. It will pay to use very high grade or pure bred rams. We have had best results from Shropshires and Hampshires. Turn them in during the night and separate them in the morning and let them rest and eat during the day. It pays to take good care of them and of the flock too, otherwise the lambs will come scat - tered out in a disappointing way. We prefer to take out the rams after five or six weeks at the most. At this time probably eighty to ninety per cent of the ewes are with lamb. If we have a flock of these ewes that have no lambs, we ship them soon after the others have lambed '•' '/ ■'■ "'' '■ ■ " ■l^^^^^^^^flfitfKli ;*•'" ''''^ " '■■""■ - ' r" 'i F *\Z/ J^^- The practice nf lamhitiK nut western "wos is bocominit quite Kcneral throuKiiout Nebraska. There is always a demand for nicely finished early sprinpr lambs. They are fat and usually bring a good price at this time, other - wise we include them in the first load to be shipped. After the ewes are bred in the fall and the weather is cooler we pasture them in stubble fields, corn fields, alfalfa fields and wherever they find suit - able feed. After such feed is gone we feed them once a day by scat - tering out the hay and feed in the pasture. The best feeds we have ever found for ewes are alfalfa hay and sheaf oats. These feeds can easily be scattered out from the pack in the far part of the pasture, </seg>
            <seg id="p517">Nebraska Imphovkd Livestock Breeders' Association forcing the ewes to take exercise. This is absolutely necessary as Western ewes especially are subject to a disease known as "lambing disease." If the ewes are not exercised one is liable to lose from 5 to 15 per cent of the best ewes, almost always those that carry twins suffer from this malady. An ewe should walk at least % of a mile every day during the last 3 months of gestation except in stormy weath - er. It is a good rule not to expose your sheep to soaking rains and wet snows during the winter months, as this often causes pneumonia. Early Lambs Demand -Good Shelter It you want to raise early lambs, you must have a good tight shed or barn to keep the flock in at night during lambing time. Noth - ing for me is so disgusting as to have 5 or 6 lambs on hand in the morning whose mothers disown them, which often is the case if one of a pair of twins strays away from its mother. It is best to keep (wins in a small pen with the mother ewe for a day or so till they are strong enough to follow her around and learn to get nourishment. After lambing, always see that the teats are open so that the little fellows can get nourishment readily. At about three weeks the lambs should be castrated and the tails docked. We find that an emasculator is by far the best tool for this purpose. At this time one should in - crease the grain ration of the ewes and also fix a creep for the lambs where they can go and eat a little grain and green alfalfa hay. Nice green alfalfa hay is about the first thing they will learn to nibble. As a grain ration, we feed one-third pats and three fourths coarse ground corn and 10% oil meal. We keep all the grain they want to eat in those creeps until they go to market. Be sure that this grain is- always clean, sweet and appetizing. After the lambs once eat grain they gain rapidly and should be ready to market in four months to - gether with the ewes which completes the transaction. It takes quite a bit of special equipment and work and considerable grain for both ewes and lambs, to finish them to market early and successfully. Must Be Careful When Buying Western K\ves It is a more or less specialized business and .1 would not advise the average farmer to undertake it or buy western ewes. The main reason for early lambs is' to get away from the stomach worm which on old sheep pastures will infest the lambs early in the summer. By getting .fresh western ewes in the fall and shipping everything out in the spring one would get away to some extent from this pest. How-' ever, it is getting increasingly difficult to get ewes free from worms, due probably to the fact that the western ranges are kept heavily stocked with sheep and we understand that on some ranges stomach and tape worms are getting to be a problem too. I would advise the average farmer to get from 20 to 50 good native ewes for a start and </seg>
            <seg id="p518">RipoitT ok Nkhuaska Statk Board ok Aomcri.TTiRE then build up his Hook (n the desired number from his own ewe lambs These native euvs will shear a better fleece and I bellove are hardier and healthier than the western ewe of today. Most farmers if they care to handle sheep can do so only as a side line. Sheep will fit. in very well this way and be mighty profitable too. That is the way we have handled them the last two years, as our main business is raining hogs. Hogs and sheep go together very well if you have good tight, fences which you should have anyway for hogs. Sheep will eat your surplus alfalfa hay and you can let the Iambs have the run or the corn field before you turn in the hogs. The lambs we told you about at the beginning were lambed in April. For late lambing a shed open to th? south is sufficient. They need much less attention during lamb - ing time. As you do not wish to push these later lambs for an early market anyway you need feed but very little grain to either ewes or iambs. Fight the Stomach Worms One thing you must do however, and don't you forget it, and that is to treat ewes and lambs, for stomach worm once a month from Mav to September, or until you turn the lambs into the corn field. This is absolutely necessary where you cannot rotate the pasture. We have found the tobacco solution the most satisfactory giving each ewe three to four ounces and each lamb two ounces of a 1% percent solu - tion, two ounces to a gallon of water, of black leaf 40. Keep the sheep f fom feed and water IS hours before giving the remedy, 6 to 12 hours after. We use a gun of this sort for this work. This will successfully lake care of the stomach worm problem. Our lambs last summer grazed on an old heavily infested blue grass pasture without a single loss and as I already mentioned, topped the market with a very light son. These late lambs are ready to wean about the beginning of August when you can put them right in the corn field till they are ready to market. The lambs will weigh about 80 pounds the begin - ning of November which is heavy enough so they will bring a good return, even your later lambs will be heavy enough so they will not go as culls, and the price for fat lambs is usually good at this time of the year. We feel that this is a very satisfactory and profitable way to handle sheep on the farm. I'UOF. \V. \V. DERRICK, Chairman: Boys and girls like sheep. Iloy.s and girls of today are farmers of tomorrow. Mr. O. O. Wag - gener. who works with boys and girls livestock clubs will now address tis on the subject. "Sheep Work for Boys." </seg>
            <seg id="p519">NEIIRANKA I.MI'HOVKll LfVKHTOck BllKKUKRS" ASSOCIATION SHEEP WORK FOU BOYS By MR. O. O. WAGGENEIt, Agricultural College Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: About a month ago while attending the International Livestock Exposition at Chicago, it was my privilege to talk with the superintendent of the tractor department of a certain well-known and popular harvester company, and after he had told me of some different phases of the business of making "iron horses," I asked him what he considered (o be his most difficult pro - blem in building, satisfactory service and long life into his machines. What do you suppose he said? "The ignorance of the operator:" "Why, 1 : he said, "we can build air cleaners, and gasoline filters and oil purifiers, and crank shafts and pistons, and bearings that are well nigh perfect, but when it comes to the book of rules for operation we're stumped. No matter if we print them in 17 different languages using a dozen striking colors and all the persuasion at the command of all of our corps of advertising experts we. simply cannot seem to make tractor users understand how to properly use and take care of their machines,". . It all seemed rather strange to me but none the less plausible and since then I've been wondering if the same thing doesn't apply in a number of other industries. For instance, the manager of one of the large Omaha packing plants said the other day that what their company most needs today is energetic and capable men who understand the business and can accept responsibility. The sales manager wants good salesmen, the successful hospital is built around a good doctor. The church must have a good preacher. The school must have a good superintendent; the factory depends on its management; the army needs a general; and last but not least the farms of America must have operators who understand their business and like it. Spend Too Much Time on "Things" I sometimes think we spend too much time on things, and not enough on men. While it would be foolish to minimize the value of livestock, equipment, and farm buildings, yet I firmly believe that the American .farmers themselves are of more importance to their country and to its agriculture than all of -their livestock and equipment com - bined. Imagine two l&amp;O's here if you can — one not even fenced and equipped with 4 cat-hamed horses and. a walking plow, the other well fenced, equipped with ?10,000 in buildings and that much more in good livestock and equipment. Now we'll put a good hard working, frugal industrious and experienced farmer who thoroughly understands his business on the unfenced poorly equipped one and a lazy incom - . petent spendthrift on the good quarter, and keep them there for a period of ten years. In that time under normal average conditions </seg>
            <seg id="p520">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture the thing would have almost reversed Itself.

We do not Plan through sheep club work to materially improve the quality of sheep ,n Nebraska nor the methods of care for sheep in Nebraska but we ,lo hope through it to inspire boys and girls with a desire to understand the peculiar management and care that sheep require and to know and appreciate the value of better bred sheep. Once that is accomplished I have no fear as to what course they will follow. "Oh, but," you say, "these boys take a couple of ewes and feed then, a few month, and think they know, all there is to learn about sheep." Xo! Most decidedly, x 0 ! If a boy cannot get above the two ewes class we consider him a club failure. The successful club boys are those who start with say two ewes and carry the project on and on until they have farm flock stage. If a boy likes sheep club work we try harder to keep him going on to bigger things than we did to c-nroll him originally. A larger per cent of the successful club boys are every year coming to the Agricultural College to learn all they can about this work. They began as club boys but are in college here now. And is it not also true that a boy who even handles only two ewes and their lambs for one season, although that is not what Is recommended, knows more about the game than if he had handled none at all? I think he does. Club Lessons Are Future Trouble Preventers Another common objection to club work is that about one-fourth of those who enter drop out without finishing. True— but is this not also true of every venture undertaken by boys and business men alike. Over one-fourth of the boys who enter sheep club work were never qualified in demeanor and mental attitude to handle sheep, and I hon - estly believe that if through club work we can help them to find thein - belves to such an extent that they know they do not like the sheep game, we have rendered them no small service. It may keep them from a disastrous and costly venture later on in life. </seg>
            <seg id="p521">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association In closing then, I want to again emphasize these things: Sheep club work in Nebraska does not aim to increase production. Sheep club work does aim to start the proper training of boys and girls in the various phases of livestock farming to the end that they may be - come intelligent and successful sheep men with a desire to improve their flocks and a vision for the industry's future. Will it do it? Sounds fine, you say, but will it work? Club work has only been well under way such a short time that it has hardly given its members a chance to prove themselves but last week I sent out letters of inquiry to 30 men in the state asking if they knew of any former pig club members who were, because of it, successful hog men today. Their replies were quite positively affirmative and con - clusively establish the fact that club work is a strong factor in deter - mining a boy's future success as a breeder and feeder of livestock. The program committee has very kindly granted me ten minutes of tomorrow's time to present thfe contents of these letters as the "Proof of the Pudding." You will be pleased, I am sure, to hear of a few of the results this work is actually accomplishing through Nebraska's farm boys and girls. PROFESSOR DERRICK: We regret very much, Mr. Waggener, _that we do not have more tin e for you to go on with the interesting discussion, but we have a fu .1 program this afternoon and now we must take up another phase of the livestock industry. Horse breeding is a phase of the livestock business possibly that there has not been so much interest manifested in during the past few years and par - ticularly since Henry Ford scattered his tractors so thick over the farms. There has been a tendency to discard the old horse and mare and to do the work .with machines. I know a lot of men that. have found out recently, however, that Old Dobbin has not been put on the shelf for good but that he is coming back to his place in the agricultural world. Mr. Mason Yerkes of the Rural Economics De - partment will now talk to us upon the subject, "Just What Does Horse Power Cost." • . . ■ ' ■ \ . \ i . ■ JUST WHAT DOES HOUSE POWER COST? By MASON YERKES, Agricultural College Probably the most important reason for the decline in the price of horses was over production. No doubt trucks and automobiles, and tractors increased the depression which has resulted in the lowest purchasing power of horses ever reported. Many people believe that horses never will be high again but a3 a matter of fact the more violent the depression the more likely the </seg>
            <seg id="p522">Rkpobt of Nkbbahka State Board of Agriculture recovery. While cheap horses may not be a paying proposition for the horse raiser they are a factor in securing cheap power. The first cost, however, is the least important in the cost of horse power. The annual cost of keeping a horse is almost as much if not more, than the first cost. The upkeep might be referred as the over-' head -an expense which has to be met. The following chart shows the different items of cost per year. The costs for feeds were based on the 1923 farm price: Corn, 50c; oats, 39c; hay, $9.00. Total grain consumed approximately 2900 pounds of which oats and corn made up the chief ration — 31 bu. of oats and 35 bu. of corn. 1 believe that there is little doubt but that the feed costs are conservative as the information was secured in Phelps and Kearney counties where the grain and hay are usually cheap and the pasture period long. At that, the feed represents practically 60% of the total cost. By the way. this is practically the same per cent as was found in several other corn belt states at about the same time. It Is not my plan, or place, to make suggestions regarding feeding practices. Variations in feeding are to be expected, increasing or decreasing with amount of work done per horse. However, on many farms variations of feed wit-h amount of work done is not practiced. Two farms in the same locality working practically the same number of hours varied in cost of feed from $57 to $!M. It. Takes Time to Care For Horses Chores is an item that is very easy to overlook yet we find that almost 50 hours per horse was necessary. This time was charged at 2ftc an hour, a lower charge being put on this work because of a large part being done at a time when the labor might not have been other - wise profitably employed. Chores do not represent a cash outlay. Interest was estimated at % r /, on the average value of the horse, approximately $113. The Dureau of Crop Estimates, U. S. D. A., has published figures on the average farm values of all horses on farms January 1st from 1867 to date. The lowest value was reached in 1897 of $32; the highest in 1911 of $112. There has been a gradual decline, although irregular, since until the present vaiue is $80. The work stock on the farms used however valued considerably above the average. Both interest and depreciation would vary with the value of the animal and of course could be lowered by using cheaper horses. Cheap - er horses, however, may mean a loss in power which would be of much greater value than the interest and depreciation charged. Depreciation was estimated by deducting the increase in value Tor the year from the depreciation owing to age, injury or disease. This </seg>
            <seg id="p523">Nkjihanka lMi'novi-1) Livestock Biikkiikkk' Association figures roughly at about 5% of the value of the horses or 8&lt;7 r of the cost per year. Harness costs were estimated by taking 8% of the value at the time of the investigation and the depreciation for that year determined by dividing the value by the remaining years of life. Miscellaneous costs here: show only shoeing and veterinary but could include taxes and insurance at least. Now the total cost for the year of ?71.60 does not take into con - sideration any credits which might come from the manure or from the colts raised. It would seem as though the costs would be con - siderably lessened by the value of the colt. However, the investigation showed only a credit of |l.3O from that source. This low value was found because of the poor sale value of the colt and the fact that so few colts were raised— (less than 1 to 3 of all work stock.) I have only shown the actual cost of keeping a horse, but to me the cost of power is high or low according to the time the horse is used and to the number of crop acres per horse. In this same area the cost varied from 16c on farms using' their horses from 200-400 hours to 7c per hour on farms using their horses 800 hours or more. (Table 35, page 32.) Refer to chart. That the- number of crop acres is also a factor affecting the cost is shown by the chart with 13 crop acres per horse at a cost of ?7.70 per acre and 24 crop acres per horse at a cost of $4.05 per acre. While it is clear that the horse that works the most costs the owner the least, there Is one very important point to consider: the most profitable combination of enterprises may call for a large number of horses for only a short period of the year. The economical use of horse power is a, question that must be considered in connecti6n with the operation of the entire farm business. PROF. W.. W.. DERRICK, Chairman: Our next speaker will be Mr. Wayne Dinsmore, Secretary of the Horse Association of America. Mr. Dinsmore has without doubt kept in closer touch with the horse breeding industry than has any other man in America. For years he was Secretary of the Percheron Horse Association. We are privr ileged and are might happy to have him with us today to discuss the subject, "Living Locomotives." </seg>
            <seg id="p524">Rkport of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture LIVING LOUOMOT1YKS By MR. WAYNE DINSMORE, Chicago Professor Derrick and Gentlemen: It is always a pleasure to come back to a Nebraska audience. I spent some time in my earlier days here in Nebraska. My uncle for a l.ong while was in Clay County, Nebraska, — old J. B. Dinsmore, who was President of the Sutton Na - tional Bank for thirty years. I first visited that part of the country when I rode across your state in 1894 and I have traveled in the state considerably since, having judged on numerous occasions at different county fairs. I have come to feel very much at home with a Nebraska audience. As business men, you are interested first of all in what is profit - able in any line of endeavor. As regards farming, I think there is no subject closer to the hearts of farm men than how to get more profit from their farming operations. Of course, they make more from the farm in some years than in others. But they are especially concerned with making their farms pay a little more now in order that there may be something left for themselves and their families during this present depression of prices and the rather meager earnings of the farm in comparison with its returns. __ __ One of the large team units that is becoming very popular .•throuKhout Nebraska i« eiitht horses hitched four and fmir adapted for use on a 3-bottom plow or a tandem disk, or other big machinery. This team is driven with two lines. The tying in and bucking back system of control is used. Farmers like it. My subject this afternoon is "Living Locomotives." I use the term because, viewed from the standpoint of the farmer or city man with work to be done horses and mules are living locomotives, capable of drawing very heavy loads at varying rates of speed, just as a steam locomotive draws long trains over steel rails. From that standpoint we must consider their initial cost, length of useful life, cost of re- </seg>

We were discussing electrification of terminals in Chicago and had referred to the expense incurred in such an undertaking. He made the statement that the cost of electrifying one particular railroad in Chicago would be one-fourth as much as that road's entire capital stock. In other words, it would take one-fourth the capital stock of the total system to electrify only 35 miles of terminal line. It cannot be done, he said, because the road hasn't the money and can't get the money since the Interstate Commerce Commission will not per - mit them to raise their rates. If electrification did occur, every farmer, as well as other users of the road, would of course pay more for the service they receive. In regard to maintenance of horses and mules on farms, I have been interested in figures which Professor Yerkes has given us. If the figures had been in tonnage of grain and hay consumed, then I should have been able to compare them with studies made in Illinois where the College carried out a five-year actual survey and found that work horses actually in use on the farm consumed annually 25 bushels of corn, 38 bushels of oats, 1.7 tons of hay, and 1.9 acres of pasture. This is approximately the crop acreage of four acres of fertile corn belt land. They consume that which might have been marketed if it had been utilized for feeding purposes. • Professor Yerkes did not give itemized facts of consumption. It is interesting to note, however, that 60 per cent of his total mainten - ance costs are for feed, whereas in Illinois the study showed 70 per cent for feed — stabling, fencing, and other items making up the re - maining 30 per cent. The Illinois studies covered a period of five years, two of which were high cost years during which hay and grain were very high; consequently, feeds made up the greater part of the total maintenance expense. Pour factors enter into determination of farm profits. First is the yield per acre; second is the selection of most profitable crops and livestock; third is cost of production; and fourth is the sale price. ' The sale price we cannot control. Many of you may anticipate a way in J^which you can stabilize the market in order to get some relief, but f^jth&amp;t would be purely speculative at present. Cost of production and "capital investment are things over which we do have some control and there is another thing over which we have some control — the ' yield per acre. It is true that the yield per acre is a thing which cannot be defi - nitely forecast. The experience in production of cotton very well illus- </seg>
            <seg id="p526">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture trates this. The price of cotton is the lowest this season it has been in many years. In November, 1925, cotton brought 18 cents a pound, and in November, 1926. it was bringing only ten cents — for the biggest cotton crop ever produced in the history of the cotton-raising industry. Tiie whole South is disorganized from it. That reacts upon you gen - tlemen because the south is ordinarily a heavy buyer of mules. Thi3 year farmers are not buying mules because they do not have the money with which to buy them; consequently, cannot buy the normal number of animals for work purposes. The feed for their mules comes from Nebraska in no slight mea - sure, also, so that when they are purchasing a smaller number of work animals their demand for feed will be much smaller and there will be a reduction in the market for agricultural products from your region here. They will have to cut down costs and that will lead them to diversify and produce something for their own animals to live on, all of which means that you are going to have just that much more competition and more likelihood of surplus production. The less cotton, therefore, grown in the South the less market jou have for Nebraska-grown products. On farms where lots of fer - tilizer is used a greater production per acre is obtained. You can find places ir. Ohio where production is as high as 100 bushels or more per acre for corn, while the average for the United States is 26 bush - els. They use fertilizer to pet an Increase in production. The use of such fertilizer is important for many reasons. Right here in the United States — in West Texas, especially — we have some of the finest potash deposits in the world, rivalling even those of Germany. That doesn't, I suppose, mean so much to you on Nebraska farms; you are not likely to need much fertilizer here for a good many years. You can, however, be affected by the increased production that can result from the use of fertilizer in other states. In some parts of the country the crop production will be doubled or even trebled, and there is going to be such an increased quantity of produce on the market that it will have a tendency to depreciate tllH prices of that which you are growing. Whether you increase your yield or not. the price that results per acre to you due to this increased yield in other parts or the United States is a condition which you will have to meet. We get down, therefore, in the last analysis to the fact that about the only way to meet this condition is for every farmer to cut the cost of production. This he can do by utilizing every natural means at his command. Nebraska has 127,734 farms, almost half of which are 175 acres and up in size. These farms will average eight or more work horses or mules each, and on them the use of 8, 14, or 18-horse teams — or </seg>
            <seg id="p527">Nebraska .Improved Livestock Breeders' Association - even larger on big farms — is practical. Their use would result in saving $200 or more per farm in- labor alone, arid would enable a farmer to plant with greater timeliness, thereby favorably influencing crop yields. When once you have learned how to use the larger teams you will find It is just as easy to drive 8, 10, 14, or 18 horses as it is to drive four. There is nothing new about these large teams; they have been in use on the Pacific Coast for over 30 years. I worked as Sec - retary of the Percheron Society of America from 1910 to 1320, trav - elling throughout the United States, and my work since has taken me to the Pacific Coast as well as to the East Coast, I have seen many men driving 16 and 18-horse teams, and in Oregon and Washington, where the combined harvester-thresher first came into general use, 90 per cent of the combines are horse-drawn; here teams ranging from 2(5 to 35 horses driven by one man are so common that they do not excite even passing comment. | Practical farmers in those states have worked out a system of "tying-ln" horses in diagonal formation in such a way that all horses except the leaders are so' positioned that they are automatically con - trolled. The leaders are controlled by means of the lines in the hands of the driver. Horses are prevented from going too far forward and thus pulling more than their share of the load by what is termed "bucking-back." It is a system which we have found virtually impossible to explain by blue prints and charts, since few farmers "are able to understand it from charts. We have found that only by actual demonstration can men be taught just how to use these large teams; and in 1922 the Horse Association of America began correspondence with the Montana Agricultural College to urge the holding of such demonstra - tions in Montana, with the result that in 1923 and 1924 more than 4 0 demonstrations were given in that state, witnessed by more than 25,000 farmers. Farmers there took very generally to the idea, some of them using 10, 12, 18, and even 20 horses in a team and finding the horses easily controlled with a single pair of lines going to the leaders only; and this despite, the fact some of them had been skeptical In starting. At one time Professor Wilson of the Montana Agricultural College, who . was in charge of the demonstrations, sent word to a county agent that a demonstration was to be given and asked him to request his farmers to have ready nine well-broken teams since the demonstrators did not wish to waste time with poorly broken horses. The farmers, however, decided differently. They said to each other: "Suppose we had to use unbroken horses in our field work? What would we do? We'll let them show us how their hitch works on our outlaws." </seg>
            <seg id="p528">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Accordingly, they got together some runaway and outlaw horses lor the demonstration. J. J. Peak, who was assisting Professor Wil - son, immediately recognized the bad ones, however, and without say - ing anything hitched them in the rear with well-behaved, broken horses as leaders. In this position, the outlaws kicked and reared as much as they liked but, tied-in and bucked-back as they were, they could not break the formation and ultimately had to submit and work with their leaders. The farmers were surprised into declaring, "By golly, the thing does work," and into similar exclamations. Hitch Work Being Demonstrated In Nebraska M. B. Posson, who is directing the hitch demonstration work here - in Nebraska, is not bringing to you anything new; he is teaching you a principle which has been worked out and proved — that you can use your horses in such a way as to cut production costs. Suppose you had a 250-acre tract of which 200 acres were in crops, and that you were working four horses or mules in each team on that farm. With eight horses you would be able to do double the amount of work in the same length of time; with 12 horses the amount of work you would do in a given length of time would be trebled. Suppose, again, that with four horses you are discing 20 acres in ten hours; put on eight horses so that you can double your number of discs and in ten hours you will be able to disc 40 acres. It is just as easy to drive 8 horses or 12 as it is to drive two or four, and you are getting added result in whatever operation you are carrying on. I was brought up in western South Dakota where horses are plentiful; yet we used four or five in a unit and would have to stop and let them rest in the middle of a field and sometimes again at the end of the furrow. Think of the time wasted! A farmer can actually turn dirt for 20 miles a day provided he puts on enough horses to make that accomplishment possible, no matter what imple - ment he is using. Furthermore, you may increase the size of your teams and use a combination of implements in the field — plowing and harrowing, for instance, in the same operation. That Is another labor - saver of our generation. I can well remember driving six horses on a six-section harrow before I was 12 years old and I rode a saddle pony behind the harrows when I drove that six-horse team, for that was before harrow carts had been devised. All this applies to one of the four factors determining farm profits — the cost of production. If you keep and wisely employ an adequate number of horses or mules on your farm you are going further toward cutting production costs than you will in any other way. This has been proved through results obtained in Oregon, Washington and Montana. Horses and mules have the advantage to the farmer of being a home product. They are put together on the farm, built out </seg>
            <seg id="p529">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association of farm products, are maintained thereon, and are long-lived and low in cost of maintenance and repair. They have greater reserve power than even the steam locomotive, being able in emergencies to start a load four times as great as the locomotive when proportionate weights of the two are considered. Moreover, horses and mules furnish flexible power, for they can be used in 2, 4, 6, 8,. 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, or even 33-horse teams, accord - ing to the nature of the work to be done. AVhut is a "Horse Power?" i The term "horsepower" has a very definite meaning ascribed to it by James Watt after a number of tests. He defined It as "the amount of power required to lift 33,000 pounds one foot in one minute." It is the same as pulling 150 pounds out of a. dry well 220 feet deep in one minute. Watt decided this was all a horse could do con - tinuously during a working day; hence, termed It "one horsepower." In closing, I should like to remind you, therefore, not to overlook your horsepower as a means of controlling production costs. It is .one of the few profit-influencing factors which we can control. We cannot fail to recognize the uncontrollable factors here In Nebraska that may defeat our efforts — storms, hall, frosts, etc., which may Inter - fere with high yields.. I cannot see much possibility of an increase in. price of stable food products for sometime to come, or in price ,of meat animals. That doesn't mean that there will not be fluctua - tions but when it comes to substantial increases that will pay real interest on investment, indications are no better than they have been for the past several years. The man who uses horses to do his farm work is reducing over - head expense in production of his crops. Furthermore, he is pro - viding himself with an outlet for a considerable quantity of grain, hay, and pasture; use of these products for horse feed withholds that, much from the market, since otherwise It would be sold either directly or through meat animals. Prom an economic standpoint, therefore, horses and mules on farms act as stabilizing factors, enabling farmers to secure much higher prices for farm products than if the land now growing horse feed were to be diverted to food production for human beings. And now I should like to say one thing more. It seems to me there is. too much of all .work and no play on the farm today as far as the horse Is concerned. In Nebraska, Iowa, and other corn belt states we have come to look upon the horse almost entirely as a work • animal only. We do not get the pleasure from them we once did. Relatively few farms today have a good saddle horse; they have quit using it. Yet, some of the happiest hours many of us spent as children </seg>
            <seg id="p530">Rkport of Nebraska State Boakd of Agriculture were spent in the saddle when evening came, or on Sundays and holi - days when we were not at work in the field. It is true, of course, that I was on a ranch in western South Dakota where we were well provided with horses, but the memory of hours I spent in the saddle are among the pleasantest I have. Farmers now should welcome giving their boys and girls a similar chance. Keep a good saddle horse; it doesn't cost much, as they live on pas - ture practically nine months of the year, and they are always at the command of the children. Give them this chance to learn horseman - ship and to engage in one of the greatest health-promoting pastimes there is. WEDNESDAY FORENOON SESSION JANUARY 5, 1927 Mr. Sam McKelvie, Presiding CHAIRMAN' McKELVIE: We have a splendid program for this forenoon. We are representing an industry today, SWINE, that is paying us men engaged in it although some years we have lost our feed crop. As I say in many places we have lost our crops in the past year on account of drought yet when we have to buy our feed for our hogs there is still a profit in the business. Of course yesterday the market pointed at $11.55 and a week ago last Monday it was $11.90. Where you are feeding at the present time good hogs or a good class of them there is still a profit in the business. I think you will agree with me on that. It is certainly a very gratifying thing to know that thosc - conditions exist. I am glad to see those who are here this morning at the commencement of our program and especially to see those boys up there and to see how young folks are taking an Interest in these matters. We have a very full program for the forenoon and will start with the first number on our bill of particulars which will be given by Mr. O. O. Waggener of the Agricultural College. His subject is, "The Proof of the Puddin'." ' </seg>
            <seg id="p531">Nedraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association THE PROOF OP THE PUDDING By MR. O. O. WAGGENER, Agricultural College At the last farmer's meeting held In this building I prepared and placed on exhibit a beaver board placard similar to the one shown here and headed it, "The proof of the value of boys' and girls' club work." I then placed it where it could not help being seen and stood around to see what would be the reaction of those who saw it. Now It had seemed to me that the fact that these boys had pro - duced the excellent animals shown in the pictures and had exhibited them to championship positions was at least. some proof of the value of the work, for to do so they no doubt would have had to have gained at least some knowledge of feeding and care of their animals. To my satisfaction many of the comments were highly favorable but a few. were anything else but favorable. Many saw the possibilities of the boy's father having supplied the animal and fed it into condition as shown, and the boy having done nothing but hold it in the show ring. Others assumed the attitude that many boys could take a calf and feed it for a few months with but little effort and win a prize and a lot of trips and things, while the boy who spends his time at home plant - ing corn and herding the cows and doing a dozen odd jobs for It hours or so a day around home will receive no recognition whatsoever. And that's the very great pity about the whole thing, isn't it? Some fathers do see to it that it their boys have to cultivate corn Jill day they can have a little patch of their own to encourage them in their other work, and which they can study and try to improve and gain a part of what recognition is due them. The boys and girls in club work are enrolled and pledged to own, feed and care for their own corn, pigs or calves, and it does give them encouragement and recognition, and any father who refuses his boy this opportunity Is, I believe, making a grave mistake. But to go back to the placard here, it was .plain that if did not convince all those who saw It of the value of Boys' and Girls' club work and for that reason I requested the gentlemen who made out this program to please allow me to take 10 minutes of your time today. The Value of-4-H Club Work Is Hard to Measure The value of club work is a hard thing to measure — harder, per - haps, than the value of schools. If what they did as members of clubs doesn't show what they can do then just what measure of the work can be made. Since the proof of the pudding is to be found In the eating thereof I decided to write out to 30. men in the state and ask them If they knew of boys who had been pig club members a few years back and who were today successful hog men because of the </seg>
            <seg id="p532">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture start and interest gained from it. Here are the replies I received. Time will not permit my reading them all to you so I have picked out a few of the most outstanding to call to your attention. If you wish to learn of others you can see me later. Now in the first place there is Arthur Wallbuy of Eagle and his brothers. They started some years ago in pig club work raising Durocs. Every year they have made a successful showing at the various fairs and last year when I was on their place for a little club meeting they trotted out a very fine deep sided, smooth boar which they had raised and told me they didn't know whether to sell or show him. He was a very fine individual and in himself sufficient proof to me that through their club work they had become masters of the hog producing game. About a month later Walter Briggs of Seward, whom a larg£ number of you no doubt know, came along. Now Walter is a Junior member of the Briggs &amp; Son Duroc firm and is recognized everywhere as one of Nebraska's leading hog men. From the class of work he had done as a club boy back in the teens people who knew him then could readily see that he was destined to become a factor In the hog producing world. Walter, after some dickering, bought the boar from the Walberg brothers at a goodly figure. In fact at a figure that would have seemed indeed plenty high to many of us. But Walter, because of the training he had had as a club boy knew what he was doing. He took the hog home, finished the job of conditioning so ably begun by the Walberg's and when the State Fair came along last September showed him to an easy Grand Championship. In short, then, the Grand Champion Duroc was raised, sold, fitted and shown by former club boys. Then there are the Ingalls boys up in Polk county who begun as club members and today are looked to as two of the county's and the state's most successful hog men. Frank Toelle from up at West Point is known all over the North - ern part of the state for his success both in club work and now in the hog game for himself. He was a champion in 1925 and is now a breeder of Durocs with his father and a club leader of recognized ability. Guy McReynolds from Fairfield — if you're a Chester White man and exhibit at County Fairs, the name almost scares you. He began his long list of runnings as a club boy and carried right on when he went over In to the adult class. He appeared as a club champion first In 1921 and has been a winner ever since. If he had all his ribbons tied together he'd have a rope that would hang any mule and some ele - phants. Guy is today a recognized Chester White breeder. We have a whole list of successful men who got their start in 4-H club work. </seg>
            <seg id="p533">• Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association Poland China men will recognize the name of Peter Pratt of Beaver Crossing, a successful breeder, and showman of high quality Poland Chinas. Pete started a few years back as an energetic club boy. ; From his club judging team work he came here to college and made every judging team put out by the institution with the excep - tion of crops alone and wound up his spectacular judging career as a member of the champion meat judging team at Chicago this year. He is now with Swift &amp; Co. at Omaha. Then there is Geo. Pfeifer of Elkhorn, whom Walter Head of the First National Bank at Omaha says is a tip top Poland China man. Huber . Bros, of Irvlngton, successfully breed high class Poland Chinas. Curtis Cook of Arlington sells Duroc breeding stock to all his neighbors. Arthur Radekar of the "Radekars of Battle Creek," began in 1920 after a successful club year and has developed a herd that records show winnings in every big swine show in America. He is a tip-top farmer and a real hog man. And Harry Knabe, of Nebraska, look at the Hampshire men prick up their ears. You all know about him . How he started with one weanling gilt, and what a famous herd he has built up and owns today. He is now recognized as one of the most successful breeding and market hog men in Nebraska. By the way, he won Grand Cham - pionship at the K. C. Royal this year on his car load of belted beauties in the carload fat barrow classes. And there are such others as: Carl Farveyj Beaver City; . Paul Hill, Edison; Clyde Walker, Smithfteld; Leonard Fowler, Arcadia; Norman Nielson, Ashland; Schoenleber Bros., Bethany; Quentln Erlckson, Schuyler; Earl Vanik, Sutton; Homer Littel, Fillmore County. Oh well, I haven't got time to name them all, but if you'll look around you'll find the woods are full of them — outstanding men in every line of farm activity — the product of Boys' and Girls' club work. A In closing I simply want to say this: Boys and Girls are the most important livestock on the farm today. They crave recogni - tion and responsibility. The future of Nebraska agriculture is in their hands and depends directly upon them and their proper development and training in farm and livestock management. Measured by any yardstick of success Boys' and Girls' club work has proven itself to be a worth while medium for training boys and girls in farm and live - stock management. </seg>
            <seg id="p534">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture CHAIRMAN McKELVIE: A great deal depends on what use we make of the products of our farms. We learn at these meetings of different ways that these products may be used. Yesterday in this room I learned that it was an advantage to keep sheep on the farm. Again we learn several ways to get rid of our surplus products that we grow on the farm. The horsemen yesterday gave us some Inter - esting addresses showing that you can make a profit by keeping Old Dobbin on the farm. I notice that in our county, of the boys who came here around 1874, thp nipn who pinned their faith to the old cow, the old sow and the old hen are there and are alright yet. They have paid for their farms and I am glad to know today that although in some districts of the South Platte Country they have had in the last year practically a crop failure, in this livestock and swine action there Is a profit in the business today even when we have to buy our feed. It is very gratifying to know that we have this line of industry that we can still operate at a profit. The next discussion will be led by Mr. O. J. Grace, who handles ihe livestock experimental work at our North Platte State Experimental Farm. His subject is, "Cottonseed Meal, Hog Feed or Hog Poison?" Mr. 0. J. Grace, of the University of Nebraska North Platte Sub Station then gave an excellent address showing that cottonseed meal was being tested as a protein supplement with corn, and also as a partial substitute for tankage in a fattening ration. The results ob - tained in these first tests indicate that cottonseed meal may have a much more important place in the Nebraska hog ration than has been given it, and that it may be found a valuable feed along with a ration of corn and tankage, reducing the cost of gain without lessening the rate of gain or quality of the finished product. (We are very sorry that Mr. Grace's complete address has not arrived as we go to press.) CHAIRMAN McKELVIE: This has been very interesting and I wish you could stay with us for quite a while and let us ask a lot of questions. The next number we are to have deals somewhat with the same topic. If there are no more questions at this time we will hear from William J. Loeffel of the Agricultural College, on "Modern Hog Feeding." MODKRX HOG FKKDIXG MR. WILLIAM J. LOEFFEL, Agricultural College Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen: The question which has been as - signed to me is certainly broad enough to cover considerable range, so I know you will pardon my random remarks. Some times our friends misunderstand our offorts. About two years ago my attention' was called to an editorial scoring us for advocating greater produc - tion when the price of hogs was low. As a matter of fact, we did </seg>
            <seg id="p535">Nedraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association not then, nor do we now, advocate a greater production of hogs but rather a more efficient production. If we can raise just as much pork from fewer brood sows by more efficient feeding and management, we are reducing the cost of production, not necessarily producing a great surplus to further depress the prices. ; During the past fall and winter, the packers have been paying a premium for well finished hogs. This has been due. to the fact that fat hogs yield less lard than thin ones. I realize that this is contrary to what you commonly believe and will say it is due to the method of cutting the carcass. With well-finished pigs, many of the fat cuts are cured up, whereas in thin hogs these cuts are used for lard. Be - cause of the very large cotton crop last year, there is an abundance of cottonseed oil upon the market this year and this cottonseed oil in the form of lard compound is one of the principal competitors of lard. A great many Nebraska farmers arc reducing the labor to a minimum by self-feeding the sows and- pies together. .Why not? Mr. .Grace covered the subject of feeding cottonseed meal to hogs very adequately. During the past year we have done considerable experimental work at this Experiment Station mixing cottonseed meal with- tankage in different proportions and self-feeding the mixture as a protein supplement with corn. We have used a mixture of three parts cottonseed meal to one part of tankage and also a mixture of equal parts of these two feeds. Bigs have been fed these mixtures lor 100 days and no fatalities have occurred. The mixture of cotton - seed meal and tankage half and half has proven superior to straight tankage. Because of the low price of cottonseed meal during the present winter, the addition of cottonseed meal to the ration has prov - en economical as well. In Wisconsin and Iowa, very good results have been obtained from a Trinity mixture consisting of 50 per cent tankage and 25 per cent </seg>
            <seg id="p536">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture linseed meal, and 25 per cent alfalfa meal. I see n.o reason why cot - tonseed meal cannot be used in place of linseed meal. With linseed meal selling now at $58 per ton and cottonseed meal at $35, the differential between the two is so great that there is little justifica - tion for using linseed meal. If linseed meal is used at all, it should make up only a small percentage, of the ration, say not more than ten per cent. Cottonseed Meal Stimulates Appetites Cottonseed meal is very palatable and where fed in the ration we have found a considerable increase in feed consumption. We have used the fine ground meal of good quality running from 41 to 4 3 per cent crude protein. There is also on the market what is known as cold pressed cake which runs much lower in crude protein and, higher in fiber and therefore is hardly adapted for hog feeding. Just a word about self-feeders. These devices have proven very desirable from the standpoint of saving labor and making quick gains. They are especially desirable for crowding pigs for early market. Of course there are conditions under which their use is not desirable, such as the feeding of breeding stock. Many of you no doubt want to know something regarding the commercial pig meals of which there are a large number upon the market. A number of firms are making a conscientious effort to put out high class feed. From our standpoint, It Is difficult to do experi - mental work with these feeds because of the frequent changes in their formulas. We have used several brands of pig meal experimentally and while we were able to get slightly larger gains than with corn and tankage, our gains were more expensive. Feeds of this type may be desirable for developing purebred pigs or to carry pigs up to the weaning period. The amount of feed consumed by the pig up to wean - ing time is very small so that the actual expense of using one of these feeds is not very great, e\en though the price per ton may appear high. The man who is fattening hogs for market, however, must watch his costs carefully. Nothing Mysterious About Mixed Hog Feeds There is nothing mysterious about mixing up a hog feed. Anyone with a reasonable degree of intelligence can do it. Yet it takes time and when we consider that the average farmer would be forced to buy the ingredients in small quantities, I question whether he cannot buy the commercial mixture more cheaply than he can mix it himself In many cases. I believe that the average farmer is willing to pay the legitimate manufacturer a reasonable price for services rendered. Much Interest has been aroused recently by the so-called open formula method of manufacturing feed. Representatives from various </seg>
            <seg id="p537">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association agricultural colleges recommend certain mixtures and these mixtures are turned over to manufacturers and farmers. Anyone can use them. The manufacturer on. his tag states just what is contained in the feed sack and whenever a feeder finds that he can mix up the feed more cheaply than he can buy it in the sack, it is his privilege to do so. The present feed control law in Nebraska leaves much to be de - sired in way of protecting the farmer's best interests In the regulation of commercial mixed feeds. It might be ' well for this organization to take up with the present legislature the matter of revising the feed control law. MR. McKELVIE, Chairman: .

            <seg id="p541">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association MR. ESHELMAN: My experience with hogs dates back to the time I was a very small boy on my father's farm. I received most of my early training from him. I was taught that the hog was a mortgage raiser. When 1 started on the farm for myself that was one pt the first things to which I turned my attention. The first year I had fifteen sows and raised fifty-five pigs for market. ' Every year since that conditions kept getting worse and my hogs kept growing less. I thought possibly changing breeds might help. The Duroc was considered a good breed by my neighbors so I got some of them and placed them on my farm. About four or five years ago I was still kind of discouraged when I happened to get hold of a little article that was written by M. B. Posson on the work that had been done in McClaln County, Illinois, in connection with hog lot sanitation and I thought if that system was good in Illinois I might use it in Ne - braska. Being a renter on a little farm of course it looked foolish for me to make any investment in equipment. I had just a common ordi - nary pig shed. It had a dirt floor and was of poor construction. I put a window in the front of it and got it cleaned out, removing" the top six inches of dirt and hauling in six inches of fresh dirt. I had eight sows that year and I raised forty-eight pigs from the six sows. . I could see that I had made a wonderful improvement on my pig raising that year. The next year I had a patch of alfalfa near by that was fenced hog tight. I built a narrow lane so that the hogs could run over on that patch. Those pigs did fine. There were eleven sows and I raised seventy-six pigsi The next spring. I saw that I needed more equipment but I didn't want to go to so very much ex - pense. I had a shed there that was thirty-two feet long and eight feet wide and I thought I could make two portable hog houses out of that. Of course I hesitated about doing too much alteration on a Landlord's building. So I. went in and talked to the Landlord who is one of the best Landlords in Nebraska. I explained it to him, and he is a very progressive man having been on a farm himself. He said, "Go ahead and get what you need in material," so I went after it. I made two portable hog houses out of the one he had and moved one over on fresh ground. I put the sows in there. Of course up to this time no brood sows had been in that house. I cared for them and watched them. and later on the pigs farrowed. When they were two weeks old I put them out in a good field of alfalfa that was fenced in. I kept them there pastured on that alfalfa with a little grain ration until October 1st. They farrowed about April 1st, and I had a good crop of corn so I took those pigs back to the old hog lot at that time. I took the fence down that was around the alfalfa field and put it around the sweet corn field and turned them in there in October. So they were there on the sweet corn until December 7th, when I shipped them to Kansas City. Their average weight was 260 pounds. I later rebuilt the old sheds that even when divided were not any </seg>
            <seg id="p542">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture too good, and drew them on new clean ground. I had watched my sows closely to keep them free from lice before putting them in the new shed. MR. POSSON: Next I am going to call on Ernest Schmidt. He averaged 1208 pounds per sow in six months. MR. SCHMIDT: Gentlemen: I believe Mr. Posson made a mis - take in calling on me. I am not much of a talker. I can dp better in raising hogs. It isn't just fair to ask me to talk before a bunch of men like you. But I had heard about this Hog Contest and read about it so I thought I would try it. About that time or shortly before my pigs began to farrow our County Agent came out and wanted me to enter this contest. At first I didn't want to and it took quite a bit to get me to finally decide I would do so. I was trying to raise ■ . *r; f%§$$mzr*r7 ! £Z'--' ' " • :■■-.. ■■■&gt;-s--:- -.-...--.-- ■-•■'-.. The popularity of hon lot sanitation can be judged if we buti notice the thousands of portable hotr houses being used in all parts of the state. these hogs under sanitary conditions. I had had a little trouble a few years before with runty pigs. Quite a few of them were smaller than I thought I ought to raise. Our yard was badly infected so I had made several small houses. I farrowed these pigs using clean' ground, and kept them on clean ground until in the fall. After the pigs were several weeks old or possibly a month and a half we turned them out in a sweet clover pasture where they stayed until mid - summer. Later on when they were pretty well along we put them on Sudan grass pasture and there they stayed until fall or until they were all sold. MR POSSON 1 : We will now hear briefly from Mr. R. C. John - son of Mead. MR JOHNSON: I might receive a certificate in raising hogs but I never would on making speeches, however, I .might tell you a few things from my experience. I had ten sows this year. The first sow </seg>
            <seg id="p543">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association farrowed the 9th of March and the last sow on the 27th of March. The average age would date them from the 17th. And that would make it the 17th of September when the time of 180 days would be up. I have always been a strong advocate of sanitation along all lines, not only in raising hogs but in dairy cattle as well. I don't think Mr. Posson can put enough stress on hog lot sanitation. I have prac - ticed it for seven or eight years now, not perfectly but in the best way I could. I can truthfully say that during that time I never had a runt on the place. What is more I don't expect to have. I give hog lot sanitation a lot of credit for that. I have Chore Boy eight by eight houses, the individual type. My ten sows farrowed seventy - two pigs. .1 had a little blood poison in one litter which left sixty - pight pigs or about 6.8' average per sow. At first when I received the rules governing this contest I thought the committee had put the maximum awfully low, fourteen hundred pounds of pork. But when I lost four out of seventy-two I found out that I just went past that mark of fourteen hundred, and that's about all. . : I believe it is possible to raise a ton of pork per sow in six months from every sow on the farm and still not harm the pigs for breeding purposes. That is what I would sure like to do. LIVESTOCK JUDGING CONTEST — 1927 Sponsored by the Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association 1. Rayriiond Nixon, Fairfield J5.00 2.

            <seg id="p545">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association THURSDAY FORENOON SESSION JANUARY 6, 1927 Mr. Charles Graff, Bancroft, Presiding MR. GRAFF: Now, ladies and gentlemen, we have a very fine program for this morning. I am going to' try and be as intelligent as possible and give you as much time as I can to get all the good you possibly can out of this: meeting. We have a program that you will be much interested in. I want you to get right in and take full advantage of the opportunity, not only to listen to the addresses, but to ask questions, upon whatever is of interest to you. I will be glad ■to recognize you. I will ask this of you, however, in order to do these things right I would like to have you receive the recognition of the chair so we may eliminate confusion. We have with us this morning a gentleman who is not on the program, but a gentleman who holds a very important position in this state today. He is one of the Regents of the State University, Billy Warner; he lives up in my section of the country and when Warner was placed on this Board of Regents we felt that we were going to have at least one honest-to-goodness man on that Board who had some knowledge of agricultural activities in this state. I would like to have you know him and hear from him something as to what they are facing in the interests of your State University. MR. WILLIAM P. WARNER: Mr. Chairman, the very fact of my being a member of the Board of Regents is an evidence of my interest in agriculture. /58 or 60 years of my life has been spent in Nebraska though not quite all of it was on the farm. Yet a great portion of it was. One thing that I wish to mention in regard to my work on the Board is to reiterate that I went on the Board because of my interest in. agriculture and I have. been representing it on that Board, trying to function as a representative of agricultural interests. During the time I have been on that Board we have been so fortunate as to .have another man come on, Mr. Frank J. Taylor, who I feel has a sincere interest in agriculture. One of the things that I am proud of is that I was in the legislature when the first appropriation of any considerable amount was made for the purpose of the building pro - gram out here at the Experiment Station in 1903. When we dis - covered what they were trying to do out here we voted an appropria - tion lor all they asked. You may know that our fore-fathers who founded this state of Nebraska and its first State Institutions helped to raise the first one hundred thousand dollars that went to the University in this state by the sale of lots belonging to this state and </seg>
            <seg id="p546">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture then all there was left was two blocks for the campus of the Univer - sity. We are spending thousands and thousands of dollars in the upbuilding of this University campus now. Gentlemen, one of the things that I am proud of in connection with my membership and service on the Board of Regents is that we have made a substantial acquisition to the acreage of land belonging to the Agricultural Col - lege since I came on the Board. We have bought one tract out here of 180 acres and another of 60 acres: I don't care what criticism comes to me when I am through I am in favor of going ahead and to allow for development in the future. I get out of patience some - times when people fail to see the actual necessity for agricultural welfare in this state. There is not a man, a shop, nor an institution in this stale but what is dependent entirely upon the farmers' welfare and on the agricultural operations in this state. There is not a min - ister, a lawyer, a banker, a doctor or a merchant but who is dependent entirely for his welfare on the farm. I am recognizing that situation. Let us all do so and let us go ahead as rapidly as we can and make substantial and rapid progress in making this institution and this part of the University what it should be and secure for it what it will need in the years to come. CHAIRMAN GRAFF: The next speaker we have on the pro - gram is the man whom we usually refer to as Professor. I have known him for a long time and I know that he has been a mighty good judge of live stock and I could tell some great stories on him. Professor Howard Gramlich: ("HAWKS THAT MAY UK KXPKCTED |.\ CATTLE PRODUCTION" H. J. GRAMLICH During the past quarter of a century there has been a gradual but consistent change taking place in the cattle production of the United States. This change in a way is but a reflection of that which has occurred in the demands of the beef consuming public. A quarter of a century ago the majority of steers reaching market as fat beeves average four years of age and weighed from 1500 to 1700 pounds. At that time beef was cheap. A review of market papers discloses that three to five cents per pound represented the range of prices paid for fat cattle during the greater part of the time. People then were able to buy steaks and roasts with comparatively little investment and consequently the size of the cut was not the 1 all-determining factor. Today we see that this change which has been steadily taking place has resulted in bringing the finished steer down to one of less than one thousand pounds and but little more than 12 months of age. </seg>
            <seg id="p547">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association- In fact in extreme cases we find many steers that have been fed grain while nursing their mothers and they are sold as finished beeves under the name of super-baby beeves when but 8 to 10 months of age and weighing six to eight hundred pounds. This change has been brought about by many contributing fact - ors. The advance in the cost of production of cattle due to increasing grain costs and cost of the rangemen have tended to result in a higher market for the finished product with the result that many buyers are forced to select lighter cuts in order to procure beef for their fam - ilies. In other, words, their money will not go sufficiently far to per - mit one of the heavier cuts as in the olden days. Modem- People Do Xot Iiike Tallow- Secondly, the people of this day apparently do not like beef "fat" ■ or "tallow." -As a result they hesitate to buy a cut which contains ■ considerable external fat or fat which is mechanically separable from the lean. They know that this will not be consumed but will repre - . sent waste. On the other hand most people realize that a certain amount of marbling of lean and fat is highly desirable and that a cut of beef possessing but little external fat but carrying considerable marbling will be tender, palatable and juicy. Baby beeves product - such cuts and consequently the popularity. Perhaps a third factor which has contributed toward the change that has taken place would be the development and general usage of machines such as the automobile, the radio and such other modern "implements" as have tended to quicken the pace which we step in living at the present time. Of those several things the automobile undoubtedly has been of the most importance. Many city residents have been forced to skimp on their tables as well as on their backs in order -to keep their automobiles running and enjoy the privileges which go with them. Such people naturally will buy light and cheap cuts of beef and will not attempt to purchase the more expensive heav - ier cuts. Furthermore, people of that class are very anxious to get in the car and enjoy it as soon as supper can be put out of the way. This means quite a strong demand for steaks and chops which can be quickly cooked while the old-fashioned heavy. roast must go begging. From the standpoint of the producer, this change to younger ani - mals has ■ come as the result in part at least of knowledge gained through practical experience and the results of experiment station trials in which the economy of animals of different sizes and age has been studied. Considerable experimental data is available to show that gain can be produced upon baby beeves much more efficiently than upon heavy steers. In fact the calf produces three pounds of gain from the amount of feed which the more mature steer uses to produce two pounds.' Furthermore, mature cattle after feeding a rea- </seg>
            <seg id="p548">Report ok Nebraska Statf. Board of Agriculture r.r'vrivv' 1116 reach a stage where they gain ™* *«** although their feed consumption continues on a constant basis Calves on the other hand will continue to gain at a Uniformly satisfactory rate over relatively long periods. This is a very important point for the cattle feeder. Forecasting markets in advance is very undepend - able. By having light young cattle the feeder can market at thp lime he originally planned to or if prices are on an unsatisfactory basis he can hold for a later market and at the same time have the cattle continue to gain quite efficiently. The man who elects to hold heavy cattle because of a bad market, does so at quite a risk as the Blow gains which these make will cost much more than the price at which they sell. Consequently unless the market has advanced quite rapidly there will have been no advantage in holding. Demand for Light Beef Will Be Permanent Regarding the future of the cattle business. First, it would seem safe to draw the deduction that the demand tor light cattle' is a reality which is with us to stay. In other words, if there are any changes in the future they will be apt to represent continuations of those which have occurred in the past rather than reactionary ones which would result in the public demanding that the feeder again produce heavy cattle. Without doubt 90 per cent of the consuming public will con - tinue to demand beef from cattle weighing from 600 to 1D00 pounds alive. Twenty years ago 90 per cent of the beef carcasses would have weighed within this range. The supplying of the demand for light beef throughout 12 months of the year will be done by feeders following various plans of man - agement. Most of the cattle marketed will range from 6 to 18 months of age. The six months old calves will be those which have had access to grain while nursing their mothers and they will produce carcasses which will be classed as super-baby beeves. The production of these calves represents the most extreme type of forced beef cattle pro - duction. They might be compared to hot house lambs and milk tea chickens. There will be other calves that will receive some grain while nursing and fed for perhaps three months following weaning. These calves will reach market at 9 months of age weighing from 500 to 700 pounds. There will be another class of calves that will receive no grain during the summer, however, at weaning time they will be placed in the dry lot and fed heavily upon a concentrated ration for approximately six months. These will weigh about 800 pounds when marketed at 12 months of age. Others will be handled similarly but continued as much as three months longer in the dry lot. When marketed at 15 months of age they will weigh 900 to 1000 pounds. The above classes will represent calves that might be spoken of as those which have access to liberal feeding of concentrates. </seg>
            <seg id="p549">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association - ■There will be other calves handled with the thought of having them reach market when somewhat older, they will not receive grain while nursing and will receive only a light feed after weaning. Silage will be used in many cases to winter these calves and this may be supplemented with a light feed of corn and cottonseed cake together with alfalfa, hay. These calves will be placed upon full food the. following summer or fall and marketed between November and Jan - uary as Christmas beeves. They will weigh approximately 1000 pounds and will have made quite reasonable gains because of the utilization of considerable roughness In starting them on feed. The Kansas Experiment Station has done some work which has tended to show that calves handled in this manner during the winter can be turned on grass without grain for three months during the following summer. They can then be full fed for a period of three months before marketing. It would seem as though this method possessed considerable merit and probably would become quite a com - mon one. In our beef making work of the future. Not only does one acquire a reasonable gain on cattle handled in this way but the work of caring for them. amounts to practically, nothing during the season of the year when farm operations are most rush'ing. In summing this up it would seem that there can be little ques - tion but what the beef production of the future will hinge almost entirely around young cattle. The ranchman who keeps up with the times will be forced to operate primarily upon a cow and calf basis just as the sheepman of today operates entirely upon an ewe and lamb basis. There will be a few heavy steers produced under some types of ranching and these will be fattened in corn belt food lots as in the past. Providing the number of such steers is kept at a minimum there should be a good outlet for them as there are still a few hotels, restaurants and clubs that desire cuts from carcasses such as only three and four-year old steers produce. ' CHAIRMAN GRAFF: I certainly have appreciated what Pro - fessor Gramlich has given us. Now the next number on our program we are going to have Mr. Swift speak to us first so that he can get away to another meeting, where he is also supposed to speak. His topic will be "Marketing Livestock Intelligently." </seg>
            <seg id="p550">Report of Nkbraska State Board of Agriculture MARKETING LIVESTOCK INTELLIGENTLY By MR. J. C. SWIFT, Kansas City, Missouri Mr. Chairman, I am glad to say I am not one of those whole - sale packers of whom you have heard so much, but rather wish I was. Now, I haven't any speech gentlemen, but I am glad to have a \isit with you. I don't know why I am on this program unless it is in the nature of Exhibit "A" to prove that there is some other market except Omaha. Now I ha\e a great admiration for those Omaha Boosters, those Omaha live-wires who "claim that it is the only mar - ket." The fact is that If the deflation had not run over me a few years ago I suppose I would have offices in Omaha, and I would be asking you gentlemen for some of your business at that point, but I do want you to know that there is another market and there has been for a long time which also serves a great purpose. When these Omaha friends of yours tell you that, Omaha is beating the devil around the bush a little. To kill that notion is part of my job today. It is true that Omaha, counting in the sheep has more in number of livestock come into her yards in a year than Kansas City. But look at it in some other ways. In 1925 Kansas City at its stock yards had several thousand more carloads of live stock than Omaha did. Those figures are taken from the records. Kansas City also had 10,000 additional carloads of hogs over at the Independent plant which was Armours. In total she had 2 0,000 more car loads of live stock than they had at Omaha so you can hardly say that Omaha was second. Count inn Carloads and Dollars, Kansas City is Second Market When it comes to carloads and dollars per car we are second. But in the last anaylsis it doesn't make any difference whether we are first, second or third we are all functioning along the same lines. That is what I want to talk to you about this morning. Production has been carried along in all lines of business until we have over - developed our production, not only in live stock but in many other things. You know that the mills in this country could grind in eight months more flour than this country can consume in a year. You know that the mines can turn out in less than half a year all the fuel that we can consume in 12 months. You know these oil wells turn out more oil than the country's current needs. A great many oil wells have been plugged up and called dry wells, waiting for future needs. So there is more livestock in the country, and 'we have produced so much we have over-worked that end and neglected distribution. I think so in our line of business, and I want to qualify here today not only as a live-stock Commission Man, but I want you to take me </seg>
            <seg id="p551">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association as one of you. I am not just a City Slicker. I have handled a few thousand cattle this year, the final returns at which are written in red ink. I am running several farms, or rather perhaps they are run - ning me. I have been foolish enough to conduct for several years a country bank and have some interest in some city banks, and in that capacity I have been standing behind millions of dollars of cattle paper supposed to represent great' numbers of cattle raised on the ranges in the southwest. Every day I have some big man come in and tell me the story of his trials and tribulations so while we are here I want to tell you men that whatever I do here this morning is not hearsay but that I am a competent witness on the subject. So with reference to marketing livestock I have had experience, also taken part in all the factors that go to make up a big market. I had a good friend come in the other day who had brought in some cattle and he asked if I was in. I told him I would go down and look at the cattle with him. He was. a real operator, a man 55 to 60 years old. He said, "Swift, I love this cattle business. I love to breed them, I love to raise them, I love to feed them, I love it all but when I come to market then it makes me sour." Those are the words he used. How many men come to market and come away feeling sour? How many elements there are that enter into this mar - ket. We of course are naturally inclined to always pass the buck. If we make a mistake we try to blame it on somebody else. I have either- had too much of this or not enough, we didn't have the right help or we didn't have the right feed but if we happen to succeed then we are glad to place the credit for the success on our own efforts. I realize that the same is true in this business, but this market prop - osition is so big that I often wonder how many people understand its magnitude.' If most of you realize, my friends, that 70% of all of the things that grow out of the soil of this great United States are eventually marketed through the livestock industry. Did you ever stop to think that clear across the Nation from the Atlantic to the Pacific, from the Gulf to the Great Lakes seventy out of every one hundred acres is used for the production of e'lther grass, grain or some kind of feed eventually consumed by live stock? Only twenty acres out of every hundred is used directly for human food in this country and about ten acres for human clothing. Those of you who are here should bear this in mind and grasp the relationship of the livestock industry to agriculture. So when you are talking about the great resources of this livestock industry and its production of seventy per cent of the area of the country. That is one thing that I would like to emphasize and leave with you. I would like to bring to the people of the great United States a true and proper appreciation of the dignity of the business in which you and I are engaged. I don't know whether it will be done, but I hope it can be done. If we just take </seg>
            <seg id="p552">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture the figures of the government which tell us that in 1925, 500,000 people left the farms of the United States to go to the cities. It those figures are correct and that ratio continues long it will not be a great while before the man In town will be looking anxiously out to the man on the farm and asking him what he has got to sell. That is the conditions I expect to see if I live ten years longer. In spite of our objections to that condition I expect to see it demonstrate itself in a much shorter period than ten years. What about these Public Markets that are open 300 days in the year? They invite you to send your livestock in any fashion or form, at any day or time of the week, but that invitation should be considered carefully. It should be accepted only after careful consideration. Why Does Everybody Come to Market on Monday? I have never been able to understand why so many of my friends want to come to town on Monday with their livestock and. so few like to come on Thursday or Friday when our records will show, with the exception of stock cattle which should come to market on Mon - day, that the market should not be so glutted on just one day and that the best average result, with the exception of the stock cattle, can be secured later in the week, when we have our lighter period. If they would do this it would result in a more even distribution of re - ceipts not only In Kansas City, but in Chicago, Sioux City, Omaha, St. Joseph and other markets. In my own experience in business extend - ing over a period of thirty years, I have found that my firm receives its biggest percent of business on the days ol light rather than heavy runs. Professor Gramlich talked on a question of light cattle. It has been a problem with us because we have seen this baby beef demand or whim grow year by year. There has been an increasing demand for the baby beef and it will remain until the apartment craze ceases to exist; until the servant problem becomes simplified, until the society ceases to like jazz, bright lights, motor cars and fun. It is not just a passing whim, but it will remain with us. There is another thing that I would like to mention. That is these people who go around telling you that meat is not healthy. Mr. Pollock will take care of them in his talk. What they tell you about acids getting into the joints until you cannot function or get around when you are past fifty. Those people are certainly up against it on this proposition of young tender beef for we notice from careful study that its juices are milder. There isn't anything in this old acid bunk. Certainly it Is being knocked out by the current markets. I will tell you of a little thing that happened. A friend of mine had a brother who got over on the side of the vegetarian and decided not to eat meat any more. He came to visit a brother in Alma, Kansas, this friend of mine, who was still eating meat. Well he came back to </seg>
            <seg id="p553">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association visit his brother and told him how he had taken a big brown bear and taken it oft from a meat diet and put it on other food, and had broken the bear of eating meat. Well he came back to visit these people the next Christmas and the brother in Alma said, "How about the bear?'' His brother seemed to want to evade the question so the Alma brother twice asked the question and he wanted to know about the bear. Finally the visiting brother said," "If you must know, the damn bear broke out one day and went down the street and broke into the window of a meat market and grabbed a whole side ot beef." That is the way he had broken the bear In on a vegetarian diet. Consider Both Weight and Quality When Buying Feeders Now my friends, most of you no doubt, have had a lot of exper - ience with marketing cattle and you know that you should consider the cattle not only as to their weight, but for their quality. Many of our customers make a practice of buying cheap cattle in the fall and giving them a short feeding and putting them on the market in the spring. They usually get a good advance in price. I know some feeders who pay around seven and a half or eight and a half cents or sometimes more than that on the better class of cattle, and then rough them through the winter and finish them on grass and corn the next summer. Geography enters into the supply and value of the fat cattle, and this morning I could take you to south Texas and show you thousands of fine fat cattle that have been fed entirely on the grass and they would make fifty-two to sixty-three per cent and some make a little more, but never have been fed on grain. Of course there are some exceptional winters in the south, even in Texas. Of course those cattle suffer, some when it is real dry down there and they don't get feed. They have to come to Oklahoma and Kansas for pasture and then they come in contact with cattle from the western and north - ern regions later in the season. This year we are not going to have many Texas cattle in Oklahoma and Kansas. I know from what we find the situation to be down there that the demand for : pasture in Oklahoma and Kansas will certainly be less than it was a year ago. As to the future market in 1927; I know it is dangerous for a man to indulge in prophesy, but I can say to you that in my judgment this cattle market and particularly on good cattle has seen Its worst point and It is going to get some better. I don't know how much better. I wouldn't be surprised to see ft a dollar a cwt. higher, in the near future. As to the summer market it certainly won't be any worse than a year ago. Whether it will be any higher depends a good deal on what the corn crop looks like after it has been put in and started on its way. Hog Market Should Go Higher Now as to the hog market, the hog market is governed today considerably by the season of the year, the supply of hogs, and espec- </seg>
            <seg id="p554">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture ially when the production is not heavy. .1 think the hog market is going to go higher but I can't understand at that why lard would be selling around 12c and live hogs around the same price. I never played the Board of Trade in my life, but if I was.in - clined to speculate I certainly would dig into that situation. Some of you people may be feeding sheep, but if you are I am sorry for you. I believe at that you have seen the worst. I believe that even the sheep feeders this year have come to the point where the market is going to get a little better. Most of us have had our experiences in these things and our course ought to be governed by these experiences but it is not. A livestock man is a natural bull when it comes to the market and he always will be, I believe. He will probably persist in giving as much per pound for stock cattle as he can expect to get for them when he takes them back to the market. If you can't figure it out on cattle for a difference in price before they have been fed how are you going to come out on the expense incurred for feeding? Sometimes they say, "Well, the rattle didn't make me anything but they helped to improve the farm." Now the man who is taking that viewpoint is certainly an optimist. I think any man who is going to be in the cattle business has got to be an optimist, but there must come a turn in the tide. It probably has come to the range men. Well Bi-e&lt;I Calves Should Bring More Than $30.00 Calves were mentioned by Prof. Gramlich and he said something about $30.00 calves. I believe every man who has registered pure-bred cattle should have calves that he would feel are worth more than $30.00 apiece. I know a drove of range calves that are under contract !or three years in advance at $30.00. I believe with intelligent hand - ling that they will be a good buy. But I do want to say, my friends, in a general way that at every market you have some personal friend that is deeply interested in jour welfare. Now don't think, men, that the commission men are entirely absorbed in just the matter of com - missions and are thinking only of revenue. If the Commission Man has got a thimble-full of brains he knows that for him to succeed he must help his customers to succeed. If he is going to stay in business the customer must be in business. So when the radio comes in with a message from Chicago and says that Chicago has got a light run, don't get excited and jump at a conclu - sion that you should rush your stock over there, but just get in touch with Omaha, Kansas City, or some of the rest of the markets, and get in touch with your Commission Man. That radio man don't tell you at the same time perhaps that Chicago might have carried over fifteen thousand cattle the day before. I remember a few months </seg>
            <seg id="p555">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association - - ago a radio message came out announcing a light run from Chicago but they didn't tell of the heavy amount carried over from yesterday. If the customer had gotten in touch with us, we could probably have steered him to a higher market. If the radio man had given the full situation he would have been doing his duty, and would have saved shipper's money. Livestock Industry is Our Greatest Industry Now we should j realize the importance of our work; you and I are engaged in this great Live Stock Industry, we are engaged in the greatest industry in the United States. These fields that produce this grain would not produce it long if the live stock were not on hand to consume it from every quarter.. "These ranges that grow this grass would not be the ranges they are if it was not for the live stock on them. These towns that boast of how they have flourished with their wonderful school buildings and all of their other buildings rest square - ly on the production of the soil, in a large measure. It might well be said today for America that if the time ever comes that the live stock industry and agriculture is eliminated from' the activities of the country it would be [in a sorry plight. I don't want live stock to see that day, but I do want to see the day that when we put a bunch of cattle in the feed lot or a bunch of hogs or. sheep in the feed lot that we will have some reasonable assurance that we can secure some re - turn for our efforts! We are engaged in a manufacturing business. You are buying or raising your material and you have no idea what your finished product will bring on the market. No other manufac - turer is working on a similarly precarious condition. I don't know just what can be done, but it seems to me that something must be done, and before I close I want to tell you something that is being done that is very detrimental you. Now I am not talking to you as a com - mission merchant engaged in one of the Public Markets of the country. I am not talking to you as the' man who lives in the city and gets his livelihood from the: products of the farm and range, but right now I am talking to you 1 as the man who is engaged in farming, who has a ranch, and who is interested in the welfare of the country. Public Livestock Markets Are Being Undermined .Now I want. to speak a. moment on the Public Livestock Markets of the United States which are being undermined. They are being undermined by a system of diverting the live stock that formerly was offeree! on the. market into private channels and by a reduction of competititive buying. A- system by which the values are lowered. I want to say that although we are Old Line Commission men, we have a strong co-operation in the so-called co-operative organizations. It is to the advantage} as well as to the credit of the farm organizations </seg>
            <seg id="p556">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture that they were the first to see the dangers of this undermining of the public markets and they have been most zealous and vigorous in fight - ing it. I hope that after the proposition is drawn to your attention of the danger to the public open markets where all buyers are invited to come in and compete with each other that you will organize and stand by those of us who are fighting for the public markets as vital to the life and welfare of this country. I want to close with this state - ment. If all of the great purchasers of live stock were to get their supply on the public market as they did a few years ago hogs would be worth at least a dollar a hundred more in Omaha today. I thank you. CHAIRMAN' GRAFF: I know you all appreciate this address by Mr. Swift. I think he said a mouthful many times. I recall in his talk his reference to the vegetarian. So many people in this country who claim there are lives being endangered by too much eating of meats. I have been told a time of two that I was indisposed and the . doctor would ask me about smoking and eating and he says, "Now, hadn't you better cut out the meat, Charlie, and maybe you could smoke a little less." I just said, "Well, you don't seem to want me to live anymore." I didn't take his advice, .men, and here I am this morning. Now the next speaker on the program this morning will be R. C. Pollock, a member of the National Livestock and Meat Board, of Chicago, Illinois. It has been about two years since he was out here to talk to you at your annual meeting, and in that two years he has done a lot of things for livestock growers. Mr. Pollock. ACTIVITIES OF THE NATIONAL LIVE STOCK AND MEAT BOARD R. C. POLLOCK Manager, National Livestock and Meat Board Gentlemen: I am especially glad for this Opportunity to talk to you today in view of the recent achievement of the University of Nebraska in winning the first Intercollegiate Meat Judging Contest at the International Live Stock Exposition. During my visit here it is to be my pleasure to present the National Live Stock and Meat Board trophy to the winning team and also the placque awarded for highest individual honors to Don Ray, one of its members. Teams from ten universities and colleges competed in the Meat Judging Contest. The contest not only was an innovation at the International but it was the first event of its kind ever held in con - nection with any exposition or fair. The judging included beef, pork, mutton and lamb. </seg>
            <seg id="p557">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association- Before taking up the work or the Board in general I want to dwell a little longer on the subject of Nebraska for I know that all of you will be interested in knowing what your state is doing in connection with the Board's program. While the Meat Judging Con - test is the most recent instance of co-operation there are others in which Nebraska has played a prominent part. As a matter of fact, the state always has been active in assisting the work of education and research on the subject of meat. Professor Gramlich and your station are participating in the na - tional-study of factors influencing the quality and payability of meat in which agricultural jexperlment stations of the country and the United States Department of Agriculture have joined hands. rw N ? braSk V?? 1 - a !? ea i, i . ud ? in(lr tcnrf to «"&gt; First Inter-ColleKiatc Meat JuditinB £"," * '" t , hu ft U , nitw S*K Thtlse b °W bt -° u K ht home the bacon in ihe IhlSnln-' n™ P w Luftt ° "KM: Peter Pratt.

Professor Gramlich also has provided experimental animals for the "Quality in Meats" Exhibit held annually at- the International. These animals, slaughtered and displayed in the form of carcasses and cuts, have taught a valuable lesson in meat production. The les - son taught has assisted the Board's effort to set live-stock. producers thinking of their live stock in terms of the finished product — meat. The University of Nebraska also has come to the fore in the Board's National Meat Story Contest, which is conducted annually in high schools of the United States. Last year and the year previous Miss Margaret Fedde, Chairman of the University's Department of Home Economics, served as a member of the committee which judged the stories on meat. </seg>
            <seg id="p558">Report ok Nkiiuaska Statr Board ok Ac.iucri.nRK. The Board thoroughly appreciates the hearty co-operation typified by the instances I have mentioned, for it serves as proof that the program in the interests of meat is a constructive one. Now suppose we turn to the subject of the Board's program in general. Thp Board was organized to champion the cause of the entire live-stock and meat industry, and in this role has met with even ' greater success: i n the comparatively short period it has been in exist - ence than had been anticipated or hoped. It has the distinction oE being the only organization of its kind in the world in which all branches of a great industry have joined hands to promote the interests of all concerned. Its Board of Directors of seventeen is composed of eleven men representing live-stock producers' associations, two from the National Live Stock Exchange, two from the Institute of American Meat Packers, and two from organizations of meat retailers. How is the Board benefitting the live-stock and meat industry? How does it work for your interests? These and many other ques - tions I hope to answer in telling of the work* Hoard's lYoffnim Includes Education and Research The Board's program is divided into two branches. These. are: Education on the subject of meat, and research of various types. One is dependent on the other. Research findings, both economic and scientific, are utilized in building up a more effective program of meat education. I have mentioned previously that various factions have assailed meat as a food without just cause. Add to this the fact that the average housewife who buys most of the family meat is familiar with only two or three steaks and a couple of roasts and it is at once ap - parent that the Board has a tremendous task on its hands. The work of education includes lectures on meat, meat cutting demonstrations, meat exhibits, publication and distribution of instructive literature, meat story contests, radio talks, and a score of other projects. Ready co-operation in the work has come from the United States Department of Agriculture, railroads, women's clubs, high schools, colleges and uni - versities, and many other institutions. Research, including scientific and economic projects already has brought to light many vital facts concerning meat. The Board thus far has established three fellowships under which a great deal of im - portant investigation has been, and is being conducted. These and other research undertakings I shall mention more specifically a little later. * </seg>

            <seg id="p560">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture average daily attendance was more than 1,000; in fact, the crowds reached such proportions at times that It was difficult to accommodate everyone. There is no question that this type of work is doing a tremendous amount of good for meat and for the entire industry. I understand that plans are under way for at least two more trains through eastern states in the near future and no doubt others will follow. Colleges Take Keen Interest ill Meat Judging Contest An excellent example of the Board's contact with colleges and universities in its effort to stimulate a more thorough study of the subject of meat was the Intercollegiate Meat Judging Contest, held as a new feature of the 192 6 International Live Stock Exposition. Ten institutions entered teams in this event sponsored by the Board, and there is every indication that a much larger number will participate next year. State colleges and universities throughout the country were invited to take part and it is a most significant fact that without excep - tion the replies were most enthusiastically in favor of a contest of this nature. Annual Meat Story Contest Popular in High Schools of U. S. Outstanding in the Board's work with high schools is the annual National Meat Story Contest. The first contest was launched in high schools of the United States in 1924 and the event was repeated in 1925 and 1926. The splendid response of high school students and in - structors of home economics has prompted the Board to make plans for a fourth contest to be held during the spring of this year. More than 10,000 high-school girls competed in the last contest and teachers in general voluntarily indorsed the project as a progres - sive movement in the study of meat. Four university scholarships were awarded aside from a large number of cash prizes. Winners were selected by a committee of which Dr. Louise Stanley, chief of the bureau of home economics, U. S. Department of Agriculture, wa3 chairman, and Miss Margaret Fedde, chairman of the department of home economics, University of Nebraska, and Miss Marie Sellers, home bureau editor of Pictorial Review, were members. Schools and Colleges Praise Board's Textbook on Meat High schools also are using a large quantity of a textbook on meat published recently by the Board. This textbook, entitled, "Ten Lessons on Meat," was intended primarily for use in preparatory schools but it has won favor in higher institutions of learning as well and has been found valuable by many organizations of the business world. Up to the present time, quantities have been ordered by 555 </seg>
            <seg id="p561">Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association high schools in 46 states and it has gone to some 33 colleges and universities. Other sources of distribution have been libraries, hotels, restaurants, meat retailers, packers, state departments of education, housewives, etc. The text takes up all phases of the subject of meat, including Its physical structure and chemical Composition, methods of preparing the various cuts, its place in the balanced diet, how to carve, and other subjects. National Radio Program Spreads Meat Facts Radio is being used most effectively in disseminating the truth about meat. The magnitude of the Board's program on the atr may be appreciated when it is pointed out that during the last fiscal year 218 educational talks on meat were given, utilizing 31 leading broad - casting stations in all sections of the country. At least 90% of the radio talks were upon subjects of interest to the housewife. The re - maining 10% dealt with various subjects pertaining to the live-stock and meat industry — its magnitude, efficiency, the effort being made to serve the consuming public to its thorough satisfaction, etc. That the radio public appreciates these talks is evidenced by the fact that hundreds of requests are received through the mail for recipes broadcast and for literature .referred to in the talks. It is impossible to say how many people have been reached in this manner but it is certain that the number has teen large considering the wide popularity of radio and the intensity of the program. The broad - casting is being continued with the same splendid results. Press of Nation Prints Facts About Meat The press furnishes a means of reaching the public with the story of meat which is probably equal to the radio. News and feature ar - ticles originating in the Board's office are published in newspapers and various other publications throughout the United States from time to time, and special co-operation is forthcoming from publications close - ly associated with the industry such as the market, agricultural, and meat trade journals. Board Sponsors Educational Meat Exhibits Four years ago exhibits of meat in connection with fairs and ex - positions were unknown. Today,] as a result of effort exerted by the National Live Stock &lt;and Meat Board, such exhibits have taken a prom - inent place among the features of these shows. The Board has as - sumed complete sponsorship of some of these exhibits and has co-oper - ated with local, organizations in the presentation of others. These exhibits are prepared so as to be of value both to the pro- </seg>
            <seg id="p562">Rki-out of Nkhhanka State Board of Agricii.tuke ducer and the consumer. They have been in place at national exposi - tions, state fairs, and food shows. The most recent occasion was the 192 6 International Live Stock Exposition, at which the "Quality in Meats" exhibit drew wide atten - tion. This exhibit represented the combined efforts of the Board, state agricultural experiment stations, the U. S. Department of Agriculture, and the Institute of American Meat Packers. The meats shown told a valuable story of the effects of various feeding, breeding, and hand - ling practices upon the finished product. The Board assisted in a comprehensive exhibit at the Sesquicen - tennial Exposition; it co-operated in an exhibit at the American Royal Live Stock Show at Kansas City, and many others too numerous to mention are on the list. Literature Plays an Important Part in Board's Program Literature on meat published and distributed by the Board must not be minimized in summarizing the principal means through which education on this food is developed. As a matter of fact, the book - lets, pamphlets, leaflets, posters and other forms of printed matter are one of the chief items to be considered, for this material is find - ing its way into the h&amp;me, into tha school, and into the college in every section of the country. There is a constant heavy demand for meat literature and the Board is filling thousands of requests for it. It is interesting to note that this demand is much heavier than it was two or three years ago. This would seem to indicate that interest in meat is increasing steadily. 1 have already mentioned ihe textbook on meat and have given a few of the facts incident to its use in high schools, colleges, and other institutions. More Than a Million Meat Recipe Books Distributed The Board has found that meat recipe books are exceptionally popular. An attractive book of this sort containing prize winning recipes has been published at the conclusion of each of the three Na - tional Meat Story Contests held thus far. Last year 418,000 copies of the current book went into American homes. This year's publica - tion has reached a distribution of more than half a million and is still in demand. The distribution was aided materially by meat retailers and packers who purchased quantities for re-distribution to their trade. Other booklets and pamphlets are prepared as the need for them presents itself. Some or these go to consumers and others are pre - pared with the idea of keeping the live-stock and meat Industry ad - vised of the Board's activities. </seg>

The offenders explained that it was not their intention or de - sire to disparage meat and they gladly consented to revise their ad - vertising accordingly. ■ Much of the propdganda charging meat with imaginary crimes against health comes from individuals or groups who are misinformed or are prompted in their attacks; by fanatical beliefs. The Board is counteracting such statements with facts proving these charges to be unsound. Board /Assists Industry in Emergencies Taking up a slightly different phase of. the Board's work It may be said that the organization stands always ready to assist the var - ious branches of the industry in time of emergency. About a year ago iamb feeders of the west were confronted with a serious situation. The supply of heavy lambs was excessive and feeders faced heavy financial lossis if the supply could not be moved More recently the beef cattle inc ustry of the west and central west found itself in a similar predicament. There was a large supply of heavy corn fed beef on hand ant the problem was to find a market for it. . • In both of these instances the Board was called upon for assis - tance, and publicity campaigns were launched without delay in an effort to improve the situation. Material went to the press, radio talks were broadcast from stations all over the country, leading railroads made use of lamb and beef stiikers and otherwise featured these meats. Display advertising campaigns were launched. Every assist - ance was extended by the Institute of American Meat Packers and the National Association of Retail Mdat Dealers toward making the cam - paigns a success. Reports received following these campaigns gave every indication (hat the desired results were obtained. Board Considers Grading and Marking For the past two years the organization has given serious con - sideration to ' the proposed grading and marking of carcass meat. </seg>
            <seg id="p564">Rkpout on- Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Through extensive surveys it gathered together a mass of information and opinion upon the subject as expressed by men in all branches of the industry. In its consideration of the subject the Board has had the co-operation of the Better Beef Committee, with which, no doubt, you are all familiar. At the present time it appears that something definite will develop in the near future in regard to the grading and marking question. Quality and Palatabillty Study and Others Make up Research Work Now suppose we take up some of the points of work coming under the head of research. Perhaps the most interesting of these projects to you men and to the industry as a whole is the study of factors influencing quality and palatability of meat. This study was originally fostered by the National Live Stock and Meat Board and since it was first considered by the Board about two and one-half years ago, it has grown to national proportions. It has the full support of the United Slates Department of Agriculture, the American Society of Animal Production, and state agricultural experiment stations. According to the latest figures. 23 experiment stations have actually begun work upon the subject and others are said to be ready to begin operations in the near future. I hope that all of you gentlemen will appreciate fully what this study means. It presents a most difficult problem for there is little definite information available which can be utilized. Meat palatability is practically an unknown quantity. Means must be devised for ac - curately measuring the color, texture and other characteristics of meat. Never before have experimental agencies joined in such a tre - mendous co-operative project as this. The study is looked upon by live-stock and meat authorities as one of the greatest ever undertaken in behalf of the live-stock and meat industry. Actual work in solving the many problems now has been under way only little more than a year but marked progress already is re-, ported. Experiments are taking up the study of feeding, breeding, age, sex, grass versus grain, etc., and the experimental animals are being carried through slaughtering and cooking tests. The committee having in charge the outlining of the extensive program and its conduct is composed of Professor F. B. Mumford, Uni - versity of Missouri, chairman; Mr. E. W. Sheets, chief of the animal husbandry division, bureau of animal industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture, secretary; Professor M. D. Helser, Iowa State College; Professor H. J. Gramlich, University of Nebraska; Dr. C. Robert Moul - ton, Institute of American Meat Packers; Professor Sleeter Bull, Uni - versity of Illinois; and Dr. P. F.

            <seg id="p566">Kkpokt of Nkiumkka State Board of Agriculture The Southern States are taking an active interest in the work as it progresses. As this meeting is being held in Mississippi, I might mention in conclusion that this state stands out prominently in at least three projects of the Board. The agricultural experiment sta - tion is among those co-operating in the study of quality and palata - bility of meat. The station was on hand with an outstanding display at the "qual - ity in Meats" exhibit held in connection with the 1926 International Live Stock Exposition. This display, Including steer carcasses to illus - trate the influence of breeding, was considered of such importance that a leading breed association had photographs taken of it and these ac - companied a lengthy article appearing in the Chicago Evening Post. Mississippi has been well represented in all three of the National Meat Story Contests. The state winner last year was Miss Drewery of New Albany. Other Southern States are equally as prominent in the work and we want you people of the South to fully appreciate the fact that you are an important cog in the Board's machinery. We have had your hearty co-operation in the past and are depending upon it for the future. Mr. Dan Hildebrand, presiding in the place of Mr. Graff, then in - troduced the next speaker, the Hon. Duncan Marshall, Former Minister of Agriculture, Toronto, Canada, to speak upon the subject: LIVKHTOCK AND PROSPKKITY HON. DUNCAN MARSHALL Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: I have had the pleasure of looking at you, a good many of your faces and becoming somewhat acquainted with you since I came to this place. I believe I am on the program lor the general meeting this afternoon and as the time is rather short this session, I will make my remarks brief so you may get away. Now when I think of the number of meetings that I may be called upon to talk at here it reminds me of two Irishmen who came across to New York and were present when they caught a mur - derer. Pat says, "Hang him sure." Mike says, "No, I wouldn't hang him, I wouldn't do anything like that, I would not hang him. You don't hang people for murder in this country, you kill them with elocution." It would seem that you people must have as many lives as a cat if you can listen to me speak so often. Perhaps people who live on the land and know livestock can stand such constant, discussions of it with all of the intricate phases. </seg>
            <seg id="p567">Nkiihaska iMi'imvKD.LivKstbcK Bhkkiikiis' Association I don't know why Ihoy put nu&gt; on this particular topic, this morn - ing. Anyway, I suppose it was to prove in the ten minutes that I am going to talk to you, at least to my own satisfaction, if not yours, that farming in your country like in ours finds it impossible to leave a little more or less prosperity unless it has its basis in livestock. Livestock is the basis of good agriculture In- practically every country in the world. We did have some land in Western Canada that we thought perhaps could be farmed forever without any fertilization whatever and without especially keeping any livestock on it. But we are getting over that idea somewhat. Those men who came out early on the western prairie land had somewhat similar experience. They came out on the prairies, got a little bit of land broken and went out and worked some place else earning a living, came back and harvested a little wheat in the proper season, went somewhere during the winter and worked and then came back in the spring and put in a little bit of crops, and then worked out a little bit in the summer. They would be away from home two-thirds of the time until their families could prove up and then when they had their land proved upon they sold out to the first man who came along. We have a great many farms that have been developed in Western Canada because they dis - covered that cows were the greatest colonizers in the world. I don't know of anything that will keep a man home better than half a dozen co.ws to milk in the morning and again at night. It sure teaches him regular habits and at the same time provides a regular income. A great many people among our fore-fathers in Scotland found and followed the habit of beginning with a cow or two before they had anything else on their place and they got a lot of milk out of one cow or two cows. ■ ' • ■ ' ' . .

            <seg id="p568">Rkport of Nkiirahka State Board of AoRfcrt.Tiritu Farming is More Than a Job Sometimes I think farming isn't a job at all, it is more or less an occupation. Few men who start out to speculate and simply buy live - stock with that in view make fortunes in what we call farming. Let's take a self-supporting home and figure the difference between two boys, one boy stays on the farm and one goes into the city. A very small percentage of successful men come from any speculative business. A large percentage of them become employed in institutions, and at the end of a less time they have some kind of a home, but not a self - supporting home. Not the kind of a home that men and women make on the land, the homes of a country are the most important thing3 that it can have. There is nothing that builds up a country more substantially than its homes. Now regarding livestock. Livestock is the thing which keeps boys and girls on the farm. We have an opportunity to grasp the problems which we have heard so often discussed. It has been discussed at every school house, at every country school house, this problem of keeping boys and girls on the farm. You never saw a normal boy who wasn't interested in livestock and who wouldn't prove some hope to ac - complish something with livestock. There is nothing with which you can awake the interest of boys and girls who are growing up more quickly than to have them learn to like to raise livestock. If you are going to keep intelligent boys and girls on the farm you have got to have livestock and you have to have livestock in which intelligent boys and girls will be interested. So I don't know of anything better in the world, or anything that I am fonder of than calves. Every boy should have his own calf. I became attached to livestock very early in life. I don't know how many of you fellows every really had a cow you were really interested in, in caring for and feeding. As a boy I used to go after the cows and bring them in early in the morning. My father was a Scotch farmer. He had another pasture for the calves and wouldn't let them in until a certain time. Everybody concentrated on those calves for two or three weeks. Now they always used to have me go out in the pasture to get those cows and it seemed they never would get up. You might call six or eight or ten different times to get them and bring them in to milk. We had a dog on our farm -who. helped considerable. I know we had one old roan who would crowd over in one corner and just refuse to move. Now I had to go out on a very cold morning and get her. I gave her one kick and got her to move away for a few inches and then I stepped over in the warm place. That is when I first got to be fond of cows. Now ever since then I have just been getting to like livestock a little better all the time. My experience with boys and girls growing up on the farm is that if you are going to keep them interested and keep them on the farm you must have livestock. There never was a chance without it. </seg>
            <seg id="p569">NKIIItASKA IHPROVKO LIVESTOCK BliEKDKIts' ASSOCIATION There never was such an opportunity as we have had in the last three or four years for farmers to improve their livestock. It is true it has been a most uncertain period for the men who raise purebred live - stock and who bought at the high prices during the war boom. They have suffered tremendously and the value of their stuff has kept coming down until it is not worth 25% of what it was, but neverthe - less this has been the greatest opening during my life time. There is vast opportunity in Canada and the United States for men to improve their livestock and to get rid of the cows on their place they do not want and replace them with one-half the number of better bred cows and the cattle of which they can be proud no matter what kind of cattle they may want to breed. A few dollars will buy a good animal. Mr. Swift this morning in his splendid address on Markets, brought out some of these points very well. ■ ■ ■ Replace the Scrubs Now If you cull out some of your cattle and replace them with the best you can buy, you will make use of the greatest opportunity that has been offered to the livestock farmer on this continent in thirty or forty years. This show that you had in here this morning demonstrat - ed that. This man Gramlich bought at a very reasonable price the herd bull that was shown here. Such bulls can be purchased all over the United States at very reasonable prices if men who have the proper statement will go and buy them. To the man who has a few grade cows this, is your special opportunity. I think the same' is true of hogs,' sheep and horses as cattle. .This is your greatest opportunity to buy pure, well bred animals and improve the quality of your live - stock. You should pick them out from purebred stock and replace the poor ones that you have on your farm and even if you replace them with half the number of better animals you not only add to the quality and production of your* livestock but you are doing what is a very wise assistance in keeping up the general qualify of the stock in the community. A man came once and told me that he was very much annoyed and worried about his boys. He couldn't get them to milk the cows and he was in the dairy business.- I went out and saw the cows and really I didn't blame the boys very much. These were really intelligent. boys. If you have cows that give thirty, forty or fifty pounds of milk from a milking, the boys will milk that kind with pleasure. It is fun to milk a cow that gives thirty or forty pounds at a milking. What is more fun than milking .when you look at the pail of milk and sec how the foam comes up? What is greater satisfaction in milking a cow, than to realize that the pall you started with won't hold the whole milking and you have to go and get a second pall? You want the boy to look at the milking with pride and get a real satisfaction out of it, and not cuss the old cow but pet her, for really even an </seg>

How much better that is than to have her rip and pull and snort for two or three quarters of an hour and not get much more than a quart of milk. If you can make the work with the cows a pleasure It becomes an incentive for the boys to stay. Other - wise you drive them into the city and they get off the farm. The wrong kind of cows never bring proper returns to the farm, you never get the proper action from them, and they never make life on the farm worth while. Who Cares if a Scrub Does Die? What is true in the dairy business is just as true in every line of livestock activity. It is worth the trouble to raise the grade of your stock by cleaning out the poor calves and taking out the poor cattle, Calves that are accustomed to grain before weaninc wean better and shrink less. The younper the animal the cheaper the train. These two reasons have caused many Ni-braska farmer to adopt the plan of creep feeding .young calves on pasture. and getting a better grade. If I see a scrawny, poor runt, I don't care much whether it dies or not. Now you can interest the sons and daughters of farmers living on Nebraska farms in future agriculture, and you can't do it in any better manner, than by giving them a knowledge of good livestock now. Set up a new standard for livestock on your farm and awaken the interest in the hearts of the boys and girls who are growing up and place a responsibility on them. You will not only make more money by this course, but you will get in addition good livestock in place of the scrubs that you may have had. When you work hard on the farm you want to see results for that work. One source of the greatest satisfaction which you can get from </seg>

There is no finished product in any factory of which we can be more proud than we can of the products of our farms. Keep on improving your livestock and you will add to the value of your place and you will add to the citizenship and welfare of your community.

Banquet at the Lincoln Hotel, January 6, 1927, the meeting was called 'to order by the President, Mr. Graff at 10:00 p. m., with thirty members present. ■ The Secretary reported some of the main activities during 1926, as follows: The State College Livestock Judging Team received $150.00 to - ward their expenses to the International Livestock Show at Chicago. • , The Champion Boys' and- Girls' Junior Judging Team received $100.00 for expenses to the Sioux City Interstate Fair, where they ■ represented Nebraska. Six silver prizes were presented to six club girls who won the first six prizes in the Breeders' Association Canned Meat exhibit at the State Fair. The Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association actively supported the 1926 Nebraska Pig Crop Contest, the first contest of Its kind ever held. The Association presented a seal to be placed upon each Document of Recognition presented by the Agricultural College to the winners. An automatic Delineascope' was purchased for use in show win - dows and exhibits at State and County Fairs. (One oE the most successful Annual Conventions ever held was eld during January at the Agricultural College. A complete report of this meeting, can be found in the 1926 report of the State Board of Agriculture. The Association activelj supported the Tuberculosis Eradication campaign and took active pirt in staging the Midwest Tuberculosis Conference at Omaha on Jurij 28th and 29th. . Active support was given to the Big Team Work started in Ne - braska during the fall of 1926. The Secretary's report was approved as read. As a matter of old business Mr. Graff announced that $200.00 had been appropriated from the funds of the Association toward the expenses of the Tuberculosis Conference held at Omaha, June 28th and 29th, 1926. He announced that this appropriation had been made by the. Board of Directors which met at the Castle Hotel for a meeting on Monday evening, June 28th. Then Dr. Hays explained the great value of the above mentioned Tuberculosis Convention and stated that the report stands out as a </seg>
            <seg id="p574">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriclxture classic report of that nature. He stated that in his estimation the Breeders' Association could do no greater work than to aid staging such a convention. President Graft explained in detail the financing of the winter meetings of Organized Agriculture and went on record in favor of paying Duncan Marshall quite liberally for the good work done at the 1927 meetings. C. B. Steward explained the National Boys' and Girls' Club Con - ference lo be held at Washington during the summer of 1927 and stated that he would like to see the Association contribute something toward sending representative boys and girls to this convention. President Graff then called on Mr. O. O. Waggener, who is in charge of Nebraska Livestock 4-H Club work. Mr. Waggener explained the qualifications which must be met by boys and girls who attend the convention. Mr. C. B. Steward moved that the Association furnish $100.00 toward the expenses of sending representative livestock club boys and girls to Washington, D. C. The motion was seconded by Mr. Frank Crocker, and carried. Dr. Hays reviewed the hog cholera situation as it appeared In Nebraska during 1926 and it is likely to appear during 1927. He out - lined a proposed campaign to be carried out during the spring months. Moved and seconded by Mr. Frank Crocker that the campaign idea be endorsed and that the Association stand ready to do whatever possible to aid in acquainting farmers with the truth about the hog cholera situation. Motion was seconded, and carried. A suggestion was made by Dr. Hays that the Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association might aid other livestock associations in giving an honor dinner to Dr. L. Van Es for his great services to the state of Nebraska. The suggestion was well taken by those present and President Graff instructed the Secretary to aid in planning sonie such activity at some suitable time in the future. The 1926 officers were again selected to hold offices during 192T. President, Charles Graff; Treasurer, H. J. Gramlich; and Secretary, M. B. Posson. Meeting was adjourned at 11:20 p. in. </seg>

CHAIRMAN PHELPS: First on our program is the Address of Welcome, to be delivered by Mt. Robert Elliott, president of the Chadron State Normal College. (Applause.) ADDRESS OK WELCOME MR. ROBERT ELL.1OTT, President Chadron State Normal College, Chadron: • • I thought it had gone past the Address of Welcome time and. I had not figured jon giving one since- two o'clock. I am very glad to have the chance to appear before this group. I think it was three years ago when this group met here before, but I believe it is somewhat enlarged this year, taking in a few more activities. We are certainly pleased to have you meet here for the . second time. We still hear of the splendid exhibit placed- in the gymnasium three years ago, and I think It had a whole lot to do with stimulating interest along agricultural lines. I want the students of the school this year to see that exhibit. I think in some respects it is second to none in the country in the display of agricultural products, and I am very proud to belong in the section of the state that raises the best seed potatoes in the world. I think it is time for us to begin to -talk in no uncertain terms about the seed potatoes that are grown in the western section of the state. ■ I am not here to make an extended address, but simply to welcome you people. I can assure you that if there is anything we can do for you while you are here, we want to do it. If there is anything that you want and do not see, just ask for it. We have a little larger plant than we had-three years ago. We have now on the west side of the campus the first unit of the new training school building. It is one of the most important buildings in connection witji the State Teachers College. We hope to complete </seg>
            <seg id="p584">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture it within another year, providing the legislature will give us the proper appropriation. Nearly everyone who comes here has heard that this institution possesses a swimming pool. Nearly everybody wants to use it I will permit the use of that pool with the understanding that anyone who uses it must have had a bath within a year or he does not get per - m.ssion to use the pool. (Laughter.) If you can bring a certificate to show you are safe on that proposition, I can assure you the swim - ming pool will be at your service. It is an excellent pool We have the finest sort of sanitation. We have a violet ray apparatus which purifies the water, which I think is the latest and best device that can be found in the way of sanitation for swimming pools. So you may feel perfectly safe to use the pool any time you desire to do so. There is an excellent shower bath in connection. A whole lot of you folks-and I know some of these men pretty well - will want to know before they are here very long where the Home Economics Department Is located. The cookery department is on the third floor, east end. 1 will assure you you will see as good cooking facilities as you will find any place in this or any other state. We admit we have the finest Teachers College in the State of Nebraska— at least, in the west end of the state— and we welcome you here. We solicit your Inspection of the institution. We will give you whatever we have. It is at your service. I understand a great many want to use the cafeteria dining room and we are perfectly willing for you to do so; in fact, we are glad to have you eat In our dining room. One reason why we can serve so cheaply Is because we have been doing what you folks are advocating. We have an agricultural adjunct to our Institution, and by virtue of it we raise our own potatoes. We have our own cows, pork, and chickens. We raise our alfalfa and practically all of the vegetables we need in connection with the dormitory. That is one reason why we can furnish what we think is such excellent board for $4.50 a week. I want you to eat a meal and then tell me If you think we do not serve excellent board for the price we charge. I heard a good story not long since along the line of progress. We are making progress every day. I know this. This will be a better meeting than we had three years ago because progress is being made along all lines. The Denver Post, speaking of ladies' dresses, said their skirts were getting higher and higher, and the man I heard telling about this said, "In times past— twenty-five or thirty or fifty years ago— a man who could hide behind a woman's skirt was considered a coward. In these days, a man who can do this Is considered a magician." (Laughter.) I can assure you we are making progress rapidly. I give you this as a concrete example to show progress is being made. </seg>

I know that such a welcome could not be other than sincerely appre - ciated by everybody. ' When a town or its people welcomes such a group and means it, it should help everybody to do .his part on the program and make it beneficial. - . i If I were to express any particular hope for the success of this first meeting of Organized Agriculture in western Nebraska, it would be a hope for increase in the "organized part of this so-called Organized Agriculture. Forty jfears ago or more when the first efforts were made and the first talk was heard about organization in any agricultural line, it was more or less of ja joke. But the time is here now when organized agriculture will become a fact — not a question any longer. Before agriculture as a business ever becomes particularly appealing to the young men, or the home life of agriculture becomes appealing to the young women, there will have to be a lot more unity in agriculture. It can't come in any other way. Naturally, agriculturists are individ - ualistic. Their life {has made them so, and we have had it preached, and believed it, that every agricultural tub should stand on its own bottom. I believe it could. It has done it for forty years. But when in all other business practices collective bargaining and actual co-opera - tive efforts have increased from year to year, agriculture can not do otherwise than organize, too. There is no use of agriculture quarreling with the tendency of business in that direction'. It had better observe and listen and apply it to itself. It was not so very long ago the average townsman felt more kinship with some stranger walking down Fifth Avenue than with the average farmer ftvi; miles out: and the average farmer felt more kin - ship with the farner in Pennsylvania than with the business man of 'liis town. When your town man and country man realize whatever is good for agriculture must and' will be good for town business, and vice versa, we wili have a mutual feeling in the agricultural districts that will help us all. If this meeting did not more than to Increase the fellowship between town man and country man within this agricul - turardistrict, it wpuld be time well spent. </seg>
            <seg id="p586">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture With the hope that this will be the first of many successful lveetings, we will proceed with our program. I thank you. (Applause.) CHAIRMAN PHELPS: We have for our next number "The Purpose of Western Ne - braska Organized Agricultural Meetings," by Mr. H. O. Werner, who is Secretary of the Nebraska Potato Improvement Association and has been largely responsible for the success of the certified seed potato industry in western Nebraska. THK Pl'KPOHK OK WESTKRX NEBRASKA OHOAXIS5KD AGRICULTURAL MEETINGS MR. H. 0. WERNER, Lincoln, Nebraska: Mr. Chairman, Members of the Potato Association, Friends and Visitors: Perhaps a consideration for a few moments of why we are here, would be helpful to us all. Tomorrow afternoon Mr. Mc- Kelvie will talk on "Where Do We Go From Here?" Perhaps it Is advisable to know why we are here in the first place. Some of you who are acquainted with the history of potato work in the western part of the state know that its first meeting was held in 1917. There is one man here at this time — Jake Pedrett — who has been at every meeting since. The meetings grew from meetings that Jake insists had three farmers and seven professors, to the place where the farmers outnumber the professors and by quite a large margin. The meetings have grown perhaps not so much in size as in interest. We began widening our scope until last year our program consisted of as many subjects not potatoes, as those bearing directly on the seed potato industry. A few weeks later the Crop Improvement Association held a special show at Bridgeport for sweet clover and alfalfa seed. We decided after they had held their show that perhaps it would be a good thing to combine forces and have the two meetings together. The proposition was suggested to Mr. Stewart, and we were able to agree upon a joint meeting, the purpose originally being for a seed show in farm crops and potatoes. We interested Mr. Biedermann and decided to combine with the Northwest Farmers Congress. Thus the plan began taking on volume like a snow ball. We found ourselves with quite a program mapped out for these meetings. Each year at the Agricultural College there is held a series of meetings known as Organized Agriculture. As a matter of fact, this Organized Agriculture ia made up of seven or eight organizations, varying from year to year. On account of the great distance from </seg>
            <seg id="p587">NBnn.vsKA Potato Improvement Association the area .west or the sand hills to Lincoln, the people from the western part of the state have not been attending those meetings in great numbers, due to the lack of time and the expense. Since the vast majority of the people came from the western part of the state, it " was logical to have j programs which would be of interest to those people. Aside from the subject of pure bred live stock and pure seed, there probably has not been very much . of interest in those meetings to western farmers; at least, not very much that could be put into practice on their own farms. • , You people are helping to .support the Agricultural College. In - stead of your being | asked to come east by the hundreds, it seemed more logical to bring a few men from the eastern part of Nebraska into the western part of the state and give you the benefit of some of the work being done by that institution, with the additional advan - tage of. having it discussed as adapted to your own conditions. So wo extended our program and decided to call it "Western Nebraska Or - ganized Agriculture.," The Chadron Chamber of Commerce and the County Farm Bureau here have done a great deal in advertising these meetings. I want to take opportunity to make public mention of this fact, because undoubtedly the attendance at this meeting will be very largely due to the publicity they gave. This program is not as complete, perhaps, as it might be. There are some things we are not touching upon; for instance, dairy work, which Is very important; and work which is of primary Interest to .women — home management problems, child . management problems, etc. We are rather] sorry we did not do that. This proposition grew so. fast after we started, that we soon found our program was thor - oughly filled up. We decided we had better stop adding to it and then to wait and sei how this program would go off. i ■ If you people !are in favor of these meetings, they can be held every year at some point in western Nebraska. The secretaries of these various organizations happen to be men from the Agricultural College — general extension specialists — except in my own case. It is entirely up to you; folks to decide whether you want to have such meetings in future; also to decide to a large extent as to what the general nature of {these meetings shallbe from year to year. I see no- reason why we should not be able to have such meetings out here as would be 6f Interest to' you people. By "we" I do not mean the -men from the Agricultural College. I know more about the roads and trails of western Nebraska than of Lancaster county; consequently I feel a great -deal more at home out here. So when I talk about "we," I mean "wfe, the potato growers," if you will admit me as one of you. Of course the same applies to the corn and alfalfa growers out here. AH of us together can manage to stage meetings which will be of </seg>
            <seg id="p588">Report of Nerraska State Board of Agriculture interest to the people in the western part of the state, and which will be beneficial to the agricultural industry of the west. I used to feel a little bit self-conscious when I came out to talk to you, because I felt you would think a man who came from the corn belt would hardly be able to say very much about potatoes; in other words, he ought to come from the country where the crop he is talking about is being grown. I am not going to say whether I know very much about it. You can judge for yourselves from your connec - tions with me and with Dr. Goss. The place of residence of a man does not always mean very much. All of the men from the College who are on our programs have had ample opportunity to travel over this state a great deal. They have been on the farms of some of you here, or on farms in your locality, and have made a special study of the line of work they are talking about. Consequently they are pretty well informed from the standpoint of the scientific aspects of the agricultural work as applying to their particular lines. Their in - terests are not merely in Lincoln, but throughout the entire state. It is entirely up to you people who are here and who will be here during the next few days to decide just what shall be done. Just a word as to how these meetings are financed. Of course the salaries and some expense accounts of the specialists are paid out of the extension fund and other funds of the Agricultural College. But there is a special fund set aside by the legislature for the uso of these various agricultural organizations. This fund is in the charge of the State Board of Agriculture. I think it is approximately ?23,000 for two years. They have the absolute say as to how this money shall be spent in the furthering of agricultural work in this state. The Potato Improvement Association has been drawing out of that fund for six years. The premiums for our Sh&amp;w and expenses of speakers — especially from outside the state- -have been paid out these funds. There is set aside for the meetings of Organized Agriculture at Lincoln an additional appropriation of $3,000 for two years, which enables them to carry the general overhead expenses and to bring in outstand - ing speakers for some of their more important meetings. The State Board realizes that the people in the western part of the state have not been coming to these Lincoln riieetings as much as those from the eastern part. They feel anxious that anything that can be done for you should be done, and they are favorable toward this movement of staging a large group of meetings and shows out here at some point each year. It seems to me the best way to bring out something concrete on the part of you people out here is to let it be known to the legis - lature, the State Board of Agriculture and the Agricultural College that you are Interested in these meetings, if you are, and if you want them in the future. If you do I suggest that you have your Chairman </seg>
            <seg id="p589">Nkhraska Potato Imi&gt;hovkmi:.\t Association* ■ ■ i ' appoint a representative committee from western Nebraska. The com - mittee should give serious consideration to the desirability o£ this whole proposition. Then the members who are here who have any ideas concerning it can pass your ideas on to this committee and have the committee report to us tomorrow afternoon. I think we will have more time then, and |due to the general, nature of the program, that will probably be the best time to discuss the matter. I think we wil) Jiave about as good an attendance then as at any time. I simply make that as a suggestion to you if you are interested in it. Personally, we from the College think that this is one of the best movements with which we have been connected in the way of extension work, and (hat it is an opportunity for the farmers of the western part of the state to get acquainted with the College and what it is doing, and what help it can render. I do not mean that the speakers who are brought into these meetings should be only college men. They should be the bust men to talk about the various subjects under discussion, whether practical growers, men from our College or from colleges of other states. Dr. Goss called my attention to something which might not be clearly understood as lo what these different organizations are. The State Board of Agriculture lias nothing to do with the Agricultural College. It is a distinct institution. Up until the last few years, its primary duty was the conducting of the State Fair. It has a paternal interest in these various organizations. The Agricultural College is ad - ministered by a Board of Regents of the University, which is an entirely different Board. We have three main branches: the Extension Service, with which you come in contact most frequently; the teaching forcn, which has charge of the students; and the Experiment Station force, which does research work. (Applause.) CHAIRMAN PHELPS: The next speaker is Mr. Morrow, who will talk on WKSTKUX NKIIKAKKA (T.UTIKIKI) SKKI) POTATOES: PROFIT, COST, POSSIIULltlKS, AND THE I TTIKIO OK THK INDUSTRY. 1 WILLIAM MORROW ' Manager Nebraska Certified Potato Growers Co-operative, Alliance, Nebraska One of my friends dropped in the office the other day and advised me I was slated for a lengthy and weighty talk, and then hastened to correct himself and said it was the title that was weighty and lengthy, and went so far as to bet the talk wouldn't be as lengthy as the title! After reading it, I had to accept the bet. "Western </seg>
            <seg id="p590">Repobt of Nebraska State Board of Aobicultube Nebraska Certified Seed Potatoes; Profit, Cost, Possibilities, and the Future of the Industry." It is very difficult to determine through one year, and even through a period of years, the cost of production on any agricultural com - modity. It varies from year to year due to weather conditions; and even over a period of years we have changes in price of supplies which will affect the cost of production. However, this morning I a'sked several growers to tell me a? nearly as they could what it cost to produce a bushel of certified seed potatoes — how much their pi-r bushel cost was. I asked them to write it on a sheet or paper. We shuffled them over and looked over the sheets. The figures varied from 47 cents to $1.65, all of these men maintaining the prices varied to that extent. I believe all were sincere in their contention. I happen to know the person who turned in the 47 cents per bushel cost on certified seed had kept very close account on two acres grown in Boys and Girls Club work; Labor, supplies, everything had been itemized, and then the yield of. the two years, together with those costs, had been averaged, an average cost of 4 7 cents per bushel was obtained. This is probably a little lower than the average certified potato grower can produce certified stock. There is considerable variation between a cost of production of 47 cents and that of $1.65; in fact, there is a very handsome profit — something like 200 per cent — to the man who can produce for 47 cents, while the man who takes $1.65 to produce a bushel is marketing at the cost of production. At first hand you might say this man who produces for 47 cents is using slip-shod methods — is not spending the money and putting in the time on his field; that he does not spend the time roguing the field or use as good or as much seed per acre. I believe if we would study the situation throughout western Nebraska and go to those growers producing more potatoes per acre, we would find their actual per-acre investment is probably more than the average. They are using more seed per acre. They are cultivating often* r and at the right time and giving the fields proper roguing. They are also using some of the best seed stocks we have available and are con - stantly on the alert to secure better stock. With this better seed they have less expensive roguing, are securing more vigorous plants, more perfect stands and larger yield. They are averaging a lower ier bushel cost because of a slightly higher per acre cost. If it takes seventy-five bushels per acre to produce the crop, the man who averages seventy-five bushels is working for nothing. The man with a hundred bushels per acre is getting a profit Of twenty - five bushels per acre. Last year and this we have received nandsom&lt;; prices for certified potatoes. Even at two dollars, if the potatoes were put on the market at the right time they would have made a profit. </seg>
            <seg id="p591">Nebraska Potato' Improvement Association At 47 cents as the cost of production per bushel, they are reaping a handsome profit. We can not expect a year such as last year and this very frequently. Even if we have years like this twice in twenty we will be fortunate, because prices have ranged much higher than normal or that which we can [hope for average years. The man who ha? brought down his production cost as low as possible should be in a better position to receive the old enemy, over - production. At least he will not take as great a loss as his neighbor whose cost of production is high. He should be able to work in the certified seed industry, year in and year out, and have the same con - fidence the colored man had when his company was ordered "over the top" in France. 'Rastus had to go over the top with the other boys of the regiment. As he was going over the field, he saw an enemy approaching him with fixed bayonet on his rifle. This worried 'Rastus only for a moment. He very soon forgot his own rifle and pulled out his trusty razor. As the Hun made a lunge at him, 'Rastus deftly ducked and slashed at the other fellow's throat, and then turned to see what had happened. The Hun was smiling, and said, "You never touched me!" "Nevah teched yo'? Jes' wait till yo' shakes yo' haid!" (Laughter.) That is the way i with certified seed. "We want to cut the cost of production just as low as possible. When the year comes we must market at a lower price — even a dollar a bushel — we will not suffer such a serious loss or be compelled to go out of business and have such fluctuations in our supply that raise havoc with the market. Last season we had a good supply of certified seed — 225 cars. This year we ought tp have had 400, and could readily market that amount. The certified seed industry in Nebraska is still a little child. We have been certifying seed about seven years, and have been in the commercial business for four years. Louisiana was the first state to accept our product and I buy any amount. Texas has been buying certified seed, but did not think it very much better than No. 1 stock and did not want to pay the premium. Both this year and last, ship - ments to Texas have greatly exceeded those to Louisiana. The Texas dealers have paid the premium, and it is very high, especially these last few years. In fact, It is now just about double the price of No. 1 seed, and more' than double the price of table stuff. How much difference is there in the cost of production between the certified seed potato and No. 1 seed? The certified seed potato grower must pay forj his inspection and marketing. In other words, he is required to hire a man, and another man to watch and see that he weeds the diseased plants from his field. The removal of these diseased plants is another expense which the grower of un - certified stock does 'not have to undergo; yet It is hardly fair to </seg>
            <seg id="p592">Rki'ort of Nkhrakka State Board of Agriculture charge it against certified seed production, because the man growing potatoes year after year benefits from taking the poor stock from his Held. He should reap that much benefit from the returns. We could market 4 00 rars of certified seed at a very specific premium. Texas is first in demand on certified seed today. Then comes Louis - iana; and Georgia, Alabama and Oklahoma are all crowding Louisiana lor second place. We may wonder why the southern states are willing to pay five dollars per hundredweight f. o. b. western Nebraska, and must add ii dollar freight. When we stop to think these potatoes are redis - tributed in the south and that very few planters plant on such ;i large scale they ran buy carloads, the cost to the small grower in the fouthern states must he about eight cents a pound. Most or these southern states find it necessary to fertilize heavily. The cost of fertilizer averages from $20 to $50 per acre. In addition tb this. they have drainage cost in some places; irrigation costs in others. On all this, the early potato crop is grown on high-priced lard. Home-grown seed is proving unsatisfactory because, for one reason, the hot olimate prevents it from keeping. Their conditions are ideal for disease development, and potatoes grown in southern states very rapidly become heavily infested with disease and are unsuitable for seed. With the high-priced land, $40 to $50 for fertilizer, and the drainage or irrigation cost, you can see with seed potatoes the^y have a very high cost per acie. II they are going to raise potatoes at a profit, it is necepsaiy lo secure the best seed available. The) better the seed, the more vigorous and capable of producing potatoes, the better their chance of making a profit. They must get a good price if they are to stay in business That is why they do not object to paying the price for a quality product like Nebraska certified seed. The market at present on Nebraska certified seed is hardly scratched. We have just started producing in commercial quantities here, and a great many regions throughout the south have ne'er had our certified seed. Wherever we get one car shipped, we get an increased demand. An instance of that is the Bermuda Islands. Three \ears ago we sent a shipment to New York, where it was repacked in barrels and shipped to Bermuda. The Treight cost must hafe been almost prohibitive. Last year those Bermuda people came alcmg and ordered a car of Nebraska certified seed. This year they have ordered three carloads. In addition to this, we have inquiries from Cuba and I'orto Rico relative to seed potatoes. Evidently we can- build up some export business, even with prices as they are. Florida is getting into the early potato business. Georgi i is be - ginning to use Nebraska certified seed. In addition to these regions where we ship to dealers in car lots, we have a good market in eastern </seg>

We are afraid they will try Montana certified seed and like it. That is an unfortunate - situation. ■ When we hkve this trade and they are looking to us, we.; should try not only to hold our production constant, but gradually extend it and keep pace with the gradually increasing demand. We will find some lyears of over-production in the potato business, just as in any other agricultural commodity. There will be years when the grower, regardless j of how efficiently he produces or how low his cost of production, will produce at a loss. We will probably havo the same situation in : the certified seed industry, but from present indications, not in the hear future. The southern states are increasing their demands, and we can take care oT more than has been produced in the last three years 1 . (Applause.)

Professor of Horticulture, College of Agriculture, i Lincoln, Nebraska. . . ■- . ■■ '■• . ■] • I should like to |express an idea concerning keeping down pro - duction cost; Tlie work on production of potatoes the country over has shown the way to- keep down the cost of production per bushel, which is what counts] is to" increase the cost of production per acre. Invariably the man who spends) more per acre gets more bushels, and thereby reduced the cost per bushel. To go to the subject assigned me: I had some connection with certification work this summer which reminded me that there still are some difficulties in the way. I was keenly aware of that several years ago when I was actively in charge of inspection work. If it were an industry without I a problem, there would be no use of having certified seed, and there would be no premium paid for it. We often feel that we are terribly abused because we have potato diseases and ■other troubles. If thfe south did not have potato diseases, there would be no seed potato industry in t le north. . We had better make the best of the situation. </seg>

            <seg id="p595">Nebraska Potato -Improvement Association We think sometimes things are going badly. We this year rejected almost as many, fields of potatoes as. four or five years ago, and perhaps you feel we are not making any progress; but I rather think we are. • Mosaic was known, to us when we first started in certification work. We were terribly scared about it. We would find no mosaic, as we knew it, in Nebraska, only to have large amounts discovered in our seed in the south. During 1923, Dr. Goss discovered the temperature at which the symptoms became visible, then we know that at certain temperatures (that is below 70° F.) we could look for it, and see it If it was present but that at high temperatures there was no use looking for mosaic. It became evident that we would have to do the roguing early in the season. In 1923, approximately eight hundred acres were rejected because of mosaic. We felt badly about it, and some of you probably thought that that was the end of the seed business. But that was a good thing for us, because all of the lots badly infected were eliminated, and many other lots not seriously infected were so thoroughly rouged, (due to the weather being so cool and cloudy) that ever since 1923 mosaic has been a minor factor. According to the figures Mr. Morrow has given me, in 1924, 1925, and 1926 there have been only two fields rejected for! mosaic. So far as we are concerned in Nebraska, apparently mosaic is a thing of the past. Perhaps if we do not take it seriously enough, we may have an epidemic in the future. You see that we have largely got the best of this disease which had us "scared to death" five years' ago. Spindle-tuber is one of our troubles at the present time. While it is more of a knotty problem than mosaic — it causes more rejections than anything else — I am quite optimistic reasoning that it we can .get ahead of mosaic, we can get ahead of spindle-tuber. We have a number of people working on this disease the country over, and they are gradually making a little progress — not as much as they would like, but I think they are getting somewhere, and I believe it will not be long until we have spindle-tuber fairly well in hand. There are other diseases about which we can not hold out so much hope — fusarium and scab. I want to tell you that I am an optimist so far as this certified seed potato business is concerned. If 75 per cent of |the potato growers here would have an opportunity to grow the lots of potatoes which they had five years ago — had they been grown in the meantime with no care — they probably would not want to own the potatoes at the present time. We are more -critical. Undoubtedly the inspection is more rigid than it was five years ago. The buyers are aiso more critical, so everybody Is making progress if he is keeping up with the parade. Why were potatoes rejected to the extent they have been during the last few years? Why is it necessary to reject a few fields? Be- </seg>

Being more or less closely connected with certification work, I should like you to give me your viewpoint. Why do you look at an inspector who conies to iook at your potatoes as your enemy? You won't admit this, perhaps, but unconsciously tlie inspector gets the impression that you consider him a man sent out to find fault with your field — to see what ho ' can "eel on you" to put you oul of business. That is not the id, -a. because if he has any interest in the future of his job. it is (o his advantage to keep as many of you in business as possible so the work will continue. He must maintain these stand - aids. Your certification organization has made a contract with the College to maintain certain standards, and the Board hires the in - spector with the understanding that he must carry out those standards, which are the ones followed the country over with slight variations. I think vou would find the inspector somewhat more useful if some of you would be a little bit less antagonistic in your conscious and unconscious attitude toward him. When he feels that he must prove thai he has si right to exist, he of course can not help you as wel! as when you show a more constructive interest in the work he is doing. I have never had a field of potatoes of my own turned down, so I do not know what it feels like. But 1 have had disappointments in other lines and try to gel your viewpoint. Some people insist that there are three sides to this question: your side, my side, and the right side. If we all try to get to see the right side, there will not be so much space for a "yours" and "mine." Prior to 1024, mosaic was the bugbear. In 1923, mosaic and spindle-iuber were the things which caused most rejections — almost. fifty-fifty. Fusarium wilt was rather serious. During 1924, 1925 and 1!l2fi. mosaic has ceased to exist as a factor; but spindle-tuber has been the serious thing in those three years. This year fusarium has been perhaps as serious as anything. Scab is another serious problem. We do not know what to do about it. Why are these diseases permitted to be in the potatoes and thus lo cause the fields to be rejected? Try to think this matter out in a fairly logical way. There are three -general reasons. The first is the grower the indifference or inefficiency of the grower himself. The next consideration us the seed — improper seed. The third might be called uncontrollable factors. You might want to load up the third classification and have it take the blame for everything, but some of these factors are not absolutely uncontrollable. You can not control the climate but sometimes you can dodge it. Every grower is not qualified to raise certified seed potatoes. He may be intelligent, but may have the wrong state of mind toward the work. He may go in it with the idea of making a "big thing," </seg>
            <seg id="p597">Nkiib.vska Potato Impkovkmuxt Association '■ ' ■ ' I ■ ■ thinking it is just a "graft," but that his neighbor got in ahead of him; that certification does not amount to anything and is merely ■■ a matter of going through red tape. ■ I do not know how a man like til at explains the matter of rejections. Such expressions are heard less every year. . People; realize that the work is run "on the square." A man goes into the business without qualifications. He needs to have good seed.j proper labor and proper machinery, and to have his work so organized that he can do the work at the right time. Very, often the man finds the inspector coming around when he is busy with something else. Sometimes these things can not be helped. Before a man goes into the business with forty to a hundred acres,' he should make sure when roguing time comes around he will havt time to do the roguing and to go over the field with the inspector to see how things iare. If he hasn't time, he had better start on a small scale.- We are more and more learning that this work can not be done with a hired man unless he is of exceptional ability. All those things come tn under' the heading of the grower. I think the grower is about 90 per cent of the whole business in connection with certified seed. ■ . • Next comes improper seed. Very frequently seed is used which is known to be more or less risky. That practice is not indulged in quite as much as in the past. Sometimes potatoes used are known to be poor, but the man has not had previous experience and thinks anything will "get by;" or he has the mistaken notion that because they have been on his farm they are better than the potatoes grown on the farm of another man. With our pride in seed potatoes, be sure that they justify that pride; otherwise they might bring grief later on. Sometimes the uncontrollable factors come in to cause a great deal of damage. One of these is the masking of disease. In. some years — for instance, in a season like 1!)22 — the weather was. .warm and dry, and mosaic was hard to see. Consequently in the cool 1923 season the disease broke out and we had a lot of serious trouble with mosaic. The certification service Is ready to help you to avoid that trouble. Whenever} there is a season like that, if samples are sent to the south and planted any time from March to April, there will be readings on mosaic. You will have information before the planting season and can avoid planting material of that kind. This may have! been a factor in the case of spindle-tub.er. We found quite an increase during this past season which we can not account for in- any other way. After seeing the fields both years, Mr. Morrow feels that the conditions in those fields in 1925, perhaps; because of low temperature, were such that it was not possible to see the disease very well. In the warm season of 1926, which was more favorable for that disease, the symptoms were more evident and </seg>
            <seg id="p598">Report of Nebraska State Board of Aqricultobe the rejections were heavier. Those are some of the things the grower can not control. When it comes to the matter of transmission of diseases, there is not nearly as much known about that as we think. Dr.. Goss will discuss that tomorrow. One thing he may not mention (because he has not concrete evidence on it yet) I noticed in the inspection work this last summer. I saw some evidence that I thought showed that flea beetles had transmitted spindle-tuber the past year. In addition we have an increase in the amount of fusarium and scab coming from the soil, as some of the uncontrollable problems. Ab to the way of handling some of these, I would suggest securing the best seed available. In this way the attitude of the potato growers has made it difficult to make progress as rapidly as it should be made. As soon as we from the College or your certification in - spector recommends a lot of seed potatoes to you, you look for that lot to consist of show potatoes when shipped to you. You are critical of their appearance. You can go by looks a little bit, but you knov; looks do not tell very much in potatoes, when you know the field performance. A bad looking lot of potatoes may be a good producing lot of seed. It has been the desire on the part of growers to get a good lot of seed and then to quit caring for it, hoping to have good seed forevermore. That can not be done. You come back and criticise the Inspector more or less severely, accusing him of having given you bone-head advice. He did the best he could under the circum - stances. There are no sources of really perfect seed potatoes in existence in this United States at the present time. We have as good strains of the Triumph variety as can be produced any place. We have tried to get seed from other states, and have not found a lot as good as we have In this state. In comparison with others, we have some lots which are distinctly superior. If you will take these better lots and apply the Intelligent methods to them that you have applied to others, you will be able to make more progress. There are still some unknown problems. We do not know what causes some of these diseases to spread. There are some things we do not know much about. We notice in Triumph fields we have some that will ripen two and one-half months earlier than others - some In the early part of August, some in September, and some as late as the middle of October. We do not know whether the early ripened ones or the late ones are diseased or whether none are. They are inclined in the east to consider the late types as "giant hills," which they think is a diseased condition. We do not know whether these are variations or disease. We hope to demonstrate that In experiments being run by the College. It is undesirable to send out these strains which vary in rate of ripening so greatly. You </seg>

It seems to me that whenever you get near the border line with a lot of seed — only 5 per cent spindle-tuber — even though you think you might get by next year, it would be desirable to get in a new lot of seed grown on another part of the farm. In case of difficulties with the original lot, you will have a supply of seed concerning which you know the value. Otherwise if you have to change, you may be taking more or less of a risk. I said there were no really superior lots of seed potatoes in this country at the present time. |. Especially is that the case with the Triumph. There are no lots near perfection. At the annual meeting of the Nebraska Certified Seed Association in Alliance in March, I outlined a program for tuber index work at the College. By this means we hope to produce a strain of Triumphs which will be as free as possible from .these diseases. We take the best lots of seed we can get hold of, based on field - inspections, giving the potato a number; we cut a small seed piece out of the potato, and give it a number, plant it in a pot in the greenhouse and grow a plant from it We place the potato out of which the seed piece has been cut In a rack in the cellar to await further .developments. We' grow the plants in the greenhouse six or eight weeks. As soon as they are about four inches high, we make inspections very frequently — sometimes eve'ry other day. As soon as we. see- a plant which has yellow spots or any leaf which has the merest trace of mosaic, •vfhich you could not find in your field or if it shows distinct mosaic or abnormal conditions of any kind, no matter what — we mark It for discard. We check our notes, marking the lots to be discarded. Later we throw out all the potatoes that have been marked as having produced a defective plant. We plant the good potatoes thus selected in a seed plot some place in western Nebraska where it is isolated. We rogue this plat thoroughly as frequently as we jean, and repeat the process from year to year to make sure our stock is remaining clean. That method is fine for getting rid of mosaic. Some seed potatoes after two years of indexing have dropped from 10 per cent to less than one-tenth of one per cent of plants which show any mottling at all. In these lots we have not found a single plant of rugose mosaic. The average potato weighs about one-third of a pound, or 180 to a - bushel. By virtue of the contract we have with the Cooperative, three years from now we should be able to expand considerably. Unless something comes up we can not anticipate — and we are using every possible precaution — we hope in the course of the next four years to develop enough seed — going back to these original Index lots — to be able to plant our entire .certified acreage In western Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p600">Rktort of Nkiihaska State Board of Aorioulture We are sure that slock will not have mosaic. We are not so sure about spindle-tuber. It is more difficult to manage. In that connection, we are looking to Dr. (Joss to work out some means whereby we can diagnose spindle-tuber in the greenhouse with more certainty than at the present time. Why is it necessary to do that? Why not do it all in the field? We do not know just how mild some of these diseases must be, or where lies the dividing line between diseased and abnormal conditions. Some of these plants thai we discard in the greenhouse very seldom show symptoms in the field. We would pass the symptoms by and the disease would have a change to spread; or perhaps we would not catch the disease early enough in the field, and the disease would he spread to other plants. That is the reason for all this rather costly work of indexing in the greenhouse. We have a great many other things to contend with mostly along the disease line. I will sum up some of these difficulties, because they will be discussed more fully tomorrow morning. I find that this loaning is not always done in time. Advantage is not always taken of the little spells of cool weather which exist. Some men think they must stick to union hours. They do not realize that they can work from 4:30 to 10 a. in. and then get some sleep. They think they must sleep until seven o'clock, and then get out. A few fellows would have been able to rogue out mosaic if they had gotten out early during the hot days, like the inspectors did. Growers have sometimes been too charitable in regard to the weak plants in the field. We invariably find they are due to spindle-tuber or some other trouble. It does not matter what the trouble is. If they a.re weak, they will not produce much, and they had better be taken out. In the matter of scab, seed treatment and late planting will help out. When frost is the factor there is not much to do except perhaps to throw a ridge over the rows in the end of the season. It would soem to be a desirable program for a man to go through the field the latter part of September and throw up a good ridge with a disc cultivator, if he knows he will not be into the field to dig before October, thus giving the. potatoes an inch or two more of protection. Some growers planted too early this year. The plants ripened prematurely. I'lantinj: from June 10 to 20 I believe could be con - sidered as a pretty safe practice thai will give a better type of potatoes. We have figures to show that the later we plant, the more nearly round the tubers become, that is, they are less elongated. The southern growers will mistake potatoes planted in early May as spindle - tuhers, although they may be healthy. I want to leave this idea with you, — there will be ups arid downs in the potato business. When we consider the progress made with potatoes in western Nebraska from three or five years ago to now, — </seg>
            <seg id="p601">'Nebraska Potato Improvement Association' when they are the highest paid proposition on the market, I think ■ ■we will all concede that we have made some progress. We have established ourselves. It may have been costly as we are doing it, having caused a lot of unpleasant feeling. It may have caused many good men here, and others not here, to feel they had an injustice done to them; that they did have good potatoes and did good work and that theirs should have been accepted. It is too bad we can not measure good work. We must be "good sports" and take it as we can. But all this 'time we have been working together and exchanging unpleasant feelings, we have been making progress. We can make, more progress if Iwe take an optimistic attitude and decide that we have hard situations to deal with in potato diseases. ■ ' i ■ We see no reason why, when we have a well functioning organiza - tion out here, there is any need to think there will be ruinous overr production in certified seed ior quite a few years to come. I want to caution you not to rush into, the business. Those in the business know you can not expand rapidly. Those now in got in slowly. There is no doubt but that in the future the seed Industry will continue to be profitable here in western Nebraska, in fact, be the most profitable industry we have. It will require very intelligent labor on your part. The best way you can market your labor on your farm is by putting it into certified seed. (Applause.) I - THE SEED POTATO INDUSTRY IX MOXTAXA ■'. MR. F. M. HARRINGTON Professor of Horticulture,' Montana State College, Bozeman, Mont. I took out membership in the Nebraska Association this morning. I have taken out naturalization papers. I hope to come back in the future and profit by what we can 'learn through coming' into this district. I do not think we can profit as much by going into any other state as we can t&gt;y coming into Nebraska. You have a certification line-up not equalled 'in any section in the United States. (Applause.) As a preliminary to a discussion of my topic, the Seed Potato Industry in Montana, I believe it is well to go back of that point somewhat and to consider other phases of the potato game and our place in the potato world before taking up the subject of the seed industry Itself. 'As has been indicated in the program, Montana is one of the most recent states to grow certified seed potatoes and at the present stage of our production we are not making much of a dent in the demand and . are not cutting in to any great extent on any other seed producing territory. Montana has an unfortunate location in one respect in that we are half way between the Coast and the CeDtral West. We have high </seg>
            <seg id="p602">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture • freight rates in both directions, as well as having the highest rates to what may be designated as the seed using sections, the Gulf states, of any of the seed producing sections. Potato production in Montana for a considerable number of years has never exceeded the 2000-car mark, and the fact that we ranked thirtieth in amount of potatoes produced does not indicate that the state is much of a factor in the potato game as yet. The potato crop in Montana has a very distinct place. We can take the Gallatin Valley as an illustration of what I mean when I say the potato has a distinct place. The Gallatin "Valley has an eleva-. tion of about 5000 feet. We are up against the proposition of the last spring frost coming early in June and the first autumn frost coming early in September. We have only a 90 to 95-day period between frosts. In such a section the number of cultivated crops to which we can turn and work into the farm rotation is very limited. Corn is out of the question. There is a certain amount of sunflowers grown but the acreage Is comparatively small. Of all the cultivated crops the potato is the best to be Included in the scheme of rotations. Those of you who have never been closely associated with a sec - tion where cultivated crops are not the general thing may not realize what such a section Is coming to In the continuous growing of non - cultivated crops. Gallatin Valley has gone very strongly to the grow - ing of seed peas — some 20,000 acres in the Valley- — and to the pro - duction of grain crops with alfalfa as the main forage crop. One of the biggest problems in the Valley at the present time is the problem of weeds. The Beed pea crop is one that is very favorable to the development of weeds. Certain areas that have gone strongly- toward seed pea production are finding that they will have to discontinue the crop because of weeds. They are finding that they must work in ■? cultivated crop or allow the land to lie idle for a year and summer fallow, entirely because of weeds. There is a tendency, therefore, to favor a cultivated crop and the potato is one of the few cultivated crops with which our farmers can work. There is another angle to be considered in including potatoes in Montana rotations. Rotation experiments have been carried at the various substations in the state for a considerable number of years, rotations which have been checked against continuous cropping to the various crops. These experiments have pointed out very clearly the influence the potato crop has upon the crops which follow it. For example, the potato has been used in rotations which include oats, alfalfa, and beets. These crops were benefltted by having potatoes in the rotation and the potato crop in turn was benefltted by being in long rotation with these other crops. The disadvantage of following potatoes by potatoes — mainly the problem of disease — was thus avoided. </seg>
            <seg id="p603">■ Nebraska Potato Improvement Association ■ i . ■ As to the effects of the potato crop upon other crops, the question has been asked: Can we put potatoes into the rotation and still get beneficial results for other crops? The results obtained from our rotation experiments I answers this question. In rotations which in - cluded oats and potatoes, we secured 81 bushels of oats when oats followed potatoes, but only 48 bushels when oats followed oats, a difference of approximately 40 per cent. Where beets followed pota - toes, we had an average yield of 13% tons; where beets were grown continuously the average was 9 tons of beets, or a decrease of prac - tically 30 per cent. Corn cannot be grown in all of the potato sections ■ of the state but where corn was included in rotations following potatoes, the average was 47 bushels of corn as against 34 bushels when corn was grown continuously, a decrease of about 25 per cent. Not only do. other crops affect the yield of potatoes, but potatoes have a beneficial effect upon 'other crops. We can therefore readily see that potatoes have a place in crop rotations in order to get best results. In all we have had 18 or 19 rotations in which potatoes have been included. The rotation which gave apparently the best returns in yield is as follows: Average Yield — 12-Year Period Potatoes,, followed by._.. 310.80 bu. Oats manured, followed by. 92.60 bu. Beets, followed by_ 14.90 ton Alfalfa _„....„. 4.75 ton Below are the yields of these same crops continuously grown: Average Yield — 12-Year Period Potatoes l . .■-- - 193.0 bu. Oats manured . 48.0 bu. Beets . '. 9.5 ton Alfalfa '. - .. 4.5 ton Our Station chemist has also supplied us with information on the value of the potato crop from the; standpoint of plant food. We have some sections in the state and many farms in the state where the use of a cultivated crop is the exception rather than rule. Summer fallow may be in order but cultivated crops have not been in order on many of the farms. Cultivation we know, whether through cultivated crops or summer fallow, promotes nitrification and so makes available greater qualities of plant food than would be the case where cultivation prac - tices are not in ord^er. Our chemist again shows us that the potato crop is in itself a comparatively low user of plant food. The following table shows the varying amounts of plant food taken from the soil by the average crop: </seg>

As a matter of fact, the potato actually uses less plant food than is set free by the process of nitrification which is stimulated by cultivation. You can see from the above facts that the potato is necessary in the farming scheme of Montana farmers. The bulk of the territory in Montana is not suited to the produc - tion of table stock potatoes, in spite of the fact that we can grow potatoes to good advantage &lt;n all sections. Our commercial, crop moves mainly to Chicago, or at least to points in the Middle West. We have a freight rate of about 80c. Oui competition in the potato market romes with sections that have a considerably smaller freight rate, in fact less than half. It is useless for us to try to grow such varieties as the Irish Cobbler, Green Mountain, Early Ohio, or Rural New Yorker for table stock markets in competition with points a few miles from Chicago, but we do find that we can grow the Netted Gem, or Russet Burbank, as a commercial potato and get by in good shape with it. The Netted Gem is regularly being quoted on the Middle </seg>

We •vWH h , P0Slti ° n t0 be Particularly stung during a year of heavy yields and low prices, for under that combination of conditions we could not move our stock to eastern markets and make a profit. With the eastern paVt of the state practically eliminated from the commercial field of potato production, the growers there are naturally turning m the direction of the production of the Bliss Triumph from the seed standpoint, lit is perhaps for that reason as much as anything else that the growers of eastern Montana are beginning to show an interest in growing Bliss Triumph certified seed stock. Such table stock as has been grown in this section has been almost entirely for local consumption. Scarcely a carload of potatoes has been moved out for table stock. Because the seed potato offers the main outlet ior the potatoes produced in the eastern half of Montana, I do not doubt but that certain sections will tend toward getting into the potato game considerably stronger than has been the case to date. In our seed potato certification work in Montana we are working mainly with three Varieties. We have a demand for Netted Gem seed stock in Idaho and Washington territories. Those sections are also making calls upbn us Tor Irish Cobbler and Bliss Triumph seed stock and we- are havingquantities of such stock going West this year as well as South. We are certifying both irrigated and non-irrigated seed potatoes and during the last couple of years we have been able to convince some of the consuming centers that we are correct in our viewpoint on the value of irrigated seed in comparison with that of non-irrigated </seg>
            <seg id="p606">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture seed, namely, that there is not necessarily any difference in their value provided factors other than the watering are equal. In 1921 the Montana Experiment Station started to test out the relative value of the two kinds of seed stock. We have gone about these tests in three ways. First, the growing and checking of irrigated and dryland seed stocks grown under conditions exactly the same with the exception of water. Second, through tests in Louisiana and Alabama we have also checked the relative yielding power of irrigated and dryland seed. Third, the testing of representative irrigated and dryland certified seed stocks obtained from the growers, also adding to these, other lots of both irrigated and dryland seed. Our conditions at Bozeman make an ideal situation for conducting the first phase of this test inasmuch as we have two tracts of college land close together. The dry land is not subjected in any way to water seepage and can be classed as the driest of dry land. This first phase of the test was started in 1921. We took ten stocks with which we had been working; each of these we divided, putting one half -under irrigated conditions and one half under non-irrigated conditions. We continued each lot under these two sets of conditions for the years of 1921, 1922, 1923, 1924, 1925. During the seasons of 1922, 1923, 1924, and 1925 samples of the irrigated and of the non-irrigated lots were grown together, under both irrigated and non-irrigated conditions. The results of these tests are given in the following table: Yield — Pounds per Acre Seed Stock No. 1 No. 2 Total Dryland Seed — 4 year average 12,516 1,982 14,498 Irrigated Seed — 4 year average 12,798 1,681 14,479 Dryland Seed— 1925 results 16,060 1,219 17,279 Irrigated Seed— 1925 results 16,766 1,077 17,843 One of our stocks has been widely distributed and is now in the hands of many growers, some of them growing potatoes on irrigated land and some on dry land. We are bringing In. samples of this - stock from the various places where it is being grown and planting the lots in our test plots. They are checking up very closely as al! being of about the same value. As to certification methods, I do not imagine they are very much different than those with which you are accustomed. We inspect potato fields at least three times a season and check on the stock as to grade. We are not out to make potato seed certification an immediate big thing in the state. As a matter of fact, a new grower is limited the first year in the acreage he is allowed to handle. We feel that he must go through a course of sprouts before he can qualify as a seed grower. The second year he may expand if he wishes. As a result, during the season of 1926 we kept out several large acreages </seg>
            <seg id="p607">Nebkaska Potato Improvement Association in the hands of three or four growers which would have exceeded all the rest of the certified seed Ecreage in. the state. There are certain requirements as to roguing and the like which we feel a new grower must become acquainted with tefore he can expect to grow successfully any large acreage for certification. Also he must learn how the grow - ing of certified seed potatoes is going to work into his general farming scheme. Through this ruling we have prevented a lot of plunging and we have avoided a lot of heartaches which surely would have been the result of allowing inexperienced growers going into the game on too large a scale. By such methods we are also able to get a line on the quality of the seed stock a grower p. -oposes to use before he goes into the game too deeply. I might say that the average beginner in Montana starts with not to- exceed an acre, although we permit up to five acres. We have been advised by certain mutual friends to hop into the seed game to the tune of at least 300 carloads for 1927. I do not believe we can handle that number. New growers next season will not influence production for ihat year. Any increase will have to come from the growers who have had at least a year's experience. Anything above a 20-acre field will be a distinct exception. It is interesting to us to note the sudden expansion in the demand for certified seed. The secretary of a local organization, who handled the crop of a group of- growers in the northern part of Montana, in - formed me that he has had over 500 inquiries for amounts ranging from one carload to several carloads of seed stock. It appeals to me that some of the southern states in addition to Louisiana are beginning to compete in the scramble for the comparatively few carloads of certified Bliss Triumph seed stock which have been available this year. The demonstrations and tests which the various stations have been carrying, putting certified seed up against ordinary seed picked up anywhere and under any" conditions, are gradually convincing the consumer that it pays to use certified seed. It appears to me that even with the expansion in production for another season, the states producing certified Bliss Triumph seed will still be behind the demand. I believe this demand is going to be materially on the increase and that we have a number of yiears to look ahead to before we need worry about the proposition of facing a serious over supply of seed. I note that Dr. Stuart, Horticulturist, United States Department of Agriculture, makes the statement that the tone of the seed market this season is exceedingly healthy. We sincerely hope that it continues to remain so. • • In Montana our growers feel that we are one of the two states which at present have the best opportunity for getting somewhere witb the production of certified Bliss Triumph seed potatoes. We concede that at the present time Nebraska is the leader in that respect. I be- </seg>
            <seg id="p608">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture lieve that botli Nebraska and Montana have natural conditions which are superior for the production of seed stock to those of practically any Bliss Triumph seed producing section in the country. We are not out in our seed certification work to try to eliminate Nebraska from the game. We rather hopn that things will develop in such a way that Nebraska will not be sawed off against Montana, and vice versa, by the fellows at the other end when it conies to the matter of prices. If our seeu stock gives from fifty to one hundred per cent better per - formance than non-certified stock, we are warranted in receiving a premium over table stock prices. We have had some interesting experiences this season, even in the marketing of such lew carloads as we have had. We are beginning - to get our eye teeth cut in regard to some of the phases of the game. We do not have one central organization and a manager for the marketing of oui slock; perhaps it will come to that in the future. I do feel, however, that unless our own growers within the state are pulling together and handling things in a business-like way, we cannot gel very far In the game. For example, I have discovered the irre - sponsibility of certain growers as to sales made. We have one in - stance, at a time when potato prices were steadily going up, of a grower whose potatoes were "frozen" at least twice, but he was still able to deliver the full original amount at the time of his final sale. Such methods do not help that particular grower, or the other growers in the game. But not only do I feel that we have the job of keeping our own growers within the state lined up, but I feel there is a possibility for states such as Nebraska and Montana to devise some scheme whereby we can cooperate more closely and to the profit of both. We want to avoid the possibility for one or the other to receive a wire to the effect that the price must be cut because it has been cut in the other state. I have understood that already some sawing off has been done and that growers in Nebraska were approached and made certain offers and at th&lt;&gt; same time were informed that the purchaser could go to Montana and get stock at a lower price than was being offered the Nebraska growers. I believe that that statement was made at a time and season when our total seed crop was not sufficient to move out a single carload of stock. Our problems in Montana may be somewhat different than yours in Nebraska. We learn by contact with the other fellow. I hope to join you on one ol your potato tours during the growing season and profit by what I see and hear on such trip. Also, we invite any and all of you when you feel you wish to see what we are doing, to come into Montana and look us over. If we cannot show you anything worth while in the potato line, at least we can introduce you to Glacier and Yellowstone parks. </seg>

Improvement Association POTATO DISDASi; PHOBLKMS OF WESTERN , NEBRASKA FARMERS : . bu. n. w. goss Associate P,lant .Pathologist, College of Agriculture, Lincoln, Nebraska. In previous talks at annual meetings of this association I have always' stressed the diseases which- are important from the standpoint of certified seed. As a result, many of you probably think of potato diseases only in . relation to the production of certified seed. Many of you here today are not certified- seed growers and I wish to emphasize the fact that' these diseases are just as prevalent and cause just as great losses in potatoes grown for table stock as in those produced for seed. The annually increasing demand for certified seed is a sure index of the importance of these diseases to the table stock grower who can not produce his own healthy seed but who realizes the great loss incurred by the presence of these diseases in his field. In addition to the diseases such as mosaic and spindle-tuber which can only be controlled by the methods used in seed certification, there are a number of other diseases which the table stock grower is all too familiar with and which he will have to combat himself regardless of the source of seed. It is only by the control of .these diseases that he will be able to produce profitable yields. By profitable yields I do not necessarily mean increased total yields. Many people mistakenly believe that the College of Agriculture is only interested in' devising ways and means by which the total yield p{ a crop can be increased, and that the resultant high yields mean over-production and low prices. We are not so interested in making two bushels of potatoes grow where only one grew before, as we are in producing the original bushel for half what it cost to produce it before. In other words, we are interested in decreased costs of production by increased yields per acre, and it is up to the farmer to decide what his total yields will be. One method of decreasing the cost of production is to eliminate wasteful methods. Waste always means loss and nothing is more wasteful than disease. When- you lose livestock by disease the loss is readily appreciated because of the high value of the individual. In the case of crop' plants the loss is not so easily discernible because of the low value of the individual plant. If you would go through your fields and make a count of diseased plants you will often find that the total will show a very respectable sum. In such a crop as potatoes there is. another loss due to the fact that it costs -just as much if not more to harvest and grade a lot of </seg>
            <seg id="p610">Report of Nedraska State Board of Agriculture . potatoes with a high percentage of diseased culls as it would If they were all healthy. Some diseases such as scab are so common that many growers would not be sure they were harvesting potatoes unless they could see some scab. Familiarity tends to make them underrate the damage incurred. If you will stop and think as you throw those scabby culls aside, that it cost just as much to prepare the land, plant, cultivate, harvest, and grade those scabby potatoes as it did the healthy ones you will begin to appreciate the amount of your loss. ■ For every crop under every condition there is a certain set cost of production, a minimum below which it is impossible to go. The profit you make on a crop is simply the margin above the number of bushels it takes to meet this cost of production. The size of this margin is very often determined by the presence or absence of diseases. Do not forget that a slight increase in the minimum cost of production due for instance to Ihe use of higher grade seed at a higher price, may so increase the yield that the margin above the cost of production will be greater and therefore your profit will be greater than would have obtained with the poorer seed and the resultant lower cost. The uso of good seed is nothing more than good insurance. Owing to the fact that the time is very short this afernoon I do not want to take up all these diseases in detail. We can probably cover in the shortest time the points you are most Interested in by allowing you to ask questions. Discussion Q. If the potato is infected with flea beetles this year, will it bf infected next year? A. It is not carried over in the potato and such potatoes are good for seed. Q. Can you control scab by dipping the potatoes? A. Stab is one of the most common diseases. It is probably the most serious disease you have, both on table stock and seed potatoes. It is caused by a small organism which lives on the potato and also in the soil. If you plant scabby potatoes in clean soil or clean potatoes in scabby soil you get the disease. The amount of disease will vary under different conditions, because this organism is a live thing and will only stand certain degrees of temperature and moisture. It is a high temperature disease occurring chiefly at 70 degrees and above. It will also be worse under dry conditions and in an alkaline soil. You can see that western Nebraska is a good camping ground for scab. We have the alkaline soils, dry weather, and hot weather. The factor of soil aeration does not come in except under irrigation when with im - proper application of water ,the soil becomes packed, is insufficiently aerated and Is favorable for scab. The amount of scab will vary year </seg>
            <seg id="p611">, ■ Nebraska Potato Improvement Association after year, even when scabby potatoes are planted, because of the dif - ferent environmental conditions. Previously we have recommended corrosive sublimate for scab control and also for the control of Rhizoctonia. Both diseases arc carried on the seed and in the soil.- This year we made tests at Lincoln, North Platte, and Alliance on the Early Ohio, Cobbler, and Triumph, testing out a. number of different seed treatments. As a result of these one year's experiments, we recommend that the best treatment for control of scab, which will also control Rhizoctonia, is hot formaldehyde — ordinary 40 per cent formaldehyde used one to one hundred twenty, which" is two pints of formaldehyde to fifteen gallons of water — at a temperature of 122 to 126 degrees F. treating for four minutes. Take them out and cover! for an hour and they are then ready to cut and plant. This was the best control method in this year's experiments. I might mention some of the commercial compounds which we tested — the Du Pont treatments and the Bayer treatment. None of these gave as good 'control as corrosive sublimate for Rhizoctonia or hot formaldehdye for both Rhizoctonia and scab. I would not recom - mend them in preference to these two, which are cheaper and have given good results. Q. Some time ago I received a circular about the compound manufactured by the Du Pont people. This spoke of the increase of germination and gave a lot of testimonials, which said they got a better stand where they treated with this Du Pont treatment. I wondered how much stock there is in that. A. If you have healthy potatoes and get a 98 per cent stand, you won't benefit your stand much by treating them. We tested four Du Pont compounds. They gave fairly good control for Rhizoctonia, but poor for scab. ■ Q. Do you have any -way of testing the strength of corrosive sublimate dip after it is used so you can add to it and keep the same strength? ■■•'■ i • ■ ■ A. Yes, we have a way of testing it — a simple chemical deter - mination. It is easy to apply but we have hesitated about giving it to the farmers without personal instruction in its use. If you wanted to, you could get your ' county . agent to use it; We can give him the methods and he can either apply them or. teach you how to do it. Our circulars on seed treatments also give methods of keeping the strength up approximately for four successive treatments in the same solution. The advantage of formaldehyde is that it does not decrease in strength except at high temperatures, due to steaming. We have figured out what the decrease: is and how it can be corrected. Q. What is the effect of Rhizoctonia on the plant? A. Rhizoctonia is a disease that does not do as much damage as scab in western Nebraska. It varies in its effect on the plant. It </seg>

Later on Rhizoctonia appears on the new potatoes as small black surface spots. In some sections they speak of this as dirt. It looks like black dirt, only it does not wash off. It does not rot the potato. It is in this form that it lives through ihe winter on the potato. It is also found in the soil. Ithizoetonia is a fairly low temperature disease compared with scab, doing the worst damage at 58 to 60 degrees. In the eastern polato section of Nebraska where the cool part of the growing season occurs early, most of the damage is to the young potato plants in the form of sprout injury. Here in the west the colder part is at the end of the season, and instead of cutting down germination in the spring you get a girdling of the plant later in the season, and the formation of the black masses which live over on the tubers. It lives over in the soil and on the seed the same as scab and is controlled by the same methods. Q. How can wilt be controlled? A. Wilt is not controlled by seed- treatment. It lives on the inside of the potato and also in the soil. It is therefore, hard to control. The only control we have at the present time is the use of healthy seed on healthy soil. In connection with wilt, we have ob - served for a number of years that Irish Cobblers show more wilt than the Triumphs in adjoining fields. Last year I. ran tests in the green - house at Lincoln, and they indicated the same thing. We ran a test in the field this year at Berea, planting healthy Irish Cobblers and Triumphs side by side on land which produced wilt the year before. There was not much wilt showing in the field; but the Irish Cobblers showed 30 per cent of Fusarium wilt in the tubers, and the Triumphs showed 15 per cent. As a result of that one test, I should hesitate to plant Cobblers in a section where wilt is severe, unless you ar&lt;&gt; sure that land had not been in potatoes for quite a while. The Early Ohio I think is possibly as susceptible as the Cobbler. Q. Some years the wilt seems to develop after the third in - spection. A. The time of appearance is due entirely to the conditions your plant is growing under. It works best at a temperature of 65 to 75 degrees. It is also affected by soil moisture. If you have infection in a dry season the organism working from the soil through the roots, may destroy enough roots to cause a wilt ofthe plant, with a resulting decrease in yield. With a high soil moisture, the same amount of root injury will not cause the plant to wilt. There will be very few symptoms in the tops, only a slight mottling of the leaves but the organism may be working rapidly under ground, and the new potato </seg>
            <seg id="p613">Neiiraska Potato Improvement Association will have a stem-end rot. A good many times you do not get much wilt in the field with high soi moisture but stem-end rot or internal discoloration may be present iA the new potatoes. Q. Does the wilt cause dry rot in potatoes in storage? A. -Wilt causes a stem-erd rot of potatoes in the field which may continue (o rot in storage. Topical dry rot in Nebraska is caused by another organism which doe's not occur in the growing plant in the field. It only attacks potatoei in storage and is unable to infect the potato except through woundk It can, therefore, be controlled by careful handling and the elimination of cuts and bruises through which this organism gets into the potato. Q. What are .the most important diseases in growing certified seed? A. I might mention 'spindle-tuber and mosaic which are the diseases responsible for the demand for our certified seed in the south. We have notj found thi organism that causes them. We know they are infectious and can bt transmitted from plant to plant. We have proved that certain Insects are capable of sucking the juice in diseased plants and transmitting the disease to the healthy plant. We can transmit them ourselves by rubbing together the leaves of the diseased and healthy plants. In spindle-tuber, we can rub cut seed pieces together and produce infection, and even the cutting knife will cause a certain amount of transmission. In regard to mosaic, table stock growers should remember that it reduces the yield; but that you cannot tell it in the potato tuber. There is no way of telling.from the examination of potatoes in the bin whether or not they are infected with mosaic, but the infected tubers wil! produce diseased plants the following year in the field. As a result of that, we have seed certification by means of which we get rid of the disease in the field, where it can be seen and thus reduce the percentage to the minimum. The disease is very severe in the south in its effect on yields so they are willing to come up here and pay a premium for certified seed in order to be sure of a low precentage of mosaic. Field inspection and the removal of diseased plants i.s the only way to control it. Spindie-tuber can be told on the potato and in the field as well. As the name indicates, it produces a spindle-shaped tuber. The disease is transmitted the same as mosaic. It is very severe in western Ne - braska—one, of the most severe diseases you have and one of the hardest to control. We know that some insects, such as aphids, will spread it. We are trying to find out if there are others which can transmit it from plant to plant. We are also trying to determine whether the disease can live on other plants related to the potato and reinfect the potato the following year, similar to the mosaic of tomato </seg>
            <seg id="p614">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture and other crops, which lives over winter In perennial weeds which serve as a source of infection the following year. Mosaic and spindle-tuber are the most severe diseases in the cer - tified seed industry. From the standpoint of the grower of commercial table stock, you can treat your potatoes for scab and Rhizoctonia. You can buy good seed or use your own and plant it on the best land available, but you have no assurance against these two diseases. I would not advise any man attempting to grow table stock to try to get rid of these diseases for himself. Go to a man raising the right type of seed, who insures you a minimum of those two diseases. It is not a paying proposition to do it yourself. The other man making a specialty of seed production can do it cheaper. Ask these men growing the certified seed and they will tell you it takes years to become familiar with these diseases and to learn how to control them. When you buy potatoes with a low percentage of mosaic or spindle-tuber, you are increasing your yields and therefore your margin of profit. Q. This year I think a great many growers are puzzled in the way spindle-tuber is masked at times during the growing season, and yet apparently many spindle-tubers are produced. A. One of the first things we studied about this disease was the effect of different conditions on the symptoms. We tried to determine the effect of temperature and moisture on the symptoms of the disease so that we might recognize it under all conditions. As a result, we found the symptoms of spindle-tuber are made more severe by high temperatures and also by high soil moistures. Under different soil conditions you will get a difference in the degree of the severity of the symptoms. There will be a difference in one part of the season and another part, due to changes in these conditions. With mosaic, the reverse is true. The symptoms of mosaic do not appear above 70 degrees F. It is hard to detect it in Nebraska, and it is easy to detect down south. As a result, we send our potatoes down south and make readings to find how much mosaic Is in our fields out here. That is the reason for the test plots in the south. Q. What causes blight? A. I am not sure what you mean by blight Q. The vines turn yellowish and appear to be ripening pre - maturely. A. Is It connected with wilt and stem-end rot? Q. I find a wilt in the vine. A. Was there a discoloration in the stem if you cut it across? Q. I never tried that. I had four acres of potatoes do that. I was away two weeks and came back and thought the potatoes had ripened. They began to green up again and grew a lot of knobs on them. </seg>
            <seg id="p615">' Nebraska Potato Improvement Association A. Wasn't it lack of moisture? Q. The vines were standing high, and when I came back they looked like a ripe potato in the field. ■ A. Fusarium wilt would produce a wilt of the tops. Another disease called "early blight" would kill the tops, but it would appear as small spots scattered over the surface of the leaf. In some seasons it is severe in certain localities. .It is found on the leaf in spots one - eighth to one-fourth inch in size. The spots are made up of con - centric rings and gradually Involve the entire leaf so that it will wilt. Your first description would indicate that you had enough mois - ture at the start of the season so that you got a heavy growth, and then not enough soil moisture to keep on supplying the tops and the plants wilted, and later on with additional rain you got a renewed growth resulting in second-growth tubers. Q. What causes potatoes to get black pretty nearly clear through? A. It might be frost injury. You are not speaking of potatoes after they have been in storage or transportation? Q. Yes; in the pit A. It is probably black heart, caused by lack of aeration and too high temperature — simply not giving the potato enough oxygen. If it does not get enough oxygen and is kept at too high a temperature, the potato will form a black center. It does not occur in the field and is not a transmissible trouble — purely physiological. It is chiefly a storage and transportation trouble, and will occur when the tem - perature is too high i and the ventilation insufficient. It can be con - trolled by remedying these conditions. BIG YIELDS PER ACRE IXCREASE POTATO PROFITS: WHY? MR. H. 0. WERNER • Professor of Horticulture, College of Agriculture, Lincoln, Nebraska Professor Harrington said something concerning a two-man planter. I. should like to elucidate a little the things he did not touch upon. With the two-man planter you can get a better plant than with the average one-man type. You know last winter Dr. Goss told you you can transmit spindle-tuber with a cutting knife, or by rubbing the cut seed pieces together. I am quite sure that in several places this summer I saw direct evidence of' its being transmitted by a picker planter. Production Cost • The United States Department of Agriculture conducted a number of investigations among the farmers In Michigan, Maine, Minnesota </seg>
            <seg id="p616">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture and Wisconsin on the cost of producing potatoes. As I recall it, at some of these farms they produced potatoes at 42 cents a bushel. In others, the cost ranged from 75 cents to 90 cents, or more, per bushel. Where the man saved on cost per acre — on the work he- did and the seed he planted and on the fertilizer he applied— the cost was low. He saved on that basis, but when it came to the proposition of cost per bushel, it was high and not saving. By spending a little bit more, one procures the extra bushels which are the ones that pay.' _H _ I i •■ I I I l.l I I »_, J^jjjf p A, | ; Si Mieh-£k rAur am fhr/kai i /Jrmr/e i ~ait /or A, I farms. l^&amp;Aj^e ; , " T " "° 'f ffj 37BL J#M ■ .■■■' ■-:- 1- 'I- , V IZ JZfel ' i , ■ ' PL ml ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ ■ iSflSOid 1 ---'-v^l'V ■■;z± ■■-.■»■■■ ■] -,-IZS ' ; U I fig"' — — — — — "^^— ! i— ? — [ I i : i §31 — ■$** a^^^^^wv&gt;^^^^ !■;- - -;-■•■ -r--— — p— ;: i 1 , i , '.L ; &amp;\mi r"-^-V '■■■fei-'-' ■■-■ ZZgJl.- ■•:■■■= ',IZEZ3 T § mi ■—■—— ■—^a^ ■ — t ! — ■ ' : ' i| i ' |ttii4^- ■ •" ■■■•^ • .

I do not know how many bushels are needed to pay for raising a crop out here on the dry land. In the- irrigated regions, I should judge you would have to raise 125 bushels before you have a profit, in western Nebraska on dry land I think around 80 bushels of common potatoes will be required. With seed potatoes, the number of bushels will probably be a little bit lower. Anything we can do in the way of directing our labor to increase the yields, will increase the profits; because it is the large yield per acre which gives the best profits. Storing Seed Potatoes A good many mistakes are made and a good many problems arise. One which is rather unsolved at the present time is how best to handle </seg>
            <seg id="p617">Neiiraska Potato Improvement Association seed potatoes. for our planting in the spring— through June and laic June. Probably you have some ideas on it. Different seasons will vary. I think we should get right back to the method or handling the crop in the fall. We must remember the potato is a living organ - ism. It goes through a rest period of a definite length. The condi - tions under which these potatoes are held will influence the length of that period. If conditions are favorable for growth, the potatoes will sprout. It is important to have conditions so that potatoes will not sprout quickly. One of the best things i: to provide ample ventilation in your cellars so that the potatoes v 111 cool oft quickly. A lot of heat is generated when potatoes are put into piles six feet deep. The more they are piled up, the more I eat Is generated. The potato is more active when taken out of the ground than it is later on. During the first ten days of storing, the] respiration is more than half of the respiration which takes place during the entire storage period. That is why the potatoes sweat. It is not necessary to have them sweat ir you have proper ventilation, j One consequence of sweating is tho potatoes sprout more quickly |in spring. There is a private citizen 1 in northern Pennsylvania who grew a lot of potatoes. He had trouble keeping them. He hired some spe - cialists and built a laboratory to investigate these problems of storage of apples and potatoes. His name is Mr. Marble. Last year they conducted elaborate experiments with 'car load quantities under dif - ferent storage conditions. They published a complete bulletin on that work: The results briefly were that when they stored potatoes in crates or sacks or provided for ample ventilation, or stored them in bins not more than four feet deep, they had practically no sprouting before April.' If stored in the dark in deep bins or in bins not well ventilated, they had a lot of sprouting as early as February first, and by June first the sprouts were several inches long. For our conditions, we should have thoroughly ventilated cellar? with flues, false floors, and double walls, with air intakes as well as outlets. We should see to it Si at there is an abundance of ventilation during the first three or. four weeks. It would be well perhaps to close the cellar on hot days, but leave it open when cool, especially at night and on cool days during the daytime. As it gets colder and the potatoes come more completely to the resting period, it is not necessary to have so much ventilation. You can close your air intake* almost entirely. We have circulars on this. Another question comes up as to whether sprouts should be removed at planting time? It is more or less a habit we have followed in removing them. We do not have much direct experimental work on this here in Nebraska, but we have from other states. Every time you remove a sprout, there will be a tendency for more sprouts </seg>
            <seg id="p618">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture lo come out of the same eye, and you will get an Increased number of stems. From the standpoint of the seed grower who wants a large - number of potatoes per acre, it is. undoubtedly desirable to remove the sprouts once or twice before planting time in case the potatoes begin to sprout. The question conies up as lo whether seed potatoes can be treated a long time in advance of planting. Using the hot formaldehyde method or corrosive sublimate, you can treat anytime just so the potatoes are kept from reinfection (by contamination with diseased potatoes or infected bins). If you use hot formaldehyde and treat potatoes in the cellar in April, spread them out thin so they will cool off. By that means you won't injure the sprouts as much as you are likely to if treated in June by that same method. Cutting Seed Potatoes In Advance of Planting We come to the matter of cutting seed in advance of planting. People have run into a lot of trouble on that. Perhaps the exhibit in the ha!! is self-explanatory. You can hold cut seed indefinitely if you do it right. If you do it wrong, there is nothing worse. You must have low temperatures, lots of air, preferably moist air, and darkness. When you provide those four conditions and spread out the seed pieces in thin layers, you can cause them to heal over so nicely that they will keep just as well as potatoes never cut. Here are potatoes (showing seed pieces) that we cut over a week ago and put them into our cellar in a box, pieces one layer deep, and soaked a burlap sack and covered the seed pieces with it. You might think that they would rot, but they did not. You can twist these pieces anyway and the film on the cut surface does not break. When we held potatoes at the temperature which exists out of doors at the time you are planting, and have them in a dry place, we see that a hard dry shell is formed. This cracks off easily and then you have no protection. When you cut and hold potatoes, this is what takes place. First, the water has a tendency to ooze out of the cut surface. You are cutting through a lot of cells full of starch. This starch dries, and you have a layer of starch. After a little while, something else takes place. As the moisture moves toward the cut surface, the fats which are in the sap of the potato also move over toward the cut surface. We have a collection of fat immediately under this cut sur - face, much like varnish which is simply a form of fat. This fat serves the same purpose on that cut surface as varnish on these wooden walls. It shuts off the atmosphere and the flow of water from the - inside. All of the cells are coated with the fatty covering which prevents any more movement of moisture. After that fat has been put down — about three days — we have layers of cork cells forming which are exactly like the cells which </seg>
            <seg id="p619">Nebbaska Potato Improvement Association - iiiake up the regular skin of the potato which I sketched a while ago. Then you have developed a protection in six days which is just as complete a protection against the loss of water as is the skin of the potato. It will keep out disease organisms as effectively, and prevent loss of water, and even more or less "drowning" of the seed potato if it is put in a wet soil. That ideal healing condition takes place in a cool temperature. The best place is your potato cellar. If you do not have quite a little moisture in the air, the cut surface will dry out unevenly and you will have blotches. There will be' areas pro - tected and areas which are not. You can lose water out of some parts, and disease can get into others. Darkness is effective because sunlight seems to Interfere with this process. A low temperature and humid air are most important. ' What happens when we have high temperatures? We have a rapid loss of water and a large amount of starch coming out, and the fatty layer, does not form. Then we have a coat or shell of starch which peels off. In the ordinary process of piling or being jarred, the surface being a hard layer, it simply cracks. You have the place open for all the organisms to enter. The layer on the cut surface is absolutely worthless. When the cut potatoes are properly cared for, no amount of handling will break the skin unless you practically break the potato In half. Sometimes it might be desirable to cut seed potatoes in advance because of the rush of labor at planting time. It is sometimes hard . to get labor to cut seed as. you want it. You can cut it a month ahead if you want to, provided you follow these general principles. This proposition has been worked out in England, and we have tried it out with success. In our work at Lincoln and North Platte we cut the seed about two weeks in advance of planting. We ship the cut potatoes from Lincoln to North Platte in sacks, and get 95 to 99 per cent stands in the field. We also ship cut seed potatoes to western Nebraska. In Maine, they cut seed pieces a month in advance. In Kentucky, they cut them in the fall and plant them in the spring. I am not suggesting such extreme measures, but it can be done. Shovel the cut seed over once or twice the first day, and once each day for the first two or three days. After that you do not need to bother with them very much. This works with Triumphs, Ohios and all the var - ieties we have. It isn't the number of eyes on a piece that counts, but the size of the seed piece. In a potato piece it is the eye toward the bud end— the last eye formed — which will be the first to grow. If you plant a whole potato, in some varieties that is the only eye that will grow, If the potato is normal. If there is something the matter with it, you may have sprouts coming out all over; but you had better </seg>
            <seg id="p620">Rf.port of Nebraska State Boari&gt; of Agriculture "look out" if that happens. The normal condition is for apical dom - inance. Increasing the size of the seed piece will not make more eyes grow, but more sprouts will grow oul of the eyes that do grow. Amount of Seed to l'liint We havp run experiments near Alliance which show that we can plant twenty bushels per acre in any year and come out ahead finan - cially on dry land in growing certified seed. It is largely a question as to what the price ol seed will be in the spring. We have planted seed worth $4. when our crop in the fall was only worth $1.50. Even applying these extreme figures we find planting large amounts of seed is still most profitable. Date of Pljintiiiji Planting time is a thing we must be rather careful about. Talk about late planting after this year's experience may not be so popular. As a general rule. I think the practice we have fallen into of planting after June 10 is a good one, for several reasons. We have less scab on later potatoes on plantings from May 10 at ten-day intervals up to July 10. In HI24. the percentage of scab ran from 75 per cent in early plantings (May 15) to one or two per cent in the late plantings (June 15-25 1. We have measured the length and width of thousands of potatoes every year. On the earlier plantings we have tuber shapes that look like spindle-tubers. As we plant later and later, we get better shaped potatoes, until the late June plantings have potatoes that are rounder. This year our results are mixed because our field was hailed the middle (jf August. The shape is frequently a matter of heat. Early potatoes develop during the hot weather. As you increase the soil temperature, you increase t he relative length of the potatoes. Late plantings develop tubers in cool weather and these retain the more nearly normal shape. There is another angle to late plantings. Probably a lot of late planted potatoes will be smaller, for two reasons: because they do not have enough time to grow large, and because the plants have a better set. We have been watching this for several years. We dug out individual hills and counted the number of stems as we dug and kepi a record of them, as well as of the number of potatoes per hill. As we delayed the planting, we increased the number of stems per plant. At North I'latte we plant In farly April. We then get about three stems per plant with Cobblers. As we plant later, we increase the number of stems, until the July 5th planting averages seven and one - half stems per plant; and a corresponding increase in the number of potatoes. The longer you hold seed potatoes, the more there is a tendency for them to produce a great number of sprouts. There is a limit beyond which you can not go, but we do not reach that in practice. </seg>
            <seg id="p621">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association- If your soli is in good condition and your seed has kept well, you will get a larger number of sprouts per plant from late June plantings than from those planted late in May, by even planting less seed late in June. Evidently the earlier one plants, the larger the seed piece must be in order to keep down the size. Discussion Q. In storing cut pieces, would you treat them with lime? A. That does not matter. We have acid conditions and alkaline conditions to deal with. The fatty covering forms better under alkaline conditions; whereas that artificial skin on the cut surface— the periderm is the technical name— forms better under acid condi - tions, so surphur would help that. There have been a number of experiments carried on in this country which indicate that insofar as helping the yield, dusting cut surfaces does not amount to anything. If you are planting potatoes immediately, it is a matter of convenience in keeping the potatoes from sticking to each other. Q. You must not store in deep piles, you say. Is that on account of the air? Is oxygen required?. A. It is' mostly | a matter of respiration. When you cut the potatoes, they start to respire and there is a lot of heat generated. That is why they go to pieces. After they have healed into the con - dition of the uncut potato, you can handle them like whole potatoes. Q. Would there be any advantage in using dry dust or dirt? A. No. You might even infect your cut seed pieces. Q. I have been using this for the last fifteen years. When your potatoes are freshly cut, they are starchy and apt to stick together. Put lime on them and you can put them in the planter and they rattle down. A. For immediate planting, that is good. If you want to hold the seed, it is not necessary. Q. What temperature? A. 45 to 55 degrees (Fahrenheit). The ideal is a little bit lower than in your cellars. If you keep your cellars closed up in spring, you can keep them colder than you think you can. You can do this work earlier than planting time. I do not want to be misunderstood. If you cut your seed early, do aU these things. Spread them and keep them cool; otherwise you may have trouble on your hands. Q. By cutting early and using a cement, I do not have any trouble. ... A. There have been experiments conducted in England with cement. They have not shown that it amounted to anything. Some- </seg>

McKELVIE, Publisher, "The Nebraska Farmer," Lincoln, Nebraska. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: This program is rather backwards. That is the way we do things nowadays, more or less. 1 am reminded of how Mr. Barnum used to do when he went across country with his big elephants. That was before they had good bridges and he would not haul his elephants by train, but drove them; and when he came to a bridge, he always put the baby elephant across first; then the next in size, until finally, if the bridge bore up each, he put across the renowned elephant "Jumbo." I still insist the program is contrary to Mr. Barnum's custom. The renowned elephants have already gone across. Yes, Mr. Chairman, if I could answer this question that has been assigned me, I suppose I cculd be elected king. (Laughter.) But who wants to be a king? That would mean more trouble for one if he got into that position. It is my own question. I asked it myself. I have asked it as much in order that I might get an answer from you as that I could hope to give it to you. Fortunately — or unfor - tunately? — I have not been able to get myself into the attitude of mind where going before a group of people of any class, I can hope to help them by giving the negative side of the question. My theory — and perhaps it is a psychological one — is that we lift people up by en - couraging them, and not by discouraging them. It is an old saying — Laugh, and the world laughs with you; Snore, and you sleep alone. (Laughter.) I can paraphrase that by saying — Believe in your job and the world will believe with you; Grouch your job and the world will leave you alone. Either we believe in farming or we do not. If we do not believo in it ourselves, we can not direct to our task the confidence it requires to make it a success, nor can we properly elicit the support of others. I have no answer for this farm problem. I have a few suggestions. I view it not from conditions as I find them today, but from observa - tions I make of what has happened in this state through a half cen- </seg>
            <seg id="p623">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association tury of agricultural progress. I view It also from the angle of what I have, found It necessary to do in my own business. I came from the farm to a manufacturing business, and yet I find in my business there are numerous principles that apply just the same as they did on the farm. It is not a far cry for me to remember— and I do not claim to be an old man— the; time when a string of white-covered wagons coursed their way across Nebraska from west to east. I was a boy growing up on a central Nebraska farm then. We saw that caravan of disappointed adventurers. Some of them paused at our place to stay over the night. They dined with us. We heard their story, and usually it was one of bitter disappointment— of lack of confidence in the country and in everything. And in my childish mind I wondered why my father and mother wanted to stay there; for I could see all about me the crops withered with the hot winds. I could see the conditions there which these people had found, through which wp were passing. They had given up and were going away. Why didn't my father and mother do the same? A lot of people in that community did do that. Some wags said they went back to their wives' folks. We stuck it out. We stayed there and learned a great lesson. It was in the early '90's that this hard period existed— this time when agriculture in Nebraska was at its lowest ebb. We passed through those years — those drouth-stricken years — those years when it seemed as if almost everyone was against the farmer. We came into the year 1896 when Nebraska produced the greatest yield of corn ever produced in her history. Not since that time have we produced as many bushels of corn in Nebraska as we did in that year. That corn was worth ten cents a bushel, if you were fortunate enough to get it when you were shucking it. Many sold it for eight and nine cents a bushel. My father believed in the country. He believed in the future of the country. Fortunately, he had credit, and was able to take this corn and crib it up. Many other farmers— not the majority, but many other farmers — did the same. And beginning with the very next year, 1897, to 1910, Nebraska passed through the most prosperous era in her history. The farmer came into prosperity of which he had not dreamed; and those jwho left in the early '90's came back to be amazed at what they saw. Then we came gradually into another period— 1914 — when there was more or less discontent among the people. The farmers were complaining a good deal, as I recall, in 1913 and 1914. I recall my brother sold his wheat on his farm in July, 1914, for less than seventy cents a bushel. Had he waited a month he could have received a dollar, and had he waited another year, he could have received two dollars. </seg>
            <seg id="p624">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agbicctltube What happened? A great conflagration broke out across the sea. Men who had been accustomed to produce the food products they would consume turned to destruction, and the weight of feeding the world was thrown upon the shoulders of agricultural America — not on account of anything the farmers had done, but on account of con - ditions they neither foresaw nor could control. The farmer came' into an even greater era of prosperity than he formerly had known. I have referred to it as "prosperity." I think that is the wrong term. I think I should better refer to it as inflation, for.lt was an abnormal condition brought about by a crisis that does not occur in normal times. Then we passed through that period of four years of fighting during which these prices Increased, until finally it ap - peared the farmer would destroy the prospects of civilization if the prices of these products were not controlled; and the government fixed a price upon certain products of the farm. When the sound of the guns died away, those who had passed through a similar period in the early '60's and those years that fol - lowed the Civil War, turned to us younger fellows and said to us, "Look out! Pay day is not very far away." We may have believed them for the moment, but for a year after the war closed, and when the so-called "minimum price" was taken off agricultural products, the price did not decline. There was no evidence on the horizon of anything except even greater prosperity for the farmer. Indeed, every grain upon which there had been a limit, as soon as the limit was taken off, advanced gradually in price until it attained levels unknown during the present generation or the one that preceded us. We turned to those hoary-headed pioneers and said to them: "You are all wrong! You are all wrong! This is a new era — a new level of prices we have now — a new condition under which we are living. We will never see those old prices again." So we went on our merry way, buying everything we wanted; limiting ourselves in practically nothing; incurring obligations which at that time seemed reasonable; but one morning we awoke and found they were very unreasonable. The price of these agricultural products began to decline, and it did not stop until it had reached the lowest level that had been known in a quarter of a century. Then we came to realize that these men who spoke from years of wisdom knew what they were talking about; that war does exact its toll, and it falls primarily upon the farmer. It always has. It probably always will unless the farmer becomes far better organized than he is at the present time. Now, we have been passing through that period since 1919 — sir years of It — during which the farmers have suffered. Many of them have lost their all. Many of them have borne burdens which have raised in their minds the serious question that I ask here: "Where Do We Go From Here?" </seg>

(Applause.) There are some respects in which the government has placed the can ZJ \ d f^n^e-sonae respects in which the government can i end a helping hand to Agriculture the same as it has to its citizens in other lines. I might at once branch out into a discussion of perhaps the most comprehensive law affecting the walfare of the producers of this country of any other single act; but I am afraid if I should undertake to discuss it in all its ramifications I would too soon be speaking to an empty hall. I refer to the tariff-not a new subject, yet a thing that has a very great influence upon the welfare of our people. I call your attention to just this thought with reference to the tariff: following down through the periods when we have had a tariff and when we have not had it, it seems to me that the farmer has generally been most prosperous with the tariff— that is, in normal times. I will explain the reason for it to you as I progress in .my talk; However, I do say this: that unless the tariff operates equally to benefit all classes of people, then it is not a just law and something should be done to remedy the condition I do not think, as I shall submit to you a little later, that the trouble s with the tariff, but rather with those affected by a tariff as groups— the ability of some classes to take advantage of it, and the failure of others to do the same. Passing, then, from that subject for a moment to another and It is not a new one. We have had It with us since the beginning of time It is the question of taxes. It is included in every political Platform that ever was written; and yet, by and large, we find our taxes gradually increased to the point where they are burdenspme —especially so if times are not good, and upon certain classes, if they </seg>
            <seg id="p626">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture are not properly levied. Here is where my criticism of taxation comes in— a criticism I regard even more important than the burden of taxation itself. It is this: that in our State of Nebraska, the farmer pays directly — did last year — 65 per cent of all the taxes of the state. I do not believe that the farmer's income is 65 per cent of the total income of all classes in the state. Why is it so? It is because of our system of taxation, in which we make a tax on property the basis for our levy. The values have been fixed by people either appointed, or elected by the people. There - fore we have the land and its improvements and its implements and its live stock and everything about it that is" tangible lying out before I he eye of the assessor. He usually is acquainted — or fairly so — with these values as they range throughout the country. In any event, he knows enough about it that he can assess those values very much more accurately than he can the value of certain other properties — for instance, a stock of goods or merchandise of any kind; or, if you please, a railroad. Now these railroad men are going to say they are bearing all the taxes, and they do bear considerable; but the average assessor does not know the value of the railroad. That valuation is arrived at loosely. The farmer pays 65 per cent of the tax whether his income justifies it or not. The percentage of taxation upon agriculture in this and other states has been a burden that has not been equitably borne among all the classes of people. The theory of taxation is it shall be borne or distributed according to the ability to pay. That, after all, is about the proportion in which we receive our service for which taxes are used. If we have much income, or much value based upon income, then the protection and service we receive from the stale is about in proportion to that value based upon income; and that is the theory upon which taxes sooner or later will be assessed in this state, because Agriculture can not continue to bear the burden of the unfair share that it has been doing. You may anticipate the time, I think, and it is not so very far away, when we will have an Income tax in this state, and the farmer with all of his assets lying out before him, will be assessed not so much upon what some one man may say those assets are worth, as what they are actually worth based upon the income they produce. That is what it should be. I am going to say to you, just apropos of that thought, that regardless of what you say your farm' is worth, or what you may think it is worth, its real value is what it will produce, and no more. We have had a lot of artificial valuations in land based upon speculation and temporary conditions, but when we begin to base the value or our land upon what it earns, just as I must base the value of my factory, and the banker and everyone else must base the value of </seg>
            <seg id="p627">Neiiiiaska Potato Improvement Association property upon its earning power, tlien we will get a! real value of our land that will bo. in perfect harmony with the theory of taxation or which I have spoken. Many forces are in movement now to bring about this readjustment or taxation in order that Agriculture may bear its just share — no more — no less. Another thing over which the farmer has no control, and yet it influences his welfare tremendously, is his source of transportation. That means the road from his farm to his central market point and the roads over which he must travel wherever he goes; the railroads over which he must transport his products, or whatever the system of transportation may be. He is a voter in determining what the policy of the state shall be. You know a great deal of complaint is being made with reference to that in this state. When it comes to our system of transportation— railway and otherwise— he has not the opportunity to effect a direct influence. The railroad's Influence upon his welfare was never more clearly indicated than in that period of which I have just spoken following the war. When the: prices of agricultural products reached their peak" because of lack or cars to deliver his product when it was ready to go to market, the farmer suffered untold losses. Between the time they called for cars and received them, the prices of their products in many cases were more than cut in half. So primarily the farmer is interested in service from the transportation system, and he is vitally interested, too, in the price he should pay for transportation. We have our State Railway Commission and the Interstate Com - merce Commission. They determine what rates are established. I admit they know far more about that than I. do. Therefore I -will admit the rates of the railroads in order to get a fair return are adequate, or what that tribunal thinks they should be. I am prepared to say also there are further things that can be done to bring down transportation costs. Then Agriculture — more, perhaps, than any other industry — is entitled to that because of the bulk and character of its- freight and the distance it is removed from the central markets. This brings me to a proposition advocated by great authorities: that we have our inland waterways, which at one time were our principal source of long transportation. Improved, since until recently they scarcely have been serving us at all. Two decades ago, the Federal treasury paid for a development, of a water project the Panama Canal — thaf brought the east, arid west coasts, in fact, all exterior points, that much closer, together than they were before that is, east and west; also the cost of trade relations between our east coast and our west coast and between our east coast and the ocean. But the very same moment, even though the money came out of the pockets of all the people in order to pay for that tremendous project, </seg>
            <seg id="p628">Report op Nebraska State Board of AgbicultiAe il removed the interior farther from the exterior on the basis of cost than it had been before. Our agricultural products that already were as far as they possibly could be from these principal markets, were placed farther away by this project in which we all had a share in paying for it. Now comes no less an authority than Secretary of Commerce Hoover to call our attention to the fact we have here in the very heart of this country, in the richest agricultural region in the world, a system of waterways comprising nine thousand miles, reaching from Pittsburgh on the east to Kansas City and Omaha, and probably Sioux City, on the west; from the Twin Cities on the north to New Orleans on the south; that there is the possibility of being connected up with the Great Lakes system. Its development will cost perhaps a good many million dollars — not so much, however, as the Panama Canal; that it stands to reduce the cost of shipping grain to the Nebraska farmer from a minimum of three cents to probably more than twice that amount as a maximum. I contend it was a good thing for our government to develop the Panama Canal. I believe it was a good thing to take the money out of the National treasury for that purpose. It is also a good thing for the government to develop this system of inland waterways out of the public treasury and let all the people pay for it, thus returning the benefit to this great agricultural region; and it is coming. (Ap - plause.) Today there is plying up and down the Mississippi River, on th§ Ohio, and on other of these principal streams, barges that are trans - porting tremendous volumes of freight and effecting very great sav - ings to Agriculture and to commerce on the continent. Also we may bring the sea to the very interior by the development of the St. Lawrence River and by a system of locks so that these ocean-going steamers may come to the interior and we may load our grain on them to be carried to the distant markets of the world, thus again effecting a substantial saving to the farmer of the interior. Men like Mr. Hoover, men who are Interested in our national development, have no intention of doing any injustice or permanent Injury to any other industry; therefore to develop this system of waterways does not mean we will abandon or have less need for our railroads. It means that this system of transportation will be broad - ened. Even though grain may not travel as far on the railroads to its destination point as it does now, it does mean if the farmer can be more prosperous he would be in a position to have more of the products for which he exchanges the products of his labor. Thus far, wherever waterways have been developed, they have not injured the railroads: and they will not. They simply become a vital part to the develop - ment of our industrial and commercial system. </seg>
            <seg id="p629">. Nebraska Potato Improvement Association So much for the external aspects— the things that may be done for Agriculture from the outside. I come now to the thing I consider more important, and that is what the farmer can do for himself. • This chart shows that in the State of Nebraska last year, a certain group of farmers In 1 the eastern part of the state earned a profit of $9.49 an acre in growing corn. It shows in that same year, all the farmers in the same region got an average of only 61 cents an acre profit. Why did these farmers, up here get more profit in the very same region? Because of their different methods of farming and the larger yield they secured. That's why. And right out in the western part of the state we find very much the same thing. We find last year these farmers secured a profit of $3.20 an acre on their corn, while all the farmers secured a profit of only 16 cents an acre. Why? Because of the different methods of farming. The better class resorted to more efficient, more economic methods of management, and were rewarded for their effort, above the average run. Now, who wants to be average in anything? It is the fellow who is an average in anything who is just getting along. It is the fellow, who is above the average who is getting ahead, and the fellow who is below the average is doomed to failure. Do you want just to get along, or to get ahead? What is the answer? The United States Department of Agriculture calls our attention to the fact there are 25 million cows in this country, of which number, 8 million are boarders — not paying their keep. The farmer is paying for the privi - lege and the fun of milking those cows and having their company. (Laughter.) Now, a cow is not such bad company compared with some . other kinds of company we might have. For instance, you might be in politics. (Laughter.) But why pay for a cow's company when she will pay for yours? Here's the story. In certain cow testing associations, it was found that a cow that produced 100 pounds of butter fat gave a return profit of $10 above feed. She showed a loss. A cow that produced 200 pounds gave a return, of $42 above the cost of feed. That cow would show some profit. A cow that produced 300 pounds showed a profit above the cost of feed of $72; and a cow that produced 400 pounds of butter fat per year gave a return above the cost of feed of $106. •I am not saying all farmers can have cows that produce 400 pounds; maybe not all can have cows that produce 300 pounds; but they ought hot to have any that only produce 100 pounds, and they don't need to have, because- the means has been evolved for getting rid of those 100-pound cows. It does not mean the market is being influenced or a surplus is being created by the 200- or 300-pound cows, or the 400. It means the surplus is being produced by the 100-pound cows that are netting a loss, not only to their owners, but are submitting the entire industry to a lower range \ of prices than it should be obliged to take. So you, Mr. Farmer, who keeps a </seg>
            <seg id="p630">I Report of Nebraska State Hoard of Agriculture 100-ipound cow, remember you are not only hurting yourself, but hurting your neighbor who is keeping a better class of cows. After all, our business of farming is so closely intertwined among our interests that we do not injure ourselves alone when we do not farm profitably; but we injure our neighbor and every other farmer who is in the same line of business. Farmers are competitors in a sense, and always will be; but after all, if we can remove just as many of the forms of competition as possible and work upon the basis of co-operators instead, we will more nearly get upon the same level Industry and Labor are traveling today. When they were competitors, they did not get along so well. They learned how to get together, and both get their sustenance from the same bowl. Failure to do these things is one of the difficulties affecting Agri - culture. They are things that are within our reach. Progress is being made to remedy them. I will tell you this, my friends: we are not going to make it fast enough to overcome this very great debt we incurred during the war unless we give more attention to these things in the management of our business that have proven wise in other lines of business. I happen to know that Agriculture is not the only line of industry that is suffering as a result of the war. I can look at my own records and know that. I can see where in four years' time I lost nearly as much money as I had made in the four years before. Other manu - facturing industries can show the same kind of records. What did we have to do? We sat down with our problem and found out what was the matter with it; so that a year ago we produced a profit in our business on a 25 per cent less volume than that on which we had sustained a very heavy loss two years before. We took 25 per cent less business and earned a profit. How? Because we became more efficient. We eliminated those things that had represented leaks and waste. We added other lines. That is how we did it, and that iB the thing that made it possible for us to evade the sheriff. He was camping on our coat tail for quite a little while. Industry in many lines will tell you identically the same thing. As we go out among the farmers we find the very same things are coming about. We find that farmers — some of them — are doing these things; so we find some farmers getting ahead rapidly, and some not so rapidly. I submit this: let us get it out of our heads that our land is worth so much; that we are entitled to earn on a certain valuation of our land. We may have bought it at a certain price, and we may have been gloriously trimmed in paying that price. It is worth what It will earn, and the higher it gets in price, the more efficient your methods must be. I take the story of a banker in Iowa. Here are his figures which show what happened to him in the farm business, He farms five </seg>
            <seg id="p631">Nebraska Potato l.MrnovEMKXT Association thousand acres. That is quite a little patch of land. He has kept records through a long period of years on farming operations. He finds during the five-year period from 1900 to 1904,. inclusive, the net income from his farm was $30,000. That was a profit of over 10 per cent. In 1920 to 1924, again his income was $30,000. That is twenty years later. That was a profit of only 3% per cent. How do you figure that? He had marked his land up in value until his profit from the same amount of income was one-third less fhan twenty years before. What your percentage of profit is is determined a good deal by the amount of your capital. You can call your capital whatever you want to, but your land is worth whatever you earn upon it — not this year or last year or your poorest year, but over a number of years as an average. If I were a farmer buying land, I would be careful to know just what the income had been from it in a period of not less than five years, and over five years In normal times. If farmers will buy land on that basis, they will have no trouble in paying for It. I am going to make the most radical proposal you ever heard If I get away with this, I , will think I am good. If I were the farmers, I would organize on an eight-day basis. You smile at that. So did Industry twenty-five years ago. When the laborer in the shop said, "We will work eight ..hours," the fellow who owned the factory said, "It will destroy me!" And the. pages of industrial history are_ red with the blood of the- battles fought over that problem of the eight-hour day. Now they don't battle. Now they sit about the council table and determine, not upon these hours, for they are settled; they are accepted by both Labor and Industry; but they sit and de - termine what the Tvage shall be, and usually there is an increase comes out of it for industrial labor. The unorganized consumer pays the bill. Here,' that is the farmer. . Who is your competitor? Is it the farmer? No. It is the fellow from whom you buy the things you need — the fellow with whom you exchange the products of the farm for the things you need In your industry.' Do you think you can by tradition or any other means put. yourself on an equality with Industry when you work sixteen hours while the other fellow is working eight? Never a chance! The question of the eight-hour day came up in Industry. They said it could not be done. They said It would destroy Industry. It is here. • I return to that proposition of the tariff. How did Industry and Lavor avail themselves of the benefits of the tariff? Was It by some . bill they passed? h No. They got together and said, "We can not afford to produce too much. If we do; we are just as bad off as though we did not have any tariff. The price of our product is de - termined by the export surplus." Don't talk it over and let it rest at that. Remember it is not mass production alone, but control of mass production. It is mass </seg>
            <seg id="p632">Repobt of Nebraska State Board of Agkicui/tube production for eight hours unless it produces too much, and then, for five days a week. The steel plants -are producing 70 per cent of normal capacity today. I was in Akron, Ohio, and found some of their rubber factories were running only five days a week. Henry Ford the other day closed down for a week or ten days to take inventory — with a question mark (Laughter) — this mass production with a very definite brake on it, to be applied whenever conditions warrant it. I am telling you, my friends of the farm, you can depend upon your legislators until doomsday, but they will never bring for you equality with organized Industry and organized Labor until you do exactly the same things organized Industry and Labor have done. That means Co-operation, with a capital C — Co-operation along the entire line. It means more efficient methods of production. It does not mean less efficient. Greater efficiency has come in factories since these shorter days came — far greater than ever before. It means co - operation in your marketing problems. I opine It is because farmers work such long hours and do not inform themselves well enough, or perhaps are so dog tired, they do not get together and co-operate better. Industry and Labor are spending some of this extra time, out of the farmer's long hours, around the council table, and they are getting better paid for those hours than any time they ever put in before. The farmers might do the same. Co-operation? Yes; co - operation to cultivate just as many acres as are necessary to feed the world, and no more. It is an old story to say the farmer should feed the world. Yes, he should. But there is nothing in Holy Writ, or elsewhere, to say he should feed it at a loss to himself. I put the problem right back to you — and it is going to come back to you ultimately, anyway. You may get something that will give you temporary relief — some legislation that will boost the price of the agricultural products above the normal level for a year or two, and during that time the price of land will increase again, and the specula - tors will get from under and leave you holding the sack, as usual. There are a lot of fellows owning land who would like to be rid of it at a price some artificially stimulated law would bring about. I say when you come back finally to your problem, you are going to have to solve it just as did the farmers in every agricultural country where they have solved it; and there are those who have. You can go across the ocean and you will find they have solved their problem, not because of something the State did for them. The State helped,, but of something they did for themselves. This is a fine country. Our resources are tremendously diversified. As we survey the field, we say, "It is utterly impossible to get farmers to work together." We are just in the boat of the two Irishmen who had committed some violation of the law and got to talking It over and agreed If they did not hang together, they would hang separately.

CHAIRMAN PHELPS: I think every farmer in this house knows that he heard one good message. No question about it. I want the privilege of saying a word. One thing Mr. McKelvie did for a bunch of agriculturists you may not all know about. I think the week of the 20th of this month there is a little law suit down in Lincoln. Mr. McKelvie is a party to it and he did not have to be. He is a party to that law suit because through his paper and his own efforts, he printed what we are all thinking was the truth in a case ■ where a man harmed and tried to harm a body of growers. I have thought about it a lot of times because, whether all you potato men knew it or not, we. received from Mr. McKelvie and his paper one lot of help. If we had not received that, I am not so sure that the - certified potato growers organization would have been saved litigation, and how we ever would have got out. of it, I do not know. -,/'-. - ' •■"•■]■• ' .■'"■'■.

CHAIRMAN PHELPS: Mr. Werner asked you men to express your opinions as to the old Potato Convention and Show versus the meetings of Western Nebraska Organized Agriculture. Inasmuch as the Potato Show will be the backbone of it, you are justified in discussing it freely. It is a mighty good time to hear some sentiments expressed. MR. WERNER: If we go into this proposition again next year, we want to know whether you prefer a solid session on potatoes, like general potato matters and certification matters, or whether you would like to have these topics scattered throughout the three days' meeting. We thought we would expose more people to some information in whicb </seg>
            <seg id="p635">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association they might have thought they were not interested, by having the pro - gram as arranged for this year. The potato man might think he is not interested in grain, but perhaps he might be. The same with the live stock and other subjects. If we group the subjects, the ten - dency is for most people to come on special, days in which a particular subject is being discussed, and not on other days. It is a jump to go from wheat to big teams, and from big teams to potatoes. I do not know, if you care for that type of program. We intentionally mixed them that way this year with the idea of giving more people an idea of these features. MR. AUGUST GADEKEN, (Bushnell): I do not believe there has been a talk in the whole program that was not absolutely inter - esting. But it is hard for people to get away from home for three days on account of their chores and other matters; so I believe it would be a little advantage if those different subjects were grouped separately, that those who could not stay for the entire time could come for their subject and go home. I have enjoyed the meeting so much I would not miss any part of it. MR. JESPERSON: I think it was a pretty good thing. I have been at these meetings before. When there is a group like this, it seems as though there is more interest shown than if some come to hear this, and others that. There is more interest shown than with just a few devoted to any one subject. I think the people have shown great courtesy in treating us the way they have. It looks like the more, there are present, the greater the interest. I think the way it is is a good plan. MR. SHELDON: I wonder if half way between would not be right? If you are going to hold group meetings every day, mix something else in. But put your most important potato meetings in rather short space on the program so that if a man could not stay the full time, he could pjck out the time he really thought he should be there. MR. STENBERG: I think people will come out and stay for all. three days if they ! can, but they could pick' their particular day if the discussions on each of the several subjects were put close together. MR. PEDRETT: From what I can see, I have hardly ever seen a meeting — in Agricultural Week or any other time — that held them more together. Some of them listened to lectures they would not go to under other circumstances. It looked pretty good as far as that was concerned. But if the most important things for the potato growers, for instance, were grouped, when that day comes those potato growers who could not take the three days would be here. If I could not attend all the meetings, I would come to Potato Day. I think that can be arranged. v_ </seg>

When I first came to Nebraska, I expected to see many trees, because I came from North Dakota which is a country newer than Nebraska. I found some of you had had experience with trees; had paid quite a little money for nursery stock and had had failures. The notion is pretty well denned here that trees can only be grown by an expert. There is one criticism we hear of western Nebraska: "I should hate to live out there because there are no trees." I have never had time to talk trees to you because I generally was most interested in getting your fields inspected. Of course trees have been grown on these plains for quite a few years, and clear up north in Canada where the winter is more severe, and farther west, trees are being grown satisfactorily. About twelve years ago, the Federal government established an Experiment Station at Mandan, which is across the Missouri River from Bismarck, North Dakota. The purpose was to conduct experi - ments with various agricultural plants, especially trees. One of the things they undertook was the distribution of trees to farmers for wind breaks throughout the western parts of North and South Dakota, and throughout large portions of Montana and Wyoming. They very soon found out, using certain methods which had previously been worked out, that trees can be grown successfully in these regions. These trees were sent to people carefully selected, who were instructed with regard to the methods to be used In taking care of them. We are especially fortunate this evening that we have with us from that Station, known as the Northern Great Plains Field Station of the United States Department of Agriculture, Mr. Wilson, who has been in contact with this work ever since it has been established. We will call on Mr. Wilson, from Mandan. (Applause.) </seg>
            <seg id="p641">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association WINDBREAKS -HOW THEY ABE BEING GROWN SUCCESSFULLY OX THE GREAT PLAINS OF THE NORTHWEST MR. ROBERT WILSON Northern Great Plains Field Station .'■ Mandan, North Dakota" I am glad you turned on the lights. While it would be kind to give me a little screen to walk 1 out behind, it is. probably better, while I am talking, to be able to face the music. The American philosopher. Emerson says "you can travel the world over in search of beauty, but unless you carry it with you, you will not find it." We cannot all go to California, because there is not room there for the -whole population; nor can we all go to other supposedly more favored parts of this great country, because one thing we need is a little room to move about in. Apparently the ordinary citizen, whether he knows it or not, is really destined, if he makes the' most out of his life, to create pleasant conditions in the place where he finds himself, and where opportunity is given him by circumstances, to endeavor! to make his contribution to the social life in which he lives. I find it difficult to make any definite statement about so large a subject as Trees, in the short space of half an hour. Probably the thing I should try to do is to stimulate thought along certain interesting lines especially applicable to the problems here. Let us investigate for a few moments the experience that has taken place in other regions. Back in 1900, our friends to the north— the Canadian government — began to think seriously, in an efficient way, about planting trees on the prairies. You know Winni - peg is the great wheat shipping center of the Canadian Northwest. The prairies of Canada have a climate of somewhat limited rainfall, and a short growing season. One of the troubles in the early days in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, was that while they had a splendid soil and usually enough rainfall to make a crop of wheat, it would not ripen soon enough to escape the early autumn frosts. They planted a wheat of splendid quality, but the frost would get it before It was ripe enough . to cut. So that their concern was to find wheat ' of high quality to fit their climatic conditions. Those familiar with the spring wheat varieties to the north, will remember that the Marquis wheat which is so widely planted, was a product of the Canadian government's efforts to answer the need for a variety of wheat adapted to that country. In 1900, two hundred miles north of the American line, at Indian Head, Saskatchewan, the Canadian government established a station </seg>
            <seg id="p642">Rki'okt of Nkiiraska State Board of Agbicui.turk lor the propagation and distribution of trees to the farmers in those provinces, for the purpose of planting shelterbelta around the farm buildings. That work has been going on twenty-six years. In 1912 they established an additional station at Sutherland, Saskatchewan, to take care of increased demand for trees. They send out to the Tanners in that territory two to three millions of seedlings every year. They have a system of oversight of this work. They employ about a dozen men who travol the field in summer inspecting the land on which the trees are to he planted, and checking up results after the trees are set out. Gradually the Canadian government, cooperating with the settlers of that country, has made a noticeable improvement in the appearance of those plains. It is a revelation to drive, especially cross country, and come into this station at Indian Head started twenty-six years ago. After you get into the grounds you would think you were in any state in the eastern part of the United States. You find yourself inside a forest of trees and foliage; many varieties grown twenty-five to thirty feet in height, completely surrounding the station buildings, and extending out in acres of test plantings. Outside is the endless prairie. The Canadians have made an unquestionable success of plant - ing trees on the northern prairies. Now a word of caution. There is a common idea that If our own location seems to be more favorably situated than some other region, trees growing favorably in the other region should be much more successful with us. This is not necessarily the case. We find by careful examination of the matter of importing agricultural plants, that for the most part, the only things that succeed well when brought from other countries, are those that come from countries very similar to the one in which we live. In 1913, the Congress of the United States passed a law estab - lishing the Northern Great Plains Field Station, at Mandan, N. Dak. This action was brought about largely through the efforts of a gen - tleman who came to the Dakotas in territorial days, and had become convinced that that area would never get anywhere in farming, unless attention was given to other things besides raising stock, and growing wheat. He insisted on the necessity for immediate investigation of the possibilities of the country in horticultural directions, and largely as a result of his efforts, the station at Mandan was charged with the investigation of fruits, trees, vegetables, and other plants, suit - able for planting under the semi-arid conditions of the northern great plains. After looking over the Canadian experience — the station at Indian Head was then twelve years old, and giving some study to the exper - ience in Minnesota and other bordering regions, longer settled, it was concluded that there would probably be no success in the development </seg>
            <seg id="p643">Nebraska Potato Improvement Associatiox I ■ of horticulture by the farmers of the plains until some sort of shelter was provided around small areas near the farm buildings. In other words, if the people were to grow plums and grapes and peaches and apples and bush fruits, and have successful gardens in these open areas, it was .first necessary to plant trees that would create the necessary break from the strong winds that are especially damaging to plants of that kind. ■■■• ■ : .-' k-t Fig. 3 — Trees and shrubbery on a portion of the. grounds of the Northern Great Plains Field Station, Mandan, North Dakota. So a part of the initial work of the Mandan station was to insti - tute what is called i the "Cooperative Shelterbelt Demonstration Pro - ject." The government collects native tree seed, and also imports seed of trees from other countries. We have a nursery in which we propa - gate small trees, and will furnish the planting material to the farmer who will cooperate in trying to get a planting of trees started on his farnu The government prescribes how he shall prepare the land, set the trees out, and advises him about their cultivation and care, and then it is up to the farmer. We have had an interesting experience with tree planting in four states — North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming and Montana. The area we have. worked. in for the past twelve years, is bounded on the east by a line that comes through the center of the Dakotas, and runs west to the Rocky Mountains. Those of you who have been around Lusk, Wyoming, and east of Cheyenne, may have run onto some of these government tree plantings. We have come well south of the Nebraska line, but in its wisdom Congress evidently thought Nebraska did not need any government help in this matter. From what Mr. Werner said, however, there is room for a tree or two in the western part of this state; for all of Nebraska Is not like the country where the Agricultural College is located. </seg>
            <seg id="p644">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture We set out 632 shelterbelts in 1916 on the farms of those four states, scattered in practically every part where there were farms. This western country is not all wonderful farm land, although some people like to give that impression. There are places where it is a little steep to plow, and where the soil is not just right for growing seed potatoes. (Laughter.) So that this distribution is not as regular as a checker board, but it is wide and broad. Each year we have added from 200 to 300 new plantings. Now what has happened to all of these trial plantings? If the government had charge of it, I suppose we would expect the success to be nearly perfect. In the Pullman car last night I listened to three of our good voters talking about the country. They kept referring to the government. It never seemed to enter their heads that there were four small parts of the government sitting in the car. They spoke of our government as something quite outside of themselves. All my association with the government has impressed me with the fact that it is fundamentally a human organization. My companions spoke feelingly about how the prohibition business has fallen down. "If the government," one of them said, "would take hold of the matter and sell the liquor to those who should have it, then there would be no trouble." (Laughter.) Yet after all, this government is a very human thing, and varies in the things it can accomplish, according to the kind of individuals who do its work. One thing about the government in connection with this tree project, it can be said without, fear of contradiction, that it has no ulterior financial motive behind the work. We have had to limit the number of these tree plantings, because we have not the nursery capacity, or the authority to raise the trees as a supply for everyone. There are not more than five of these plantings sent out in the county in any one year. To date we have set out over two million trees cooperatively on the semi-arid farms of the northwest. A large number of these trees have not survlyed, and the reasons for the loss were numerous. In the beginning we had no experience of our own to guide us. We took trees that had grown well in neighboring countries and used them — notably among the first species tried out was what is called the Carolina and Norway poplar. These were widely planted in the first plantings, and did not prove adapted to the climatic conditions of the plains. They- were a joy to the people who planted them for the first year or two, because they grew very rapidly. We Americans like things to happen quickly. The thing that does the quickest job is often considered the best, so this tree that grew so rapidly made a very favorable impression at first, until it was discovered that it could not last, and that its rapid growth is not a sure sign of value under our conditions. We had to determine by trial the kind of trees adapted to our climatic conditions. We have eliminated several varieties through </seg>
            <seg id="p645">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association the experience gained by actual test during these years, and we now have concrete evidence that several trees have stood the tests of hot dry summers and severe winters. As a matter of fact, we do not find temperature is especially important in this question of hardiness. _ When it gets .to 40 below zero, you would think it must be a hard climate on trees. Not necessarily. Drouth is the problem — the con - servation of moisture. Winter is a dry season, and for the most part, only trees covered with impervious bark and with the habit of early shedding of, leaves, will live through our test seasons, and go on year after year. . • ■ I would say, roughly, these government plantings, for the ten years, taking them by and large, are 50 per cent successful; that 50 per cent of over two thousand plantings are still in good condition, ranging in age from two to twelve years. We have demonstrated that trees can be successfully started, and with proper care, they can. be kept in a healthy physical condition up to twelve years. There is evidence this will continue for from twenty to thirty years. There is also evidence that on the dry plains we may not be able to keep trees to as great an age as in more favored countries; but time alone will tell us definitely about that. The plantings we are putting out now have risen markedly In ' the percentage successful. What Is almost Invariably proven In plant - ing any crop on a large scale? What, in potato growing or raising live stock or turkeys, Is responsible for success or failure? It is usually the man on the land. We have lost some perfectly good, healthy plant - ings by fellows who did not have courage, energy, get-up-and-get to them. Instead of trying to attribute their lack of success to the climate, they should learn to look to their own neglect. That has been the chief factor in mpst of the failures that have occurred. Of course there Is a variation In soil. There is no question about it. There are some places where a man has unfortunately built his house where there jwas not a good soil for trees of any kind. Such may make a partial success, but it won't be -.very great. There are occasional attacks of insects. I suppose one of the most serious enemies to tree raising on the plains is the .jack rabbit — more especially for fruit trees. We have had serious damage from this source at our station at Mandan. In summary of this somewhat rambling rehearsal, I am here to testify that It can be done. I do not say you can do It, but I can tell you with confidence that you can, if you will observe certain things. What is there peculiar about tree growing? " There is nothing especially peculiar about it. I have a growing impression that the ways and means usually applied to any successful farm project in any region, are the same in other regions and in other lines. There is no mystery </seg>

            <seg id="p648">Report of Nebkaska State Board of Agriculture We have found one or two things about this tree planting that probably would be of interest. The reason I do not care to go much into detail is that you have an excellent agency in the Extension Forester for getting details. If people want to build a barn, they don't hear how to do it from the platform. They have to hold a personal conversation, where they can draw plans and study over the matter, if they are to do a good job. We find on the plains that granting a man has the desire for trees there are two or three things he must do. You must curb this desire to have them right away, because the nature of the climate won't permit that. We have tried to get people to practise summer fallowing. Now, summer fallowing is not simply not raising a crop which you can harvest on the land. Some people do not understand this. I inspected one man's planting site a year or two ago, and found that as a help to his summer fallow, he had planted corn thick to help choke out the weeds. (Laughter.) That was his idea of summer fallow. He had taken special pains to put the corn In. The object of a fallow before the planting of trees is incidentally to get the land clean, but especially to store moisture in the first foot of soil. While the practice is good for a seed bed for grain, it is perhaps more important for transplanted trees which have estab - lished a crown and a root system which has been partly cut off when the trees were lifted from the nursery. Soil which is not moist is unfit for starting trees, and you are wasting your effort and money if the soil you pack around the roots of the trees is not moist. It pays to store up the previous season's rainfall in that soil against the time of planting the following spring. The nursery companies are selling a great many trees that are too large for best results, because they say people want them; that is probably true, but it is not an educated demand. The larger the tree gets in the nursery, (he more of its root system it loses when dug, and the harder it is to re-establish itself under the trying con - ditions in the plains. Our success, whatever it has been, is partly due to the fact we use a seedling between one and two feet in size. We get bigger stands that way, and it costs less to pack and ship them. A comparatively small tree is almost all there when you plant it. You can plant it and pack the soil around it with a better chance for it to take root and grow than if it is three or four feet high. We insist on small trees. Now a word about the kinds of trees we have found useful. We like the Caragana. It came from Siberia and northern China, areas similar to ours in climatic conditions. This, with our own native trees — the green ash, the white elm, and in its place, the box - elder — probably form the most reliable material out of which we con - struct shelter belts. After you have them growing, leave a space </seg>
            <seg id="p649">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association on the leeward side of your planting, and when the others have gotten up, add as many rows of evergreens as you have room for. The evergreen is a tree of dense crown, and it is green the whole year around. There is nothii g so gratifying on these colorless winter prairie landscapes, as a sight of a fine bank of these trees. I have here about twenty lantern slides'. Unfortunately this set was prepared six or seven years ago, and you will' not see plantings • of over five years of age. I spoke about land preparation. This is a photograph of excel - lent summer fallow. Note the somewhat rough and ridged condition of the surface obtained by the use of a shovel cultivator. This type of surface- will not allow soil blowing, and checks surface run-off, so that -the rainfall soaks in more readily. It is much better than a smooth surface such as is produced by a disk or harrow. Clean culti - vation is the important thing in caring for trees in the semi-arid plains. This picture is an example of proper cultivation. Here we have a well lntentioned by ill advised practice of trying to help the tree by cutting of its lower branches. It makes the tree top-heavy, and more readily whipped about by the wind. It also retards the growth, and lets' the wind get through the shelterbelt in fine shape. We do not advise the trimming of shelterbelt trees. ■ ■' I*- I ' - Here is a picture of the Colorado blue spruce and the Black Hills variety of White spruce; both excellent varieties for the plains. This picture of an old cottonwood grove shows the natural ten - dency of this type of tree to thin out as it gets older. We have discontinued the use of all varieties of poplar except for a limited use as nurse trees. Here are several pictures showing the fatal results that follow when a young tree planting is neglected. There is moisture enough for either weeds or trees, but not for both on the same ground. ■ . ■' I have tried to open up this subject in its general phases. I think Mr. Watson, your Extension Forester, will be in position to speak more definitely upon the special problems of western Nebraska. I shall be glad to "talk turkey" with you about this matter. If any - body wants to discuss the details with me. I will be here tomorrow and a part of Friday. (Applause.) CHAIRMAN WERNER: If you have questions on this matter, keep them in mind until the next speaker has an opportunity to talk. Along about last spring, there was quite a little interest created . by a newspaper article stating there would be some trees available from the Halsey nursery for free distribution. There was quite a response to the statement, and some misunderstanding; but anyway, trees were sent out to quite a number of people in the state the past </seg>
            <seg id="p650">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture spring. That has created the movement to have an extension forester 1 have an idea that a forester has a place in Nebraska. We have a man who happens to be a native of Nebraska who has training in forestry and has had actual experience in forestry work, who now fills he position of extension forester in this state. We will have Mr Watkins speak to us. (Applause.) TREES! MORK TREES FOR WESTERN NEBRASKA FARM HOSIES! MR. C. W. WATKINS Extension Forester, College of Agriculture Lincoln, Nebraska I am sure we have all gotten quite a little from Mr. Wilson's address He has in North Dakota done what we are now starting to do in Nebraska. I feel if we fail in the things in which thev have failed there, or found difficulty, it will be because we are not co-operating as we should between the states. We are advocating co-operation between each state and the national government, and among people within the state; then we should also co-operate with the states which have gone through this stage of forestry, and profit by their experience. I was very glad to have you hear what has been done in some other places. Mr. Wilson also mentioned the difficulties ha are encountered in tree planting in the plains. We anticipate that. We do not expect to plant one hundred trees and get one hundred to grow the first year. I think we can get 50 per cent. ZToTllT high as 70 per cent on an average year in **«* tions We i I^v iT Condi " ons enteri "S '"t° » a great many sec - tions. I talked to a man this afternoon who tried it.

I can not say how much they will be; but hey will be reasonable. We want you to wanf them. I think that S fundamental. If you want them badly enough to give them the care we (hink is proper. I believe we will have some success. In viewing the plantings of last year , I do not believe we will Iwvp any (rouble in gP ,tlng co-operation from those who planted </seg>
            <seg id="p651">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association them. I visited a number where the failure was due to the dryness. We wjll blame it on that, anyway. One man had lost every tree — maybe ■ five hundred. Of course I expected he would want to wait until some one else had tried it out a little more thoroughly before he took it- up again. But one of the .first things he said was, "Are we going to get more next year?" I told him we hoped to. "Put me down for five hundred more." One man from KimbaU County said, "If I don't have trees on my farm, I wlli know the reason why." That's the spirit that will win. If he wants them as badly as that, he will give them the care he would any other farm crop. It is' only diversified farming — another phase of . agriculture. The progressive banker is encouraging it. If he puts his money on the farm, he wants to know the crops are diversified and pro - tected; and if he loses one, another may succeed and he won't have to carry over another year. I. think trees in Nebraska will play an important part in the agricultural industry, in the way of wind breaks, mostly. They are also a source of revenue, although we can hardly measure the value of tree plantings in bushels as Mr. Werner would in potatoes, nor in dollars and cents. Still they are invaluable to the progressive farmer. It makes a home out of a house to add a few trees. I have tried to bring that out in a crude way in a little exhibit I put up today at the gymnasium, showing what we might expect — : the ideal we want to work toward. Of course we do not go out and say, "You have to move your barn. It is in the wrong place. You must tear down your chicken house and build one according to the extension man's idea." That would be. ideal; but if some one came to me and said, "Your garage is facing the wrong way according to the way things are worked out now. It ought to face the other way," I would not turn it around. If I rebuilt I might probably face it the other way. I want to bring out the fact we will not say that yours is wrong and you must tear down your building and we will build more, and then plan the way we think is ideal. But as Mr. Wilson says, have that ideal to look toward. As we add these few hundred trees, we will fill them in following some sort of a system. If you. have some already planted, we will build onto them. We want your ideas, because they will help us. Our source of information is the government and state experi - ment stations. According to the way the requests are coming in, we will probably have to limit the number of seedlings but we will add to them each year. We are planting more seed than ever before, and as we get more familiar with the idea of planting, and profit </seg>
            <seg id="p652">Report of Nebeaska State Board of Agriculture by our past experience we will probably have enough to supply those who want to make extensive plantings. Some are thinking seriously of planting a section of sand hill land as soon as they have deter - mined what has been done at Halsey and learned what the typical, sand hill country is capable of doing. This land might be grazed, after the seedlings were well started or, since the revenue from graz - ing is not great enough to justify making grazing a primary object, a crop of posts might be cut out in twenty-five years, and the trees replaced by more desirable species. We might work toward that as the ideal that we are going to bring about as our supply increases and we improve the species. Some we have already. We are limited in this section, and probably all western Nebraska. In the sand hill region, Scotch pines are making unusually good growth in all plantings I saw where fire or grazing has not interfered. A great many Kincaid plantings were ruined by fire or stock. We want to get these seedlings to you in just as good shape as we can, because a very few minutes of exposure on the roots means a lowering of the tree's vitality. If exposed for many minutes, there is no use putting them in the ground. We want people to be serious on this proposition and feel the need for these trees so they will take the precautions in planting that are necessary. I was in the mountains west of Pueblo last summer, and a great many people would come in there generally in cars and spend a week fishing, and almost always they would ask for one or two little evergreens as they were leaving. We had a great many white fir which were growing in dense plots. We did not mind their taking them out. We would consent to a person's taking three or four, if taking them to their home to plant. Nearly everybody would do it. I saw any number of them I did not get to talk to, who would pull them up and put them on the side of the car. Maybe they lived in Kansas. They would throw a coat over them. The trees would lie with the roots exposed. Before they had left the station grounds, they might as well have thrown the tree off. They would wonder why they did not grow. You can not do that with any tree. You must be very careful. Pack the soil well. If it is moist, pack it thoroughly around the roots to exclude the air, and put a dry layer of soil over the top and hold the moisture down until the tree establishes itself, because it has undergone a shock in moving. As we send out the applications and they are approved and sent back, we have planned to send with them a list of simple directions that have been found practical in tree planting. Those people who have succeeded to a high degree have followed instruc - tions approved by their county agent as to the care of trees. We have a little game left in western Nebraska, and we should consider that. It is more or less a parallel proposition to forestry. </seg>

            <seg id="p654">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agbicultube FRUIT GROWING SESSION FRUIT GROWING AS IT IS BEING DONE IN SOUTHWESTERN SOUTH DAKOTA MR. JOHN ROBERTSON Hot Springs, South Dakota Ladies and Gentlemen: It is a pleasure to come down into Nebraska on account of the fact I grew up in Nebraska. I have lived in South Dakota for thirty-eight years, but somehow, no matter how old a fellow gets,, his mind goes back to where he was when a boy. I was born in Cleveland, and my parents moved to Nebraska in 1869. Father took a homestead In Dodge County. Fremont is the county seat. I can not remember the beginnings of the homestead exper - ience, although I can remember pretty nearly the beginnings. There were pretty hard times in Dodge county for several years after father took the homestead. Any of the old-timers will remember about the grasshopper days in the '70's when they ate everything up. The pioneers had difficulties there just as they have had all the way across the United States when settling new country. I remember something about the fruit conditions down there. Probably there was more fruit down there than out here when you people started in — nothing but wild fruit. I did not stay there long enough to get the benefit of the orchards or tame fruit planted. It is the same there as here, and where I am in South Dakota. There is no use saying you can not grow fruit. There are plenty fellows saying you can not grow certain kinds of plants. When I went to school, I remember we studied about where the first Pilgrims settled In a little territory of the United States on the Atlantic shore. Finally a few went back to England and reported this country was not fit for anything but Indians and wild beasts. It has always been that way. You people will say you can not gTow fruit successfully. I do not have to come down here to hear that. I have heard it up there. I did not get any encouragement to plant trees where I live; but I have been used to overcoming difficulties and going ahead and using my own judgment — going ahead slowly. I have been able to grow fruit bo that those old-timers are not making fun of me any more. Some of them were not kind enough to whisper I was a fool. They would tell me that to my face. (.Laughter.) Even after I had made a success with the orchard, they would say, "It Is a pity a man like you hadn't gone to Oregon or somewhere where they grow fruit successfully!" </seg>
            <seg id="p655">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association Where things come to us, they are not worth much. It is more interesting to. do something where you have a little more difficulty and where the other fellow does not get on so easy, because you do not have so much competition. Where I am we are having about all the insects and other drawbacks that go with fruit growing in most sections. They arrive if a fellow grows fruit long enough. Even down to the competition of the western fellows .snipping in fruits to Hot Springs, when I got down to be honest about it, I am thankful for all those difficulties— for competition. If a fellow did not have any competition he would be satisfied and get an idea everything was going his way. He would become a little lazy and would not value his friends and customers like he does when he has more competition. You have it in all positions and occupations. A person ought to be thankful for difficulties and drawbacks, because they are put in the way for a man to overcome and to make him amount to more. i' -J V ' . " ■ /■'-■■"■-' Fiq. 4— View in Mr. John Robertson's orchard, Hot Springs, South Dakota. We are talking about growing fruit for home use. I am growing fruit commercially up there. In order to make a. home, you need trees and fruit. You can buy a place, but in order to have a real home, you must make it. It takes long years to make a home. I do not want anyone to think my place is any better than his place, but I think it is better than any other place. It does not matter where I have been traveling around, when I get back home I am better satisfied with the place than any other place I have seen. That is the way you should feel when we get back. That is your home, and it ought to be a little better than any other person's place. </seg>
            <seg id="p656">Report ok Nebraska State Board of Agriculture When I see a family who think they must go to town or out to California or down to Florida to have pleasure, some way I think they have made a failure at home, because the place they have worked on ought to be a little dearer to them than any other place. Some folks think they have to get an automobile to take the family to town every other night. If vou have not anything at home that will interest the boy and girl to keep them at- home — not all the time, but the greater part of the time — I figure you are making a failure I do not think we should go away from home all the time in order to be entertained. I will start right in about the fruit growing on my own place. It is thirty-eight years since I went to Fall River County, which is next the Nebraska line. Conditions are a good deal the same. I do not want you to say "you live in the hills and have different conditions." We have folks around me who when they come to my place say, "That's different. You can not grow fruit where 1 live." I have not time to prove things to everyone else to show you can grow fruit in different places. I have come to the conclusion you can grow fruit where grass grows, and where it is worth while trying to make a home. I started out trying to grow in a small way. I have not anything but natural rainfall. It took me a long while to prove things to my own satisfaction so that I could go ahead a little bit stronger. I was pleased with the talks yesterday because most of those fellows, in talking about turkeys and chickens and different things, advised you to start in a small way and not to be in a big hurry. Sometimes if a fellow has capital he is Inclined, especially when young, to start in a big way. You must start at the bottom. You must be at the bottom some time, and it is better to start there and gradually work up, because we learn a lot of little things at the bottom we will need in order to make a success. I have been going on slowly year after year, gaining in knowledge. I do not know it all and never will. The more a fellow knows, the more there is to know. But I have learned enough to know I can grow fruit anywhere in South Dakota or in Nebraska wherever there is good soil and grass will grow. If I were in an open country I would not stop growing a family orchard, because I know I can grow fruit. Where you are In the open, you need some sort of protection for a small family orchard. If I were going to grow fruit commercially, I would take forty acres and plant in a square, and let the outside trees be the protection of those inside. I have gradually expanded, and have been testing out varieties that came from Iowa, South Dakota, Minnesota, and North Dakota, and up into Canada, trying to learn the ones best adapted. I have got along better growing fruit than I had expected in the be - ginning. If I had known what I know now, I could have done a lot more. I am past the point of having a desire to plant a great acreage, </seg>
            <seg id="p657">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association because it does not take much ground to give a fellow all the work 'IB WElRlS lO (10. . One reason people grow, fruit in southeastern Nebraska and across in Iowa and here in the Black Hills is because it is a rough hilly country, and when a fellow moves in he has no room to put out field crops, so he must give his attention to something he can work on a small scale and bring in returns on a small piece of ground. It isn't because that country is adapted to fruit more than in the open Wo nave rocks and stumps and side hills where the water washes off it sn't as cheap to work the ground; but the open ground has its draw - backs, too. One balances the other. I have found there are a few certain varieties of apples that will pay to grow I have over a hundred varieties in my orchard now grafted in different ways. We do not grow trees from the ground Fig. 5-Picking Wealthy apples in Mr. John Robertson's orchard September, 1926. (Mr. Robertson in lower foreground ) up, but top graft on certain varieties. I have a good many varieties of crabs and plums. I have been growing fruit nearly thirty years The first apple trees were planted in 1896, and they are there yet The varieties that have done the best, in my estimation, are the Yellow Transparent, the Duchess, the Hibernal, the Okabena, the Wealthy the Jewell's Winter, and the Mclntosh Red. The Northwest" Greening s a pretty fair, apple. When you get to the Ben Davis, the season is not quite long enough for that. You can grow sorts that will mature here that won't with me The altitude rules the season. The higher up you are, it is just </seg>
            <seg id="p658">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture the same as being farther north. I figure a thousand feet In altitude Is equal to one hundred miles in longitude. The varieties of apples that grow in eastern Nebraska where It Is around a thousand feet, will mature later up here. I find the Wealthy apple is the leader where I am. It is not the best apple, but considering all things, it is the most popular variety we have in South Dakota, and I think it is for a good share of Nebraska. Perhaps it is too early in the eastern part. I keep the Wealthy apples all winter. We have them for market pur - poses up to April. We have 1500 bushels that were picked last fall before the September freeze. I keep them all winter every year. The point is to grow some of the ones you are most sure about, and the ones that will give returns first. You should put out a few plum trees. Professor Hansen has originated several new varieties of plums. The Opata is what I consider the most valuable single var - iety Professor Hansen has gotten out. A good many sorts of new plums are not so desirable, because they don't bear early or regularly compared to the Opata. The next most valuable is the Waneta. It is the largest plum. Currants and gooseberries and those small fruits are easily grown and should be in every farm garden. You do not have to grow those littlt red Dutch currants that grow about the size of a pin head. You can «row big currants that grow the size of a cherry, like the Per - fection, the Wilder, and the Diploma. The Perfection sometimes in growing shows an inclination to overbear. In gooseberries, the Joslyn is a very large berry. In planting out trees and in growing all crops with our nominal rainfall, we have to plant farther apart than down east. It is hard to get over the habits you learned with more rainfall. We get sixteen or seventeen inches of rainfall, and in order to get enough moisture, we have to space the plants farther apart and keep the ground thor - oughly clean in between. A person should not plant standard apple trees closer than thirty feet apart each way. They nearly all put them ten to fifteen feet apart. By the time the trees reach the stage where they should be in best bearing, the roots are together and they are competing for moisture. We have not any water to add. I am planting forty feet apart. If I were going to start an orchard in the open, I would plant forty feet apart. People would laugh .at me. I take little trees, not more than two years old. They do not look like anything, but you must think about twenty years from now when they are going to be big. They will get big if you give them space. In the meantime, you can plant one row of small fruit, like currants or gooseberries or raspberries or even plum trees, be - tween each two rows of apple trees. By the time the apple trees are needing more moisture, those small fruits will have done their best and can be dug out. If you plant too close together, later on </seg>
            <seg id="p659">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association you need to thin them out. When you come to taking out one tree in between each two, they are left too long and hurt the older trees By the lime you take them out properly, you have pruned up side branches of the trees left. It is better to plant them far enough apart to begin with. I have heard lots about the soil. I have different soils just as you have. Some soil is red, and some is dark. Most is hard-pan underneath. In order to get it broken up deep enough, I use a r^ ~ ~~ * — aMWMHPffl^y ffiinWCfeytfP^lr V 'i / i ... -.."■, ' ■■■•..

Most of us use too big plows in this country. Use a big team. Gradually get down deep— about a foot. A good many fellows talk about using giant powder. It is all right, but you don-'t have to use it. Plow as deep as you can and save the energy of plants trying to get their roots down in the hard soil. I have started trees when there was not very much moisture in the spring. I have plowed- when I could not get deep enough and had to plow out. some hard ground in the spring that hadn't got wet yet. I do not have those conditions any more. A fellow must get moisture ahead. I plow my ground in sections, so there is a dead - rurrow where each row of trees, is to be. This leaves the ground sloping toward the trees so that when it rains, the water runs toward the rows and soaks things up. In this way you will be gaining mois - ture during the first few years because your trees are not using very much moisture. Most fellows can not resist planting corn and potatoes in between, as an excuse for cultivation. You have to cultivate the </seg>
            <seg id="p660">Rkpokt of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture trees. You should gain moisture year by year, and have stored up to tide your trees over the years when they get large. Moisture, where it is dry, is just the same as money. Most of us know what it means to have a deposit and keep drawing out; and sometimes you overdraw, if you are well acquainted with the banker. You can not overdraw on moisture, and must be on the square with it. In order to have a hank account in this moisture storage, you must have a margin and keep adding to the surplus until you have subsoil moisture to tide you over the dry years. We have years when there is not enouRh moisture to grow your crop of apples. If you have not the moisture stored up, your orchard will be a failure. In growing corn and potatoes and different kinds of common crops, most fellows have learned they must space their plants farther apart in order to get a good crop in a dry year. It is more important with ireps, because it won't do to have the moisture used up in the fall. You must have some moisture daring the winter. These trees are drawing moisture right along now — not so much as In the summer. If you cut a limb off now, and drop it on the ground, even with a little snow, next spring the limb will be dried out more than those on the tree, which shows they are not entirely dormant during the winter. We ought to consider the size of trees for planting. Most people ■Aio In a hurry about having fruit, and want to buy a tree that is tliree or four years old. You can always get those. Most nurserymen have a surplus of them and are glad to sell them. In a town where you are only going to have one or two, it may be all right to get a large tree, hut personally, 1 choose the yearlings. I want a thrifty tree. You can get them for less money, but that is not the main - point. They are easier to transplant. You do not have to have sucli big holes. It is a good idea to make the holes bigger than necessary. They are pasier set out. You have nearly all the tree, because the roots are not left in the nursery. They will make a better growth the (irst year, and I think will make a better tree eventually. As to where to get trees, that is another problem. I do not always know myself where to get them. You must use your best judgment. One or the best suggestions I can give you is to buy trees as near home as possible. If you have a nurseryman in this section you are acquainted with and have confidence that you will get from him what you order, buy there. It is a good Idea to get aU the help you can from your neighbors who are growing fruit, both in regard to varieties and methods of growing, because they know something about conditions here. I would rather trust a man living close by than a fellow away off, because he^tnows more about conditions here. You are more likely to get advice that will help you. It is easy enough to select what you think you want and send in an order, but it is </seg>
            <seg id="p661">Nebraska Potato Ijiprovkmunt Association not always filled that way. Even if they are labeled what you ordered, they will not -always turn out true to name. You will condemn that variety without knowing what it was. Order from somebody who is reliable and does not do such a big business but what he can sec that everything is sent out true to name. If you fail in your efforts, don't quit. ■ You must have good varieties, true to name. If you gel the right varieties for this section and give the trees a fair show, you can grow them all right. I do not care about talking about myself, but all I say conies from my own experience. It is because of what I have done I have confidence I can grow fruit here. I might move into a section I was not acquainted with, and it would take a number of years to find the varieties best adapted. You people are not so far from where I live but what conditions are similar and the same methods applied up there and the same varieties will do the same here, except I think you have a little longer season to grow some varieties that won't mature with me.- For a number of years I have been growing a raspberry crop, growing $900 worth of raspberries, and some years $500 worth of currants. After the people learn what the red currant is, they want them year after year. The same with plums. Cherries are not so successful. .There is a demand for them, but I can not make as Fig. 7 — John Robertson's orchard. Hot Springs, South Dakota.

            <seg id="p662">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture much money out of them as out of gooseberries and raspberries. Apples are really the main crop. We have been growing from three to four thousand bushels every year for several years, except in years when we have had hails. Some years we have hails that cut down the crop production. One point I might have mentioned is that while I am talking, I like to have you fellows think of questions you wish to ask. I give an opportunity to ask questions because it brings up the things I have overlooked. About the pruning of trees, that is one reason why I prefer the small tree. You have seen these pictures on the screen of those trees pruned away up, leaving a little top. That is some fellow's id^a to make things look nice. We go along on the streets here or in any town, and we will see apple trees pruned up as high as a fellow can reach. The tree must grow somewhere, and it grows out of reach. Let the tree spread below and it won't grow so high. It gives a more symmetrically shaped tree. I believe in letting trees head from one and one-half to two feet high. Lean a little tree toward the southwest so that in the hottest part of the day the two o'clock sun will be shining against the shank of the tree. If a tree is sun - scalded, it leans the other direction. Most of our trees are sun-scalded in February and March. Let the tree limb from the ground up the first year. Gradually prune up until you get up to two feet. Tho tree won't get thicker at the ground than close to the lowest limb. After that is cut off, there is nothing to thicken it near the ground any more than up near the next lowest limb. You are growing fruit too far from the base of operations. The soil and roots are where the tree gets its nourishment. The closer to the ground, the better the fruit. Low-headed trees will stand the wind. Most fellows say the wind blows the apples off. The limbs close to the ground do not get so much wind as those up high. The earth's surface retards the motion of the wind. Discussion MR. KUSEL: How can a community ascertain the valuable win - ter apples that are adapted to the climate and to the country? I have been here forty-two years — homesteaded here.. I made a trip to the Oregon country where those apples are wrapped in tissue paper. I took my trip a year ago in the month of August. I wanted to see how California and Oregon are in hot weather. They raise those fine apples. It is a great deal like this White River valley. The elements sweep down, with the Black Hills on the north and the Pine Ridge on the south. It struck me with our soil and the natural way this country Is laid out, I have a vision right now if I could see this' country again forty-two years from now, there will be some of the </seg>
            <seg id="p663">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association finest orchards, and perhaps apples wrapped in tissue paper labeled, 'From the White River Valley," and people will know where it is. They think we are in the sand hills. There are seven creeks fed by springs, and an opportunity for seven . reservoirs to store this water. I think our climate in July and August is just as nearly like the Oregon climate as two climates can be. The sun shines and puts the sugar in the beets and fruit, but it won't rain! ' I have waited for forty-two years to get rain to come in July and August, and it won't do it. If we could catch and store this water, we would have it like it is in Oregon to feed the trees. We must have a variety that won't blossom until late to escape the spring frosts. If our cultured and scientific men at the State University would show us as laymen who build up this country what fruits have keeping value to plant here to make a success, it would be helpful. The nurserymen are in the business to sell trees, and it takes ten years to find, one is skinned. These men with the appropria - tions made have a duty to perform to show us as laymen and taxpayers how to proceedj to avoid these failures. I think we .can raise apples and pears and plums and such things — fruit with keeping qualities— in this valley. I We can have several reservoirs. It is a black soil. It retains, the moisture fine. It does not take a great deal of water to bring fruit to full maturity. They have water in Oregon. They do not hesitate on the cost. We have a small cost. It is not worth men - tioning. If we had these reservoirs here to fill themselves through freshets during the winter time, the water would be available when we needed it. The Whitney I project is going to bring this about. I do not believe it will make a fruit country of this alfalfa country, because it will stand for years. Where you can have a good stand of alfalfa that will keep for thirty years, it is mighty fine. We are not getting the income out of this land we ought to. We should get down to scientific farming. I should like to see these men come to our assistance. y We will fall in line, and this land will become much more valuable. It is not used for what it was intended. MR. ROBERTSON: I think that was mentioned yesterday by one of" the speakers. I think it was in regard to the turkey business that had not got very far along yet. We are still working towards perfection. The experiment stations are working along those lines right along with the thought of creating new and better varieties. We have no winter .varieties of apples for the north. There may be some nurserymen who will tell you they have. I do not know of any of what. I call a real winter apple that has been proven to be thor - oughly hardy in the northwest. The Mclntosh Red is one of the best apples we grow, but not as hardy as the Wealthy. Some of the winter apples a little farther east and south are not hardy enough up here. </seg>
            <seg id="p664">Rf.port of Nkmiakka Siatf. Board of Agriculture The Wealthy may mature early, but it will' keep long enough to be practically a winter apple. If you go far enough north, the Duchess becomes a winter apple. The Wealthy will compete with western apples. People do not buy from me to help me along. I must fill the measure in competition with others. My apples hold their own with the western apples. We can put out just as fancy apples as those tissue paper apples from the west. I have some customers at Hot Springs who prefer my apples for baking or a dessert appie. In speaking about experiment stations, you have your Agricul - tural College at Lincoln. We have ours at Brookings. Each state has a state agricultural department that looks up projects and has experiment plots and farms over the state in different places. They do a lot of good, but there is more real knowledge in the man who is living on the ground. Some fellow will start in this valley in a small way. It may take a lifetime. If he has ten acres, he is doing big work. Whenever you find one man who has made a success in any line, the other fellow in his vicinity will do the same thing. T do not doubt but what you have the soil and the climate. This water proposition was brought up. I do not mean to belittle irrigation, but as far as I am concerned individually, I would not go one loot out ol the way for irrigation. I would rather take my land without irrigation. Where they have Irrigation, they charge more for taxes and the land is valued higher. My land is worth, just as much as in Washington and Oregon, but they do not value it high, because it is considered a doubtful enterprise. All you need in order to grow without irrigation is a little more space. The land is not valued high enough here. Back east it is valued too high. The only way to make our land worth more is to produce more on it. I will produce as much and as good quality of fruit from every tree I plant as the man who irrigates, only he can grow more trees on the same amount of space. Do not think you have to have water in order to have fruit. When we get down to talking sense, we should not allow the water to run away. The waters of the Missouri and White rivers ought to be stopped and held here, because they do not need it farther down. They are building levees to keep the water from nootling the ground. That will be done, but conies slowly. You will have this water dam and save the water. Those fellows growing fruit on a small scale are doing a lot of good in helping surrounding communities. MR. JASPER JASPERSON: What method do you use for mois - ture after you get the trees planted? MR. ROBERTSON: There is only one principal method by which </seg>
            <seg id="p665">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association t. . we lose moisture out of the soil. That is through plants growing on the surface. MR. JASPERSON: How do you keep the weeds down? MR. ROBERTSON: That's the trick. MR. JASPERSON: What machinery do you prefer for holding moisture after, you get the trees planted, not to take too much time in keeping- it clean? MR. ROBERTSON: If I were in an open country, I should use regular orchard tools. Where I live it Is so rough and rocky, we use a one-horse cultivator. If you were working for me you would think that is too slow. We use a little seven-shovel spring-tooth cultivator; also a big four-shovel cultivator at times to loosen the ground up a little. The main thing is keeping those weeds down, and the principal tool we use is a simple, old-fashioned hoe. MR. JASPERSON: I have been using a disc and thought it worked nicely. This disc leaves a little square about the tree. You can take a hoe and hoe that out. I was wondering if you did not have an easier method. It is a side line with us to keep our families satisfied and have a better place to live. We have not done it with the expectation of raising any big fruit. We had a soaking rain and the shoots grew fast. In two weeks we had a killing frost and killed all of those except three or four short trees. That was several years ago. We have never had. that condition since. Some of these years we may have the same condition and it will take those trees again. We will try to keep those that die replaced. The small trees do not cost much. Now they are from eighteen to twenty feet high. They are too close together. It. is hard to get time to take care of them. We live on the table by Hemingford, and it is a little high and hard winters. MR. ROBERTSON: You have the right idea. That early frost is no more common here than other places. Don't have fear about frost stopping fruit growing, because you will have it come some time, when it should not come. You have drawbacks. They have frosts in California and Florida and Texas. We do not have more trouble with frosts than other' places. They tell you about the good points in other places, and after you get there you learn about the other side of it. My way of getting around the frost hindrance is not smudge pots. All I do is to keep my trees in good, strong condition. The freeze last September did more harm than we realized, especially to the little trees. In general, taking care of your trees and keeping them in strong condition will put them in shape to overcome the late frosts in the spring and produce a pretty good crop. It is just the same with trees as with chickens or horses or cattle. If you had two </seg>
            <seg id="p666">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture bunches of cattle and one had been fed and was fat, and the other bunch had been running and making a living, with -a lot of snow on the ground, and the first of April you turned this bunch in the stable out, to make a living on the green grass. If there came up a cold, wet snow, the bunch that had been well fed would pull through, while the ones pretty nearly dead would die. The trees that have had to fight for a living are the ones that die out. That is the reason you do not have a crop of some fruit every year. It is a case of the survival of the fittest. They are so weak a late frost takes all the fruit off. MR. J. PEDRETT, (Kimball) : If you were not in a country like you say, if you had a chance to get irrigation water, would you consider it a help to put irrigation water on when you need it? MR. ROBERTSON: With most fellows growing trees, it would be a help. I do not believe I would care for it, personally, as I have been growing trees without water so many years. * I do not water anything. I figure if I had to water a tree to get it started, I would not bother with it, because if you begin watering you must keep it up. I do not want to start anything I can not keep up. If you add water, it should be in where the roots can get it. Soak the roots up, and do not water any more for a while. MR. PEDRETT: For instance, with other crops we raise under dry conditions, there are certain times if we could put about two inches on and take the place of rain, we would make a success. Have you ever noticed any time you wished you could have given the trees a good drink? MR. ROBERTSON: There are times we won't have any rain for a couple of months. That's the time I am drawing on this margin of moisture. There will be places where roots are competing for moisture, and it would be pretty nice to have a little water. Most fellows water too much. When you use judgment about it, you can help to produce better fruit. CHAIRMAN BIEDERMANN: We are going to have one of these specialists from the Agricultural College talk to us now. I will ask Mr. Hoppert to make his talk brief. He has a headache this morning. That story Mr. Wilson told last night about "Adam had "em" haa soaked through his head at last. (Laughter.) Mr. Hoppert has been in this section before and is acquainted with conditions. While he may not be able to tell you all the varieties that will do well here, I am sure he is willing to make plans with us following out some system of taking what varieties are available here or adaptable here. We have some excellent orchards. One had sixteen varieties of apple3 at the county fair this year. There is a lot of information we are overlooking in our own midst. We will now listen to Mr. Hoppert. (Applause.) </seg>
            <seg id="p667">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association THE POSSIBILITY OF GROWING A HOME SUPPLY OP FRUIT ON WESTERN NEBRASKA FARMS MR. ERNEST H. HOPPERT . . Extension Horticulturist, College of Agriculture, Lincoln, Nebraska. I can not make, use of t tils' story, but it has gotten through my head finally. (Laughter.) I' am glad to have had the opportunity of hearing Mr. Robertson tell of his experience in fruit growing in this so-called arid region. He has done a very valuable! thing for the agriculture and home life of northwest Nebraska and southwest South Dakota. In eastern Ne - braska we have had' such pioneers also in Isaac Pollard, Governor Furnas and J. Sterling Morton. Men like these have faith In the country. They try different { varieties and methods until they attain their aim. Many people scoff at such efforts but some profit by the experiences of these pioneer 3. Let us make good use of the sug - gestions Mr. Robertson made in his talk. He has been trying things out for about thirty years aid surely a man is bound to learn some - thing in that time. Many of the things whiish I had intended to take up in my talk this morning have been discu 3sed in considerable detail by Mr. Robert - son. His experiences ought to carry much more weight with you than my experiences, for mine are only second hand and his are first hand. By that I mean that I am bringing you not my own experiences but rather the experiences of othors. As Extension Horticulturist my work puts me in touch, with growers in all sections of the state. By' observa - tion and conversation with various successful growers It is possible to bring to you information that will save you the necessity of ex - perimenting. We have in northwest Nebraska men who have spent many years of their lives trying to find what fruits will grow here. Many of you have no doubt heard of Jules Sandoz of Sheridan county. . His experiences would do us a world of good. It is too bad that he could not be here on this occasion. Mr. Spoenaman of near Brule in Keith county has likewise been successful with fruit. Therefore I will substantiate what Mr. Robertson has told you, namely, that fruit can be grown here with a considerable degree of success. As this- section of the country becomes more thickly settled, as the large ranges are broken up and planted to potatoes, wheat, oats, corn, etc., there will be more interest shown in the planting of fruit plants to meet the needs of the farm home. At present many farmers will say "What is the use of bothering with fruit. We can buy fruit with the money we make out of corn or wheat that would occupy their ground." We have had the same story for years in eastern. Nebraska. And yet there are many home orchards being planted each </seg>
            <seg id="p668">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture year by these same men. Why? Because it is a pleasure to be able to have fresh cherry pie in cherry season without driving to town or to a Sandoz or a Spoenaman, for them. The same is true of strawberries, currants, grapes and even apples, though I think there is more excuse for not growing apples than there is for not growing some of the other fruits. A farm with fruit plants looks quite attrac - tive, too, when it comes time to sell the farm. Most of the people coming into this country to buy farms are from farther east where trees are more common and a farm without trees looks odd to them Through the work of some of our experimenters like Professor Hansen of South Dakota, we now have many varieties of fruits that will withstand the unusual climatic conditions of northwest Nebraska. The dry cold winters and dry summers that we occasionally have are very trying on tree life. But such varieties of plums as the Sapa and Opata seem to thrive here. They are sand cherry crosses,— that's the reason. Other varieties that do well are Wauneta, Red Wing, Kaga and Hanska. The Compass-cherry also belongs in this class hut has an exceedingly brittle wood, making it undesirable where ex - posed to winds. Many of these plums will grow and produce without the protection of a windbreak. They come into bearing at 3 and 4 years of age. Cherries, too, can be grown successfully. The late varieties like Montmorency. English Morella, Wragg and the Zumbra are well adapted for this region. Both the plums and cherries are subjected to sun-scald. This trouble affects the tree on the southwest side of the tree. To avoid this trouble have the branches come out close to the ground (12 to 18 inches) and be sure to set the tree so there is a good tree on the southwest. In setting lean the tree to the south - west. Should something happen to the southwest branch wrap the trunk with building paper or newspapers or lean a board against the southwest side of the trunk to keep off the sun. In buying plums and cherries get one year trees. Most two-year trees will be headed too high for. you in this section. As a rule the nurseryman takes off the lower branches of the two-year trees in the .nursery row. For this section the small tree is most easily trans - planted, as Mr. Robertson explained, but it can then be headed as low as you want it by simply cutting off the end of the whip at a point where you want the main branches to come out. There is another point to remember in planting cherry tree?, namely, the proper depth of planting. Cherry trees are usually worked on Mahaleb stock. This is an imported cherry brought In from France. It provides a vigorous root system for our ordinary cherries and one which does not sprout up from the roots. In planting a cherry tree never plant it deeper than the knob on the trunk. This is the place where the desired variety (Montmorency, etc.), has. been </seg>
            <seg id="p669">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association budded into the Mahaleb stock. If planted too deep so that the soil comes in contact with the Montmorency or other desired cherry, then roots will spring from this part and these roots throw up sprouts. Mr. Robertson has suggested varieties of currants and gooseberries that thrive with him. These same varieties will do well here, and you don't have to let them go to waste If you have more than you need yourself. Just advertise the. fact and you'll be able to'sell the excess without difficulty. Mrs. Brasch of. near Dalton in Cheyenne county told me last fall when I was at her place that she sold $20 worth of currants from thirty bushes. There is very little difficulty raising these two fruits. Grapes are not so easy lo raise. One difficulty has been that we have tried to raise the varieties that are popular In eastern Nebraska, like the Concord. It has been the experience of most experimenters that this variety is not adapted where the growing season is as short as It is here in western Nebraska. There are some other varieties that are not quite as good in quality but hardier and more prolific that could well be grown, the Beta and Alpha for example. The Lucile is another that is quite hardy and better adapted than Concord. Some of shorter season sorts, like Worden could probably be grown by pruning in the fall and then covering the vines with dirt. As you probably know, the fruit is produced from buds on wood that grew the previous year and this wood must remain alive if fruit is to be produced. Raspberries, too, can be produced quite successfully. Mr has found that the Cumberland black raspberry does very well, especially if it is grown among trees where it is shaded partly during the winter months. Out in the open the canes seem to blister quite easily and therefore are not as productive. There are some varieties of red raspberries that seem quite hardy, the Latham, for example. But even these are better when covered with dirt in the fall and then uncovered: in the spring. I have seen red raspberries do wall where the snow drifts over them every winter. I have purposely put the discussion of apple growing last. Mr. Robertson gave considerable time to this phase and I can add very little to what he has told you. It seems to me that a good windbreak on the north and west is necessary for success with apples in most places. Here in the White River Valley that may. not be so important, but on the exposed tables such plantings would help considerably. I question whether the Wealthy, if grown in large quantities so that shipment would have to be resorted to, would be able to compete with such varieties as Jonathan, Delicious, Mclntosh, Winesap, etc. Mr. Sandzo seems to think that Delicious and Mclntosh could be grown here quite successfully. The Mclntosh Is a comparatively new variety of extreme hardiness and excellent quality. It will sell as well as Delicious in some of the eastern markets where it is known. It seems </seg>
            <seg id="p670">Report of Nebraska State Boabd of Agriculture to require rather a short season. In eastern Nebraska it ripens too early to ever be popular. Then, too, it drops before it colors up. Here in western Nebraska I am quite sure this objection is not met. Regarding the use of dynamite for blasting holes in which to plant trees: In most cases it is distinctly harmful because the force of the explosion will compress the dirt around the hole which has been formed and the roots will not be able to penetrate this hard layer for several years. The use of dynamite is not warranted except where there is a layer of hard pan or rock just under the surface. Another point that might be stressed in this discussion Is the use of hardy stocks upon which desirable varieties have been worked. Ordinarily trees are propagated by grafting upon pieces of seedling root. These seedlings vary in hardiness but soon the trees get onto their own roots. Some varieties are sufficiently hardy on their own roots. Many are not. It has been found that if the desired varieties are top-worked up hardy stocks like Virginia crab or Hibernal, then there will be little trouble with winter injury to the trunk and roots. Some of the nurseries are now top-working trees upon pyrus baccata. This produces a hardy tree also, though perhaps not as vigorous a top as a tree worked on to Virginia crab. It would be a very good thing to grow the Virginia crab for two years or buy a two-year tree and then work into the main scaffold branches, scions of the desired var - ieties. In this way the main crotches would be of hardy stock also. This is quite important in some years when there are late fall rains to keep the crotches from hardening up for the winter. Ordinary trees would suffer considerable crotch injury should a severe early freeze follow such a fall. But these hardy stocks can withstand a lot of such danger. In the gymnasium the State Horticultural Society has an exhibit of apples, some of which are adapted for western Nebraska. I will be around this exhibit most of the time when there is no program here. Since the time is now here for the next speaker to begin I will close without giving you a chance to ask questions. If you should have questions concerning some of the matters I have touched upon, feel free to ask them at any time you see me. I thank you. </seg>
            <seg id="p671">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association LWE STOCK WOOL IS NOT ALWAYS WOOL! PROFESSOR R. H. BURNS University of Wyoming, Laramie, Wyoming. When I looked over the program and the title of this talk I am supposed to give, I was not quite sure of its meaning. I am sure some of you people here nave the same idea along that line. To me as I should like to take it, it means the different kinds of wool. Wool is not all just wool. We have different kinds and different qualities. It is a good thing to know about them. We hear quite a lot of talk about artificial j wool. The Wyoming men were scared about that last year. The first thing I shall discuss Is wool. That is niy chief subject. You have to have the sheep to get the wool. Our work deals mostly with wool. What is it, anyhow, and what is its value? It might be said it is one of our most valuable and useful fibers. It has properties no other fiber has,- and always will be one of the chief textile fibers. Take this piece of cloth in my coat. It could not be made out of cotton. : It would not stick together as well and make as warm a piece of clothing. To bring out the idea about wool, we might compare it to different kinds of grass grown on different types of soil. Wool is the grass that grows on a sheep's back. Just as there are a lot of different grasses, there are different kinds of wood. Usually wool has been graded as other products have been graded, according to the par - ticular use made of it. There used to be seven grades of wool in the United States. The classification has now been changed to twelve grades. The government has put them out, but not all the commercial men will accept them. Sometimes these commercial men and farmers and others have set ways and are slow to take up anything new. It is the same proposition with wool growing. A man is interested in the sheep business from two standpoints: Either producing mutton or wool, or sometimes both, to the best of his ability to combine those two characteristics. In this state and Colorado a large amount of lamb feeding is done. They are Interested primarily in mutton. If you are interested in mutton, there are certain kinds of sheep best fitted for your use. If you are interested in wool, certain kinds of sheep are best fitted for your use. If you are in - terested in both, there are other kinds of sheep. You take your choice according to local conditions and your personal preference. </seg>
            <seg id="p672">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture It is the same proposition that has been talked about concerning fruit. You must find the variety best fitted to local conditions, and with this additional factor each farmer might have a different proposi - tion. One man might have a lot of pasture land and want sheep especially adapted to grazing. Another might have all his land under farm conditions, and do a little feeding on the side. In regard to the commercial grading of wool, I will give you a few details. There are various factors used in grading wool. Length and fineness are the two chief factors which are used. There is also the stretch and life the fiber possesses, which is very important; and its strength. Of course all those things are influenced not only by the breed of the sheep, but also by the feed conditions to a large extent. Another factor which is very important is the shrinkage of the wool. That is one argument which is always coming up between the sheep man and the wool buyer, especially after the sheep man becomes informed and thinks he knows a little about shrinkage. The tendency has been in the past for all wool buyers to allow not only for the grade of the wool, but also for the shrinkage. They allow about ten per cent shrinkage in their favor, and it is very hard to figure how much they gain by the grading. All wool is sold not so much by grade, but by clip. They take your wool and value it largely by the larger portions you have in the clip. For that reason a lot of. work along grading lines needs to be done. We have been working on the measurement of wool in order to get a grading system. We have not come to any definite conclusions as yet. Length is one factor that has definite measurability, arid we can make definite standards. Some other factors are not so definitely measurable — for instance, the luster or the stretch and the breaking strength. You have to have moisture and temperature control for the last two, and that is not practicable for ordinary purposes. The United States government has also matched up sets of grades based on diameter; but their measurements are not the same as ours and we have not been able to check up on them; but we are working along that line with the idea of definitely getting at a standard basis of grading by actual measurement. A man grades wool today on judgment alone. He is usually a man who has been trained in the mills and knows wool from the manufacturer's standpoint; or possibly he has been with the wool buyer of a commission house. It is like grading cattle or anything else. It is done on judgment. He gets quite expert in his judgment. On the other hand, he has nothing to check up his judgment other than the basis on which we are working. We are trying to get some - thing on which to base one's judgment. All the grading we do is by judgment, but we have a set of samples right along with us to check our judgment occasionally with standard commercial grade samples, which have been measured in our laboratory. </seg>
            <seg id="p673">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association* In regard to shrinkage, you can also get so you can estimate shrinkage quite, closely, with a little practice. Wool buyers get so they can guess shrinkage from actual contact with different clips. They know the shrinkage in a certain flock, if they have kept the same kind of sheep year after year, vill.be about the same if they have the same climatic conditions. If the climatic conditions change and we have a dry year, the shrinkage goes up on account of the greater amount of dust in the wool. The sheep do not get as much feed and there is not so much grease in the wool so it does not keep the dirt out as well as in wet years. Merino wool has a heavy shrinkage. That shrinkage is not all dirt. They look black on the outside as if they were very dirty. There is so much grease on the tip of the wool that the dirt stay? there instead of working into the fleece. You might have Hampshire wool where the wool looks cleaner, but the dirt goes clear to the skin and between all of the fibers. This fleece will give a heavier shrinkage than the apparently dirtier Merino wool. You have these two factors to consider: The dirt and the grease. If. you are going to try to judge shrinkage, it is better to look for dirt more than grease because it is more responsible for a high shrinkage. In my laboratory work with students, I can take a group of students who do not know wool from cat hair, and give them a series of samples, and in two weeks' time they will guess a series of twenty samples with not more than three per cent average error in their shrinkage estimates because I direct them what to look at and show them heavy and light shrinking wools; ' a greasy wool, and a dirty wool: Then they guess on twenty samples, and in a very short time they can guess very closely. When they start, they miss the actual shrink - age from 15 to '20 per cent, like anyone Would who is unacquainted with' wool. Of course, there are some samples that are deceiving. These samples are not used in the estimation of shrinkage. The same thing holds with fineness. That is how we begin our work in measuring in order- to train the eye to see the difference in fineness of wool. We use a small micrometer. It has a spindle that turns about and measures in ten-thousandths of an inch. They are accurate. We first used them with only the idea of training the eye to see differences in wool fineness. Later we tested them out against the microscope, which has been the standard method of measuring, and found the micrometer measured accurately, although it measures finer, than the microscope. You say it will crush the fiber. That is true to a small extent. The instrument is so delicate you cannot, turn it up too fast or it will not check on the zero point. We find the crimp and fineness are </seg>
            <seg id="p674">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture two of the main factors to pay attention to in grading wool. Of course length is another factor. You can always measure that very easily. Now the practical application of this work in the field has been with sheep culling and wool grading. Every spring we put on a sheep culling demonstration. Oregon has done considerable work along the same line, and Nevada is starting. A trained man culls these sheep on fleece weight as they come through the shearing plant, which is the ordinary method. However, you must be careful or you will keep some undesirable sheep and cull out some desirable ones if you go entirely on fleece weight and do not take body conformation into account. I think that Mr. Hill, of Wyoming, is the man who started this sheep culling work. He has culled sheep in the summer and fall and his judgment has been backed up by the fleece weights at shearing time, the next spring. It takes an exceptionally well-trained man to do that. I think there was something like a pound and a half or two pounds difference in average fleece weight between the culls and the reserves. We often give grading demonstrations at shearing time in order to acquaint the sheep man with the methods of grading and find out what the whole flock grades; and give them an idea based on grade and shrinkage of what their whole clip is worth. This is rather ticklish business because the commercial man will say the samples are not big enough to estimate the shrinkage of the whole clip. From a relatively few tests, we have found our method of sampling has beei&gt; a fairly good index of the wool which was sampled. We are planning now on a project to cover the same field. What is the best method of sampling for shrinkage? Do you have to take a whole bag— -500 pounds — or will a composite sample of five pounds be accurate enough? How should that sample be taken? Several methods have been used in the past, but the com - parative accuracy of these different methods has not been tested out. That is one thing we hope to do within the next few years. I expect you will be interested in types of wool in different breeds of sheep, and their adaptability to this section. There are three or four distinct types of sheep, classified according to wool: Long, medium, fine, and a subclass called the demi-luster wools. Then of course there are the cross-bred types of wool. These usually are.on a Merino foundation or some other breed with a medium or long wool top cross. The long wool breeds are the Lincoln, Leicester, and Cotswold. In the west the Lincoln and Cotswold have been used considerably, particularly in Wyoming, for crossing on range ewes. Fifteen years ago a market for mutton developed. Then they started to look for some sheep to cross on Merinos. It happened they </seg>
            <seg id="p675">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association used the Cotswold to begin with. It Is not as good a sheep to use as the Lincoln has later proved to be. It does not produce as much wool, and it Is not nearly as good a wool, because it mats together at the base. The Lincoln has a longer and more lustrous wool, and the individual staples can be par ed to the skin. It does not mat together. A good many cross-bred Cottwold fleeces come into the Wyoming wool laboratory. Last spring on i came in that would grade as a reject because it was matted together. You could not tear it apart with your fingers. When it goes through the combs at the factory, it tears them to pieces. That is one thing the Cotswold cross has done. That showB up even today, although they have not used Cotswold for years. The Lincoln is probably the best cross. Range sheep men have found it out by experience. The Lincoln has an exceedingly heavy fleece and lots of grease.- If you cross a Hampshire on a Merino or a Ratnbouillet the wool becones open and fluffy and has no oil, and it is not o£ so much commercial value. On the other hand, when you cross a Lincoln with them, the resultant crossbreds have plenty of length, exceptional weight, and the wool is dense on the body in contradistinction to the other, and has plenty of grease. We must watch carefully in our range country, the amount of grease in the wool. If you have too much, the shrinkage is too heavy and the wool is not long enough. The more Merino or Rambouillet blood, the shorter the wool becomes. I can take a good Rambouillet ewe . with *ool two and one-half inches long and run her on the range a few years and the wool gets so short you can hardly pick it up off the shearing floor. ■ ' ' Some of theni have been using the Hampshire because they get exceptionally fine lambs, but they are paying attention to mutton only and do not get very good wool. Around Casper is the region where they use the Black Face rams, and the wool clip is the lightest of any in the state. That shows what using medium wools will do tc the wool clip. The shrinkage is also very heavy. On the medium wools I will not spend so much time. They are adaptable to farm conditions. Of these, the Shropshire has been the leadihg breed in the United States, chiefly because the large farms throughout' the middle west have Shropshires. They are the most idfial combination for mutton and wool, under farm conditions. They are not good enough rustlers and their wool is too open to go on the range. Now, the Southdown is a farm sheep adaptable to farm conditions. They need lots of care and plenty of good feed. The Oxford has been used to some extent on the range, but has not proved successful. They are too big and do not give the same solid mutton conformation as the Lincoln, and' have much poorer wool, because it Is of the same type as the Hampshire and other medium wooled breeds. </seg>
            <seg id="p676">Rkport of Neiiraska State Board of Agricui.TURK In the demi-luster type of wools, there are two breeds: The Cheviot and the Romney. The Cheviot has not been used much in this country. The Romney has been used to a large extent, but has been discarded in favor of the Lincoln. The chief reason is that the Romney cross did not do as well in a range country as the Lincoln cross. There are two other breeds which have recently been developed from the cross breed types — the dual-purpose breeds of sheep. The Corriedale has elecited a lot of favor, but the chief objection to it has been caused by its lack of uniformity. It is a new breed, and there have been so many breeders working with them, each breeder' with a different idea of type; so of course you have many different types. But they have given wonderful success when using them as a cross on native ewes. I was much impressed with Corriedales four years ago in Arizona when the range sheep men brought their sheep to the Salt River valley for the winter. They had been using Hampshire rams to get their early lambs for a number of years. Their idea is to sell all of the lambs. They tried out the Corriedale and the lambs were larger than the Hampshire at the same age. At the same time they had a good half-breed sheep and could keep as many ewe lambs as they wanted to for replacement. If they replace with the Hampshire cross - bred ewe lambs they will get into trouble because of the open wool, the black face and the black fibers appearing quite often in the wool. So the Corriedale has proven to be a rather profitable and popular ■ sheep. But you must watch for uniformity and cull constantly with that in mind and be very careful in picking your rams.. Sheep production is a large subject to cover. I know I have not touched much with actual production. I have covered the main breeds, and the commercial grading of wool. I have a few notes on sheep cycles. Nowadays this has become a popular study. Whether or not there Is anything in it, you can forecast sometimes, and sometimes you can't, as the market goes down and up. Over a number of years, I have here the figures. Sheep population has increased and decreased. From increase to decrease over a period of years has been seven to ten years. The last top in sheep population was in lfllfl. Then it went down. In 1922 it dropped away down. Then again in 1925 the last drop occurred and now it is goin? up again. Wyoming's sheep population has been on the increase since 1923. Colorado is up to third place now. Texas is the leading slate. Then the sheep population decreases and increases every seven to ten years. The prices are more flexible. It has been nine to ten years between the high and low price. The last low price was in 1920 and 1921. Now it has been increasing. It is hard to tell how </seg>
            <seg id="p677">Neihiaska Potat) Improvement Association long it will go up. Some say it will break next year. It broke last year for the lamb feeders in Colorado.' Some contracted the lambs for ten and one-half cents and kept them for three or four months ' and sold them at eleven cents They must have a larger margin than that. No one can tell exactly how it will go. Sheep population in - creases and decreases according to demand. After the war, the market dropped. During the war it went up. Now it is going up again. When the sheep population gets up to a sufficient point where it is a drug on the market, the price will go down again. I have made rather a general, talk on wool. I shall be glad to answer any questions, becaus; I realize I have not covered the entire &amp;ub.iect. " . "WHAT CAX'T IE POXE WITH HOUSES?" • MR. M. B. POSSON Extension Specialist in Animal Husbandry, College of Agriculture, Lincoln, Nebraska. Horses, as they always have been, are going in the future to be a very important link in our! farm program. There has been quite a tendency to drift away from horse power. I attribute this fact to ' the natural advance of big farming. Most men who farm two hundred acres are farming it better iand with bigger machinery than a few years ago. I think we are gradually getting to the place where we like to do big things; and if we are on one side of the fence turning over two furrows and see the fellow on the other side turning over five, we begin to wonder why we too can't turn five. That is probably the reason why some men have gone to the big tractor outfit.. I believe it is more for that reason than for the fact that they would rather drive a tractor than horses. I do not believe the average mau Cares more for a good tractor than for good , horses. It is because he thought- he could do more work with the tractor than with horses. This condition is due to the fact that we have not had the proper hitches to handle big horse units. I am not going to talk in favor of horses. I do not have to. It would be like a man standing up in a dairy community talking in favor of good cows. They do the arguing for themselves. We cannot take advantage of horse power unless we know how to use horses. A man. may say, "There is a job on my farm that can't be done with horses." It is not necessarily a fact because he says it. He believes it, but that does not make it a fact either. There is NO job on the farm that can not be done with horses. Down around Alliance there are a number of men carrying on big unit jobs successfully and economically with horses. A lot of fellows have the Idea that if you hitch twelve horses you are putting </seg>
            <seg id="p678">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture yourself in a position where you are liable to have a runaway. If properly hitched, there is no more danger than with two. On a ranch this side of Alliance we had a big hitch demonstration. The boys were deathly afraid to hitch twelve horses because they had had a runaway with an eight-horse breast hitch the year previous. They thought twelve could not be driven. After they were shown some of. the main principles in hitching up a big team, they were entirely sold on the idea and drove twelve without the least difficulty. This matter of big teams is more a question of what a man wants to do than anything else. If he makes up his mind to haul three discs across the field with one team, he can do it. If you want to sit behind a four-horse team, you can do it. If you want to sit behind a twelve-horse team, you can do that also. ;.,... - .. ■:./-;:;... :^;; ..■ \ : ;:^p.-..-: .;:■;•_; ■ Fig 8— The eight horse tandem disc hitch. I know a man who said his neighbors laughed at him when he said that he would do as much work with horses as they could with tractors. They thought it a joke. For the past six years he has done that very~thing and has been one of the most successful men In the community. He made up his mind that he wanted to do it. After he got that in his head, it was easy. The big team proposition may be handled in several ways. Some men handle fourteen or sixteen horses with three or four sets of lines. The more lines you have, the more danger you are getting Into. I do not want to talk about forty horse teams. I think the thing to do is to start with small teams. In eastern Nebraska, the men </seg>
            <seg id="p679">- Nebraska Potato Impbovement Association are not interested in more thin ten horses. They are interested in six, eight, and ten-horse hitches. Out here they are interested' in larger hitches. I talked to several men at this meeting who said they were planning on using silxteen-horse hitcheB. The idea when using a big learn is to have a team in the lead that controls it. The othsr horses are merely led into line. You can work green horses in a big team more easily than in a two- or three-horse team. The idea is to hitch them so they are under perfect control, then. you do not need to pull your arms off. I will outline a few of the most simple hitches. I can not show every one of you how to hitch these horses. There is no need of it, because you are all good drivers. If you'knaw the principle, it is easily developed. You can hook to implements of any size or number. Mr. Peak has been working with us during the past year. We were in southern Nebraska. In Nuckolls county, Fred Kelly said, "I would like to put two big discs on these fields and put a man behind two discs, but I can'jt do it." He added, "It would mean a lot in dollars and cents." Hje thought the limit was one man on one disc, and he was cussing the implement dealers because they did not put out a disc forty feet wide. (Laughter.) Those are the things that open up the possibilities of this big team work. One of the most important things is not that you work a lot of horses. It is that you save the ones you already have and give them a better chance to serve you. There is a lot of difference whether a horse is pulling with his trace at right angles to his shoulder, or at. some other angle. If you adjust the draft properly so that it is at right angles, you will have less trouble from sore shoulders and necks than where the draft is improper. Five or six horses can do the work of eight if hitched . properly. You can take two hitches of different kinds and put your hoj-s.es on one hitch and kill them off in a few days. You can take the same horses and hitch another way and they will do the same work easily. You must watch' side draft, which is the biggest horse - killer we have. Many commercial hitches have a great deal of side draft which puts sores on the shoulders of horses. The most simple hitch you see out here is four horses abreast on a plow. I saw a dozen outfits like that across this table land last year. Such a hitch throws approximately one hundred pounds of side draft on the team. You can take the same plow and put two pairs tandem and you will immediately notice the difference in the way the horses walk off with it. At a demonstration near Alliance one man told me he had been working six horses abreast on a gang plow. We stretched them out tandem for him on the same plow and he said as quick as he started the team that they walked off more freely. They did that because he got away from side draft. </seg>
            <seg id="p680">Rkport of Nebramka State Boakd of Aoricii.tire The system of tying in and bucking back the horses is the whole secret. Let us take the four-horse tandem hitch. A man might say, ■ "How in the world will I handle that bunch with four lines?" If this team gets too far ahead, it will pull the whole load, and if this team gets too far back, it will pull the whole load. This problem has been solved by a tying-in and bucking-back system. In this county next spring I think we will have some demon - strations. If you are interested, get in touch with Mr. Biedermann. You can drive almost any number of horses with one pair of lines. In fact, if you use more than one pair lines, you are complicating things. The fewer lines you use, the better off you are. We use a pair of lines on the lead team. This team is the control team. When you speak to (hem they move up and lead the next horse in line which _— . _ -.;-••, •• ■ . . .

As the lead chains tighten, all the other horses move also. That takes care of going forward. What do you do to keep the team from getting too far ahead? You buck them back. The buck strap is the rope that goes over the horse's neck and snaps into the bit. Put a buck strap on each horse. The buck strap fastens to the draft chain. If a horse goes beyond the point where this buck strap becomes tight, he must pull the machine win his mouth. He is tied to the horse ahead with a lead chain. He is bucked back to the draft chain, and he has the whole weight of the implement behind him. He is under absolute control; That is the principle on which these big teams are hitched. Any of you who saw the demonstration at Alliance know how nicely it worked. </seg>
            <seg id="p681">Nkuuakk a Potato Improvement Association ■ You can take three four's and line them up behind a lead team of two horses and make a fourteen horse team. If the lead horses swing a foot, the other horses swing also. One man said, "The reason I am afraid of these big teams is that I have no team that would make a good lead team." You don't need a good lead team. Take a team that is well broken so that if you speak they will start moving. If that team goes at the rate of two miles an hour, every horse must go at that gait. If one horse is getting out of line, tighten his, buck strap. If a horse is lazy, tighten his lead strap and he! must walk in line. In Saunders County a man said, "I will give any one twenty-five dollars who will work that mule and keep it in place." Mr. Peak said, "That mule will walk up." He put a lead strap on him and tied it to the horse in front. The mule shook his head the first round, but the second round he was right up in place. He hail to work there or get his jaw pulled off. You can work fast or slow .horses. It makes no difference. Can you blame a red-blooded Nebraska boy or hired man who gets' tired sitting behind four horses? I think a boy loses a lot of ambition if he has to go over a 160-acre field with an eight-foot disc. It is a mighty slow proposition. If he can drive a four horse team on an eight foot disc, he can drive an eight horse team on a tandem just as easily. Most boys like livestock. If we are going to interest these boys and keep them on the farm, get them outfits they can cover ground with. If you analyze the reasons why you are using big motor outfits, that is one reason. I think there are two or there, outfits especially adapted to" western Nebraska. I think the four horse tandem hitch — two in front of two— is a fine hitch for the one-bottom plow if you want to do deep plowing. It is the coolest hitch you can use. Every horse is pulling straight forward and has lots of freedom and will do much more work in a day. The six horse tandem hitch is just as good. Some fellow will say, "With a lot of horses strung out, it takes too much time to turn." They can be turned as readily as the smaller numbers. When they are using big teams, they will fire a man who stops a team more than once or twice during the entire half day. His directions are, "Keep that team moving." They plow one acre per horse per dayi In Nebraska the average man during one season will probably kill enough time visiting in the field with his neighbors to plow fifty acres of ground. (Laughter.) Another hitch I think you can use to fine advantage is four behind and four in the lead. This team of eight horses will handle an eight-foot tandem dies or two eight-foot single discs; or you can put another four horses on land run an eight-foot tandem disc with an eight-foot dHll behind. . ■ </seg>
            <seg id="p682">Report of Nebraska State Boabd of Aoricultube The best combined hitch I know for a sixteen foot combine 1b the eight horse hitch — four and four. Some fellows say a combine calls for a tractor. Maybe it does. If you think so, that is your privilege. Did you ever stop to think though that the hardest place for your tractor to pull is where your combine Is doing the heaviest work? In the damp low places is where your tractor must move with more speed. You can pull a team down until they are going very slowly where grain is heavy and you can speed them up where grain is light. I think it means quite a little In the life of a combine. A lot of men are using big outfits. Why? Because horses are cheap. They can raise the "gasoline" on the farm to feed the horses. It is a better proposition to buy gasoline from yourself than to buy it from an oil company. Twenty per cent of the grain produced In the United States is fed to working animals. There are a lot of reasons like that which justify the use of horses, especially If you already have them. You have the horses. Use them. Discussion Q. How long would It take a man to hitch up twelve horses twice a day? A. It would depend a great deal upon the sort of harness you are intending to use. In the big team country with eighteen and twenty-four horse units, they figure a teamster during the day in getting his horses ready, hitching and unhitching, takes a total of an hour and thirty minutes for an eighteen horse outfit. You can not do it with the big heavy harness we have here. We do not need half the harness we are using on the farm with these outfits. The simplest kind of harness is best. Some of the biggest operators us* 1 nothing more than a coHar and tugs. One man makes practically all his harness out of cow hides that he tans at home. I think this county will see a lot of the more simple kinds of harness. Mr. New - berry of Alliance is prepared to make this kind of harness. Big operators use the halter bridle — a halter with a blind. A bit is attached. Lead chains are used for the halter chains in the barn and are made of passing link chain which will not kink. A lot of things have been worked out that are time savers. Q. How do you fix on a gang plow four horses abreast and two in the lead? A. It is so much easier on your horses to work them three teams tandem. When you put four horses abreast, you have one hundred pounds of side draft. If you will work the six horse tandem hitch for one round, you will never go back to the other hitch. (Applause.)

            <seg id="p683">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association J. R. Redditt, extension specialist in poultry husbandry, College of Agriculture, Lincoln, will speak to us on growing turkeys in western Nebraska. I . . '•: TURKEY PRODUCTION IN WESTERN NEBRASKA MR. J. R. REDDITT . . College of Agriculture ■ Lincoln, Nebraska - Before going into the discussion of turkeys, I should like to comment on . poultry business generally. I want to urge we think a little bit more in terms of chickens than we have been doing. What I have in mind is that possibly we are overlooking one of the most important enterprises on the farm. I sometimes fear we know less about poultry than anything, else on the farm. That may not be true in northwestern Nebraska, but it is in other parts of the state. I feel we are not managing this poultry business as efficiently as we might. I fear we are letting the chickens manage the chicken business. How many of iis can make these hens of ours sit when we want them to? We can not do it. I feel if we are going to make the most of this chicken business, it is necessary we take over the manage - ment of it. We must know when these chickens are hatched, because on this depends the profit we will make. When we depend on the hens to do this setting and hatching, we can not know when they will hatch. Apparently this hen has her own notion of when she is going to set. Nothing we do will change it. I believe most of you will agree when we look into the chicken businr * we find invariably it is the early hatched pullets that make the n st money. It is only the early hatched ones that lay much durint the winter. If they do not mature before it gets cold, they do not lay much until spring, which makes them practically a year of age before they have been anything but an expense. If a chicken has not more than paid for Its keep by the time it Is a year old, we do not believe it is worth bothering with. I think if we are going to go into this poultry business with the idea of making the most out of it, we must adopt the recommendations of the people on the western coast. They are telling the people to raise four hundred, or forty — forty, if just raising enough for their own use; and four hundred if producing a surplus. In raising four' hundred, they find themselves justified in using artificial equipment. We would not recommend you have a lot of incubators and brooders with forty hens. If you had four hundred, I believe you would pro - duce enough to make the venture worth while. </seg>
            <seg id="p684">Rkport of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Give a little more consideration to this poultry business. We think it is one of the most profitable things on the farm. We know it is one of the highest quality food products on the farm; and not only that, but we know it is one of the highest priced products on the farm; so it is one of the most profitable. I believe there are good reasons t'oi producing and giving more attention to poultry. We find actually less attention is given to chickens than almost anything else. We seem to know less about chickens than anything else. We find people do not recognize the requirements of the fowls. Because they do not know these requirements they are unable to meet them in a way that is going to be profitable to them. We urge you learn more about the possibilities of the chicken business and make a real effort to meet them. When we have done this, we will know where to place the blame. As things are now, very often if you have poor luck hatching, you blame the man who sold the incubator, or the- chickens, or the feed, or the brooder; and very often the fault may be found at nonie. This reminds me of a story. A fellow went to sleep in a hotel lobby, and a friend rubbed Limburger cheese in his mustache. He awoke and smelled this odor. He walked around the lobby, and the longer he smelled, the madder he got. Finally he went out. of the hotel and walked several blocks, and when he returned he was madder than ever. His friend met him and said, "What's the matter? Aren't you feeling well?" •No." "What's the trouble?" "The whole world stinkb." (Laughter.) Folks, I think that illustrates our attitude about the chicken business. We are blaming everybody else, when the fault is at home. I am supposed to talk about turkeys. We are not certifying turkeys yet, but Nebraska is quite a turkey-growing state and pro - ducing one of the highest quality turkeys in the eastern markets. Maybe some of you have noticed in eastern market quotations: "Ne - braska turkeys" or "Nebraska No. 1 Prime." We are producing some of the highest quality turkeys on the market, but I do not believe enough of us are. One reason for this is we do not know enough about the turkey business. There are a few things we can look into that might help to make the turkey business more profitable to us. We know we have more advantages for growing turkeys here than in lots of other sections. Sunshine is one of the most beneficial factors we can have and we have it in abundance here. We find Nebraska is about as well equipped for turkey growing as any state. Western Nebraska is better equipped to raise turkeys than eastern Nebraska and eastern Nebraska is raising some. Down in the eastern </seg>

They, have problems we do not have out here. I am thinking ot blackhead. It seems to be the big bugbear and obstacle in the way. They find they can raise turkeys in spite of the presence of blackhead. Out here we have not that, so we have advantages they do not have. As for coyotes, I do not believe we should accept them as a real obstacle. I think we cin raise turkeys in spite of coyotes. If it is turkeys, let us raise them. Different ones have already men - tioned this coyote problem. I know in other parts of the country where they have the same thing to contend with, they have corrected it. Mostly they have used dogs which have been trained to herd this turkey flock just as the shepherd dog herds flocks of sheep. I think we can do it here. Let us look into the possibilities of this turkey situation for the last few years, the poultry d apartment of the University of Nebraska has been working on this and have kept accurate data. They have found turkeys are one of the most profitable phases of the whole poultry industry. Four hundred and fifty turkeys were raised on four acres of land at a feed cost that would surprise you — not exceed - ing one dollar each, and we 1 had to buy everything. They sold for It-— j— Jlifi B&amp;P*^*^ W *^^^^S- " fljrTiMrrinnpTfflriiS I«PiralflBl^9 fiS MlSraB^SSElsKiiliils&amp;ill Fig. 10— The turkey breeding flock.

            <seg id="p686">Report ok Nkhrahka State Board of Agriculture $4.80. or a profit of $3.80. They consumed forty pounds of grain each up to market time. I can not think of forty pounds of grain bringing us much better returns than with turkeys. Another good reason for raising turkeys is the fact they are popular. If you will study its demand, you will find a constant increase in '",\e demand for turkeys. If you will study turkey production, you will find a constant decrease. There is an increased demand, and there has been an almost yearly increase in the price of turkeys. If that is not ample evidence of a demand for turkeys, I do not know what is. We are asked to raise more turkeys, and I think it would pay us (o accept that fact and go into turkey production on a little bit larger scale. You folks are doing things on big scales. If I were recommending turkey growing here, I should recommend it on a big scale like you have gone into the cattle business or anything else you have done — large enough to call for the best business manage - ment you have, not to keep a few hens and one old gobbler, but lo keep a hundred hens and raise in quantities. A man by the name of McMann in northwestern Kansas raised and sold 10,000 pounds of turkeys at 44 cents a' pound. That is $4,400. If this Kansan can do that, we can, too. There is a lady at Smart on the Northwestern who recently sold 500 pounds of turkeys. The price varied from 40 to 4 5 cents a pound. Down in Mr. Willey's community these people shipped out three carloads of turkeys, and 1 think they received 42 cents. These turkeys were bought on contract. Producers killed, picked and delivered them and received (heir checks right at the car. In a good many parts of the state folks are deriving a handsome income from the turkey business. There is a demand for them, ynd the Nebraska product is recognized as much superior to the southern turkey which is a tougher, flabby-fleshed fowl. There is not the deliciousness about it. If that is the case, I think we should take advantage of this opportunity and raise more turkrys. Let us go into it with the idea we will develop it on a little larger scale. Possibly it would pay us to forget a few of the other enterprises. I am not knocking the other industries but those- of us with equip - ment and experience and knowledge or who care to ;&gt;cquire these requisites, I think should do it. Lots of folks seem to think there is too much danger of disease. There will be trouble. If we will equip ourselves with the neces - sary facilities in the way of yards or houses or feed equipment and incubators, and incidental knowledge, I do not believe it will be such a big task, after all. The biggest difficulty is blackhead. The University folks last year ran some tests on the spread of this disease and control measures. They did one thing which makes us realize we do not have to have </seg>
            <seg id="p687">Nebraska Potato' Improvement Association a whole township for a bunch of turkeys to range on. They have proven' that is not the case. They raised, very- successfully, seventy turkeys on a lot 24x50 feet. If you will figure it out, this is about 17 square feet of space per turkey. That. makes us realize we do not have to have a whole township or county to raise turkeys. In another lot of the 98 turkeys hatched, 93 were raised. These turkeys con - sumed 418 pounds of grain; 3,229 pounds of mash, and about 2700 pounds of milk or less than 40 pounds of grain each. The milk we can get for about one-half cent per pound. The other feed we got at a total cost of about a dollar. In raising this quantity of turkeys, | ■'■ • • : " ! |: " \ ; I : '. ■. ! Fio. 11 — Clean ground is more essential than a large rangfc. Seventy turkeys were raised in a gravel covered yard 24x50 feet with a mortality of one poult during the season. we found it was not necessary to give an expensive kind of feed, or any different than we feed chickens. The use of mash is getting better results with chickens, so we are urging it with turkeys. Throughout the whole process, practically the same methods apply in turkey pro - duction that apply in poultry production. If we are successful poultry raisers, I think we will be successful turkey raisers. I should like to ask Mr. Brouse to discuss turkey raising with you, because he has. raised, this year, 300 turkeys. He is at the substation at Valentine, and his methods are those being recommended by the poultry raisers. </seg>
            <seg id="p688">Rki'okt of Nkhraska State Board ok Agrici'LTCBE MR. R. W. McGINNIS, (C. &amp; N. W. Ry., Lincoln): I think you have us all sold on turkeys. We are strong for you. The first thing, in my opinion, I think you ought to tell us, if you can. Is where we are going to get the turkey eggs to start in the business? MR. REDDITT: That is a thing we must consider as one of the first big problems. We will talk to Mr. Brouse about the poss - ibilities of the substation at Valentine going into turkey production with the idea of supplying eggs. The University will supply a few* The substation at North Platte will supply a few more. We will have to start in a small way at first. Let us not stay there. Start with any number. One good torn is good for a dozen hens. We have about thirty-five. Get a few good hens. I believe that would be the best way to start. You will find it very difficult to buy eggs, so I would suggest the most practical way would be to secure a few hens and a torn. In getting these hens, I believe you can use young hens just as well as old ones. They will lay more eggs, and the more eggs they lay, the more economical the production. If hatched tarly enough, they will be as good for breeding purposes as the old hens. MR. REDDITT: It is necessary in order to have the best results to keep turkeys and chickens separate. That apparently has been the biggest mistake most of the turkey raisers have made. This blackhead disease is present in chickens and apparently does not do any harm; but it plays havoc with the turkeys. That is ■ tha reason we found it necessary to keep the two apart. If we can keep the turkeys on the clean ground away from chickens and see they get clean feed and water, we do not have so much trouble with black-' head. We find turkey hens possess the same laying characteristics chicken hens do. Last year they had an average of one hundred eggs per turkey hen. Some were laying over one hundred, and a few a whole lot less. Apparently we may in time begin to give more atten - tion to egg production in turkey hens. We will go through the turkey flock and "rogue out" those poor layers. I want to thank you for your patience. MR. E. M. BROUSE, (Valentine Substation): Speaking of the egg supply, I am impressed by the fact you go to many a turkey raiser's flock and you will find as a rule the turkeys are left to roam over the range at will and steal their nests out — to lay a brood of eggs and hatch those eggs. I think right there perhaps can be the solution, in a measure, of this egg shortage. If these hens are handled in such a way that they can be broken from setting as we do our chickens, and get them to lay from two to four clutches of eggs, we can increase our egg supply considerably. By feeding the hena mash during the winter or early spring, you can advance their period </seg>
            <seg id="p689">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association of laying somewhat. If you can get the hens to lay by the first of March, then by the first of May you can have quite a number of eggs per hen. Even If you have to hatch eggs laid the latter part of May, you are still getting them hatched early enough to put the pullets on the Christmas market. At the station at Valentine the past four years we have been doing some turkey work. We started with six eggs that my mother - in-law happened to send . up to us. From that we have grown in numbers until this year we are raising three hundred. We had set our goal at five hundred poults, but missed the niark due to various reasons. Turkey eggs should not be held over a period of ten days. We wanted to hatch with artificial methods one-half our production and raise them in the brooder, so that it was necessary to hold quite a number of eggs a longer period than for best hatchabllity. This year we are increasing our flock so that in the spring we will have enough eggs laid in a Week's time to fill an incubator and hatch and brood the poults artificially. One of the greatest problems with using the hen is that it is hard to watch them in the early spring to keep the eggs from chilling; and during the latter part of the season when the weather gets dry we have had a low per cent hatch due to low humidity. It can be overcome a little by visiting the nests and adding moisture. I do not know as the question of humidity has been entirely settled. We do find eggs set earlier in the season hatch better than those set later. If you can) crowd your turkey hens for early pro - duction, you are going a long, way towards getting a large percent of hatch.. • This year we raised in the brooder house about 85 per cent of the turkeys put in. ,A large number of those were lost by carelessness. You must havje every corner in your brooder house rounded, with not even a 2x4 that sticks out. We had trouble with the turkeys crowding in corners. One night we lost seven between six and seven o'clock.. They crowded against a 2x4. Another time I left a kettle in the brooder house. The next morning I found fifteen in that. We are learning by experience that you must be careful to remove all methods by which a turkey can commit suicide. (Laughter.) They are worse than other kinds of fowls in this respect. If there is anything they can jump into and can't get out, that is what they want to do— whether a water tank or a barrel or an old tin can. Those things must be watched during the early stages of the poult's life. In fearing poultry, I know Mr. Redditt has told you the chicken method is the one they use at Lincoln for turkeys. That is what we use. Peed mash throughout the entire growing period with the poultry. We raised one-half the flock under artificial methods, and the other one-half we let run with the. hens. The loss was greater </seg>
            <seg id="p690">Rkpobt of Nehkaska State Hoard of Agricultubk r* with the hens than under artificial methods. The coming year we expect to increase our artificial equipment and handle most of them that way. The turkeys getting bran, corn chop and mash, and some - times shorts, will keep in better condition than if allowed to run at large; in fact, we have lost less from blackhead in our flock that was raised artificially than we did among those that ran at large. That may seem contrary to our common belief. Keeping a turkey in good physical condition is a long step toward enabling it to combat blackhead. The turkey may be infected, but it is able to resist the disease to the extent it will get to the market in good condition. The per cent of death loss has not been high where proper feeding and sanitation methods are followed. I will be glad to talk turkey to any of you individually. If Mr. Reddit and I both can not convince you, we shall probably call in some one else. (Applause.) (X)I?.\ PRODUCTION IX NORTHWKSTKRX NEBRASKA P. H. STEWART Extension Agronomist, College of Agriculture I am glad to have (his opportunity to talk to you on corn pro - duction altho I do not know that there is anything new I can say to you. It seems to me that you are practicing in this part of the state, at least to a great extent, the very things that I might talk about. One thing I would like to emphasize is the value of corn in Western Nebraska. I believe that we can profitably increase our corn acreage to quite an extent and that, is the very thing you are doing. One lias only to travel through Western Nebraska, or to look at statistics on the corn acreage and distribution to see that corn is gradually working westward. I believe the biggest factor in increasing corn production in Western Nebraska and similar locations is the fact that wp have learned to work with Nature rather than to fight against her. The point that I wish to make is this. Some ten years ago I was county agent in Kimball County at a time when a great many farmers were moving in from Eastern Nebraska and Iowa. These men, or at least a part of them, insisted on bringing seed corn from back home. You know what happened. If they selected the ears that matured, they found that when they had done this for a few years, the ears became shorter and shorter, the kernels more shallow, the stalks shorter, and the ears lower on the stalk. Being accustomed to Eastern Nebraska or Iowa corn, they often looked upon such corn as being "run out," and being dissatisfied with the appearance of the </seg>
            <seg id="p691">Neiiraska Potato Improvement Association adapted corn, they, in a good many- cases, sent back East for more seed corn. They were fighting against Nature rather than cooperat - ing with her in the development of adapted seed corn. We undoubt - edly made a big step in the production of corn in the Western part of Nebraska when we learned to cooperate with Nature and pick out the type of seed that best suited the conditions. Let us see for a moment what has been happening in crop pro - duction in Dawes, Sheridan, and Box Butte Counties during the past eight years. During the 4-year period of 1922-1925, the acreage of corn in these three counties has Increased over the acreage grown in the 4-year period of 1917-1920, 68 per cent; winter wheat 140 per cent; spring wheat 28 per cent; oats 56 per cent; barley 51 per cent; while rye has. decreased 51 per cent. Although corn has shown a big increase it has not kept pa.ce with winter wheat. The per cent of increase does not tell the whole story unless we know what acreage was grown, during the first 4-year period or the per cent of grain land in wheat, oats, corn, and so on. This is shown by the following table: TABLE I. Average Per Cent of Grain Lund in Each Cereal Crop in Dawes, IJox Butte; and Sheridan Comities Period Corn Winter Spring Oats Rye Barley Wheat Wheat 1917-1920 39% 4.5% 21.7% 17.2% 13.5% 4.1% 1922-1925 45% 7.5% 19.1% 19.2% 4.6% 4.2% Practical farm experience supplemented with experimental work shows that corn and winter wheat make the most profitable grain combination in all of western Nebraska where winter wheat does not 'winterkill. There are several good reasons why more corn should be grown in western Nebraska. In the first place corn is a good crop from the standpoint of the crops which follow it. Experiments have shown that all grain crops do be_tter after corn than after any other grain crop. Winter wheat will yield more following corn than following winter wheat, oats or barley and the same is true of oats. The reason for this seems to be that corn does not dry out the soil as" much as small grain crops which is to the advantage of the crop that follows. Corn, if kept clean, is a good weed eradlcator, which is a point of considerable importance. I have seen in parts of western Nebraska where winter wheat had been grown almost exclusively for several years, fields thatwere almost completely covered with Jim Hill Mustard In order to control this weed, it is necessary to either summer fallow or grow a crop of corn. </seg>
            <seg id="p692">Retort ok Nehbahka State Boarii of Auriciltubk Where one is growing a large acreage of winter wheat, it is rather difficult to grow an equal acreage of corn which would be necessary if one were to drill winter wheat into the corn land. Prob - ably large wheat growers will not attempt to do this but will rely more on summer fallow. A number of men in western Nebraska are following out the plan of planting corn in every other row thus making it possible to tend the corn with larger machinery and to use a 7-foot drill in seeding the wheat. This -plan seems to deserve a wider trial in western Nebraska counties. Because corn adapted to western NebrasKa conditions has small pars produced low on the stalk, the harvesting of the crop is rather disagreeable. It would seem, however, that hogs and cattle could be used more than they are to harvest the corn crop. Let them do the work, and while they are doing it, they will be making good gains. It would be hard to think of a better combination than alfalfa or sweet clover, which grows so abundantly in western Ne - braska, together with a good field of corn to "hog off." Because most of the Western Nebraska farm land is level and the soil easy to work, large machinery may be used to a very good advantage. Corn can be tended with much less labor per acre and altho the acre returns will likely not be as large as in eastern Nebraska, they are likely to be very satisfactory from the standpoint of the investment per acre and the returns for the time spent in' raising the corn. Figures secured in the Nebraska 10-acre corn yield contest are very interesting from the standpoint of labor costs, yields, cost per bushel and profit per acre in growing corn in different parts of the state. The plan of the corn yield contest is simply this: A farmer enters a field of at least 10 acres. He keeps a record of his labor during the season and at the end of the year the yields of the fields are checked up. He also gives a detailed report of the ■ cultural methods used. Man labor is figured at 30 cents per hour and horse labor at 20 cents per hour which also includes the cost of machinery depreciation. Rent was figured as 2/5 crop rent in eastern Nebraska and 1/3 crop rent in western Nebraska. Corn was figured at 60 cents per bushel. Husking was figured at 10 cents per bushel. Table II gives a summary of the contest for the past 2 years. </seg>

It will be noticed that western Nebraska farmers raise an acre of corn -with about one-half the man labor and a little over half the horse labor required in eastern Nebraska. This is due to the fact that larger machinery is used in the west, weeds cause less trouble, and the soil is relatively easier to till. Corn can be grown a good deal cheaper if listed than where It is surface planted and altho the surface planted corn may outyield the listed when the labor of growing the surface planted corn Is considered the lower yielding but less costly listed corn may prove to be the most profitable. This is indicated by a summary of eastern Nebraska results in the 102 6 contest as given in Table III.

Altho his corn yielded 3 bushels less than contestant No. 54, his profit per acre was $2.93 more. • • It must be remembered, however, that where one uses large machinery the investment is greater and it must be used a good deal to. make it profitable. This usually means that it must be used on more than one crop rather than to use it only on one crop and then allow it to stand idle the rest of the year. This is one more argument for diversified farming' or the growing of a reasonable acreage of corn along with wheat and other small grains. The matter of a supply of good, viable, adapted seed corn of the correct type, as has been .mentioned, is a- matter that needs more attention in all of western Nebraska. I have, just finished judging the corn show held in connection with this meeting where I found that of the corn on exhibit only samples which were selected early will grow. Due- to the very cold weather in late September, this year, the seed corn situation in the western end of Nebraska is serious. In -early October I helped Mr. Biederman, the Dawes County Agri - cultural Agent, husk out a variety plat of corn on the farm of Mr. Goodman. Out of six varieties, we found only one with ears that would grow. I have been out here in western Nebraska more or less for the past 10 years. I do not know of a single year when any man who had good seed corn could not have sold several hundred bushels at a profitable price. In Kimball County our annual problem every spring was to. get enough good seed corn to supply the demand. That is the case more or less in all of western Nebraska. I believe that there is a chance for a dozen men in every western Nebraska county to specialize on seed corn, to develop a good type of adapted seed and to offer this to the public at a reasonable and yet a profitable "price. We should forget the eastern Nebraska (ype of corn. It will not do for western Nebraska. We are all inclined to look toward corn raised under more favorable conditions for our seed. Perhaps the corn shows have caused this trouble. For instance, at the Inter - national Grain and Hay Show large deep-kerneled, rough corn from very favorable corn growing sections of Indiana usually wins the grand champion prize. Eastern Nebraska farmers reading of this are tempted to buy seed of that sort of corn which does not yield nearly so well as their own medium-smooth, solid, dimple-dented type of seed. Like - wise central and western Nebraska farmers hear of corn grown in eastern Nebraska winning at Lincoln at various shows and fairs and buy seed of the exhibitor. This is, of course, a mistake. The best seed for any community is, in . all probability, seed which has been grown for several years by] good corn men in that community. The </seg>
            <seg id="p696">Rkpokt of Nkhraska State Board ok Aukicui.tukk development of local supplies of good seed by careful growers will do much to increase the profit from growing corn in western Nebraska. 1 thank you for your attention. MOHK MONKY KROM SMALL GRAIN CHOI'S MR. LEROY D. WILLEY County Extension Agent Sidney, Nebraska Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: At the start of this talk, 1 want you to understand I am not boosting for any more wheat in the United States. We usually have too much of it. What I have In mind is more bushels per acre. For instance, it costs, according to the Department of Agriculture and according to government auth - ority, from around eight to twelve bushels of wheat per acre to produce an acre of wheat. Suppose it costs twelve bushels and you get thirteen, that is only one bushel left for your net profit. With just a little effort you can get another bushel, and that is twice as much net profit per acre. In my county we have increased this net number of bushels by a little extra labor in a few cases. I think we can get five or. six bushels additional on an average over the county by a little extra effort. Some people think they should plant 800 acres and spread their labor so thin they get just about the cost of production. The thing to do is to apply what seems to be as much labor as you can profitably apply to that acre and get those extra bushels. It does not make any difference what you are working at, it is the extra above the cost of production you are after. There is a limit to how much labor you can profitably put on to an acre of ground with any particular crop. Nobody knows what the limit is. He must learn it by experience. We have another source of information which I think is used too little, and that is our experiment station data. Sitting down to read it, to the ordinary farmer it is a little bit dry, and some of it must be taken with a grain of salt. In the main, it is far more reliable than any data you can get because they are keeping records from the beginning of that experimental year to the end. That is what very few of us are doing. Therefore we can use their data to considerable advan - tage and profit. Another thing: back 20 or 30 years ago it was not necessary to keep data on anything. They produced what they ate, and ate what they produced. But times have changed. If a man is going to get that last unit of production, he must keep a record of exactly </seg>
            <seg id="p697">' . Neiirahka Potato Imi-kovkmext Association what it costs him to do that — either a commodity record or else a complete farm record. I think the latter is necessary or he may have a certain opinion but no records to back it. What value is the opinion unless you have some definite figure to back it up from beginning to end ? Therefore I would recommend as one item in reducing cost of production, a record as to what you are doing, or have done. I shall talk mostly on winter wheat. We are more interested in that than any other one thing in our county. I am more familiar with Cheyenne County than some of the other counties. These are experiences I have had or have observed. In preparation of the soil, the practice among the better farmers is to. disc that land early — as soon as it is in condition in the spring. There are three or four objects in doing this. We are bothered ' with insects considerably — various kinds of cut worms and grass - hoppers. If the land is cultivated early in the spring or late In the fall, you will upset the egg stacks of these insects and have less bother from them. Another thing; early discing will provide early germination of weeds. Also— and this is contrary to what Professor Russell gave you yesterday, but I think I can explain it later — it conserves moisture. ■ For instance, on wheat stubble land. ■ If you do not disc it before the time in June when you do summer till plowing, it gets too dry to plow. If you do disc, the time of plowing in June is extended so that there must be more moisture caught, or more moisture saved, due to early spring discing, because the plowing time for summer tillage is extended- where you do disc. Suppose you disc early in March. You have also accomplished ithe early extermination of the major portion of the weeds in that soil, or the early germination of weed seeds. If in May just previous to corn planting, or in late April, you disc again, you get rid of a lot of the weeds and invite further weeds to come up. You will plow the land in June after corn planting and have most of the weeds exterminated. Your weed problem for the year is pretty well handled. Suppose you had let the land sit there, with no discing and W.hen the time came to plow, plowed. There are three things you will run up against. If you have heavy stubble, you will not have as good a seed bed as you would have due to two previous discings. They would have mixed the stubble up through the soil. Another thing is you will find on undisced stubble land when you come to plow It, it is quite a job. It dries out too soon. For a week there is fine plowing, and then it quits. There is too short a season during which we can plow In "western Nebraska. That is the thing that is causing so many farmers in our country to stubble back some of them two or three times. </seg>
            <seg id="p698">Kwokt of Nkiikaska Statk Boakii of Agkicii.ttUk Let us take summer tillage. We have entirely too many weeds on summer tilled land in our country. If we can just save the moisture that goes through those weeds and put it through the crop, I believe it would more than pay for the cost of removing those weeds in wheat produced. This last year there has been a lot of interest shown in that very thing. Heretofore farmers have used a disc and a harrow to get rid of the weeds on summer tilled land, and they have been objectionable implements in some cases. A disc runs too deep and destroys your seed bed. A harrow fines the soil too much, and the wind comes along and your soil is blown to eastern Nebraska or into Colorado. So this last summer half a dozen machines or more were devised and brought in, the purpose being the economic control of the weeds on summer tilled lands. I will mention two or three of these. One is the Oregon rotary weeder. -It has a square bar- that runs parallel to the ground, and it is attached to three or four beams similar to plow beams, and attached to a tumbling rod and a sprocket wheel. This rod is forced into the ground an inch or so, and it rotates. The square rod rotating takes hold of the weeds and lifts them out of the soil. The fine dirt goes to the bottom and the clods on the top. It packs a firm seed bed. After you have been over the ground with this machine, when stepping on it, it is firm under your feet. You have gotten rid of the weeds and you have conserved the moisture. Those are the objects we should have. Unless the weeds get too large, this implement will control them. Immediately after a rain storm it some times will not control them. If the weeds are wet they will wrap around the rotary rod and you will have trouble. If applied when the weeds are small, it will control them. That implement costs too much money it seems. That is the objection to it. The farmer has too many implements, anyway. I should like to see some way devised by means of which he could cut down the number of implements necessary. This next one has been used only one year. In two towns in the north end of the county, two blacksmiths are making, from auto springs, blades to attach to the shank of harrow teeth. They put these blades, which are run at right angles, in the place where the harrow teeth were. The blades run parallel to the ground. They have those at such a position on the harrow frame that they cut the whole surface of the land. You have your tilling lever adjust - ment so that you can run these blades at any angle. Those blades can be attached to any harrow. It has been doing the work, and it also leaves the clods on top and the dust on the bottom, and firms the seed bed. Those are probably the two most practical weeders we have tested. I want to call attention to some experiments carried on in various experiment stations — government and state — in the Great Plains. This </seg>
            <seg id="p699">NkiirahkA Potato Improvement "Association data is from the Experiment Station at Archer, Wyoming. They have a duck-foot cultivator. It is an implement that was used a few years back and discarded in our county. The reason for using it is, they have a light soil that blows considerably and they must get away from that blowing. So this cultivator is used in place of other im- ■ plements. Instead- of plowing that land, this implement goes under the ground and lifts the soil enough to cause the fine dirt to fall to. the bottom and the clods to stay on top-. You know what the duck-foot shovel is — similar !to a lister shovel, only smaller. They get rid of weeds. They make it serve as a plow. In connection with this implement, they have an attachment for any Van Brunt drill. By taking off every other disc on a disc drill, they put this attachment on and plug up one hole in the drill box, making the drill holes four - teen inches apart. It has two discs, one throwing to the right and - the other to the left, making a semi-listed ridge, and the wheat is planted in the bottom. It is planted twice as thick in the row as is ordinarily done. . "You will say, "It won't control weeds. They can't cultivate them, and the weeds will come in." That is contrary to their results up there. The weeds do not come in. I was there last summer and they had a summer tilled plot, and a duck-foot furrow drill plot, and a duck-foot common drill plot, side by side. The best plot was the one .duck-footed and planted with the furrow opening drill. There was quite a pronounced dif - ference — no weeds. Those plots had been run for three years. I haven't this year's data, but I have the average of two years before. On early plowed land that was plowed for fallow in April, when you do spring plowing, and common drilled, using the seven-inch space drill, they got a yield of 7.6 bushels per acre on an average for two years. Using a furrow drill, they got a yield of 7.7 bushels per acre'. On late plowed fallow prepared in June, which is the usual time, using a common drill, they got 13. G bushels of winter wheat per acre. Using a furrow drill on June summer tillage, they got 18.7 bushels of wheat per acre — a difference of five bushels in favor of the furrow drill. On fallow land that had been prepared with the duck-foot cultivator, using a common drill, they got 12.8 bushels. Using a furrow drill on duck-footed land, they got 22.7 bushels. If - that data will hold out through a series of years, there is something in that duck-foot cultivator. . A few farmers are putting on experiments to find out whether it will hold true in our county. It is the last bushel we are after, just as the rest of you men. ; The North Platte Experiment Station, as well as several others, .show3 the 'most profitable method of growing winter wheat is after corn. They have data to back it up. They say it is more profitable </seg>
            <seg id="p700">Rkport of Nkiira.ska State Board of Agricti.tckk than summer tilled land followed by wheat. Here Is the difference they have as compared with the thing you have on your farm today. You plant your winter wheat in standing corn stalks. They cut the corn off and have bare corn land with the corn stubble, and drill. They get different results than you would using standing corn stalks. Whether it will be against you or for you I am not prepared to say, but there is a difference. All experiment stations give the yield of corn stalks as well as the yield of corn on the stalks, so they must cut them to get the yield. A thing that is happening in our county is in some communi - ties we have three or four spring wheat varieties. The farmers haul them to the elevator, and the elevator man mixes them up, and con - sequently, due to being mixed wheat, he gets a lower price than if he had been able to get a car load of any one particular variety. And everybody lost money because of mixing the wheat. I believe communities should adopt some particular variety and stick to it more or less. If you were introducing a new wheat and only six or seven are raising it, try to market your wheat at the same time so that the elevator man can put it in a particular bin and get all there is in it out of it. That is causing a loss in our county. We have one wheat variety that is either causing a loss or a discrimination on the Grain Exchange at Omaha. It looks to me as though it may be the mixing with other grades that is causing a loss of five to ten cents a bushel. That represents the difference between profit and loss. I believe com - munities should adopt some one variety so that the elevator man can co-operate with them. He has a limited number of bins. If he is going to handle three or four varieties and half a dozen grades of each, he will run out of bins. Another thing that should be looked to, is the fact it is not the producer who has the say as to what his wheat shall be used for. It is the man who uses it. That is where supply and demand come in. If the mills do not want it, there is an excess supply at a low price. If the mill wants it, there is a better price because there is a demand. It is the quality in wheat that produces the desirable loaf. Take a given amount of wheat and the protein quality should be such that it will expand with baking, making the porous loaf. It should have a wheat instead of a yellow color, and a large per cent of flour compared to the total yield of the wheat. Some wheats are low in this and others in that, and therefore that thing should be considered. Up in this community you are producing a lot of Marquis. This is my own observation. Maybe I am wrong. In September and early October mills pay a little premium on Marquis, due to the fact that it has a desirable quality of protein. Just as soon as the Canadian No. 1 Spring wheat started moving, that premium on Marquis was chopped </seg>
            <seg id="p701">" Nebraska Potato Improvement Association oft, because mills wanted Canadian wheat worse than Marquis; and it is so right now. It looks as though Marquis wheat should be marketed before the Canadian Iwheat comes on, or else you will have to wait until after the Lakes freeze up and Canadian wheat is largely used up; and probably toward spring there will be a premium paid again. This makes the farmer feel as though somebody is working against him. I do not think it is the Grain Exchange. It is the Canadian farmers, I think, because they produce a wheat with a protein more desirable than the quality in Marquis wheat. That is my observation. • I ' In our county we have an appalling amount of smut, just as you have. I think it is a common trouble in western Nebraska. That 1b a thing the good Lord — or Nature — has wished onto us, and we do not like to accept it. Is He going to wish that off of us unless we do our part in applying some means of control? Some feel that there is nothing to the control of smut. I am just as firmly convinced there is as they are that there is not. Nature plays a part, as weather conditions, the time of seeding, and the condition of the soil all con - tribute. But I think you can play a part by applying any one of three methods: (1) blue vitrol, which has largely gone out of date; (2) the formaldehyde method, which is getting out of date, but It will dc the work; and (3) copper carbonate, the dry treatment. Some are skeptical about the dry treatment because' they did not get good results with jt last year. You will not get uniformly good results, no matter what you are applying the remedy for. The doctor does not always get results, because the thing that will work on you won't on the other fellow. There is no treatment for any one thing that is perfect. It depends a lot on the man applying it. Copper carbonate must be applied thoroughly. That word "thoroughly" is the thing that has been the ' cause of more criticism than any other one thing because we had to learn what "thorough" was. I have a. different conception of it now than last year. It means more this year than last. If wheat looked like it was well coated with copper carbonate, I thought last year, that was thorough. I went to a farm south of Sidney this fall. The farmer was treating wheat in a mixer that would accommodate half a bushel at a time. He was putting a bushel in there. I looked in his wagon box and it looked like the wheat was thoroughly treated. I said, "Let's put half a bushel in and see what that looks like." We did that. We took half a bushel measure and were very accurate about It. There was no comparison between the two lots. Therefore, if I had not seen a half bushel batch of that wheat treated in that machine, I would have advised him wrongly. </seg>
            <seg id="p702">Rkport of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture On the wheat treated with one bushel in a half-bushel mixer, he will have bad results compared with the one treated more nearly right. That would be a hard thing to explain next year. That Is a thing we county agents are running up against right along. A lot of those things can not be answered a year after the treating was done. They can best be answered at the machine. At a little town east of Sidney, an elevator had a treating machine. They owned it and inviied the farmers in with wheat and copper rarbonate. It would treat forty bushels to the hour. One farmer treated three loads. With the first load, the machine was sitting on level ground, and he got good results. Some bright individual put some two-inch blocks under the front end of that machine. It wasn't treating as fast as he (bought it should. The farmer did not get such good results with this load. With the third load, they put four - inch blocks and the wheat shot right through and he got very poor results with this. If the machine had. been intended to have four - inch blocks, it would have been built that way. That farmer did not condemn anybody for that. He accepted the machine as somebody else had prepared it for him. He did not do that this year. He is controlling the smut. I do not know how many combines there are in this community, but we have lots in our county. There is a time after you begin to bind or head grain when you cair not combine — a matter of ten days or two wppks you must wait. That is when a man sweats blood.. "Our county dops not have any hall." All the rest of the counties probably do. (Laughter.) Several of our farmers were hailed out last year. How will you get around it if you are a big farmer? I saw an item in the "Denver Post" last fall that cited a wind-row method, used by the Campbell Farming Corporation at Hardin, Mon - tana, so I wrote to Mr. Campbell and asked what he meant by a wind - row method. It is simple. For the big farmer this thing might work, or for three or four small fanners who can agree to get together. It is this: As soon as wheat was in condition to cut, this man went in with four binders with the binding attachments removed, behind a big engine. On the first binder, the wheat was carried over the elevator and dropped into the wind-row. The next binder had a short apron which carried the wheat into the same wind-row. The next binder had a longer apron, and the fourth had still a longer one, and the four binder widths of wheat were carried into one wind-row. The wind-row stood for ten days or two weeks to cure. I do not know just what a wind would do to this wind-row. What is hail going to do to that wind-row of wheat? I believe it is more safe in the wind-row than standing. Cut it high. The rain can run under it for a while. Frequently it will go clear to the bottom. Mr. Campbell has rain up there to contend with. </seg>

The Department of Agriculture fifteen years ago said live stock was the foundation of success in the semi-arid areas on the dry land If you are hailed out and do not raise much crop, your live stock will carry it through. We are getting more live stock all the time We have far more hogs than I had thought. A farmer was in from near Da ton last week and he said, "I counted the hogs between my place and Dalton and there were 2500 hogs in seven miles, on both sides of the road. I can count as many hogs on another seven-mile strip going two miles south to start." There is profit in hogs or they would not have them. I believe they are doing the right thing by going into more hogs. I will open the meeting for questions. .■■ Discussion Q- I should like to ask as to the heading of grain? A. We had a lot of heading down there. Q. I had in mind as is suggested by the binder: would two head - ers be as economical as four binders? A I believe if you have headers, they are probably more prac - tical than binders. It might take fewer men to operate two headers behind an engine than four binders. The way Mr. Campbell has four binders hooked up, he had one man adjusting those four binders I could see a series, of wires running from one to the other. For'ad - justment purposes I suppose. Under your, farm conditions, maybe you can not do that. The reason I mentioned binders was because most of you have binders and not so many have headers/ It. depends on the community. • " Q. There are different methods, but we have only the old Ford - son, and we have an awful time keeping the men contented. : A; I meant to touch on the labor proposition. We have that same difficulty down there. A fellow will go to work and be a fine man for twenty-four hours or so, and then be blows up </seg>
            <seg id="p704">Report ok Nehraska State Board of Agbicitlture Q. Has anybody had any experience with automatic dump header - barges? A. We have. Q. There is a man in Tripp county north of where I live who used one this year, and he says he believes they are going to be a big success. A. This man built a header-barge or box that was a tremen - dously big box on wheels. He would head into it for three or four hours and have his stacker inside it, and have the endgate up. He would top out his stack and take the hind endgate out and let the back end of the barge down and drive off and leave a stack right there. (Applause.) He would have a flock of stacks with just a tremendously big load of headed wheat in each stack. I have not asked this man in our county who has used this barge stacker just what results he had. I know he went right along in harvest. He did not kill any time. I saw him dump one load, and it was just a matter of a minute. He removed the back endgate and drove off, and the stack slid off without any trouble. I was some distance away when it was taking place. It looked like there was no difficulty in removing it. I noticed he had trouble holding the stackers on the job. They did not like the work under those con - ditions. Q. As it happened this year — it does not every year — there wpuld be a lot of objections to either one of the two methods of handling, due to rain, as far as keeping this wheat would be concerned. We had some awful big stacks. We had an old experienced stacker and he said, "Put her up here!" Where they did, we had good stacks, with very little loss at the bottom, and none on top. With the little stacks, some would be one-third loss, which I imagine if we had any big rains would be rather objectionable. My idea was to get a method that would be easy to handle, and yet build big stacks. Q. They had stacks 30 feet wide and 60 feet long, stacked with the mechanical stacker. A. I have never seen that done. We have not any of it in our county. I thank you. (Applause.) </seg>

If I were to criticise our meetings so far, it would be on the point that a few speakers have done most of the talking. I dislike a session of this kind unless the audience does a part of the talking, because that is when we get the most out of a meeting. Now here's your chance!. In this question box meeting I prefer not to do the talking but to hold the watch on you. We can summarize our experiences here. We would like to have you give us your name and county when you speak so that we can have this information for the printed report The first question that we have here is "What variety of alfalfa shall we grow?" That is a question which is probably asked as often as any that we have come to our department. Shall we grow the Common or Grimm alfalfa? Who has tried out several different varieties and has some first-hand observations on them? What about the yield in hay? MR. WICKERSHAM, Sioux County: I have tried out Common alfalfa quite extensively, and Icossack alfalfa some. I can see but very little difference. The Common has seemed to be as leafy as the Cossack. MR. STEWART: Have some of you had trouble with winter - killing? You have your local alfalfa seed up here in this part of the state and so probably do not have as much trouble with unhardy seed as they do in Eastern Nebraska where seed is largely shipped in We have so many questions come in regarding varieties that perhaps it would be a good thing to say a word or two about them. We can classify all our alfalfa varieties in this general way. First there is what we call Common alfalfa [which is the name applied to the alfalfa brought into Nebraska from California. It was brought into California from South America, and into South America and Mexico by the Span - ish. .Most of our alfalfa in Nebraska is Common alfalfa. What the South Dakota people are selling as South Dakota 12 is Common alfalfa which was brought into the Black Hills country a good many years ago by Captain Seth Bullock. Then there is the Turkestan alfalfa introduced first about 1898. The first lots of seed brought in were found to be hardy and gave good results. At the present time there is very little coming into the United States, and what is being imported is not recommended. We also have varieties such as Grimm and Cossack in which you may be interested if you are raising alfalfa for seed. These are called Variegated alfalfas because the blossoms vary from purple to white or yellow or intermediate shades. We think they are a natural </seg>
            <seg id="p706">Kki'ort (iy Nkiihaska State Boaiih ov Agkkti.ti hi-: cross of the yellow-flowered alfalfa which grows wild in Siberia, and the Common pulple-flowered alfalfa. The variegated alfalfas are on the whole very hardy. We think they get Ibis hardiness from the yellow-flowered parent. The Grim, Cossack and Canadian Varie - gated alfahas are the most important variegated sorts. * The work at the Lincoln Experiment Station and over the state indicates that for average Nebraska conditions, Common alfalfa is as satisfactory as the Grimm or Cossack. We recommend Common alfalfa for average conditions. As we go farther north into other states, the Nebraska Common alfalfa would proDably kill out, while the Grimm and Cossack varieties would live through. There is very little difference in yield, although at the Nebraska Experiment Station the Cossack variety has yielded slightly more than the Grimm, while both of these have slightly outyielded the Common. There seems to be no differ - ance in the leal'iness of the hay, providing there are equally good stands of both. If you are raising seed and plans can be developed for certifying this, then I think more of the Grimm should be grown. From the ordinary hay standpoint, however, the Common seems to be very satisfactory. The most important non-hardy variety in the United States is the Peruvian. It does not come from Peru in South America, as the name might suggest, but is a non-hardy variety grown in Cali - fornia and Arizona largely because it recovers quickly after being cut, and therefore makes about six cuttings a year. Two years ago, one of our large Nebraska seedhouses shipped Peruvian alfalfa seed from Arizona into this state and sold large amounts of it. It is unhardy and winter-kills easily. "Is hard seed a problem in alfalfa?" is the next question we have. You know what hard seed is in sweet clover. It seems that in sweet clover much of the seed will not germinate as it seems to be impervious to moisture. Such seed is run through machines which scratch the coat of the seed so that moisture can get in, this process being called scarification. It is not unusual to have from 20 to 40 per cent of sweet clover seed "hard." MR. M. E. ADAMS, (Scottsbluff ) : My seed was tested at the sugar factory after being run through the scarifier. We got 76 per cent germination. Another lot sent in germinated 86 per cent. A third lot germinated only 25 per cent. MR. STEWART: In sweet clover we usually recommend that in winter seeding it is not necessary to use scarified seed, because Nature does that through the action of the frost. If the seed remains on the ground during the winter, it is thought that the action of the frost causes it to germinate. For seeding in the spring after about the first of April, we recommend scarified sweet clover seed. </seg>
            <seg id="p707">Neiikaska Potato Immiovkmkxt Association The proposition of hard seed in alfalfa is not yet well settled. We find hard seed in alfalfa. Alfalfa seed tested in a germinator may show a high per cent of hard seed, but field plantings may show a much better germination. It seems that we cannot in the case of alfalfa seed always depend on the germination tests to decide what we will get in the field. Some work done in Montana indicates that we do not need to worry very much about hard seed in alfalfa. MR. JAMES G. PHELPS, (Belmont). Don't you think alfalfa seed two or three years old becomes harder with age and needs to be scarified? My idea has been that the newer seed was more likely the germinate. MR. STEWART: I think it works the other way. Ordinarily the percentage of hard seed in sweet clover and alfalfa decreases with age. It is believed that scarified seed does not hold its germination, so seed - men are careful not to scarify seed that must be held over. MR. ADAMS: As I understand it, if it were scarified a year ago and put on the market this year or next, the individual buying the seed might find that the germination was very poor. MR. .STEWART: We now have the question: "What is the best method of seeding alfalfa in this part of the state?" Here is a point that should be of interest to all of you. Mr. Brouse, what is your experience at Valentine? MR. BROUSE (Valentine Substation): We have had very good results by drilling alfalfa into corn ground in the spring; and also by drilling into rye or wheat stubble about the middle of May. We have. also had good results by spring fallowing up until the middle of June, and seeding then. It looks to me as though up in this country the method of spring fallowing or summer fallowing would perhaps be about as sure as any you could follow. I have had such good results from different methods I have tried that I cannot say I have any "best" results. I have had a failure in trying to fall seed in standing corn, largely because of moisture conditions. MR. BUEHLER, (Gering). It is always easier to tell how to do it than to do it. I have found that out. In the eastern part of the state, my father was one of the first ones to start alfalfa thirty-five years ago. We had cows bloat on it and die. Later on we found out how to use it and, of course, it was a good crop. When I moved out here I was interested in alfalfa, and the first thing I did was to sow some, although the experience I have is limited. I thought it necessary to take care of it like back east, but I found out that it wasn't. It is more easily started here. I tried it with oats the first year, and had good results. Spring wheat is not as satis - factory as oats. Barley is as satisfactory, and maybe more so. Where we are located, which is under irrigation, the barley does not yield as </seg>
            <seg id="p708">Rkpokt ok Nkhkaska Statk Board m AoRiCll.TrKK well as oats. As to the rate of planting I consider ten pounds to the acre plenty. Some think ten pounds is not nearly enough and sow twenty-five pounds. I think ten pounds of good seed of good germ - ination is plenty. MR. STEWART: That would put about fifty seeds on every square foot if equally distributed. Of course, in the matter of seeding' you have to consider weeds. If the land is pretty weedy, my exper - ience has been that it is a good practice to use plenty of seed so that you can compete with the weeds. If the land is in good shape, with the weeds well killed out, you can seed less. This summer Mr. Biedermann, County Agent of Dawes County, pointed out a field of fine alfalfa which had been seeded with winter wheat as a nurse crop. Ordinarily even in eastern Nebraska we think that winter wheat is the worst nurse crop we have. I was sur - prised to see a fine field which had been seeded that way clear out here in northwest Nebraska. I think your conclusion that barley Is a good nurse crop and that Kherson oats are almost as good, is correct — winter wheat and winter rye being pretty severe on the alfalfa. We have another question that often comes up. "What about breaking up sod and seeding it to alfalfa? Is that a good practice?" MR. WICKERSHAM: I have had quite a little experience on that point. I hardly ever fail to get a stand on sod, while it is rather difficult to get a stand on the old ground. We find in my neighborhood in seeding old ground, it is best to seed in stubble. We usually broad - cast and harrow the ground. It is more difficult to get a stand on old ground than on the sod. We do not have trouble with grass coming in where the ground is broken after the first of May. We seed as soon as the breaking is done, from May first to the middle of June. My land where I have been seeding is both sandy and heavy ground. Most of it has been done on mixed soil. MR. STEWART: I think there are advantages even on both types of soil. Sod land probably contains more moisture than it will after it is cropped for a few years. Then there is the matter of weeds. They do not bother on sod. If the land is sandy the sod tends to prevent it from blowing. MR. SKAAG, (Dawes County): I have about as good luck by breaking the first year and seeding the second year. The weeds are not so bad the second year as afterwards. It is easier to get the ground in shape than the first year. I do not think grass is quite so apt to come in. At the present time I am on pretty good farm land — not irrigation, but dry-land. MR. WICKERSHAM: How do you prepare that ground the sec - ond year? MR. SKAAG: With a disc. </seg>
            <seg id="p709">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association- Mr. STEWART: ' I was interested last summer in seeing a field of alfalfa where the owner had broken out god and seeded it to alfalfa and then planted corn on it. He had practically a perfect stand of alfalfa, and what promised to be a good yield of corn. He was killing two birds with one stone. MR! WICKERSHAM: I did the same thing this summer, which was rather dry.'; I got a splendid stand of alfalfa and a good stand of corn; but it turned so dry in the fall that the corn did not ear very well. Several years ago I planted a field of alfalfa and corn that way which was partially irrigated, and I got a splendid crop of both. A MEMBER: How long has alfalfa been tried out on sod? How do the yields compare year by year? MR. WICKERSHAM: A takes alfalfa on young sod a year or two to get to yielding well. I could not see but what it kept the stand just as well as when seeded in other ways. MR. SKAAG: I think the yield is just as good on two-year-old land. I am inclined to think the first and second years give our best yields on sod seeding, taking everything into consideration. MR. WICKERSHAM: I have a question I want to ask concern - ing this "wild oats." That is our great problem with dry-land alfalfa especially in my neighborhood. It is coming in very bad and crowding out the alfalfa to a great ex ent. I should like to know if anybody has had any experience in ch cklng that wild grass. MR. STEWART: You p obably refer to a grass which is green at first and then turns a sort o bronze color. It is also called "Military Grass," or wild brome, being a wild relative of the cultivated grass Bromus inermis. It is a fall annual like winter wheat. It starts in the fall and develops seed early the next season. It Is not only a pest out here but In much of the state. MR. PHIL SHELDON, (County Agent Scotts Bluff County): I have not had experience with it. We have done a little with sprays on morning glories. I wonder whether spraying might not kill this brome grass before it seeds, and possibly not. kill the alfalfa? MR. STEWART: It would be pretty expensive and hard to handle in that way. My only suggestion would be this: Since it is a fall annual, it must produce seed in order to live over from year to year. The thing to do to eradicate it js to cut it before the seed is formed if you can. MR. WICKERSHAM: I have tried that, and it is just like cutting a field of oats or rye early. It will sprout right up— not so much as before, but plenty. MR. STEWART: The next question is "When should alfalfa be cut?" Since time is short, we will pass this except to say that if </seg>
            <seg id="p710">Report of Nedranka State Board of Agriculture alfalfa is cut too early, the tendency is to weaken it. Ordinarily we cut it when one-tenth in bloom, or when new shoots start from the crown. I think that is pretty generally followed. "Does alfalfa seed production in western Nebraska pay" and "should Nebraska alfalfa seed growers certify their seed?" are the next two questions. I thought we would have a number of seed growers here and might well discuss those two points. We have a fine seed show here this year. No doubt, some of you have exhibits. Is alfalfa seed production a big enough proposition and of enough importance to form a marketing organization and to arrange for certification espe - cially of Grimm and Cossack seed? MR. BUEHLER: We used to have a section in the western part of the Seotts Bluff County where they grew alfalfa seed. We had seventy acres of alfalfa and the rest in pasture land. For five years straight, we averaged more off seventy acres of alfalfa than for the pasture land, which was practically the same kind of land. I am a strong advocate of raising alfalfa seed. It has been in demand every year, and we have been selling it up as high as thirty cents a pound, and never less than twenty cents a pound. MR. WHITE: Might I ask if he uses the first or second crop? MR. BUEHLER: We use the second crop every time. MR. WHITE: We do not raise enough of a second crop to make seed on our table land. MR. BUEHLER: Where the water table is shallow we get a vigorous growth. MR. STEWART: Just to shdw you what the demand for good western Nebraska alfalfa seed would be, let me read you this telegram from Wayland Magee, who farms 1200 acres Jn Douglas County: "My regards and best wishes for a very fine first meet - ing of the farmers of western Nebraska. Tell them there are many eastern Nebraska farmers who want to buy hardy western Nebraska alfalfa and sweet clover seed." Eastern Nebraska farmers are anxious to buy Common alfalfa seed raised under western Nebraska conditions so as to be hardy. If you were organized, they could send their orders and get it from you. MR. FRANK ARNOLD, (Crawford): What steps would be neces - sary to organize western Nebraska alfalfa seed growers to certify seed? Mr. Lyons, one of the seed buyers from Sioux City, tells us Nebraska seed is just as good as the certified Grimm from South Dakota. He says according to the tests it is equally as good as South Dakota seed. MR. STEWART: As indicated in this telegram from Mr. Magee, there is a big demand for western Nebraska seed.

It looks as if we are going to get. by without having the question brought up. MR. STEWART: Mr. White, who was to discuss that subject, 13 not here but I believe the scheme he used was to rebuild an old binder into a flail machine. This is done by taking off the packers and rollers, and then box in the platform, using tin or very fine wire or hardware cloth. The reel is rebuilt so that it is very strong. Some use wagon tires for flails. Others use board slats. A chain is run from the bull wheel to a cogwheel that turns the reel. The reel turns about five times to one revolution of the bull wheel. That is fast enough to flail out the seed, which is caught in the boxed-in platform. The plants remain standing in the field. When the platform gets full of seed it is sacked up. The biggest trouble with this scheme of harvesting is that leaves off the sweet clover plant and some of the finer stems, millers, cater - pillars, bugs, and sweet clover seed are all caught together. One also gets a good deal of green seed. It is necessary to scatter it In a thin layer where the ventilation is good so that It can dry out. Later it can be sacked and cleaned. One does not have any twine bill and no shocking or threshing is necessary. The capacity of a machine would be about that of the binder, except one would have to stop and clean out the seed. There is one other thing I want to mention in closing as it is very important from the alfalfa seed production standpoint. In a few seed samples at the show, I found seed of the large alfalfa dodder. This is a serious weed pest in alfalfa. The large alfalfa dodder has seeds so near the alfalfa seed in size that it is impossible to separate it. Dodder is a parasitic plant. It comes up from the seed each year. The plant which is a yellowish vine-like growth twines about the alfalfa stems into which it sends suckers for its food supply. Since it is an annual it can be eradicated if it is kept from forming seeds. To do this the field, or spots infected, should be cut early or straw may be piled on the patches where it grows, and burned. It would be a very serious thing to allow this weed pest to get widely scattered through the alfalfa sped growing areas of western Nebraska. It would seriously affec. the sale of alfalfa seed to farmers or seedsmen. I thank you. </seg>

MINICK - First National Bank, Crawford, Nebraska Ladies and Gentlemen: I am obliged to Mr. Stewart for infring - ing upon my time, because I am quite sure I have no lengthy address to make to you at this time. I might explain at the outset why I can personally farm so many more acres and raise so much larger a per cent than the average farmer, and house my machinery better. It is due to my equipment It consists of a very pleasant room, a large supply of lead pencils! aau rg hter UPPly -' PaPer&gt; * 8harpener&gt; and an eas y ch^. Some things I shall say no doubt you have heard before, and not very long before. One is on account of the technicality of my dis - cussion this afternoon, it might be necessary for me to adhere closely to my manuscript. (Laughter.) The only difference I know of be - tween this and some other manuscript which you saw last night is that at the present time there are no strings on this manuscript. (Laughter ) I have not any doubt many of you. before I get through, will wish there was a string on this manuscript. I have a fairly good reputation for truthfulness. I do not have a reputation for knowing so much. When I tell you the next thing r am going to tell you, I want you to believe it, because I have docu - mentary evidence to prove it.| What little spare time I had at home when I should have been reading, not the Bible, but the daily paper I would take a few minutes and jot some thoughts on this subject down on this paper. I jotted them down on this side and brought the paper to Chadron with me and read it over. It didn't suit me I started trying to write on the other side a speech which I shall try to present. Usually I do not refer to the manuscript, but I will make it short and refer to it a little until 1 get started. After I run to the end where they called "Dinner!" I wjll speak extemporaneously. Before starting out on so perilous an undertaking as to try to tell a class of farmers who are progressive enough to attend these farm meetings, and a group of agricultural specialists, anything about agri - culture, my only excuse for. addressing you is to let you know that I am in full sympathy and accord with your teaching and your con - clusions, as they relate to western Nebraska agriculture. I feel like an editor remarking about a big and successful revival in a neighboring town, and the large number of conversions. He said "The sad part of it is the fellows in that town who needed conversion most got away." So the people I really should address are not here </seg>
            <seg id="p714">Report ok Nehraska State Board of Agkicli.tihe After the learned and practical addresses you have heard at this and former meetings, it is not to be expected you will get more than a shiver out of what I can say to you. I feel somewhat like the small boy who used a little profanity. A preacher overheard him and said, "My boy, don't you know it is wrong to swear? Every time I hear you use one of those words it sends a chill down my back." The bey said, "Say, Mister, if you had heard what my Dad said when his nose was caught in the wringer, you would have froze to death!" (Laughter.) We are supposed to talk on Balanced Farming. The subject is so large that we have been talking about it for years. It is so im - portant that our children's children will be still studying this same question; but they will likely be practicing it more than this present generation. At no time in the history of our nation was it so important as now. As the population increases, the need of balanced farming will become more and more a necessity. When the country was new with few people occupying the land; when taxes were low and our personal demands much less than at present, we did not need so great a net income. When the family used the wagon, the spring wagon, rode horseback, or walked to town; when they got their mail once in a week or month; when they wore home-made clothing and shoes, cotton stockings, and calico dresses, a large amount of income was not so necessary. But now with the family demanding a new and up-to-date closed car; with every member of the family demanding pretty silk stockings, and up-to-the-knee and up-to-the-minute clothing, a program must be had on the farm that will provide those things; pay the taxes and interest, and reduce the mortgages. Ladies and gentlemen, these are - some of the incentives for applying the very highest intelligence to our energy and industry on the farms. Western Nebraska is a wonderful country as to climate, fertility and variety of soil, and the great variety of crops that can be success - fully produced. The time was in western Nebraska when a man could raise a herd of cattle or a bunch of horses and make some money, or at least, a living. But in this day of high taxes and large personal expenses of the home it is not possible, except in few instances, to get by with a strictly cattle or horse program. In fact, I feel that if Father Abraham of old should come into western Nebraska at this time and try to put on his cattle program, he would regret exceedingly that the Lord had promised his children should be as the sands of the sea for number. Ladies and gentlemen, the day has arrived in northwestern Ne - braska when the need ia for organized agriculturists as well as for </seg>
            <seg id="p715">Nebraska Potato Impbovehent Association organized agriculture; that Is to say, each farmer must organize his farm unit and equipment so that he may adopt a program that will produce for him -a good, regular, and dependable yearly income, instead of a large income one year and a very meager income other years. I know two brothers who had a small place. They plugged away for several years raising alfalfa, chickens, . milk cows, hogs, on not a very large scale. Every month, if not every week, they took produce to town. They always had their pockets full of tin money. Each month they deposited their surplus money. They bought an additional section of land. They loaned money to their neighbors— finally $15,000 to one neighbor and ?12,000 to another. These brothers now live in. California. They were Dawes County folks of early day who started in thirty years or more ago with a program of balanced farming. • I know other fellows having several times as many cattle who bought their eggs, butter, and milk. They were forced out of business to pay their debts, or as much as they could. . I know a man who bought quite a tract of land. He sold some of it at a big advance, partly paying- for the balance. He said to me, "I can pay for the rest of the land. I am going to put in five hundred acres of rye, and in three to five years I will have my land paid for." . • . When I asked why he did not milk cows, he said they wanted to go visiting Saturday nights and Sunday, and could not be bothered! Of course he failed. That \Vas in this county. In a new county like Dawes, with a great educational institution such as this, he ought to know better than that. I know of another mat— and these . are only some of many— and there are not enough to make the country what it should be— who owned -600 acres of land possibly worth $6,000, and had half a school section rented. They had been taking butter and eggs to town regularly for twenty years. They arranged their business so thfiv never paid cash for groceries in the store. When they sold the grocer more butter and eggs than necessary to offsef the grocery bill, It went into the bank, and the returns from the load of hogs went, too. Now the husband and wife and one daughter have perhaps ?5,000 each on deposit. I know a man who had a little bunch of sheep— 800. I found he milked fifteen cows. He said, "I got d d tired of paying a $600 grocery bill every year, out of these sheep: I thought I would try to milk a few cows so I could apply some of the milk money toward my debts." I think these instances explain to some degree our troubles. It is dead easy for us to lay all the troubles of the farmer on the </seg>
            <seg id="p716">Rkport ok Nkhkaska State Boaru ok Aiirkhltirk later war. But it isn't all due to the war. It is because the farmers of western Nebraska did not start their balanced program on time. I said to an old gentleman who owes us some notes: "Mr. So-and-So, you ought to raise more hogs. You are not getting income enough lo keep up the interest and taxes. You must do something to bring in an income. You can not keep on paying interest and taxes and borrowing more money, or you will soon be "broke," and maybe the bank, too." He came in six months later and said, "I think I started five years too late." I believe he did, myself. I realize we must have specialists, and I am glad to see spec - ialists, but they must be exceptional men specially adapted for that thing. It all rarmers try to be specialists in potatoes, or wheat, or rye, there is going to be a lot of dissatisfied people in the community. I know a man who was raising quite a few potatoes. This was ten years ago. He had five thousand bushels at 85 cents a bushel. I said. "He will pet rich quick. That's real business." I did not know there were if's and and's about it. The second year he wasn't in the potato business. He is a good man and a hard worker. He bought six registered heifer calves for $125 apiece when they were at the peak, and he bought a few registered cows for $100 each of a friend who was a breeder, and they were from seven to fourteen years old. Then the Chadron bull farm had a registered sale and my friend attended. After the sale a gentleman said to this friend of mine. "What do you think such heifers as mine would have brought at that sale?" He had twenty-seven heifers 2^ years old. "If I had the money. I would not be afraid of them at $400 a head." This other fellow was a trader. He said, "Why can't you use them? I have to go out of business. I can not give It my personal attention." "I haven't the money." "Supposing we fix it up." He happened to be a banker. "Even if I could. I wouldn't take them on with less than two and a half years' time." "We will fix it for two and a half years." He was deciding to go into that as one line. He paid $10,800 for those twenty-seven two and one-half year old heifers, and gave a mortgage on them and a second mortgage on his land. Within six months or a year. I doubt if any one could have taken those same heifers and got $150 apiece for them. I think that man in today in debt $25,000 on account of going into one line to make a living. I was out there six months ago and I asked him about this. </seg>

            <seg id="p718">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture What we need in western Nebraska is a lot of men like you for missionaries. We do not get the farmers of the west end of the county, which is the garden of the earth, down here to these meetings. (Applause.) How are we going to get this religion over to these people in our part of the country — in eastern Sioux County and southern Fall River? It does not make any difference if not in Nebraska, for we Ret that trade. (Laughter.) The Chadron folks won't let you bring the Farm Course to Crawford, and we must adopt some method of taking it up to them. You men who get the inspira - tion of these splendid intellectual, and informing addresses from the State University and other places should get information enough to inoculate your own communities with the thought we must have better conditions in our agricultural sections. We are not competitors. No matter how much your neighbor raises, it does not change the price of your stuff. If we are going to make the most out of the things for which this country is admirably adapted, we must standardize the things we do produce, and try to fret more producers of the same thing. We have two or three producers of good chickens, but not enough to make it pay. If we had one hundred people tributary to Crawford raising different breeds, and would organize a chicken society and get to work, then they would take notice. At Shelbyville, Tennessee, with only seven raisers of thoroughbred chicks to start with, they began asking their neighbors to get chickens and buy baby chicks, until they got to be one of the leading chicken counties in the United States, sending out hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in poultry products. We can improve. One thing we should figure is this: if we can help our neighbor improve his herd or flock or crop, it is not hurting any. If he is raising good crops, your land is worth more because of it. It does not make a bit of difference what that land is 1 worth. There are just as many poor people and just as few rich people in every place — or there would be if our rich people did not go to California. Just as many fellows have mortgages on farm 3 worth *500 an acre as on $10 land; and the fellows are just as prtjsperqjis here as on $500 land. It is a question of organizing your farm community to get the maximum out of it. Many people have been led for years to farm more laid than they could handle properly. There is another thing to take into con - sideration here: you must farm more cfops per farm. I do not think there is any place in the corn belt that can raise a larger viiriety of crops successfully than here in this panhandle of Nebraska. (Ap - plause.) But I am not foolish enough to say .you can every year depend on as many bushels of corn as they can in Iowa 01 Illinois or northern Missouri. Our rains are a little more erratic, and we are </seg>

That being true, and you want the feed to feed your hogs and cattle and milk cows, instead of five acres of alfalfa, you ought to have forty, especially in this cheap land. Up in this country our and is cheap enough to have fifty acres of alfalfa as well as ten We may only get the first crop. We do not get enough water to make the second crop seed. Once in a while we do. If it gets high and you get a bushel of seed, it is worth the money. Fellows say, "I am short on pasture." I said to a fellow, "Why can't you take a team and hitch onto a drag and go over the rough spots and smooth it a bit, and put your scarined seed in there and let it grow, or lie over and make a pasture for your milk cows out of it?" I think you people of northwestern Nebraska, and especially Dawes County, could be the happiest people in the world if you would get to the place where you could say, "There is so much about my farm I do not know, I will spend the rest of my life finding it." If there is anything that makes a fellow happy, who has not had more education than I have, it is to open up something new, and hear the speakers speak about the difference of soils. It makes a man feel he wants to live for a hundred years. Another thing is this: you men do not know it, but Pome of our people do. A lot of people of today— I have some of them and I have not much money to give them, either— think they must s:pend a lot of. money to have a good time. They must have a Master Six car. It is all right. I would like to have two or three Those things are good and we must make money enough to provide a cer - tain amount for these things. Every farmer should mike his home a place of education so far as he can. Buy good magazines— not the kind with nothing but stories— but the "American" or "Success," that gives the boy inspir - ation because of what somebt dy else has done. Buy him something on farming. Teach' him the potato business. At Glen I delivered one of these high-brow subjects Mr. Werner had me go up there to make. I said: "You can stop their schooling at the eighth grade but if you bring the children up in the potato field so that they can tell the banker, 'This is spindle tuber,' or, 'This one is mosaic,' I would just as soon have a boy know that thing as to spend a year in school.'! Have them learn cattle, hogs and the growing of these crops. Maybe we can get these different fellows to go to the school house and talk to the farmers throughout the county and get the boys and girls interested. If we can get them to read a little, instead of thinking they must stay Out every Saturday night until Sunday </seg>

Make life worth while, and become intgrested in these problems these men are discussing; and keep this thing in mind: farming is a life business, and the man who plans to jump in for two or three years and then move to town will not be likely to make a success of it. These farms ought to be built up and the fertility kept up, and that is a life work. Mr. McKelvie's paper, "The Nebraska Farmer," gave a splendid article by some boys who went to Scotland. One Scotch farmer, before he would start into the registered cattle business, spent fifteen years building up a certain farm Into the wonderful grass they hi.ve over there. A man should have as much pleasure in thinking hew he is going to take that little corner of his farm and put it in scmething worth while and watch it grow as to have money in the bank. I have said to renters, "Buy your own hog wire. Dontt starve yourselves to death because the landlord won't get the wire!. He is not interested because you are going to own the hogs. Why not buy $200 worth of wire, the same as you would farm Implements, and when you can't get along with that landlord, roll up your wire and move to the next place?" They have been doing that some. I would just as soon loan a man money to buy 300 rods of log wire as to buy six or eight good sows, because with the hog tighn pasture and some hogs they will pay off the debt. I thank you.

Lincoln, Nebraska How many of you are acquainted with the man who says that there is nothing wrong with western Nebraska— not a single thing; the farmers are all right; the soil is all right; everything out here is all right. Just give us the rain and we will raise the crops. As a farmer, that man is a fatalist. His practice is to put in all the crop that he can, as cheaply as he can, and trust to luck. If it rains, he knows he will get a bumper crop. If it does not, it is not his fault. That is a part o£ the hazard of the business. He is frank to say that he knows all about how to raise crops in western Nebraska and what kind to raise, and how best to raise them. That man is not here this afternoon. He never comes to meetings of this kind and I am certain there are not many like him here. He is right, however, in his statement that the most important thing that is needed out in western Nebraska is rain. A generation of farmers and fifteen years of scientific experiments in the dry land sections of the United Statos have demonstrated conclusively that the most important factor in crop production in semi-arid regions is moisture. I want to spend a few moments in calling to your attention some of the facts concerning the moisture situation in your section of the state. The mean, annual rainfall in the northwestern counties, par - ticularly in Cherry, Sheridan, Box Butte, Sioux and Dawes, varies between 16 and 20 inches. The mean annual precipitation at Val - entine for the last 25 years is 19.25 inches, and the mean annual precipitation for Fort Robinson for the last 28 years is 17.27 inches. Table 1 and figure 12 show the data for the Fort Robinson Sta - tion. In order to make a complete record it has been necessary to use in a few cases data from either Agate, Harrison, or Chadron Stations, which are all near enough to Fort Robinson to make this allowable. It requires but a glance at the figure to see that wet and dry years come in irregular cycles. The distribution of rainfall is an important consideration. Figure 13 shows the mean monthly distribution of rainfall at Fort Robinson. In agreement with all other weather stations in interior America, the bulk of the. rainfall comes in the summer months. At Fort Robinson 73.4 per cent of the rainfall comes during the six months April to September, inclusive. In south central or eastern Nebraska, June or </seg>

A single good rain of a half, inch or more is much more desirable than a number of little showers that barely wet the ground. On the other hand, a couple of good rains of around one inch each are better than a single three inch cloudburst. Figure 14 shows the average character of rainfall at the Fojrt Robinson Station.

            <seg id="p729">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association data is a realization that we do not always get all the water in this country that we want when we want It, and therefore we must learn to conserve it when we get it so that we will have it when we want it, and we must learn how to make the most of it when we have it. Fundamental to a solution of the moisture problem is a correct idea of how water .gets, into the soil; how it gets out. and how the crops get it. As I understand soil conditions in this section the question of how to get the water into the soil is not so important as it is in eastern Nebraska, because you have a more open soil and it takes water more readily than the heavy soils of eastern Nebraska. The important thing in this section is how water get« out of the soil. Water may get out of the soil in three ways; first, through weeds; second, it may rise to the surface as oil does in a lamp wick, and evaporate; third, it may evaporate within the soil and rise upward as a vapor. It makes a great deal of difference whether or not we have correct ideas on how water gets out; whether we believe that water climbs to the surface or whether we believe that it rises' as vapor. If we believe that it climbs up like oil in a lamp wick, then our whole efforts in the conservation of soil moisture should be directed toward the maintenance of surface soil conditions that would prevent the moisture from rising to the surface. The dust mulch system of moisture conservation that was being taught through - out this western country 15 years ago was in harmony with this idea. If we believe that water, evaporates within the soil just as if you would put it in a hot oven and bake it out, then we should alter our practice entirely. The fundamental principle would seem to be to keep the water from evaporating inside the soil, and to keep it from getting outside the soil as vapor. As a matter of fact the second idea is the correct one. Exper - imentalists about 15 years ago began to suspect that capillary move - ment was too slow to lead to much moisture loss, and later researches verified these suspicions. Up to recently, however, we have had little idea of how water actually did escape and we generally ascribed the great losses that do occur to weeds. It is clear in our own mind at this time that water may move out of the soil in large quantities as a vapor. .1 want to call your attention to some very remarkable data, (table 2), taken from the records of some of Dr. T. A. Kiesselbach's corn experiments at Lincoln, which illustrate the significance of soil moisture losses. Included in these experiments are four plats, all fairly well alike, and lying on fairly level' land. Two plots are in corn and two are uncropped. One of each is kept clean by good cultivation, and the others are allowed to grow up to weeds and are not touched at all from the time the corn is planted until it if </seg>

Weeds that escape the culti - vator are removed by hand. The data in table 2 are taken from the 1923 records. On June 23rd when the corn was perhaps 8 inches tall, all four plots were sampled to a depth of 5 feet to determine the inches of water in the soil at that time. They were similarly sampled on September 15th, when the corn was mature. During the interval between these dates, a total oC 9.10 inches of rain fell. What happened to this water and to the original supply of soil moisture is shown in the fourth and fifth columns of the table. The clean corn used 2.14 inches of soil moisture plus the rainfall or a totalof 11.24 inches. The weedy corn used but little more soil moisture, and the weedy fallow plot but little less. In all three cases, vegetation, either corn or weeds, used 1 somewhat more than 2 inches of soil moisture plus the rainfall, or a total of over 11 inches of water. Where there was no vegetation to use the water, the soil was practically no wetter in September than in June, and 8.97 of the 9.10 inches of rain - almost all of it — was lost. All of this was lost by evaporation and run-off — very little of the latter. None was lost by seepage for other moisture samplings made at intervals between the dates shown in the table never revealed any wetness in the soil that would indicate percolation. The clean corn plot yielded 52 bushels per acre. The weedy corn plot yielded 6.5 bushels per acre and a lot of weeds. The difference in the yields on the two plats is much larger than is ordinarily expected and is due to an unusually good , weed crop that year.

            <seg id="p732">Report of Nkiiraska State Board of Agriculture The point to stress is the reason why so much water was lost on the clean fallow, and why this water went to produce vegetation on the other plots, for it did largely go to produce vegetation. It actually takes almost all of 11 inches of water to produce a 52 bushel corn crop or its equivalent in weeds. The vegetation on the one hand shades the ground and keeps it cool and breaks the wind, and keeps the hot sun from beating down on the soil. When a little rain falls, the plant roots are there to compete with evaporation for the moisture. On the bare land the sun beats down and the wind whips close to the ground and every little rain that falls soaks into (he ground only a few inches and may dry out again before others come to drive it deep enough into the subsoil to be beyond the evaporating effect of the sun's heat. We should not conclude that it is impossible to store water by clean fallow. That is not the purpose of the data just quoted. The possibilities of storage of soil moisture by clean summer tillage vary with the soil and the season, and the type of cultivation used, and they will be more favorable in western Nebraska, particularly in the north - west, where soil is sandier and where small rains can penetrate deeper, and where the evaporation rate is less than at Lincoln. My personal belief is that there is yet much to be learned about summer fallow methods. In the past all efforts have been directed toward moisture storage, mainly with two ideas in mind, viz: Keeping, the water from escaping through weeds, and through capillarity, by the employment of clean mulch-like tillage. Possibly a certain amount of vegetation systematically planted is desirable and certainly there are possibilities in new types of cultivation machinery designed to leave the soil in the most receptive condition; at the same time producing a heat insulating and wind breaking surface. Agriculture in the Great Plains Country has undergone an evolu - tion, if not a revolution, in the last 15 years. One of the features of change is an increase in the acreage of corn and a corresponding decrease in the acreage of small grains, particularly wheat. Farmers are evidently learning that a combination of corn and wheat or other small grain is more profitable than single crop farming. In a measure, and particularly on small farms, corn is able to take the place of summer fallow In wheat farming. Table 3, adapted from data in Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin. 179, pages 14, 25 and 28, shows the yield of winter wheat at 4 Dry. Land Experi - mental Substations representative of western Nebraska conditions, where wheat was grown continuously on the same land, and after corn, after fallow, and after some system of green manuring. The table also shows the yield of corn on the corn plots preceding the winter wheat. In every case the yield after small grain was the lowest and the yield after fallow the highest recorded. However, if fallowing </seg>
            <seg id="p733">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association* is to be' a successful practice in competition with straight wheat farming, it must double yield the amount that can be produced after grain less the seed for one year, assuming that the cultivation ■which good fallowing. requires is practically equal to seed bed preparation. - This it has not done on the average, or at any one station except Scottsbluff. Furthermore, if fallowing is to compete with corn, wheat must yield enough more after fallow than after corn to equal the value of the corn produced, assuming that the cost of corn production is practically equivalent to the" cost of fallowing. On the average "this difference has been only 3.7 bushels of wheat against 18.3 bushels of corn, and at no single station has the difference been large enough to be in favor of fallow. Table 3.

There are a number of cultivation practices for increasing the efficiency of rainfall that may be stressed. For example, the time of getting land ready for winter wheat. All experiments go to show that the early work which gets the weeds out of the way leads to higher yields of winter wheat. Also early fall work for corn and other spring crops is better than late fall or spring work, providing it is done early enough to conserve water that weeds would otherwise use. If this is not done early there is not much to be gained, for there is a great deal of value in this country in the stubble and stalks that stand up during the winter time and hold the snow. During the winter season plowed land actually conserves less moisture than unplowed land, and the danger of soil blowing is increased. </seg>
            <seg id="p734">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Although moisture is the most important problem in western Nebraska it should by no means be the sole concern of the farmerB. Western Nebraska farmers, like farmers in all other sections, should be interested in the mainteance of soil fertility; for in no country is soil fertility completely or even relatively inexhaustable and West - ern Nebraska is no exception. Analysis made in the laboratory at the Agricultural College indicate that phosphorus, potassium, lime, and other important constituents except . nitrogen, are relatively abundant in western Nebraska soil. Nitrogen and the organic matter with which it is associated are both deficient. On the average the top foot of virgin western Nebraska soil contains 0.118 per cent of nitrogen as com - pared with an average of 0.223 per cent in virgin eastern Nebraska soils. Under cultivation soils in both sections of the state are losing nitrogen and organic matter at about an equal rate. Since western Nebraska soil contains less of these constituents — only 53 per cent as much — in the beginning the conclusion is apparent. On the other hand the fertility in western Nebraska soil is apparently more avail - able than it is in eastern Nebraska. Given the same rainfall, the western section will outyield the eastern. How will we maintain fertility in western Nebraska dry land soils? One thing is certain; we cannot all expect to succeed in our attempts to do it with legumes and barnyard manure which are the recommended methods for humid and irrigated sections. If we grow alfalfa and plow it up, we know what happens. We know that so much plant food is unlocked in the soil that the crop makes too big a growth early in the season and burns up when dry weather hits it. If we use manure in quantity, the same thing happens. Some farmers are more successful than others in their use of these methods, probably because of better subsoil moisture conditions, prob - ably because they apply manure at a thinner rate. Sweet clover the acreage of which is rapidly increasing in northwestern Nebraska is more promising than alfalfa as a soil improver. Corn in the rotation is probably a good thing, for the stalks which contain a third of the nitrogen removed by the crop, can be turned under and will help to maintain organic content and soil conditions. Crop residues generally should be returned to the soil in some form or other. One question in which western Nebraska farmers are interested is the possibility of stemming the loss of organic matter by the use of wheat straw. One of the arguments for the use of combines in western Nebraska is that it makes possible the return of all wheat crop residues. I wonder how it will eventually work out? Already there are farmers who prefer to burn over the stubble fields. They </seg>
            <seg id="p735">Nebraska Potato IiIpbovement Association' say that the straw depresses the wheat yields. Others maintain that though they may not be getting quite as big yields at present where they put the straw back, they will eventually. Agricultural Experiment Station investigations the country over have generally failed to show much advantage from the spreading of fresh straw either as a top dressing or to be plowed under. If it is plowed under it may leave the soli too open and loose which will be a disadvantage and it may repress the formation of available nitrate plant food for a period. If it is used as a top dressing, It may smother the wheat if used lieavily, and at least will keep the soil from warming up as quickly in the spring as it should. In the irrigation rotations at the Scottsbluff Substation there are two plats that have been in spring wheat continuously for 13 years. AH of the straw produced on one, plat has been returned each year and that from the- other has been removed. The average wheat yield for the 13 years has been practically the same for both with a -slight advantage for the one that has had no straw. At the same time these plats have both declined in production due to the depletion of nitrogen. On adjacent plats where manure has been used of legumes have been grown productivity has been maintained. Straw, as compared with manure and legumes, has simply failed to produce results. Straw should not be allowed to go to waste. There are technical reasons why it cannot be' profitably returned in quantity in the fresh condition, but there are no reasons known today why it cannot be returned with profit after.it has rotted. Therefore let it rot. Stack it in the barnyard or turn animals to it in the field and let the bacteria from manure inoculate it and start it to decaying. Then when it is well rotted, haul it out and spread it as you would manure and you will get value from it. If you use a combine and the quantity of straw is light, it may do no damage, therefore, turn il under and eventually it will do a little good. If the yield of straw is heavy it may do damage for the first year. Therefore use your judgment in the matter, but do not call your neighbor a fool if he burns his field. It is sometimes economically and scientifically sound to burn it. At any rate, pay no attention to statements to the effect that the introduction of combines which permit the return of straw will solve the soil fertility problem in western Nebraska. The prospect for the maintenance of soil fertility in western Nebraska is not especially favorable at the present stage of our scientific information. Fortunately we are not yet suffering. We are still drawing on our fairly abundant virgin resources and if we get the rain, if we practice better methods of utilizing what we do get, we will continue to raise satisfactory crops for a number of years. </seg>
            <seg id="p736">Report of Nebraska State Boabd of Aqbictotube But we must keep in mind the fact that our fertility is eventually exhaustable, and we must do the best we can to the extent that it is profitable, to postpone this exhaustion. And in the meantime, we must continue to support the activities of our scientists who are aware of the situation and are faithfully working to discover some system whereby agriculture in dry land sections may continue pros - perous and permanent. </seg>

Seconded by Mr. Skinner. Carried. President: The next in order is correspondence. Mr. Secretary, have you anything in the. way of correspondence? Secretary: No, I have nothing. President: The next in order is committee reports. There were no committees to report. President: We will now take up the unfinished business. Mr. Blaekman, I understand is here and wishes to make a few more re - marks and believe it would be good. Mr. Blackman makes report on legislative bill opening at Lincoln. Dr. Flippin: I believe that it is no more than right and fair that this Association go on record for endorsing bill for licensing poultry and egg dealers and I wish to encourage this. I believe it would do more than anything else to eliminate poultry stealing. Mr. Smiley: Perhaps you all know the most important question at the Convention was to interest the people in bringing their birds to the show. He quoted the following: "Any standard-bred fowl may be regis-. tered provided it wins a place not below fifth in a recognized show and under a recognized judge. When the owner of a winning fowl desires to register the fowl he shall apply to the Secretary of the American Poultry Association for application blank. The said blank shall be properly filled out, giving the Information required and signed by the secretary of the show and the judge and returned to the Ameri - can Poultry Association together with the proper fee. The application will be checked by the Association and if found correct in every detail a Registration Certificate shall be issued. Registration of High Producing Fowls There shall be three classes in high producing fowls and these shall be as- follows: Class A — To become eligible for registration in this class a hen must have laid 200 or more eggs in one year in an official egg-laying contest, and must score not less than eighty-six points under a recog - nized judge. Class B — To become eligible for registration in this class a hen must have laid 200 or more eggs in one year in a Record of Produc - tion project, and must scor|e not less than eighty-six points. Class C— To become eligible for registration in this class a hen must have laid ' 200' or' more' eggs in'bne year in'a" trap' nest on the </seg>

The hen must score not less than eighty-six points Under a recognized judge." Mr. Hale gave a talk on "Standardized Judgment." I find that the exhibitors found more fault than the judges themselves, at the convention. Suggested new methods of licensing. Next year the American Association will meet in Ottawa, Canada, and it will pay you all to go to this Convention. The Association is getting better every day and this organization should have one to represent it at every Convention. President: Have you anything further under this head? Mr. Bender: I believe that this organization should be repre - sented next year and I move that we send someone to the Convention next year. Mr. Skinner: Second the motion. President: Any remarks? Mr. Smiley: I move that it be placed on the table. Seconded by Munson. Motion carried. President: We will now take up new business. Mr. Smiley: At the present time appropriation of $5,000 or $10,000 is given every two years for an Oklahoma organization divided into precincts and counties. I move that this appropriation, or one of this kind be made here. Mr. Burnham seconded the motion. Carried. Mr. Davis: I would like to see a Club egg exhibit at the egg show. Some encouragement should be made to raise better birds, quality fancier. Judging and demonstration has fallen down at the State Fair and this Association has put up medals for judging team and demonstration team for each county which has representation at the State Fair. Bronze, County Fair; Silver, State Fair; Cash at State Association. Encouragement should be made to work on poultry. Circulars are put out with name appearing upon them. We should get this Association before. the people of the State. Many people do not know what we are trying to do or accomplish. Norberg: It seems that an appropriation as Smiley suggested would be a wonderful help to the State Poultry Convention. Mr. Munson: I think we should do something to put our poultry show on the map. I hope we may be able to get someone to bring it to Legislature and get action on it. Mr. Davis: I make motion we appoint committee to award medals. Motion seconded by Mr. Burnham. Carried. Mr. President: We are now ready for election of officers: I will appoint Mr. Jewel and Mr. Bender to distribute ballots for nominating President for coming year.

            <seg id="p743">Nebraska State Poultry Association Mr. Knudson made speech. Carrtad' Skinnen X m ° Ve that we ad J™™- Seconded by Skinner. January 17, 1927 The following report was sent to the Secretary of the State Board of Agriculture, Lincoln, Nebraska: The Nebraska State Show of 1927 held at Omaha, Nebraska, Jan - uary 10th to 15th, 1927. goes on record as not only being the largest 2!\ i7. T held in Nebraska ' but also the Iar * est stat « •*«&gt;«• ever held in the United States and also the largest winter poultrv show held In the United State 8 . . The quality was the finest in practically every breed that has ever been exhibited at a Nebraska State Show. In numbers it stands as a record with an actual count of 2,674 birds not counting the Pigeons, which numbered over 200. The last- three state shows had approximately from 900 to 1200 birds, the one at Alma last year had right around 1000. The attendance was well over 5000: The percentage of these people were from out in the state and from southwestern Iowa Re - duced railroad fares made this possible and the interest shown by the people in attendance has never been seen before inasmuch as sales of birds was the greatest ever. The Rhode Island Red Class, Rose and Single Comb together, were the leading class with over 300 entries. The Barred Rock Light fhl To"". 6 r° nd&gt; Flght ar ° Und 30 °- The Buff Orpingtons were third with 225 birds. The White Rocks were fourth with even 200 birds. The Anconas were next with 125 birds entered. The White Leghorns followed with 120, then came good classes of Silver Laced Wyandottes, and Partridge Wyandottes with a 110 and 115 in each of these classes. White Orpingtons, Light Brahmas, White Wyandottes and Rhode Island Whites were next, all being between the 90 and 100 mark We are told that no show in the country has ever showed such quality and quantity a* shown at Omaha at the state show this year. The Nebraska State Poultry Association this past year has done a great deal to stimulate the poultry industry in the State of Nebraska first of which was getting behind, the Burlington Poultry Special which was a howling success, and by sending our own representatives Mrs Donohue and her Champion , Boys' Poultry Club Workers throughout this trip. We also had a helping hand in the Northwestern Railroad Company and Chicken Special which, was equally as successful as the Burlington Special. We had a helping hand in the Poultry Field Day at the University of Nebraska, Agricultural Department in June act- </seg>
            <seg id="p744">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture ing on the program, and having our representatives present at this meeting. In August this Association had the good fortune to be able to send her Secretary to the International Baby Chick Convention at West Baden, Indiana, at no cost to the Association, where the Secre - tary attained a great deal of knowledge which has been broadcast throughout the State of Nebraska to the poultry breeders and baby chick hatcheries of the State. The Nebraska State Poultry Association sent as a representative Judge Erie Smiley of Seward, Nebraska, to the American Poultry Association Convention, held at Peoria, Illinois, as the official representative of the poultry breeders of the State. A booth was maintained at the Nebraska State Fair at Lincoln during the week of the Fair at the Poultry Building where literature pertain - ing to the raising of poultry and the benefits of the Nebraska State Poultry Association were given to thousands of visitors that week. A helping hand was given the Poultry Show at the Fair this year by the State Association and many comments on the arrangements and cour - tesy of the officials of the poultry show were heard from the vistors. The Nebraska State Poultry Association for the first time in many years had a complete poultry program during the week of organized agriculture at the Agricultural College, Lincoln, Nebraska. Many comments have been paid to this program and another year will see a big improvement over last year. The one big movement on the part of the Nebraska State Poultry Association this year was the free entry encouragement, which was tried out this year. Any first prize winner at any County Fair, local show or the State Fair, where that Association was a member of the Nebraska State Poultry Association, all entries at these shows winning first were given a free entry at the State Show held at Omaha 'thia year. The books are not quite up to date but the Secretary is sure that right around 500 birds took advantage of this opportunity and were shown free at the State Show, and a surprisingly large number of these entries were among the big winners in this year's State Show. Another year will see a thousand first prize winners at the Nebraska State Poultry Show. Before getting ready for the State Show this year we took up the matter of the Boys' and Girls' Club Work in the Poultry World with Mr. Mussehl, of the University of Nebraska, Poultry Department, and we received a very uncertain answer as to what we could expect from this Department at this time. There seems to be very little work in what we term and realize the most important part of all the various agricultural pursuits. Inasmuch as the Poultry Club Work, as far as the boys and girls are concerned, seems to be at a stand-still, however, we have started to work on this part of the program and at our meeting held on the 13th of January a committee was appointed to work in conjunction with the University of Nebraska on the Boys' and Girls' Work and this committee will have the power to purchase </seg>
            <seg id="p745">Nebraska State Poultry Association medals and diplomas necessary to make this worth while and we expect to have a real boys' and girls' display at our next State Show. In answering your question as to whether or not the poultry shows of the country are running too much to exhibition birds, I can only say that a poultry show is an exhibition where the best birds are shown and where the winners as a general rule are noted for their aggressiveness, build, beauty, all of which makes better breeding and producing possible. The shows throughout the country have not turned a deaf ear to production, such as they are accused of, but are endeavoring to combine exhibition and production, as they certainly feel and know that both must be taken into consideration if success is to be obtained. At the recent Sesqui-Centennial Poultry Show the grand champion female was champion in both the exhibition and pro - duction class and the male bird was the same, both of which will show that exhibition and production go hand in hand. I remain, Yours very truly, HARRY KNUDSEN, Secretary. ■ ■■-'.■■.'. ■ ' . ■ ■ - I ■ , . . ■ • ■ . - * ■ . ■ :.,-..' ,■•; ■:■-: (- ■ ■ ■ ■ . . .■ ; I ... ■ ■ . ■ ; , ■ - ■•.'"'■'"" ■ ' .-■.-.. : ■ " - ■ . . ■ ■■" ■ </seg>
