All needless and useless governmental activi - ties and employees must be eliminated. When the cost of government mounts so high that it threatens confiscation of the farms and small homes, the activities of the government must be halted, curtailed and limited. Retrenchment, economy and tax reduction must be the goal for which we should strive. It is my desire to co-operate with you to sustain and support the various institutions and state activities. We should be neither ex - travagant or parsimonious, but I shall feel it my duty to use the executive power to disapprove any appropriations that are needless. extravagant, or of doubtful value REPEAL OF THE CIVIL ADMINISTRATIVE (ODE My first recommendation deals with the form of governmt which the state's affairs have been administered during the pasi four years and which was the central issue of the recent campaign namely, the civil administrative code. From the time this measure was enacted, four years ago, until it was made the paramount issue of the recent campaign, the people endeavored to get a referendum th would permit them to express themselves by direct vote on this measui The candidates for governor of the two major parties took their stai on opposite sides of the question whether the code system of govet ment should be upheld or repealed. An analysis of the vote for gc V ernor in any or all of the legislative districts of the state &lt; to only one conclusion, viz., the people demand that the code of government be abolished. i The present code system centralizes in th responsibility for not only executing the administrative policies of the state but also of determining all administrative policies, which Include the very important and far-reaching banking matters and the bank guarantee fund operation, also the decision as to public highway development projects, insurance administrative problems and other important functions. Such a centralization of power is unwise, unsafe as a business proposition, and fraught with danger to the general welfare of the people. Under the provisions of the code system, the state officers, other than governor, are shorn of all but mere clerical authority, although It is physically impossible for the chief executive to be constantly available or prepared to confer and decide important policies coming 1 </seg>
            <seg id="p003">3 GOVERNOR CHARLES W. BRYAN up from the various code department secretaries, who are employees with no direct responsibility to the taxpayers. It seems to me that it is of utmost importance that the state constitutional officers be given authority to sit as an executive board at least once a week, and oftener when needed, to decide administrative policies and to stand as the people's representative between them and the organized business groups which are to be affected by the laws to be administered. I do not believe public service or public business will be benefited by the creation of any executive officers in addition to the regularly elected state officers. I therefore recommend the repeal of the civil administrative code and all amendments as quickly as possible, so that the reorganisation work may be carried out without unnecessary delay. In lieu of the present system I recommend that an executive board, consisting of the Governor, Secretary of State, State Treasurer, State Auditor, and Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings, be created and that these officers constitute a board of review to be known as "The Executive Council," which shall have power by majority vote to ietertnine the state's administrative policies. (I have not Included the Attorney General as a proposed member of this board for the reason that he must be its legal adviser, and, therefore, should not be required ke sides on any disputed c controverted question) The Governor is by the constitution made the supreme power to execute and administer the laws of the state. In order that there may- be no shifting of responsibility for the execution of the state's admin - istrative policies, and no divided authority over appointees and em - ployees, it is my conviction that all department heads and needed employees should be appointed directly by the governor, and that the appointive power should also have the authority to remove any appointee w I believe the government should be made more compact by cur - tailing and combining departments by eliminating duplications of offi - cers and employees connected with the administrative work, and that all educational effort should be discontinued in the state's adminis - trative departments and confined to the state's educational institutions to avoid duplication of effort and unnecessary expense. When the code law is repealed, useless departments can be abol - ished, others consolidated so that the number of inspectors, bureaus, commissions and inspections can be greatly reduced and some inspec- </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 INAUGURAL MESSAGE OP tions can be handled by local officials. When the regular state offi - cers again assume the responsibility of recommending to the legisla - ture the needed appropriations for the various state activities, the dupli - cations, fads, theories and isms calling for an endless number of employees, and ever increasing and unnecessary expenditures of the people's money, will cease. The first step in restoring the government to a business basis is to repeal the code law. Second, regroup the state's necessary depart - ments with authority in the governor to appoint the heads and neces - sary assistants, and with authority in the Executive Council to deter - mine administrative policies. Third, re-enact separate statutes dealing with the subjects covered by the original enactments which the code superseded, so that the enforcement or administrative provisions there - of may be brought in harmony with the general administrative plan. REPEAL OF INTANGIBLE TAX PROVISION The Revenue law, known as Senate Pile No. 65 (1921 Session), favors one class of taxpayers while it lays unjust and unfair burdens upon others. The owners of stocks, bonds, notes, mortgages, and other property known as "intangible" property, are avoiding their obliga - tions to the government while their less fortunate neighbor, whose wealth is invested in a home or farm or other "tangible" property, bears the added burden. I recommend that this preferential provision be repealed and that it be replaced by a statute which is in accord with the state motto, "Equality Before the Law." TAXATION The shifting of taxes from the rich to the poor must cease, whether it be through hiding intangible property, by increasing assessed valua - tion on one class of property and lowering on others or by securing low valuations of public utilities for taxation purposes and high valuations for rate making purposes. It is impossible for the assessor to find all intangible property for taxation. I suggest for your consideration the following legislation in order to equalize and to reduce general taxa - tion and so as to more equitably tax each citizen in proportion to the benefits he receives under the law: Provide for a system of certifying mortgages for taxation purposes from every record office or court in the state to the county assessor in the county where said instruments are recorded. Public utilities and common carriers should be taxed on their rate making valuations. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">GOVERNOR CHARLES W. BRYAN 5 In justice to the owners of some tangible property, a constitutional amendment should be submitted by you to the people tor their adoption or rejection authorizing the exemption from taxation of such tangible property as unsold grain on the farm. A STATE INCOME TAX To offset any loss in revenue that may result from just exemptions, to reach the incomes from tax free securities, and to permit a redaction of taxes on tangible property, I recommend the enactment of a gradu - ated state income tax law modeled after the Wisconsin law, discrimi - nating in favor of earned incomes and using the federal income tax re - turns as a basis of state assessment. INHERITANCE TAX 1 recommend that the inheritance tax law be amended so as to pro - vide for* a graduated inheritance tax running from 1 to 5 per cent. NO TAX ON GASOLINE A sale tax is a tax on consumption and is another plan for trans - ferring the taxes from the rich to the poor, and I strongly urge you to oppose a tax on gasoline or any other kind of a sale tax. LAW ENFORCEMENT It is my intention and purpose to strictly enforce the laws of this state, and especially the prohibition law, whose enforcement is placed under the responsibility of the governor. It is the duty of every pa - triotic citizen of this state to obey the laws under which he lives. It is the duty of each citizen and organization to assist the governing authorities In seeing to it that the laws of the state are upheld. It is my intention to use every means within my authority to bring about respect and obedience to law. In at least two separate parts of the statutes the chief executive of the state is authorized and empowered to establish under his au - thority a special law enforcing organization. The functioning of this organization shall be in addition to and supplemental to the best efforts of local and county peace officials. The Sackett law provides for the ouster from office on complaint filed by the governor of any local offcial who wilfully fails, neglects or refuses to enforce the laws of Nebraska, in his jurisdiction. To make this law effective it should be amended so that the officer so complained against could be suspended from office and the Governor empowered </seg>
            <seg id="p006">INAUGURAL MESSAGE OF 6 to make a temporary appointment during the determination of the complaint, and I so recommend. THE BANK GUARANTY In 1909 a law guaranteeing bank deposits was enacted. This law was passed for the exclusive protection of the depositors. It has given confidence to the depositor and promoted general banking business and has served its purpose well. I am aware that there are efforts con - stantly being made to repeal or emasculate the guarantee provision in our banking law. I strongly recommend that you do not permit any tampering with this law that would weaken it or cause the public to lose confidence in the banks' ability and promptness to pay depositors on demand. The number of bank failures in recent months is sufficient to Justify an investigation as to the causes of the failures, methods of banking and of the character of examination, division of authority over and conservation of assets of insolvent banks, with a view to enacting legislation that would prevent a recurrence, if possible, of past diffi - culties. I therefore recommend that a Joint committee of the Senate and House be selected to conduct such an inquiry and to make a report at this session of the legislature. OBLIGATION TO WAR VETERANS The people of Nebraska are proud of the men who served their state and country in the world war and proud of the record they made. We owe them a debt of gratitude that we can never fully discharge, but it should be our aim to see that they have every care and considera - tion that a grateful, patriotic nation can bestow. Hospital accommodations in Nebraska for the care of ex-service men are inadequate, and this matter should receive careful considera - tion at your hands. I also recommend that you memorialize congress to substitute the soldier adjusted compensation bill for the ship subsidy bill, and then pass it as an assurance to the country that patriotism can not be sub - ordinated to the selfish interests of the shipping trust. THE DIRECT PRIMARY The defeat by the voters at the recent election of the effort to emasculate the direct primary law should put an end to any further attempts in Nebraska to take from the people their right to nominate their officers by direct vote. The women voters are entitled to much of the credit for preserving the primary law. The people are committed to the principle of the direct primary, and it should be reinforced by a </seg>
            <seg id="p007">GOVERNOR CHARLES W. BRYAN 7 more strict corrupt practice act. As another step to encourage the people to give closer scrutiny to the personnel of the candidates for office, I suggest for your consideration the advisability of removing the party circle from the ballot. REDUCE AUTOMOBILE LICENSE TAX Six years ago this state accepted the benefits of the federal aid road acts, and made the necessary appropriations therefor. This same practice has been accepted by practically all other states of the union and a great many federal made roads have been constructed and are being maintained throughout the entire country by a Joint system of the federal and state governments. This practice has led to a growing menace of matching federal money with state dollars. The system has become established, and I believe it would be an undue burden upon the taxpayers of this state to alone withdraw from the present system. I recommend that you carefully consider this matter and if deemed wise memorialize congress by a proper resolution, requesting the dis - continuance of this system of spending public moneys. Until proper action can be taken on this question I recommend that the present auto- mobile license tax be reduced fifty per cent, and that of the money de - rived from such licenses, less than administrative expense, be turned over to the respective counties in which collected to be used in the improvement and upkeep of county roads. This would lighten the tax - payers' load approximately one and one-half million dollars annually. LABOR he word labor carries with it the thought of human beings, men and women whose mind and muscle must be relied upon in all construc - tive, progressive development that is undertaken. The Democratic party through Jefferson and the Republican party through Lincoln are com - mitted to the doctrine that the government should protect both human rights and property rights, but where there is a conflict between the two, human rights are superior and deserve first consideration. I believe the right to collective bargaining by labor's representa - tives should be recognized by all. The eight hour day and a living wage at American standards, with a margin for old age, is a right that should not be questioned or opposed. I urge you to oppose any effort to establish in this state any en - forced slavery system such as an Industrial court. Labor and capital are mutually dependent and, working together in friendship and confidence, should give to society the maximum of productive power. </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 INAUGURAL MESSAGE OP To insure peace in the industrial world a permanent state tribunal should be created for all disputes before they reach the stage of lockout or strike — not compulsory arbitration but investigation for the purpose of bringing out the facts. Public opinion could be depended upon to be the final arbiter. CO-OPERATIVE MARKETING Agriculture is the basic industry of Nebraska. Upon the success of the fanner all other profitable business is dependent. Every burden should be lifted within your power to the end that agriculture be made a paying industry. Co-operative market facilities should be encouraged. Co-operative companies should be made exempt from anti-trust laws. A co-operative marketing law so that non-capital, non-profit organi - sations can incorporate in this state should be provided. RURAL CREDITS The small fanners are now unable to take advantage of the credit facilities that are offered by the federal and other rural credit agencies sufficient to meet their needs. For the purpose of encouraging, fostering, and promoting the agri - cultural interests of the state, I recommend that you give careful con - sideration to a rural credit system modeled after the South Dakota law, to supply the financial needs of the fanners and stock raisers. GRAIN WARE HOUSING The Federal Government has, by an act of congress, provided for the regulation and supervision of bonded storage ware houses and placed the same under the Jurisdiction of the federal secretary of agri - culture. The general purpose of this act is to provide for safe and suitable places for the storage of grain by the individual growers with the view of making receipts for deposit in such ware houses a ready medium for securing assistance in financing crops. The state ware house law of Nebraska does not conform to the requirements of the federal law and for that reason possible benefits offered by the federal law are not obtainable by those operating under the Nebraska law. I therefore recommend the Nebraska ware house law be made to conform to the requirements of the above mentioned federal act. REPEAL INDETERMINATE SENTENCE LAW The Increase of crime, especially of crimes of violence, demon - strates that criminals do not sufficiently fear that adequate punish - ment will follow. I recommend that the Indeterminate Sentence Law </seg>
            <seg id="p009">GOVERNOR CHARLES W. BRYAN 9 f. should be repealed, and that the power to impose the proper sentence be left to the trial judge who has heard all of the evidence and knows the facts. Paroles, commutations, and pardons should not be con - sidered by the Pardon Board without recommendations from the trial Judge to the effect that such attention would be in the interest of Justice or humanity. MUNICIPAL OWNERSHIP OF PUBLIC UTILITIES To protect the people from profiteering in the essential necessaries of life and to bring the producers and consumers together for their mutual benefit without middlemen intervening, I recommend a general statute giving all cities, towns and villages the authority to acquire, establish and operate municipal water plants, light plants, gas plants, ice plants, coal and fuel yards, slaughter houses and public markets and to provide money for the same by taxation. WATER POWER DEVELOPMENT The water power of the state if developed would be sufficient to light and heat the homes of Nebraska and to furnish power to manu - facture raw material produced on Nebraska farms into the finished products. We can not now compete with eastern manufacturers who have coal at hand. By developing our water power we can save much on the cost of fuel and save long freight hauls on fuel and on raw mate - rial to and from the factory. Cheap fuel, heat and power will raise the price of farm products and furnish employment to labor. I therefor recommend that immediate steps be taken by the state to develop Nebraska's water power by districts. ABOLISH COUNTY TRUANT OFFICER The state government is responsible for much of the increased cost of county government. The office of county truant officer is a duplica - tion of work in the city, and Is not needed in the country. It should be abolished or authority given to appoint the county superintendent as truant officer without additional salary. ABOLISH COUNTY HIGHWAY COMMISSIONER The position of county highway commissioner is a duplication and an unnecessary expense to a county, and I recommend that the office be abolished or authority given to appoint one of the county commis - sioners to the position without additional pay. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">INAUGURAL MESSAGE OF 10 CONSOLIDATE COUNTY OFFICES I recommend legislation that will give the voters of a county the right to consolidate two or more county offices in the interest of economy, and that an option be given counties to establish by ma - jority vote a new form of county government when desired. REFERENDUM ON WAR The untold sorrow, suffering, destruction and loss that war entails on the entire citizenship of the country justifies the people in reserving the right to themselves to declare war. I recommend that a resolution be passed memorializing congress to submit an amendment to the con - stitution requiring a referendum of the people before a declaration of war, unless the country Is invaded. LAW GOVERNING BOND ISSUES Owing to the many different forms used in issuing bonds of muni - cipalities and school districts many test suits are brought in the su - preme court to determine their validity. I recommend the codification of these statutes or the enactment of one general scheme or plan that may be put Into general use so as to avoid the present confusion. CONCLUSION During the past few years, and especially during the late war period, there has been a universal tendency towards an excess of gov - ernment. This is resulting in the enactment of public laws for the cure of private and personal ills that are burdening the state govern - ment with functions and obligations which will destroy the effectiveness of governmental activities, and also of individual responsibility. I recommend that In your deliberations you concentrate your at - tention upon matters of general substance and that you refrain from the enactment of laws which are lacking in fundamentals of state-wide importance and needs. The ability of the taxpayers to pay should constantly be borne in mind when matters of expenditure of public funds are considered. In appropriating money raised by taxation, special care should be given to see that no class or group receive unnecessary financial bene - fits at the expense of the taxpayers in general. Appropriation bills should be completed as early in the session as possible so as to guard against hasty action in the closing hours of the session. </seg>
            <seg id="p011">I GOVERNOR CHARLES W. BRYAN 11 In presenting later to you recommendations relative to the budget, I will suggest eliminations, consolidations and transfer of some of the state's activities to other institutions, I will also lay before you for your consideration more specific plans for a regrouping of the admin - istrative departments of the state government. I believe that the legislature, in the interest of economy, should fix or limit the compensation paid to departmental chiefs, chiefs of sub-departments and amounts paid for skilled and professional serv - ices of those in the state's employ. We have a great state, and our citiizenship is second to none. The people of Nebraska are expecting definite and progressive results by this legislature and the chief executive. They want to see the state government put on a business basis by placing the authority to de - termine administrative policies and the responsibility for recommend - ing appropriations into the hands of the constitutional officers of the state. They want the taxpayers to stand on an equal footlnig and be taxed in proportion to the benefits they receive from the laws. They want the cost of government brought within the taxpayers' ability to pay and all non-essentials in government eliminated. They want the natural resources of the state developed for the benefit of all the people of the state. They want the agricultural Interests of the state to be recognized as the basic Industry of the state and all handicaps in its development and progress removed — and with a broad, tolerant spirit of brotherly love between man and man, our state and its people will go forward as the leaders of all things that contribute to national great - ness. I am ready to loin you in the expectations of the people. a sincere and earnest effort to meet CHARLES W. BRYAN. </seg>
