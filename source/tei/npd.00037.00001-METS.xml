            <seg id="p005">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 5 REPORT OF BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF STATE INSTITUTIONS TO THE GOVERNOR AND TO THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF NEBRASKA : The Board of Commissioners of State Institutions begs to present herewith for your consideration its second bien - nial report for the period beginning December 1, 1914, and ending November 30, 1916. PERSONNEL By the re-appointment of Silas A. Holcomb, one of the members of this Board, upon the expiration of the term for which he was first named and which expired July 1, 1915, the membership of the Board during its entire existence and the period covered by this report has remained the same and as originally constituted and its work has continued along the lines and according to the principles and policies adopted immediately after its organization under the law creating the Board and under which it has been operating since the beginning. An earnest effort has been made to improve wherever opportunity presented itself, not only in the general man - agement of the institutions under the control of the Board but with the view of more efficiently carrying on the work pertaining thereto and to safe-guard and promote, wher - ever possible, the interests, comfort and welfare of the charges of the State maintained in the several institutions referred to. </seg>
            <seg id="p006">6 SECOND BIENNIAL REPORT OF From the first, it has been the policy of the Board to make no change in the personnel of the officers of the several institutions unless such change should seem to be required in order to promote efficiency and good service. Where vacancies have occurred for any reason they have been filled so far as practicable by appointments from among those already in the service of the State whose qualifications were such as to entitle them to recognition and promotion. EXECUTIVE AND STAFF CHANGES Â»Dr. E. R. Van der Slice, after serving a little more i a year as superintendent of the Hospital for Tuber - &gt;us at Kearney, retired from the service of the State November 30, 1915. I He was succeeded on January 14, 191G, by Dr. L. S. B. inson, who came to us from Minnesota, of whose State itorium he was assistant superintendent. During the interval between the going of Dr. Van der Slice and the coming of Dr. Robinson, the needs of the hospital were well cared for by Dr. L. M. Stearns of Kear- IDr. W. D. Guttery, formerly superintendent of the pital for the Insane of Nebraska at Norfolk, was relieved n duty on January 15, 1916. I Dr. M. W. Baxter, formerly superintendent of the leside Hospital for the Insane, retired therefrom on uary 31, 1916. The vacancy created by the retirement of Dr. Baxter was filled by the transfer of Dr. W. S. Fast from the super - intendency of the Nebraska Institution for Feeble-Minded Youth at Beatrice, where he had made an admirable record of efficient and faithful service. tDr. D. G. Griffiths, then pathologist of the Nebraska pital for the Insane at Lincoln, was appointed superin - lent of the Nebraska Institution for Feeble-Minded th, to succeed Dr. Fast, on February 1, 1916. Dr. G. E. Charlton, second physician of the Ingleside Hospital for the Insane, was transferred to the Hospital </seg>
            <seg id="p007">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS for the Insane of Nebraska at Norfolk to become the suc - cessor of Dr. Guttery on March 18, 1916. Mrs. Grace Baxter and Mrs. L. M. Guttery, who re - signed their positions as matrons of the hospitals for the insane at Ingleside and Norfolk, respectively, were suc - ceeded, the former by Mrs. Libbie Thordson and the latter by Miss Bertha M. Ludwig, each of whom had long served the State efficiently in positions of less responsibility. In this connection it seems proper to state that it is the policy of the Board not to appoint as matrons the wives of super - intendents, and that there are now but two instances in which the wife of the superintendent is the matron of the institution. The vacancy created by the promotion of Dr. Griffiths was filled by the appointment of Dr. F. S. Marnell, who had previously served with credit in similar institutions in Iowa ; and that created by the promotion of Dr. Charlton was filled by advancing Dr. C. A. Oaks, previously third physician at the Ingleside Hospital for the Insane. Dr. Oaks was succeeded first by Dr. G. C. Rice, who remained but a few days ; then by Dr. W. A. Danielson, who resigned after a few months to accept a better position in Illinois ; and finally by Dr. Ward W. Hedlund of Lincoln, the present incumbent. Col. Ferdinand Zimmerer, formerly commandant of the Nebraska Soldiers' and Sailors' Home at Burkett, was suc - ceeded on March 15, 1915, by Col. John F. Walsh, of Hum - boldt. Adjutant J. T. Lane of the same institution resigned February 23, 1915, and was succeeded by E. J. Maxwell, of Nemaha City. Dr. Clyde P. Fordyce, after more than two years ser - vice as physician of the Nebraska Soldiers' and Sailors' Home at Burkett, resigned to re-enter private practice and was succeeded on October 18, 1915, by Dr. J. A. Waggoner, of Humboldt. INVESTIGATIONS Among the duties which devolve upon the Board is to investigate and report any abuses or wrongs alleged to exist </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 SECOND BIENNIAL REPORT OF I any institution under its control. Complaints are fre - ;ntly presented to the Board, often anonymously, and se no matter what their source, have always received care - consideration and, wherever sufficiently definite to afford asis for such action, have been personally investigated by Board or some member of it. Beside instances which e been called to its attention by others, the Board has on own initiative investigated matters which seemed to need ention. Some of these investigations have been quite in - mal; others were attended with many of the formalities a court proceeding. (The more important of these investigations disclosed gularities in the business methods and management of Hospital for Tuberculous, resulting in the retirement of Van der Slice ; irregularities in connection with certain Dlies and other matters in the management of the Ingle- Hospital for the Insane, resulting in the resignation )r. Baxter; and an ineptitude of management and de - alization of the working force of the Hospital for the me of Nebraska at Norfolk, resulting in the retirement )r. Guttery. In many instances complaints were found to be without any substantial basis and in most cases where some ground for complaint existed the facts had been greatly exaggerated and colored. Each case was carefully considered and such action taken as seemed to be required by the facts estab - lished. I The Board has at all times encouraged the retention ill employees who have proven themselves efficient, well lifted, and conscientious in the discharge of their res - tive duties for such period of time as their work proves sfactory ; and with a view of keeping in the employ of State the very best class of service that can be obtained required that no one be discharged from his or her )loyment except for cause and for reasons which are sfactory and for the betterment of the service, and that jport be made to this Board monthly of all such dis - rges and the reasons therefor. We feel that it is now I understood among the larger number of employees in </seg>
            <seg id="p009">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 9 these different institutions that their continuation in the service of the State depends entirely upon the merits of the service rendered to the State and the faithful and efficient discharge of the duties which they are required to perform while engaged in such employment. In general, it should be said that conditions in the several institutions have been excellent. STATE INSTITUTIONS The several institutions managed and controlled by the Board consist of three hospitals for the insane ; two homes for ex-soldiers and sailors; two industrial schools, one for boys and one for girls; an institution for feeble-minded; a hospital for tuberculosis; an orthopedic hospital; a state penitentiary; an industrial home for women; a school for the blind ; a school for the deaf ; and a home for dependent children, making a total of fifteen. POPULATION The average daily inmate population in the different institutions of the State for the year ending November 30, 1914, was 4305. The average daily inmate population for the biennium covered by this report, being for the two years ending November 30, 1916, is 4526. The average daily inmate population for the month closing the biennial period, that is, November, 1916, is 4864. In the above summary of the population there are not included those who were not actually present in the institu - tions but were on parole or furlough or for other reasons temporarily absent from the institutions in which they were inmates or held membership. This absent population in - cludes those committed to the different hospitals for the insane who were deemed by the authorities of such insti - tutions sufficiently recovered to go to friends and relatives or to those who took friendly interest in them on parole for brief periods of time or for so long as their conduct was such as to warrant them in having their liberty, some of whom were finally discharged and others from time to time </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 SECOND BIENNIAL REPORT OF returned to the institutions from which they were paroled. The same rule holds good as to the institution for feeble - minded and the industrial schools. At the soldiers' homes and the penitentiary a large number are constantly out on parole or furlough. Temporary free homes are also fre - quently found for many of those committed to the home for dependent children. This absent population will average altogether approximately ten to twelve hundred. The aggre - gate absent population for the month of November, 1916, in all institutions numbers 1001, thus making a gross total population under the control of the State, directly or in - directly, at the close of the biennium of 5865. The total number of officers and employees as shown by the reports for the month of November, 1916, aggregates 718. I It will be seen from the above that the total population intained in the different institutions and present therein the close of the biennial period numbers 5582, and if to s is added the number on parole and furlough or who, for ler reasons, are temporarily absent, the grand total of the pulation of all of the institutions reaches in numbers 6583. I It is to be noted from the foregoing that there has n a steady increase in the population of these several titutions and, judging by the past, it is not to be doubted that this increase in the growth of the population will tinue for some time to come. Based upon the experience the past, the capacities of the different institutions to ivide for the accomodation of those seeking admission, increased facilities by the completion of new buildings v under construction, and additional buildings which are ommended in our estimate of appropriations needed for coming biennium, it is estimated that the average inmate mlation for the coming biennium will be at least 5031 and which provision will have to be made for their proper e, support and treatment. For some time past and at present the greatest demand for additional room and facilities for caring for the inmates or those seeking admission exists at the three hospitals for the insane, the institution for the feeble-minded and the two soldiers' homes. We have found ourselves unable to </seg>
            <seg id="p011">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 11 provide promptly for the reception of all those who have been legally adjudged insane and regularly committed to one of the three hospitals maintained by the State. Every effort possible has been put forth to accommodate this un - fortunate class of citizens of the State and to receive them promptly in one of the different hospitals as they are found to be entitled to admission and committed by the proper authorities thereto. By transferring from one institution to another and crowding to the utmost limit commensurate with the safety and welfare of those already under treat - ment, we have been enabled to care fairly well for all those who have been committed to the custody of these hospitals and in this we have received the hearty aid and co-operation of the superintendents; but notwithstanding the utmost efforts we have been able to put forth, there are a large number that for a shorter or longer period of time have to be detained in the counties of their residence, in the jails or other places of restraint until a place can be found in which to receive them in one of the hospitals where only can they be given the care, attention and treatment their unfortunate conditions demand. The Nebraska Institution for Feeble-Minded Youth has outgrown its capacity and is now unable to receive all who are committed thereto and who should have the intelligent and humane care and treatment that can there be given and of which they are deprived because of the lack of facilities to receive them as rapidly as application is made therefor. At the two soldiers' homes the applications for admis - sion are greater than the two institutions can provide ac - commodations for and a waiting list has been necessary for some time in the past. By the construction of a new build - ing at Milford and other improvements there made which increase the facilities of that institution to care for a larger number, and contemplated further improvements at the soldiers' home at Burkett, it is hoped and believed that all those applying for admission hereafter can be with reason - able promptness provided for and accepted as members in one or the other of the two homes. In this connection it is to be noted that those who are admitted to these two homes </seg>

FINANCE We are transmitting herewith a full, complete and de - tailed statement of the appropriations made by the Legisla - ture for and on behalf of the Board in the prosecution of this work and of all expenditures made therefrom and show - ing the purposes for which made ; and also our estimate of the appropriations needed for the coming biennium. tin order that a more intelligent understanding may be regarding the expenditures of the public funds for the ort of the different institutions and the purposes for h expended, the Board has classified or grouped all of its expenditures under two principal heads, as follows : First, the ordinary expenditures required in maintain - ing such institutions and which under the heading "Mainte - nance," are divided into twenty-two sub-heads, many of which are again sub-classified or divided so that there are fifty-three classifications and sub-classifications under this heading, such as salaries and wages ; transportation, tele - graph and telephone ; articles of food ; clothing ; dry-goods ; hardware; fuel, light and power; machinery, tools and sup - plies ; general repairs ; etc. Second, in addition to expenditures under the head - ing of maintenance which includes the ordinary running, every-day, current expenditures, there are further divisions denominated extra-ordinary, including furniture and equip - ment of all kinds, permanent improvements to buildings and grounds, and new buildings and land. These are all </seg>
            <seg id="p013">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 13 sub-divided or sub-classified under different titles or head - ings so that for all institutions we are enabled to determine the monthly and annual expenditures of all kinds, both the ordinary and the extraordinary, and to have them prop - erly classified as above outlined. For, the purpose of determining the per capita cost of maintaining the different institutions the same has been based upon the current or ordinary expenditures as the extraordinary expenditures fluctuate very greatly as to the different institutions and also as to the different biennial periods for each of the institutions and depend largely upon appropriations made for permanent improvements, new buildings, furnishing and equipping the same, the purchase of land and other like expenditures of extraordinary char - acter. A detailed statement of all such expenditures prop - erly classified and showing the per capita cost will be found among the tabulated statements herewith submitted as a part of our report and which will disclose fully and in an itemized form all of such expenditures and the pur - poses for which made. During the biennium there was expended for mainten - ance in all of the institutions under the control of the Board $2,125,351.98; for furniture and equipment $62,068.94 ; for permanent improvements to buildings and grounds $144,460.94; for the construction of new buildings and the purchase of land $359,522.09; for miscellaneous purposes 35,969.66. The principal expenditure making up the item last mentioned was for the purchase of the equip - ment and material of the Handcraft Furniture Company at the State Penitentiary, and of new machinery, amount - ing to over $23,000; and personal damage claims for in - jury and death of those connected with the services of the State and which were made by the last Legislature under special enactments made for that purpose, making a total expenditure for extraordinary purposes of $602,021.63, or a grand total of expenditures for all purposes for the bi - ennium of $2,727,373.61. </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 SECOND BIENNIAL REPORT OF EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSES IThe expenditures made during the biennium covered this report were distributed among the different state ;itutions and generally for the purposes as follows : Nebraska Institution for Feeble-Minded Youth There was expended for extraordinary purposes a total of $56,986.16. This sum was in the main expended for the purpose of constructing, furnishing and equipping a new school building with auditorium on the third floor, rooms Eie basement for industrial training and other purposes, at a total cost of approximately $40,000 ; also to con - it and equip a modern dairy barn capable of housing about 36 dairy cows; also a vitrified hollow tile silo of 135- Ii capacity and a hay barn holding a large tonnage of hay which the herd of cattle is fed during the winter season ; o an expenditure of $9,600 for the purchase of 80 acres land which has added greatly to the crop producing capa - y of that institution and is believed to be a very excellent r estment. Some extraordinary expense was also incur - 1 in extending heating mains, constructing a new well and }viding for a greater supply of water which at no time s been very abundant at this institution. Girls' Industrial School A total extraordinary expenditure of $26,679.64 was made at this institution, principally for the purpose of fin - ishing and furnishing a new auditorium and dormitory building with kitchen and dining rooms on the basement floor, and remodeling and changing the interior of the old building, which became advisable upon the occupancy of the new, especially with reference to re-arranging some of the rooms, the laying of new floors and extensive repairs and changes in the heating and plumbing system which were found to be sadly in need of the same. State Industrial School There was expended for extraordinary purposes $6,741.59. The improvements were in the main of a general </seg>
            <seg id="p015">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 15 nature, in adding to the appearance and preserving the structures already in existence, but also including the con - struction of a new ice- house, some new hog houses and a hay barn for the storing of hay and feeding of cattle therein. There was afso purchased some additional laundry machin - ery and equipment for the several trade departments main - tained at this institution. No extraordinary appropriations were requested of or made by the last Legislature and the expenditures above mentioned were made from available funds found to exist including the institution cash fund de - rived from the sale of farm products, live stock, etc., pro - duced at and sold by the institution. m Nebraska Soldiers' and Sailors' Home, Bnrkett The soldiers' "Home" expended during the biennium for extraordinary purposes the sum of $10,669.65. This sum was used for the purchase of machinery and equipment for the laundry, to replace equipment which had become old, worn out and of no further practicable use, the construction of a building principally for the care and protection of farm machinery and .for storage purposes, the extension of the heating plant by the laying of additional mains to other buildings, and for painting, re-wiring, re-plumbing, the lay - ing of floors and other such general repairs throughout the different buildings which have been constructed for a long period of time and are in constant need of repairs and im - povements in order to preserve them and keep them in a comfortable and sanitary condition. The "Home" has made a total expenditure for the bien - nium for the purposes under consideration of the sum of $34,056.81. This sum was paid for the furnishing of the new hospital building completed during the biennial period, for laundry machinery, the finishing of the new hospital building and the construction of a new laundry building with sleeping rooms above for employees, and some expen - ditures for repairs generally. Soldiers' and Sailor. 1 Hone, Milford </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 SECOND BIENNIAL REPORT OF Ingleude Hospital for the Insane rAt this State hospital a total expenditure of $17,711.33 extraordinary purposes was made and principally for purpose of re-shingling several of the mfcin buildings with asbestos shingles which are fire-proof, thus decreasing materially the fire hazard there existing also the laying of the necessary cables and erecting a complete system of elec - troliers for lighting the buildings and grounds and which have added greatly to the convenience and appearance of that institution. Out of this sum there also was paid a death claim of $2,000, allowed and appropriated by the last Legis - lature. This institution is the largest in the state and the gen - eral repairs constantly being carried on in all parts of the institution amount to no inconsiderable item. By constant Eition, however, to the subject the institution is kept in llent condition, in a good state of repair ,and deteriora - is reduced to a minimum. No special appropriation made for any expenditure at this institution of an aordinary character, and the amount expended was found to be available from funds of the regular appropria - tion and from the institution cash fund, a statement of which appears in another part of this report. There is also contemplated the erection of a new gen - eral kitchen, modern in all respects and of sufficient capac - city to provide for all of the inmates as well as the officers and employees, and also to furnish dining-rooms for all of the employees, with a dormitory which will accommodate 75 to 100 of such employes on the third floor. The construc - tion for a building of this kind will probably require an ex - penditure of from $40,000 to $45,000, all cf which is now available or in sight and can, with profit to the State and advantage to the institution, be used for such purpose ; after which, according to present indications, a large sum will lapse into the state treasury at the end of the biennial The old kitchen building has been carefully examined by competent architects at our request with the view of </seg>
            <seg id="p017">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 17 remodeling and enlarging the same rather than to build a new structure, but such examinations disclose that this building is structurally unsafe and cannot be depended upon for the purposes for which used but for a short time, and that safety, business prudence and to properly prepare for the future require the construction of a new building and the destruction of the old. There will, of course, be much salvage in the old building which will be put to the best pos - sible use and no useless waste or destruction of any kind will result from the improvements thus to be made and as above outlined. Nebraska Hospital for the Insane A total of $51,842.84 has been expended at the hospital at Lincoln for extraordinary purposes. Included in these expenditures are the erection and furnishing of an addition to the main building which, when occupied in the near fu - ture, will provide additional facilities for 50 or more pa - tients, and will also afford a general dining-room for male patients much more convenient than the one now in use. This new addition has been connected with one of the de - tached buildings by a permanent structure serving the pur - pose of an enclosed walk or passageway on the first floor to be used in inclement weather and an open walk from the second floor of the two buildings thus joined, and permitting the passage conveniently of attendants and employees from one building to the other at all times and at all seasons. There have also been constructed sun porches on the east of the building thus connected for both the second and third floors, these porches from experience having been found to be a great convenience and adding greatly to the comfort and welfare of the inmates. An officers' kitchen has been constructed and new tunnels built to connect the new addi - tion containing the dining-room with the general kitchen, and there has also been a general overhauling, changing and extension of the mains for heating and for water supplies, as well as the installation of additional plumbing required by reason of such changes. The entire main building has </seg>
            <seg id="p018">18 SECOND BIENNIAL REPORT OF also been re-wired for purposes of safety at an expense of approximately $3,000. While there was appropriated but $30,000 for new buildings at this institution we have been able to make the improvements above refewed to by finding other available funds at our command, including the institution cash fund. Hospital for the Iniane of Nebraska At the Norfolk institution a total expenditure of Â§âº3,877.82 of an extraordinary character has been made â¢ing the biennium. This expenditure was for the purpose finishing a new extension or annex to one of the ward buildings for male patients ; also the construction of a new ward building for women patients which is nearing comple - tion ; and other improvements in the way of remodeling and adding to the laundry building so as to increase its capac - ity ; constructing a small cottage for the residence of one of the physicians ; a considerable extension of the system of tunnels and of heating mains, and of a sewer system for the purpose of properly disposing of the sewerage at this institution. Other improvements seem to be required in the way of a new ward building for male patients, increasing the capacity to properly house and care for 100 more in - mates than is the capacity at the present time or will be when the womens' ward is completed, and which will per - mit a total population at this institution of 750 to 800 in - mates; also extensive repairs in the way of remodeling or constructing anew the power house and installing therein new machinery and boilers, all of which are imperatively necessary in order that the work may be carried on economi - cally and satisfactorily. Hospital for Tuberculous I At this hospital a total of $61,588.55 has been expended the purpose of furnishing and equipping, as well as for construction of a new hospital building which is now ipied and accommodates 50 additional patients; a new er house and laundry building, together with laundry </seg>
            <seg id="p019">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 19 machinery and equipment ; the extension of the heating sys - tem to connect the power house with the new laundry build - ing ; also additional sewerage necessitated by these improve - ments. Further changes, improvements and repairs are con - templated for the coming biennium and are referred to in our estimate of appropriations required for this insti - tution. Orthopedic Hospital A total of $25,859.29 has been expended at this insti - tution for furniture and equipment, permanent improve - ments to grounds and buildings, and a new building con - structed thereon. The principal part of this expenditure is for the completion, furnishing and equipping of the new hospital building which has been completed during the cur - rent biennium and which has been occupied for something over twelve months, and which has added greatly in facili - tating the work carried on at this institution and increas - ing the capacity to properly care for those who come there for treatment.

State Penitentiary There has been expended at this institution for pur - poses of the kind under consideration $92,831.87. Of this amount $5,000 was expended by reason of an appropria - tion by the last Legislature on account of a death of an em - ployee occasioned at the time of the outbreak occurring at that institution in 1912; and $23,969.66 for the purchase of machinery, equipment and stock, manufactured and un - manufactured, of the Handcraft Furniture Company, the business of which has been acquired by the State and which is now being operated on behalf of and for the benefit of the State.

While this work is not quite complete it is nearing the end and it is believed that with the facilities thus provided by the State and for the pur - t mentioned, the work and result will be found satis - ry as well 'as economical and that the State is now to generate its own electric current in sufficient quan - tity to meet all of the requirements of the institutions re - ferred to for a much less sum than it could possibly hope to do from outside sources. Nebraska Industrial Home The sum of $11,380.38 was expended for extraordinary purposes at this institution, the main part of which was for the purpose of covering the two main buildings with a coat of stucco with a view of preserving each of them and pre - venting further deterioration of the brick of which the original construction is made and which shpwed plainly indications of disintegration and decay. The improvement has greatly added to the appearance of the buildings as well as, it is hoped, to render them safe, durable and inhab - itable for generations to come. There has also been con - structed an addition to one of the buildings in the way of a nursery, a sun porch and an extension to the kitchen which has greatly added to the convenience of the work carried on as well as the comfort of inmates and employees. Nebraska School for the Blind $3,602.11 was expended at this institution in the way of furniture and equipment, and improvements to build - ings which were of a general character and serve the pur - pose of keeping the institution in good repair and prevent </seg>

No extraordinary appropriation was made nor was any required to keep the buildings and grounds in a satisfactory condition. Nebraska School for the Deaf $73,626.06 was expended at this institution for extra - ordinary purposes, $5,000 of which was appropriated for the purpose of paying a personal claim for injury and the remainder of which was used in the construction and fur - nishing of a new primary building, remodeling and enlarg - ing the power plant, extending the heating and water mains, the building of an ice house and refrigeration plant and general repairs in the way of painting and improving other - wise the buildings already constructed ; also a complete re - wiring of the main building has been made as the old wiring was condemned as unsafe and liable to result in a fire which might destroy the entire building. With the removal of the old and the construction of a new barn, and some re-grading the physical condition of this institution will be placed in a very complete and satisfactory state. Nebraska Home for Dependent Children The sum of $24,567.53 has been expended for the con - struction of a new building near the Orthopedic Hospital and for the purchase of the necessary land, with a view of bring - ing together all of the dependent children until temporary or permanent homes can be found. These now number 80 or more. 'These wards of the State are at present being boarded at the expense of the State in private residences throughout the city and its suburbs. It is believed that when this building is ready for occupancy and the children brought together therein that the new arrangement will greatly facilitate the finding of homes, which is the ulti - mate object of the law for these homeless ones, and will also permit the carrying on of the work and administering of the affairs of the institution much more economically than can be done at the present time. </seg>
            <seg id="p022">22 SECOND BIENNIAL REPORT OF INSTITITION CASH FUND We present with this report a detailed and itemized statement of the amounts received in the institution cash funds of the different institutions and deposited in the State Treasury to the credit of such institutions, the amounts expended therefrom and the balance on hand November 30, 1916, the end of the biennial period. These funds accumulate from time to time from different sources in the different institutions and are reported monthly by the sup - erintendents showing in detail from what sources received and the amounts going to make up the total which consists of various items of many different characters but which in the main represent the proceeds of the sales of farm prod- Ei, live stock, old and discarded machinery and supplies other property of no further use to the institution, h funds are, after being so reported, immediately de - posited in the Treasury to the credit of the institution pro- King them and for its benefit in the general support and ntenance and carrying on of the work generally and for which no specific provisions have been made by an appro - priation by the Legislature There are also included some other sources of revenue hereafter specifically adverted to. From the attached report it will be observed that the total receipts for the biennial period from all sources belonging to the cash funds of the different institutions amount to the sum of $258,565.25, and that the total expenditures for the same period amount to the sum of $130,710.06, leaving a total balance on hand to the credit of these different insti - tutions November 30, 1916, of $149,069.44. In addition to the sources from which these funds are received as above noted, it should be stated that of the in - stitution cash fund received by the Nebraska Institution for Feeble-Minded Youth, a large amount thereof, as shown by the table presented herewith, was received under the provisions of the law from the different counties from which the inmates were committed to that institution, and from the relatives of such inmates who are legally chargeable, and which are paid in for the purpose of supplying such in - mates with clothing and which is denominated a ''Clothing </seg>
            <seg id="p023">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 23 Fund." Under the law the counties or individuals properly chargeable are required to pay annually for each individual the sum of $40 or such a part thereof as may be necessary to supply such inmate with clothing, the State thus being relieved of that portion of the expense necessary in the maintenance of the inmates at that institution ; and, while heretofore this fund has been under the control of the au - thorities of the institution and purchases from time to time made as needed and separate from the general business of maintaining- the institution out of the appropriations made by the Legislature, this board on May 1, 1916, adopted a policy of having this fund deposited to the credit of the institution cash fund and denominated a "Clothing Ac - count" and the purchase of clothing for the inmates placed upon the same basis as like purchases for all of the other institutions, the payment therefor being made out of this identical fund and not otherwise. While the method of do - ing the business has been thus changed and modified to the advantage, we think, of the inmates of the institution and while under the present rule every item of expenditure for this as well as all other purposes is required to be drawn from the State Treasury on properly executed and verified vouchers fully itemizing the nature of the purchase and the amount of the same, it still leaves the situation as it has heretofore existed in that in making up our estimates for the necessary sums for the maintenance of this institution no account has been taken of the amount required to pur - chase the clothing needed by the inmates, this being pro - vided for as above stated and thus reducing to that extent what would otherwise be necessary to be included in the general appropriation for maintenance. Also with reference to the three hospitals for \he in - sane there is collected and paid into the respective institu - tion cash funds from relatives and friends and thode leg - ally chargeable under the law passed by the last Legislature, being Chapter 134 of the Session Laws of 1915, mainte - nance charges for such inmates as have the means to pay the same or whose relatives who are legally liable for the support and maintenance of such inmates possess 9uch </seg>
            <seg id="p024">24 SECOND BIENNIAL REPORT OF means ; and also as to the hospital for the insane at Lincoln the collections made pursuant to Section 7288 of the Revised Statute of Nebraska called "Receipts for the Care of Dipso - maniacs." While these laws have not been in force for a sufficient length of time to estimate with a reasonable de - gree of certainty what would be the probable income annu - ally on account of collections from maintenance and for the care of dipsomaniacs, a careful and conservative estimate leads us to believe that we can safely count upon at least $60,000 for the coming biennial period which, to that ex - tent, reduces the necessity for that amount of approQria - tions for maintenance generally. We have accordingly in our estimated expenditures for these three institutions for the coming biennium reduced the total sums, which seemed to be necessary, by the following amounts: For the Ingle - side Hospital for the Insane, $30,000; for the Nebraska Hospital for the Insane at Lincoln, $20,000; and for the Hospital for the Insane of Nebraska at Norfolk, $10,000; or a total of $60,000 for the three institutions. It is also to be observed that with reference to the in - stitution cash fund of the State Penitentiary there is paid therein besides the funds derived from the ordinary sources the proceeds of the labor of the inmates of that institution where they can be put to profitable employment, a portion of which goes to the permanent benefit of the State in re - ducing expenditures generally and a portion to the individ - ual, whose labor resulted in the receipt of the money, for the support of those dependent upon him or to create a fund for his benefit held by the Warden as trustee and fixed by rule of this Board to be paid under the provisions of the law after the time of the expiration of fiis term of service to the State., There is also included in this fund the proceeds of the sale of all of the manufactured materials produced by the Handcraft Furniture Company and sold to the trade generally, amounting in the aggregate on November 30, 1916, to $46,802.56, and in this connection it is to be said that, while all of the proceeds of the sale of the output of the business carried on at that institution under the name of the Handcraft Furniture Company is deposited in the </seg>
            <seg id="p025">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 25 State Penitentiary institution cash fund, when so deposited it is immediately resorted to and used for the payment of the running expenses of that industry including salaries and wages of employees, a percentage paid to the inmates who are employed therein, and for the purchase of raw material out of which are manufactured the articles produced and sold, and for machinery and supplies of all kinds necessary in carrying on the business so that, as to this fund so de - posited in the institution cash fund, it really and in fact constitutes a working capital and is used as occasion re - quires for carrying on the business generally connected with that industry. For a detailed and itemized statement of all of the re - ceipts of all kinds including the appropriations made by the Legislature and all of the expenditures of every description and which have been heretofore referred to in a general way, we refer to the tabulated statements hereto attached consisting of several different tables which by study and comparison will disclose very fully the financial workings and conditions of the several institutions mentioned therein. INCREASED COST OF SUPPLIES At the very threshold of the biennium just passed the Board was confronted with the increasing cost of the â sup - plies and materials required to be purchased by it in the prosecution of the business connected with the management of the several institutions under its control. Later on this tendency toward higher prices grew at an astonishingly rapid rate and it soon became apparent that the total outlay compelled to be made for the support and maintenance of the institutions, if such prices continued, would be in a very appreciably larger sum than that which has heretofore been required ; in fact, when in many instances the Board was met with quotations -fifty to one hundred per cent higher than it had been paying in some instances, in amounts that were really prohibitive, the members felt quite apprehen - sive of their ability to get through the biennial period with - out creating in the aggregate a very substantial deficiency. </seg>
            <seg id="p026">SECOND BIENNIAL REPORT OF 26 To meet this extraordinary situation the Board adopted a policy of substituting lower priced articles where it was be - lieved it could get substantially the same service or benefit, and refraining as far as possible from the purchase of larger quantities than absolutely necessary of the more costly sup - plies and altogether wherever possible. Upon the whole we are glad to note that even though we have been com - pelled to pay much higher prices than what would be re - garded as normal, yet we will, we think, be able to get through the biennial period with a substantial margin yet remaining to the credit of the State as to the aggregate of all appropriations and other receipts, and all expenditures required to be made. It is quite true that as to four of the different State institutions deficits will appear but in no in - stance in a very large or unusual sum; in fact, the total of these deficits for the biennial period will fall far snort of those we had to contend with two years ago. It is also interesting to observe that where these deficits have oc - curred they are generally at institutions where opportuni - ties and facilities for raising produce and foodstuffs for the benefit of such institutions are altogether absent or in exist - ence only in a small degree; while at the other institutions where we have been enabled to employ the inmate labor in farm and garden operations, in caring for livestock, keeping up dairy herds, etc., we are enabled to get through the bien - nium without deficits which otherwise would undoubtedly FARMING OPERATIONS At all of the institutions where the inmates are able to labor to a greater or less degree much of such work is utilized in the raising of farm and garden produce and other articles for food and forage consumed at the institution, and with, a view of obtaining the best results it has been the policy of the Board to encourage in every way within its means the careful, intelligent and scientific use of methods and labor to the end that the largest possible output be made of those things so useful and common in the support of the institutions, and thereby in a large measure avoiding </seg>
            <seg id="p027">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 27 the necessity of buying the same supplies in the open mar - ket. Two years ago the Legislature made provision for the purchase of additional farm lands for the Nebraska Institu - tion for Feeble-Minded Youth, the Hospital for the Insane of Nebraska at Norfolk, and in a smaller way at the Hos - pital for Tuberculous at Kearney. All of these investments, we are confident, have proven profitable to the State and have been the means of enabling these institutions â and especially the two first named â to increase the production of farm and garden to a very appreciable extent. At the other institutions, notably the industrial school for boys, the hospitals for the insane at Lincoln and Ingle - side, the penitentiary, and the home for soldiers and sailors at Burkett, farming operations, the caring for dairy herds and the feeding of live stock, especially hogs, have all been engaged in on a large scale and have been the means of bringing in large returns to these several institutions, far more than paying the costs of the operation of such indus - tries. Over and above this the employment of the inmates in the manner now under consideration is believed to be more healthful, wholesome and beneficial than almost any other way in which their labor can be utilized. Farm lands are growing dearer in Nebraska from year to year and it is hardly to be hoped that the State will ever be able to purchase farm lands adjacent to these institutions for any less than will now have to be paid and the prob - abilities all are for increasing prices as time goes on. At the penitentiary especially is there pressing necessity for additional farm land on which the inmates of that institu - tion can be profitably and beneficially employed. We have been compelled, in order to carry on these farming opera - tions in a small way, considering the labor at our command, to rent high priced land and for which a high cash rent is required to be paid, and sometimes a share of the crop or a crop rent which yields to the owner as high as $20 to $30 an acre as rent for the land thus used by the State. With the view of improving conditions at that institution in this respect, the Board found itself enabled to secure an option on a good piece of farm land convenient to the penitentiary </seg>
            <seg id="p028">SECOND BIENNIAL REPORT OF 28 at a very reasonable figure and by the payment only of a nominal sum, viz., $100, for such option which will expire April 1st, next. There are in this tract of land 120 acres ; the same is in a good state of cultivation and can be secured for the sum of $20,000, and we have recommended in our estimate an appropriation with a view of obtaining title to such land for the benefit of this institution. I Notwithstanding the acreage owned at the Hospital for Insane of Nebraska at Norfolk and that acquired two irs ago, that institution in order to put to useful purpose : labor of the inmates, is required annually to rent farm - ; land convenient to the institution and for which in many tances a very high rental is paid especially where a share the crop is received by the owner. On one piece of land, â¢ecially well adapted to the purpose, a large acreage of :atoes was planted and cultivated by the institution, the ner receiving a share as rent, the result being that with I extraordinarily good yield and the high price of this pie article, the state could have applied a very substan- I payment on the price of the land out of the proceeds the crop which it delivered as the owner's share for rent. tThe Ingleside Hospital for the Insane can also utilize dvantage additional farm lands and some steps were n by the last Legislature looking to that end but this not result in any appropriation for that purpose. tAs to - both of these institutions, we are not in a posi - to recommend specifically the purchase of any partic - tract of land and yet, should we find an opportunity ng the sitting of the Legislature, we would feel it in - bent upon us to call to its attention the desirability of purchase of any such lands that may be found conven - ly situated and offered at a reasonable price. In the reports of the superintendents of the different institutions will be found a resume of the products of the farm and garden, stock raising, dairy farms, etc., the aggre - gate of which amounts to a surprising figure, and we espe - cially call attention to these reports, disclosing^as they do, the work accomplished along these lines. </seg>
            <seg id="p029">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 29 PENITENTIARY FURNITURE INDUSTRY On the 24th of May, 1915, the Legislature having pre - viously made provisions therefor, the Board acquired the business, property and good-will of the Handcraft Furni - ture Company which had been carried on in this institution by a private corporation for several years and in the opera - tion of which the labor of a portion of the inmates of the penitentiary was utilized in the manufacture of the product put upon the market by this company. The consideration paid for all of the property thus acquired including machin - ery, equipment, raw material and the manufactured articles on hand amounted to the sum of $21,043.75. The amount paid in acquiring this plant was more than one-half less than the amount asked for at the beginning of the negotia - tions for the purchase of the same. In obtaining the business the Board proceeded to take a full and complete inventory and after ascertaining as well as it could the fair value of all of such property, proposed to acquire the same from the company then owning it by the payment of the amount thus found to be its value which was finally accepted and the property turned over to the State. After the acquisition of the property many changes were made, some much needed machinery and equipment acquired, facilities for operating the business improved and the work since carried on by the State for its own benefit has gradually grown in proportions and volume until the present time. The principal part of the business thus carried on is the manufacture and sale of furniture of many kinds, con - structed chiefly by the use of reed and fibre which is ob - tained in the market as needed and at prices as advanta - geous as can be found. At the beginning there were employed in this depart - ment the first month of its operation 52 men which number has gradually increased until the month of November, 1916, shows the employment of 115 men who are inmates of the penitentiary, and in addition to the number mentioned there are an average of 15 apprentices per month who do not appear upon the pay-roll. The men are paid a small stipend </seg>
            <seg id="p030">30 SECOND BIENNIAL REPORT OF for the work performed by them which is used for the support of those dependent upon them or is saved as a fund for their own benefit when they are discharged from the institution. The total sum thus paid to the inmates working in this department to November 30, 1916, or for a period of eighteen months, aggregated $5,659.68. In addition to the amount thus paid the men in the employ of the State who are inmates of the penitentiary, there is a pay-roll made up of a general manager, a book-lreeper and three foremen of the three different departments, amounting to the sum of $525.00 per month, and all of which has been paid out of the earnings of the business. Manufacturing conditions for twelve months and more havo been unfavorable and difficult by reason of the con - stant advance of nearly all of the raw materials used in the manufacture of the output of the plant. In fact these ad - vances have been so marked and persistent that selling prices have had to be correspondingly advanced by an in - crease of 10 r /r on two different occasions, the last of which, however, not taking effect until January 1, 1917. tThe products of the department are shipped into ;een various states but particularly into the states of â aska, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Colorado, Missouri, Okla - i and Texas. A special effort has been made not only to prosecute the work diligently and promptly meet all demands for the pur - chase of the output of the department, but also to give espe - cial attention to the quality of the article produced in order that merit and quality shall be leading features in the dis - posal of the manufactured article to the public generally. tThe wages paid to the men thus employed have helped tly to bring about a satisfied condition and to encourage ough work of the best quality and to make them satis - and contented. A complete inventory taken during the month of No - vember discloses that the State has on hand at the present time in this department property in the way of equipment, office supplies, supplies generally in the way of raw material and finished stock, of the value of $38,447.69. It is also </seg>
            <seg id="p031">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 31 disclosed by the report of the general manager that for the period of eighteen months during which this department has been operated by the State and after paying all expenses of operation as above narrated, there was a net gain in the business of $10,071.74. The showing of the work thus done and under the circumstances, is regarded as reasonably satisfactory and it is believed that so long as the State may go into the market generally in order to dispose of its pro - duct that the business can be carried on, furnishing em - ployment for 175 to 200 of the inmates of the penitentiary at a profit; that the employment will be beneficial to the inmates by reason of the character of the same and that it is found agreeable and pleasant and of such a nature as that by applying oneself diligently the necessary skill to perform the work satisfactorily may be obtained by an apprenticeship of from 15 to 30 days. It is also found that many become very proficient in the work assigned to them and to such there is paid in accordance with the graduated scale adopted by the Board a larger wage than that paid to the beginners or those showing only ordinary skill and ability in the work in which they are engaged. In connection with the reed and fibre department there is carried on a hard wood department employing only a few men and engaged particularly in making chairs, tables, cabinets, etc., which may be used in the other institutions of the State. No attempt has been made to manufacture furni - ture in this department to be placed on the market gener - ally. It furnishes employment to those who are especially skilled in cabinet and hard wood work. In determining the amount that should be paid by the institution receiving the benefit of work of this department, the Board has endeav - ored to fix a price at about the same figure it would be com - pelled to pay were it to purchase, as it does other like sup - plies, from wholesalers and jobbers. The operation of this department shows a loss of $944.22 but it is to be noted in this connection that, while this is the loss as shown by the books, yet the State has found useful and profitable employ - ment for a few who were especially well equipped and has expended a considerable sum for machinery and equipment, </seg>
            <seg id="p032">32 and that the institutions receiving the output have been benefitted to the extent shown by the books to be a loss in its operation. REFORMATORY I The Legislature of 1913 provided for the establishment a reformatory for first offenders and appropriated 0,000 therefor. During the period which intervened be - en the organization of this Board on July 1, 1913, and assembling of the Legislature in January,1915, members ;he Board had visited a large number of proposed sites had secured necessary information preliminary to locat - the institution, but had not in fact selected a location. i Board therefore reported to the Legislature its doings this behalf and recommended that the said sum of 0,000 be re-appropriated and that $50,000 additional be ropriated for equipping and maintaining the institution, s Legislature, however, thought best not to follow this jmmendation and the original appropriation meantime *ed. The State is, therefore, still without a reformatory. I It is understood that the Legislature which will as - ble in January, 1917, will be asked to provide for the blishment of one or more State custodial farms for the &gt; of mis-demeanants. Such a measure meets with our lial approval. The weakest and least creditable of all machinery connected with the administration of justice le prevalent system of jails and lock-ups. It is an iilogi - and pernicious survival from the dim past and should ! way to a more rational and constructive method. Such an institution as is proposed will help to solve the problem of the dipsomaniac and will relieve the Nebraska Hospital for the Insane at Lincoln, from the custody of such alcoholic and drug addicts as have no desire to secure relief from bad habits and need disciplinary no less than hospital tWe suggest that in the establishment of such a custodial i provision be made for the admission thereto both by mitment and by transfer of such persons as would be </seg>

The prison population of Nebraska is not large, com - pared with that of other states. The number of those eli - gible to a reformatory is relatively small. Yet there should be proper provision made for these, however few in number. Such provision, it seems to us, could well be made, for the present and for several years to come, in connection with the establishment of the State custodial farm, and we so recommend. COMMISSION FOR THE BLIND The Legislature at its last session appropriated the sum of $2,000 for the relief of the blind and provided that the money so appropriated as well as any funds contributed for such purpose, should be expended only under the authority and supervision of the Board of Commissioners of State Institutions. The Superintendent of the Nebraska School for the Blind and the Executive Board of the Nebraska Association of Workers for the Blind were constituted an Advisory Hoard to carry out the purposes of the act. The statute specified the following lines of work to be undertaken : (a) To collect, interpret and publish data relating to the cause, prevention and cure of blindness; the means employed or advocated for ameliorating the condition of the blind ; the number, location, character and condition of the blind of this State. (b) To provide home teaching for the blind. (c) To encourage home industry by assisting the workers in obtaining supplies and in finding a market. Cd) To assist worthy and competent persons in finding remunerative employment suited to their needs and capacities. (e) To assist worthy and talented persons in pur - suing studies more advanced or more technical than those offered by the Nebraska School for the Blind. </seg>

Har - of the school and himself totally blind, field Mr. Harris entered upon his duties August 1, 1915, and has traveled over a large part of the State, securing infor - mation concerning the blind and those whose vision is seri - ously defective, and making a census of their number, loca - tion, character and condition, as prescribed by the statute. He found a total of 404 blind persons, of whom 129 are self-supporting, 121 partially self-supporting and 154 en - tirely dependent. Of the total number 76 are minors and most of these, of course, are dependent. I Through his instrumentality several have been enabled enter the Nebraska School for the Blind and are now â oiled as pupils. To a limited extent Mr. Harris has also ie some home teaching of the blind, and with the co - iration of women's clubs and other associations and in - iduals has accomplished something in the way of provid - : a place for the sale of articles made by the blind. tn one instance a loan of $75 at a nominal rate of ;st has made it possible for a blind man to start a little for the making of brooms. The Advisory Board was organized to solicit and re - ceive contributions either for immediate use or for endow - ment, but the receipts from this source have been insignifi - cant, amounting during the biennium to only $12.05. The work is evidently regarded as a matter of public duty rather than of private charity and no substantial sums may be expected from voluntary subscriptions. tWe feel that considerable good has been accomplished that there is a field for further activity which will fit not only the blind but the State at large. The statistics have been gathered for the most part, and future efforts should be directed chiefly toward bringing to self-support the adult blind who are now wholly or par - tially dependent.

To accomplish any appreciable results along these lines will require the services of two persons â a woman who could teach cooking, sewing, weaving, basket-making and other household arts, and a man who could instruct in broom-making, net and hammock making, piano-tuning and other occupations adapted to the blind. We therefore recommend the continuance of the com - mission for the blind and an appropriation of $4,000 to carry out the purposes outlined. STERILIZATION LAW Among the preventive measures enacted by the last Legislature was a law authorizing the sterilization, in proper cases, of certain classes of state wards. The law itself is very conservative. It recognizes the fact that there is no need of such a procedure in the case of any person who requires permanent custodial care. It applies, therefore, only to those who may be eligible to parole or discharge. Neither is it compulsory. It presents as an alternative a continuation of institutional custody. It applies only to feeble-minded and insane persons, in what - ever State institution found. After the bill became a law a Board of Examiners of Defectives was appointed consisting of the superintendents of the three hospitals for the insane, the institution for feeble-minded, and the orthopedic hospital. This Board organized with Dr. B. F. Williams as chairman and Dr. W. S. Fast as secretary, and adopted suitable rules to govern their procedure. The board of examiners has held several sessions and has investigated and passed upon the cases of 89 persons, of whom 40 were men and 49 women. Of the total number examined, 46 were authorized to </seg>
            <seg id="p068">36 SECOND BIENNIAL REPORT OF be paroled without sterilization ; 35 were ordered to be ster - ilized as a condition precedent to their parole; and 8 were held for further consideration. Of the 35 persons, in whose cases it was ordered that no parole be granted unless after sterilization, 15 were operated upon. Of these 9 were men and 6 women. No operation had been performed upon the remaining 20 on November 30, 1916, the close of the period covered by the report. Of this latter number it was considered that several were not suitable to be paroled and hence that an operation was not advisable nor proper. kit is gratifying to learn that good results have been ined in all cases operated and that in no instance have ulties or complications arisen. â  tThe Board of Examiners has acted very conservatively considerately, as its report transmitted herewith shows, h the thought of protecting the individual and safe - â¢ding the interests of the State". I The feeble-minded are recognized "as the most pro - class and potentially the most dangerous from the ldpoint of race standards". The Board therefore "un - itatingly authorized the sterilization of the male feeble - ded wherever application was made" in proper cases, but ng to the more complicated surgical procedure and the ger of prostitution and the spread of venereal disease vocated custodial care rather than sterilization in the &gt; of the feeble-minded female". In case of insanity the ird was guided largely by the wishes of the patient and itives. I The examinations were confined to wards of the State the several hospitals for the insane and in the institution â¢ feeble-minded. I The law is applicable also to persons who are inmates the penitentiary, industrial schools and industrial home, such persons are found to be either insane or feeble - nded and are in other respects fit subjects for such a pro - lure. We believe the law is a wise one and that, administered conservatively and rationally as is being done by the pres- </seg>
            <seg id="p069">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 37 i ent Board of Examiners of Defectives, it will prove a val - uable factor in diminishing, in some degree at least, the enormous burden of insanity and feeble-mindedness which the State must bear. VISITS The Board has kept in touch with the several institu - tions not only by means of frequent official visits by the members of the Board but also through visits by the secre - tary and accountant of the Board who have been sent from time to time to inspect supplies and to audit accounts, to the end that the Board and the institutions might co-operate more effectively in carrying on the work. A detailed state - ment of the visits made by the Board is attached to and made a part of this report. CONFERENCES Semi-annual conferences have been instituted whereby the executive and other members of the staffs of the several institutions may meet with the members of the Board to discuss the affairs and the work of the institutions. Such conferences were held in Lincoln October 27th and 28th, 1915; May 25th and 26th, 1916; and November 15th and 16th, 1916. Papers were read covering a variety of topics, profes - sional and administrative, and interesting and profitable discussions followed. The meetings were helpful in many ways and have manifested a gratifying spirit of unification and mutual co-operation in our common task. It is expected that these conferences will become a permanent feature of the work. Superintendents, members of the medical staffs and members of the Board have participated also in meetings of several of the medical societies of the State, thus bring - ing the work of the institutions into a better understanding and closer relations with the medical profession. </seg>
            <seg id="p070">SECOND BIENNIAL REPORT OF 38 ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS It is made the duty of this Board, among other things, to study " the conditions, causes, prevention and cure 01 crime, pauperism, insanity, epilepsy, imbecility, evil home conditions and environment" with a view "to diminish pauperism, defectiveness and degeneracy." Society has been aroused to the necessity of the repres - sion of the traffic in alcoholic liquors and in harmful and habit-producing drugs and drastic restrictive legislation has been enacted to check these evils. There is another fruitful source of physical and mental degeneration which likewise, should receive attention â the venereal diseases. tThe extent to which these diseases are prevalent, as â d by the highest authorities, is almost unbelievable and â¢ terrible consequences are manifest in our hospitals other institutions. I It would seem not unreasonable to subject these ail - ts to at least as close supervision as other and less dan - us infectious diseases. We accordingly renew our ler recommendation that physicians and druggists be ired under severe penalties to report to the Department ealth all cases of syphilitic and gonnorrheal infection ng under their observation and that authority to en - &gt; quarantine against infected persons should be lodged le proper medical authorities. The proposal accords the views expressed by the best alienists and neuro - ts of America. A further consideration of the subject leads us again to recommend an amendment to our statutes whereby the age when a girl attains her majority should be raised from eifirhteen to twenty-one years. </seg>
            <seg id="p071">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 39 There is no sufficient reason why a girl should be eman - cipated and become her own mistress at eighteen while her brother must remain a minor until he shall become twenty - one. Indeed, the girl of eighteen, nineteen or twenty is at a peculiarly critical period of her life and often stands in special need of wise over-sight, careful protection and par - ental authority. INSTITUTION REPORTS We are transmitting herewith biennial reports made by the superintendents or chief executive officers of the differ - ent institutions covered by the foregoing report. These reports show with considerable fullness and in detail the workings of these several institutions, the conditions pre - vailing and what has been accomplished in general by the work thus carried on. Much that is of value and interest concerning each of the institutions will be found by a close examination of these reports, which also give the views of the different heads as to the future needs and requirements in the further prosecution of the work and the, carrying out of the purposes and objects of the law creating the same. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 'We wish to express our appreciation to the Governor for the interest manifested by him at all times in the work connected with these several institutions, his valuable sug - gestions and counsels regarding many of the multifarious matters that are constantly arising, and the earnest support and hearty co-operation given in rendering the work suc - cessful in the greatest possible degree.

The office force working with the Board in the prosecution of its business has remained pactically the same since the organization of the Board and we are indebted to each and all of them for the faithful and efficient service rendered and the assistance given in the performance of their respective duties, involving, as the work does, a high degree of accuracy, application and skill in order to overcome and avoid irregularities and mistakes and render the record of our transactions comprehensive and complete in all its details.
