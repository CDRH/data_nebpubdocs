A karfe pi-opori ion nf I he apple orchards in Nebraska have lieen neglected to such an extent that they are do longer profitable i&lt;&gt; their owners. This is tmjutMly tine of the small home or chards. In most cases the irees were |ilanied too close together and in later years were not given the proper attention with re - gard to pruning, spraying, and cultivation. The trees were allowed to grow at will, and it resulted in the branches Incoming interlocked. 1'nder such ohm petit ion they grew entirely too high. The tujMs became dense and a considerable portion of the wood died. Where these orchards have not l&gt;een cultivated to conserve the moisture, or have been used as hog and calf pastures, the trees are making but little, if any. growth. The numerous insect ami fungous enemies now so common in Nebraska find a welcome home in such orchards. The invariable result is that the fruit harvested from such trees is small, gnarled, poorly colored, and infested with fungi and worms. Despite this neglected condition, many of these orchards can l&gt;e made to bear prolitable crops of large, well-colored fruits free from worms and fungous blemishes. The principal things to lie kept in mind in renovating an old orchard are: (1) The trees should be relieved of a considerable portion of their wood; (2) iu must cases, the head should l»e lowered several feet; (It I the cankerous growths should be treated; (4 I the ground' should be cultivated: and (51 the trees should be properly sprayed. PRUNING NEGLECTED TREES. old apple trees that have not been pruned should have |iei - liaps one-fourth of the wood removed in order to stimulate them into a more vigorous growth. This should l&gt;e done while the trees are dormant, preferably a few weeks before growth starts in the spring. All dead, dying, ami crossed branches should lie cut out. In addition to this, several limbs from 1 to 4 inches iu diameter should l&gt;e removed. This will open up the crowded center and will relieve the tree of some of its surplus wood. When this is EXTENSION BIL. NO 30, AGR. KXP. STATION OF XEHB. </seg>

It may lie necessary to use a ladder for this part of the operation. One should never leave stubs when pruning. If left they will dry out and afford a means of entrance for wood rots. Always saw off a branch Hush with the trunk or larger limb from nkl it grww*. Never use an ax for pruning. If the orchard is worth pnuing. it is worth the price of a pruning saw and shears. All wounds an inch or more in diameter should be painted widiin a few days after the pruning is done. Almost any paint will answer this purpose, but white lead mixed with boiled linseed oil is recnai mended. A severe pruning, as outlined above, will stimulate a rank growth of water sprouts the following summer. These should be cut off either during the growing season or the follow in}; winter in order to force the grumth into ihe bearing vihm] iliat lias lieen left. LOWERING THE TOP. Apple trees that have been planted close together and allowed to grow unattended will in most cases be so high as to reader spraying and harvesting next to impossible. Often it is advisable to cut out every other tree and to lower the heads of the remain ing ones several feet. When lowering the top of a tall tree one should be careful to cut back to a healthy side branch in order u&gt; avoid leaving a stub. It is often necessary to cut back several of the tall leaders in this way. The cut should be made slanting so as not to hold water. TREATMENT FOR CANKER. &lt; 'anker is a term applied to any diseased condition of the bark or wood of a tree. There are several diseases common lo the apple orchard that cause cankerous growths upon the tree. The one most injurious in Nebraska is known as the Illinois or blister canker. It has developed rapidly in the State the past live years. This disease is easily recognized by the blisterlike protuberances which appear around the point of infection. Fig. A illustrates ■ typical infection after the irregular spots, surrounded by a dark ring, have been formed. These circular spots produce spore* which upon l&gt;eing scattered by the wind or other agencies may cause new infections. Large wounds left unpainted, stubs left in pruning, and bruises or cracks in the bark offer favorable places for infection. Ken this canker is discovered in the orchard, it should be tly cut out or treated. If a cankered area is found upon a . the most economical method of treatment is to remove the </seg>
            <seg id="p005">5 branch and burn it. Where t lie infection is upon the base of a large limb, or upon the trunk of the tree, it may be more advisable to cut it out. When ratting out ■ cankered area, oue should be sure to make the cut deep enough that no discolored strands remain in the wood. A curved 2-inch gouge and mallet are the best tools for this purpose. Care should be taken to make the ml mine to a petal both above and below. If blunt-pointed cuts arc made, a wedge shaped piece of dead bark will result which will encourage a new infection. Disinfect the wound with corrosive i»i r Fig. A. — Typical illustrations of Illinois or blister canker. The specimen above, 1, was a three-year-old canker growing upon a live and other wise healthy tree. The specimen below, 2, was taken from a limb that had been killed by the canker. i sublimate. 1 part to 1,00(1 parts water, or with carbolic acid. 1 part to 500 parts water. It should then be covered to the edges ol the bark with liquid asphaltiun. This material should He cvenh and smoothly applied. Liquid asphalium costs about 5(1 cents a gallon, and mav In* secured thru the local druggist. Bees that are so badly cankered as to render the above treat - impracticahlc should be either cut out and burned or the red area should be kept covered with liquid asphaltum to it the spores from finding their way to other trees. The key to success in canker treatment is thorn and careful work. Pruning tools should be disinfected after pruning each tree, or after cutting thru cankered areas on any part of the tree, liy swabbing them thoroly with coal oil. CULTIVATION. Old orchards in Nebraska that have been allowed to grow for a number of years to weeds or sod should be plowed and then be given clean cultivation for Ml eta] seasons. It is well not to plow more thau 4 or 5 inches deep for fear of breaking too many of the feeding roots. Clean cultivation can then be given with a disk or </seg>

SPRAYING. The degree of success in sprayiug de]ieuds almost wholly u|»m Bthe materials are put on and how they are applied. The scal&gt; and the codling moth worm are the two chief pests for we spray in Nebraska. There are other injurious insects ingKiis diseases common to the orchard, but if the orchard lerly treated for these two the others will in a large measure Ik- controlled. The life histories of the apple scab and codling moth are so well known that fairly definite directions can be given for lighting ihein. The scab is a fungous disease that develops upon the low - ers. leaves, ami fruits of many of our l&gt;est varieties, under favor - able weather conditions. If lowering time is accompanied by a few days of cloudy, damp weather, there is likely to l»e a great dropping of the young fruits later, due to this disease working upon the young Hower stems. In addition to this loss, the re - maining fruits are likely to be rendered unfit for the market by the time they reach maturity. For controlling apple scab one of two sprays may lie used — Bordeaux mixture or commercial lime-sulphur. One is equally as effective as the other in controlling this disease. Lime-sulphur is somewhat more convenient to use in that no mixing devices are required, and there is not so much danger in russeting certain varieties like Hen Davis and Jonathan. It may lie bought upon the market in a concentrated form. Most commercial brands of lime-sulphur should he diluted about :»0 times before l&gt;eing used as a summer spray for applet. Bordeaux mixture may Ik- used instead of commercial lime-sulphur. It can be made by using fresh stone lime, copjier sulphate I bluestone^, and water. The To make it. slake the lime in a little water anil dissolve the copper sulphate separately in warm water. Dilute each of these to 25 gallons and |&gt;our them together. A tine strainer should be ■to keep the coarse particles of lime out of the sprayer. ) control the codling moth worm some poisonous spray must be used.

Elie second spraying is the most important one of the four, principal object of this application is to get the poison into alyx cups before they close, at the same time covering the &lt; and leaves with the fungicide. In order to do this, use pressure and direct the spray downward as much as possible. this application, use a type of nozzle that throws a coarse . Most nozzles have disks with different sized holes acconi ing them. The coarseness of the spray increases with the &gt;f the hole. The third and fourth sprayings should be applied as tine mists. A well-pruned tree makes a good job of spraying easier, and the actual amount of material needed is much less. K average sized apple tree, 18 or 20 years old. will require l."&gt; gallons of spray material for the four applications. Of four sprayings, three contain the fungicide, and three the isenate. One hundred trees. IS or 20 years old. will require ."&gt;ll pounds of lead arsenate and :{5 gallons of concentrated ulphui- for the four applications. In case Bordeaux mixture 1 instead of lime-sulphur. 00 pounds of lime and !&gt;0 pounds estone will lie needed. I me barrel sprayers have a capacity sufficient to care for an rd of Ml trees. A sprayer of this type may be bought fully |ied with rubber hose, extension rod. and nozzles at a price [ceeding $ 25. There are other barrel sprayers with a smaller ity that may be bought for $15. or even less. A barrel er is a good investment for the general farm. It can ha used ■ disinfect ion of the hog and chicken houses. A list of linns manufacturing sprayers, spray inatevials, and orchard tools will Ik- sent upon request. &lt;3-23-'15— KM. </seg>
