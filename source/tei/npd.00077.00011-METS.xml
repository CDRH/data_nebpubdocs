From that time on we have made our reports every year. This is the first year I have been here, and last year I couldn't come. I called the President up yesterday and told him I was coming down this morning. Our position is this, we have held our fair practically every year for the last fifteen years. We have been making it larger every year. We had a three day fair this year. We have had the matter in Court relative to the appropriation. We got the appropriation in 1929, and for 1930 :i ii il l !» :i 1 there should soon be a decision from the Supreme Court on them. We have been told and we have understood that the State Board of Agriculture has made a ruling that they can recognize only one fair to a County. We feel that we have a fair claim for that recognition from our county. , As we received the 1929 county appropriation through an error Stockville filed a certificate and we want to appeal to the merits of our claim as we think it will be decided in our favor and the appro - priations for l!)30 and 1931 and on that we should receive your rec - ognition. We would like to have this body recognized by President Reed: Mr. Lamb is there anything further on that? MR. LAMB: I have nothing further. I think this should be put to the vote of the meeting, and I will make that a motion. Motion seconded by President Reed. Mr J. Lamb moves to put this to the vote of the meeting, whether we will recognize this fair or not. MR. T. H. WAKE: I believe it is a matter of record and we are not to recognize a second fair in any county. PRESIDENT REED: I think we passed on this same matter a year ago. MR. T. H. WAKE: Isn't that the law? PRESIDENT REED: I think it is. MR. WAKE: I just asked for information. PRESIDENT REED: I think perhaps this question should be passed upon by the Credentials Committee. MR. LAMB: AVe have decided that we can't recognize but one association and Stockville is in. We decided that on the vote of the committee but we would rather leave it to the decision of the whole meeting, so far as we are concerned. PRESIDENT REED: I expect the Credentials Committee should </seg>
            <seg id="p010">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE oe Kept In session, so if anything else comes up along that line they can take care of it. We have had this report of the Credentials Com - mittee, and what do you want to do with it. MR. LAMB: I move that the report of the Credentials Committee be adopted as far as it has gone. PRESIDENT REED: I don't think it would be amiss to recognize that fair. Some years ago, and we have it in our proceedings at that time, it was put to a vote and decided not to recognize more than one fair in a county. That is according to the law. Of course, if any one insists, we can vote on it again. MR. JACKSON: May I just say a word. I think it was last year the Board passed on this same matter. And at that time the motion to recognize this fair was lost. We were adhering to that old law that we cannot recognize but one fair in one county except in two counties where dual fairs have been recognized before that rule was adopted, that is Dodge and Holt. If you want to adopt this proposi - tion to recognize this fair you would have to go back and change your constitution or repeal that we did quite a while ago. The fact that the Eustis reports hud been filed and their articles In the first instant were approved doesn't mean much unless this is passed on by the Board. If you want to make a change and reverse your policy perhaps this organization itself could consent and it would be satis - factory but I have outlined what must be done before we can rec - ognize this fair. I am sure this association would be glad to admit Eustis if all those things were done. I am not making that sugges - tion to injure any body, but that is just what we are up against from the resolution passed some time ago. PRESIDENT REED: If there is no further action to be taken in that matter and if we do not want to vote up on it, we will consider the report of the Credentials Committee as adopted.

THE PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS Ladies and Gentlemen: I do not have very much of a report to make and I haven't had time : to write anything. But I do wish off-hand to tell you a few things. The last year has been a very trying year not only to the Ne - braska State Fair but to every State Fair in the Union. We have had a great many things to contend with. Of course, we have had a great many things to contend with that have been a part of the prevailing conditions, that people out in the state have not been aware of. We had a very poor attendance at the State Fair this last fall. As you all know, we had a deficit. At that time, the deficit of the pre - ceeding years fair had not all been met or dispensed with, and that had been pretty well heralded by the newspapers. Part of the ex - pense of the preceeding year was included during the last year and it is part of the total deficit that we now face. The 1932 Fair did not come out so bad when you consider that phase of the matter. Now I think people will admit that we did as well as almost any of the fairs that are in our class, or as a matter of fact, in the United States. There were a lot of fairs that went into the red very much, more than we did. Of course, we have been criticized about a great many things. We have had a lot of suggestions offered that if we had done this or had done that we would have come out in better shape. Perhaps we might take into consideration that a lot of our experience could yet be used to guide us in the future.. We must </seg>
            <seg id="p014">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE consider that a lot of preparation for the State Fair must be made six or eight months before the Fair is held. It is pretty hard to tell what conditions will be when it comes Fair time. A lot of these attractions have to be engaged and a lot of expense has to be con - tracted and much of it taken. care of ahead of time. If we had known just what conditions would have been at Fair time we might have changed a great many of our plans, but that was impossible, us we had made contracts and we had made preparations for the Fair. You have heard a lot about cutting down the State Fair, and even 'some talk of discontinuing it, but it does not seem to me that it would be a sane or safe proposition to discontinue the fair. One reason is that the state has a Million Dollars investment out there. If we were to discontinue the fair the buildings would go down and there would be a lot of property depreciate out there and if the state ever wants to go ahead again and hold a fair it would* take an immense expense to do so. It seems to me the Legislature would not be doing the right thing unless they make an appropriation so the Board of Managers could go ahead with the 1933 State Fair. I think perhaps they can cut down a great deal on expense. I think this will be done with every State Fair in the Union. We are going to have to do that. I think it will be necessary for exhibitors and people of all classes who are interested in fairs to make sacrifices and they will be glad to do that, and we shall expect them to cooperate along that line. This is my second year as President of this Association. You know we all start at the bottom and have a sort of a ladder that we climb up in this association. I started on this about sixteen years ago. My name was presented to the convention, such as we have here at this time, when I was not present. I knew nothing about it until I saw an account of it in the newspaper. It has been a pleasure to me to work along up the ladder and now I have reached the top rung. I am ready to jump off. It has been a pleasure for me to work on the Board of Managers. I have probably made a lot of mistakes. I have done the best I could. In closing, I want to thank you people for the co-operation you have given me in the last two years. 1032 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY It Is necessary for me to show that the 1932 Nebraska State Fair Teceipts were less than any year since 1910. It was a very peculiar situation; with ideal weather conditions from the start of the fair until its close, with our exhibits and demonstrations greater both in quantity and quality, our entertainment program the best ever staged on the fair grounds except the years we had circus', and with our cribs and granaries filled with farm products, thousands of carloads of </seg>
            <seg id="p015">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE grain and stock ready for market, yet our people so financially emmu - rassed that they found it impossible to attend the state fair. Not because they had lost interest in the fair but because of lack of funds. It was evident that they wanted to attend because hundreds, both, men and women, climbed the fence, cut the wires, and used every means possible to get into the grounds without paying the admission price. It was impossible for our guards to protect us. While attending the annual meeting of the International Associa - tion of Fairs and Expositions in Chicago, a short time ago, we found. that the state fairs all over this country came out with a deficit as did all other business in general this year. Most of the fairs suffered much more than we did, in fact our state fair deficit for 1932 was not. so serious, only $20,000, but that amount in addition to our 1931 deficit makes it impossible to continue unless the state legislature: gives us financiul aid equal to the amount other state fairs are re - ceiving. It will also be necessary to amend the law so we may have - legal financial standing in order that we may legally! borrow in case of an emergency. It is possible that we might have a fire any time, in fact we have had two fires in the last two years and no money to re - build. The rates on fire insurance on empty fair buildings is pro - hibitive, in fact the state carries its own fire risk on all its institutions. . Mr. Abbott, president of the International Association of Pairs and Expositions of this country and Canada, mailed out a questionaire to all the larger fairs. This report showed that three fairs out of sixteen had an increase in attendance. Grandstand receipts were cut on an average of fifty per cent. Fourteen out of sixteen fairs showed de - crease in publicity. Fifteen out of sixteen showed 'a cut in premiums, from twenty to sixty-six per cent. Only three out of fifteen showed a profit. The fairs that reduced their main gate admissions seemed, to come out much better than those that did not. After each fair we can always see where we could have improved, the fair and then it is too late. Personally I believe it would have been the wise thing to have done to reduce our gate admission to, twenty-five cents. The psychological effect it would have had it nothing more would have been worth trying. We were criticized by many for not trying to meet conditions by reducing the admission, and other fair expenses for our patrons, as far as possible. This was the one year that people were prone to fault finding and it seemed to. be contagious and spread like a prairie fire on a windy day. We have compiled a report showing the amount received per capita after entering the outside gate for the years 1900 to 1932 in - clusive. This report is as accurate as can be made and consists of all receipts due the fair after entering the grounds, that Is, the amount </seg>
            <seg id="p016">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE taken; in for concessions and the grandstand per capita. The total grandstand and concession receipts for the last thirty-two years or during the period of time that the fair has been located in Lincoln permanently, showed to be $1,310,265.42 or an average of $39,705.01 per year. The largest amount ever taken in from these two branches of our fair was in the years 1928, 1929 and 1930. The average for these three years being $89,520.64 for concessions and grand stand receipts. The average amount received per capita from every man, woman and child after entering the front gate was as follows: the first decade or ten years was 13.9 cents, the second decade 21.4 cents and the third decade 21 cents, but the last two years was only 14.5 cents. The complete report follows showing what we may expect from our guests after they are on the inside. This does not show the total amount spent in concessions for the reason that in some, cases we re - ceive but thirty per cent of the gross receipts. Some will say that under present conditions it would bet better to close the state fair for a year or so- and we can readily see how one not familiar with the fair work might feel justitted in ■ suggesting this plan, but let us analize this proposition and see what it would mean. In the first place if we would close for a period of time, the plant would depre.ciate to such an extent that it would cost thousands of dollars to get it in condition. We would also lose our fair dates. We belong to the Middle West Fair Circuit and the dates o£ all the fairs are fixed at the annual meeting of that circuit held in Chicago in December. We happen to have Labor Day week, other fairs would much prefer that date and if we should drop out for a period of time we never would get the date again. Imagine if you please, having a city in which thirty or forty thousand people can be housed and just leaving it idle without any attention for two years. The cost in putting the buildings and equipment back into condition and provide the necessary fixtures, furniture and decorations that would without question of doubt be stolen, it would cost more than the amount we are asking for to continue the fair. Aside from the maintenance cost there are many more important aspect which makes it undesirable to suspend the state fair unless it was intended to eliminate it entirely. We must remember the fair is not just a two weeks institution but the result of year around planning, not only by the fair board alone but those that really make the fair, the breeders of horses, cattle, swine, and sheep must breed their stock so the young will come in time to fill the different classes and make a complete show at the fair; the school work, spelling, high school bands, essay contestants, as well as all the 4-H Club activities are working the year around to reach their climax at the state fair. In fact the graduating exercises for all the above educational activities are held during the fair. And then too the agriculturists and horticulturists of our state that grow and dis- </seg>
            <seg id="p017">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE jlluy such wonderful exhibits in the Agricultural Hall will be at work as soon as spring opens up cultivating the soil, selecting seed and fertilizer that will develop quality as well as beauty. The personnel of the entire exhibit force must plan and work the entire season if the fair is to be a success. So you can readily see that to eliminate the fair for a short period of time would necessitate starting all over, building from the bottom up through a new and complete organiza - tion. If ever there was a time when fairs should be held it is in times of distress when our people are inclined to see all the dark spots and overlook the bright ones. During the war Congress, at the impulse of the moment, introduced a bill to abrogate all fairs and expositions for an indefinite period. A meeting was called of the representatives of fairs to meet in Washington on July 3rd, 1918, those present besides the fair managers were Food Administrator Herbert Hoover, Secre - tary Huston, Bawer and Daniels with President Wilson. After a very short deliberation it was not only decided by the President that all fairs might continue but they must operate, realizing of course that if the fighting strength of the boys at the front was kept up the morale of those at home must be 100%. In these times of depression, or financial crisis as it should be called, we need to mobilize, organize, cooperate and pull together for the one great purpose which is that of bringing back prosperity and happiness to those that need it the most and you will find the Nebraska State Fair in the lead in progress and for the betterment of humanity. I will now present the Nebraska State Fair in the various depart - ments as it appeared this year. Stock Horses, cattle and swine were some what fewer in number but the quality was far ahead of any previous year. It was the quality stock show of Nebraska. This can be accounted for in the fact that the breeders rather than fit an entire herd to fill all classes selected a few of the tops which could be done with much less expense. Sheep and Gonts This department had several new exhibitors and was the largest sheep show for many years. The goat department entries were less than last year but the quality was much better. Poultry, Pigeons and Rabbits The superintendent of the poultry department advises us that the poultry show was one of the best both in quality and quantity. All ■of the space was taken and it was necessary to double deck to take </seg>

Public Sufety Department The minimum of accidents and the prompt clearing of traffic jams speak well for the police force. No complaints of rowdy language or unnecessary assumption of authority came to the ears of the officers at headquarters. Machinery The machinery exhibit was cut quite materially but it attracted a great deal of attention. Nearly every manufacturer was represented but not with as large a display as usual. Most every new kind of machinery was on display making a very fine show. Many new tract- , ors of the crawler type made their first exhibit. Midway Attractions These have become such a feature of the fair that the side shows are looked upon as a fixture. The features were never better but the paying visitors who turned the styles were a dissappointment to the management which displayed a calm complaisancy and admitted that it was the business of a showman to "take the bitter with the sweet." Horseshoe Tournament Most communities have, or think they have, in their midst one or more whom they boast of as a wizzard with horse shoes; not the old Dobbin type of shoe but the modern high powered two and a half pound instrument that has done much to make skill, not luck, a meas - ure of their competency. The State tournament held every year at State Fair courts is the trying out grounds for all the old and young boys who love the game and can show up well on a percentage basis. The State Fair pitching lanes, twenty in number, are the equal of any in the United States and the prize awards have been liberal. Nebraska has developed a fairly large line of players who will size up well along side any other state and could find place if given oppor - tunity in a national meet.

Revision Committee Report follows: Lincoln, Nebraska, January 17, 1933. To the Honorable Nebraska State Board of Agriculture: Gentlemen: We, the Committee on the Revision of the 1933 Premium List, beg leave to submit the following report and recommend the follow - ing changes in the premium list: Change all dates to comply with the year 1933. Change "By-Laws" — Page 17 — Number 9 as follows: "The salaries of the officers of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture shall be as follows: President, $300.00 per annum'; vice president, $200.00 per annum: treasurer, $250.00 per annum; secretary, $2,400.00 per annum; members of Board of Managers, other than mentioned above $200.00 per annum. Rules and Regulations — Page 20 — Center of page. Add at the close of paragraph beginning, "All entries competing for cash prem - iums — " the following: "and must show the same on records of the Record Association in which they are recorded. (Relative to live stock). Add a new paragraph to follow the above reading: "In case of inability to get animals recorded before the time limit, a certified copy of the animal's pedigree on regular record application blank is to be sent in with the regular entries. This certificate of application to be signed by both parties of the transaction and must confer with the Record Association records which must be had at the time of the Fair to be eligible to show." The Revision committee had had a. difficult task and we have covered it pretty thoroughly. We took the list right at the beginning and went on through. To give you a general idea, at the outset I will say this; we followed this plan. For instance, take live stock. Say on a cer - tain animal it has heretofor been $20.00 for first; $15 for second; $12 for third; $10 for fourth; $8 for fifth; $6 for sixth. We revised this by just cutting off the first, that is we cut off the $20.00. Then we moved the figure for each succeeding class or prize one space for - ward and cut off the last class or prize. For instance, that would make It $15.00 for first; $12.00 for second; $10.00 for third; $8.00 for </seg>

PRESIDENT REED: I£ any one wants to discuss any of these changes as we go along and as Mr. Miller reads them off, that will probably be the best time to do it. i Mr. Miller then presented the report and the suggested changes according to classes and Mr. A. W. Lamb reported for Agricultural Department. Your Committee recommends that the Board of Managers be empowered to make changes that may seem necessary and feasible in the Premium List and complete same in their best judgment. Respectfully submitted, A. H. MILLER, Chairman. MR; GRAFF: I move you that the Report of the Revision and as far as it has been given be adopted. I further move that the Board of Managers be given by this Convention the authority to, amend, revise or change the premium list, especially by further reductions as they shall find expedient. Motion Seconded. MR. E. R. PURCELL: I would say reduce or change. MR. GRAFF: I would give them the privilege of raising, or of changing in what ever way is. necessary. MR. E. R. PURCELL: I mean they should make such changes as they see fit for the good of the State Fair. PRESIDENT REED: You have heard the motion, duly seconded, all in favor say aye. All others say no. Vote taken. Motion carried. MR. GRAFF: Gentlemen of the Board and of this meeting: I feel that we should seriously consider the reports made today by our President (Mr. Reed) and our Secretary (Mr. Jackson), and in fact the Committee report just received this afternoon. I would like very much to stress the importance of the situation that these officers have presented to us today. I wonder whether you fully realize what it would mean to the State of Nebraska and to the individuals citizens of this state if the Nebraska State Fair should fail to function for say one or two years. Do you realize, gentlemen, that unless the State Board of Agri - culture receives some pronounced aid from this present legislature, which is now in session, that the State Board of Agriculture can not continue to function efficiently or adequately, if at all. </seg>
            <seg id="p030">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE To put on a State Pair you must expect to call on all of the allied activities of the State Board of Agriculture. I think, Mr. Secretary there Is one thing in your report which I did not get if it is in there. If it is not, I want to call attention to it, and if it is I want to empha - size and supplement it. The State Board of Agriculture, as you gentlemen must know is the parent organization of our County Fairs in this State. You and I know that if we are not able to put on a State Pair the coming fall and it will put a serious damper on the County Fairs in the State of Nebraska. People may promptly like - wise lose interest in our whole Fair machinery. The entire set-up of our Fair World may crumble and tumble down and you men who have been in the game for these many years in this task of upbuilding will have lost your labors, and you understand what an immense task of up-building it would take to restore the situation. I hope you men will be able to impress this on the present session of Nebraska Leg - islature, so they will come to realize the great importance and proper understanding of this menacing situation. And when they do under - stand it like you and I do I have no hesitancy in saying that before this Legislature adjourns that this financial problem will be met and that this great enterprize can be carried on. Men, just think of it, if this can not be done, how far we will go back. I don't believe there is one person in a thousand in the State who would really be willing to see our Fairs destroyed. Our Fairs must carry on in this State. For one reason, they are educational, when we are talking about education I want to say right here that we mean just that. While I want to remain true to pledges of cutting budgets, lowering costs and reducing taxes, I do not believe we can do so at the expense of these Pairs that we are so proud of. I believe we can find ways and means of cutting enough to allow the Leg - islature to redeem these pledges and still appropriate enough to per - mit the State Board of Agriculture to carry on. Of course, we can discover some method o£ reducing overheads and eliminating wastes here and there without destroying these essential institutions. We have reached the point where we must meet this situation, and whatever the- Legislature decides we must do, we must cut the cloth to fit the con - ditions. We will do that. The report of the Premium Revision Com - . mittee made here this afternoon has made a good start on that task. We have approved the recommendations it has submitted to this con - vention. We are glad to proceed along that line but we are not in favor of destroying an institution that the people of the State of Ne - braska must value so highly. I think we will reach a favorable re - sponse when we talk to our Legislators and it is our duty to inform them of the importance of this situation and the danger of destroying the work of these many years. </seg>
            <seg id="p031">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE FORENOON SESSION, WEDNESDAY FORENOON January 18, 1933 Roll Call of the Board disclosed all present except E. J. Mitchell and Charles Dobry, heretofore excused. BY PRESIDENT REED: We will now receive the report of the Credentials Committee. By CHAIRMAN LAMB: We have nothing more to report in addi - tion to what we tendered yesterday. I move that the committee be discharged. Motion seconded, voted upon and carried. By PRESIDENT REED: We will now receive the report of the Resolutions Committee. To the Chairman and Members of the State Associations of County Pairs: We, your committee on Resolutions, herewith submit the follow - ing: AVe call attention to the value of the County and State Pairs to the State of Nebraska, and would stress at this time the urgent need of wholehearted support of these institutions. Nebraska is chiefly an agricultural-livestock state. The Fair is the show-window of Nebraska's greatest industry. Present conditions made it imperative for the continuance of county and state aid if the fairs in Nebraska are to carry on. A decrease in the number of Ne - braska Fairs would be a step backward and the discontinuance of the State Fair, if such a thing should happen, would be a blow to the agricultural as well as all other industries of Nebraska that would take years to overcome. Therefore, we urge the necessity, greater at this time than ever before, of continued aid from the Nebraska Legislature and continued support from the county governments of the state. We recommend the use of home talent as a part of the program before the grandstand, thereby encouraging more of a cooperative spirit in outlying towns and communities. We, therefore recommend the continued support of 4-H clubs and other allied educational work .by county and state fairs. </seg>
            <seg id="p032">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE We urge the need of the greatest economy in all departments of the fair work. We endorse the greatest efforts for a continued higher type of exhibits and the best premiums possible under present conditions. We insist on the elimination of all gambling and questionable shows on all Nebraska fair grounds. It is with profound sorrow we record the death of Joseph Roberts of Fremont, in October, 1932, a past president of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture. Also of R. M. Wolcott of Central City, in November, 1932, also a past president of the State Board of Agriculture. Both of these members devoted much of their lives to county and state fair work. They were representative and useful citizens in their communities and in the state at large and were greatly beloved by their large circle of fair members and workers. Therefore, resolved that these resolutions in respect to their memories be spread upon the records of this Association and copies be sent to the families of the deceased. Respectfully submitted, E. R. PURCELL ALVAH R. HECHT. By MR. CHARLES GRAFF: Mr. Chairman I move that the report of the Resolutions Committee be adopted. Motion seconded by Purcell. By PRESIDENT REED: All in favor say aye, opposed no. Motion carried. The Secretary will call the roll of Members and Delegates. (Sec - retary calls the roll of members and delegates and reports 50 entitled to vote.) By PRESIDENT REED: We have now come to the point for the election of Members of the State Board of Agriculture. As tellers I will appoint C. Y. Thompson of Cuming County; Stanley Matzke of Seward County; and E. R. Purcell of Custer County. By FRANK WALKER: It seems to me Lancaster County has too many men placed in nomination. At this time I would like to withdraw my name and ask that it be not considered. By PRESIDENT REED: I do not think we can entertain that request because the ballots are already printed and I think we will just have to leave it to the judgment of the members in honoring Mr. Walker's request. </seg>

When the first ballot had been cast and the roll was being called by Counties it was discovered that Holt County and one other- county not entitled to vote because they had not held fairs in 1932 had cast ballots so the ballots as thus far cast were destroyed and a new ballot taken. The result of the ballot was announced as follows: First District — Wake, 45; Gustafson, 9; Walker, 5; Sanderson, 37; Shubert, 47. Elected: Wake, Sanderson and Shubert. Second District — Noyes, 4G. Noyes elected. Third District — Lamb, 49; Kuhl, 49; Graff, 47; Thompson, C. Y., 1. Lamb. Kuhl, and Graff elected.

Hawk, Tolen and Dobry elected. During the count of the ballots, President Reed called for remarks from Otto Pfeiffer, new president of the Association of County Fair Managers. By MR. PFEIFFER: Mr. Chairman and Members of the State Hoard of Agriculture, and County Fair Managers: I just want to leave ;i little thought with you for you to take home with you. Here is the thought I want to leave with you: that it is very important to advertise pur State Fair and to continue both our state fair and our county fairs. There is a great deal of hard work to be done when we get back home in our respective counties. We must get in touch with our representatives in the Legislature that is now in session. I don't mean that we should move down to Lincoln and lobby, but each one of us can go home and write personal letters to our representatives until we make some progress with them, in our argument for the continuance of the State Fair. We can get our friends to do likewise in our respective districts. These members don't pay so much atten - tion to a lobbyist who stands down here and talks to them as they do to letters from their own respective districts. They are busy men but they like to hear from their home folks and this is very very im - portant.

            <seg id="p035">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE little bit about the State and County Fairs and in the course Oi turn talk after I had explained to the people that Nebraska being an agri - cultural community, peculiarly an agricultural state, I presented some of the problems that were facing the fairs in this state. There were I think about 15,000 people gathered there that day. I asked them how many people there were in favor of appropriating, as I had ex - plained, what would be necessary to remove the deficit the State Fair had for the last two years. I got a roar of applause and commenda - tion in response from those people who were there. There were people there from not only Richardson but Nemaha and Pawnee and other surrounding counties and a few from counties further away. Then about two weeks ago I had an opportunity of making a little talk before a Chamber of Commerce at Stella where there were gathered together about 250 to 300 farmers of that community. I tried the same thing out on that crowd and I got the same sort of a response. I also had an opportunity of talking with another crowd of people more closely composed of Nemaha county people. I approached them on this subject and I believe if the people of this state had a chance to vote directly upon this question for an appropriation suf - ficient to put the State Fair on its feet they would do so, so I want to leave that thought with you, that we should present this matter to our representatives when we write these personal letters that have just been suggested. If these represntatives could each go out into their communities and talk with the people on this particular question I wouldn't question the result, but we perhaps had better get some resolutions and other expressions on the questions from these respec - tive communities and I am sure there will be no question but what the State Fair will be put back on its feet. By MR. C. S. HAWK, Chadron: I am a member of the State Board of Agriculture, just re-elected to continue in that service. I also happen to be a member of this 49th Session of the Legislature which is just beginning its session. I want to emphasize what Mr. Pfeiffer has said to you. I have had a very little opportunity so far to gather the sentiments in the House but I do already hear some rumblings. It seems that people who are not friendly toward the State Fair have been already perhaps more active than the friends of the State Fair and these unfriendly people have been putting out a lot of talk already. I have perhaps not yet run into a lot of very violent opposition but there is some sentiment that is rather hostile. The thought that a good many people don't quite grasp is the precedent it would put the State Board up against if we omitted to have a fair in 1933. Now if you write to your representatives you can express from your respective homes a sentiment that is contrary to what I have been mentioning as circulating to a dangerous extent around here. Whenever this matter </seg>
            <seg id="p036">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tnen comes up before the House there will be some support behind those who are friendly to the State Fair. By SENATOR W. B. BANNING: I want to endorse what has been said from the floor here in the last few minutes. I am also pres - ent in this session of the Legislature, facing the problem you have been discussing. This morning I had on my desk a petition that must have had between five hundred and a thousand names on it and that represented a lot of work someone had put forth to get all those names, but what happened to it. I couldn't possibly take time to carefully read it, I must send it to a committee that would certainly have no time to even look over the names on it. To get better results it certainly can be attained much quicker and simpler by personal letters to your representatives. You will get much better results from them. I know a good deal of that kind of work is going to be necessary to fortify those in the Legislature who are friendly to the State Fair. There has been a good deal of misrepresentation sent out about the State Fair. These taxpayers may demand that you cut other things. But when they come in and say you must reduct expenses fifty per cent, it can't be done at this point. There are a good many things that may stand some reducing but at the same time you have got to appropriate enough money for them t&lt;&gt; function. The great burden of our taxes is not on the state, but right at home. I want to cite one little illustration in our locality where our taxes run $25.40 on every thousand dollars. Take your own local taxes and analyse the amount that is state, that is county and that is for schools and local purposes. That is the trouble. You will find the state tax is a small thing; what we want to do is turn on the switch at home and make the saving right there. There are many sorts of bills being submitted for lower appropriations for this and that and many that will be introduced. There will be income tax and sales tax bills. I happen to be the sponsor of one, but we will not talk about that here just because I am introducing it. The purpose is largely to replace real estate taxes and it is hoped that in years to come it will replace the rest of the taxes, especially on real estate. We have all those things to consider here i so let's work to stop some of the tax waste, when you stop to consider that 48% of every dollar collected on taxes goes to schools and only 12% goes to the state, — that if all the state expense were abolished it would reduce the total only 12% — you find you have a problem, facing you. You can get at it, in this Legislature, I believe, if you approach it right, and get them to under - stand the question, get them to understand the work of the Fair. People have had the wrong impression concerning this State Fair. I know years ago people used to think the Fair Board ran the fair for their own individual profits. People have changed some in more recent years, but they still tell our Legislators things that are very </seg>
            <seg id="p037">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE very wrong as to what is done. We must get action designed to cor - rect this misapprehension and misinformation. I believe we will work out all right. For the 127,000 farms in Nebraska it would take less than one dollar each to clear up this whole thing. Less than $1.50 per farm would take up all of this deficit and permit the fair to run until we put it on its feet again. The real problem then is to get the people to understand this question, and I believe they will want it put through. By A MEMBER: I just wanted to say it would figure out less than thirty cents a quarter section of land. By PRESIDENT REED: I think that is right. We will hear from Mr. Cedar. By P. P. CEDAR, Fullerton: I talked day before yesterday with Senator Banning on the point he brought out "here today. Just for your information along that line, in an instance of my own, on a little piece of hind 74 acres at the edge of a town the state tax takes $15.09: the county takes $20.44; the town tax takes $22.20, and the school tax takes $110. 2G, on a total of $167.99. Now you can see where our taxes go. If the people will analyse this situation they will find about 75% to 80% of their tax burden is spent at home. By MR. L. E. HUNT, Otoe County: Senator Banning brought out a point I didn't in connection with the personal letter plan, that I would like to impress upon you. I have been around some of these tax - payers meetings and heard some of the talk about tax reduction and from some angles it is not very friendly to the Fairs. I will say a lot of the people don't know what the situation is. This ignorance is a good deal more prevalent than perhaps most of you realize. Just during the recent campaign a man in one neighborhood in my county denounced Senator Banning and came to me and said, "Hunt, will you answer a question, 'How much does Senator Banning get out of the State Fair?' " He was one of those who had an idea that a member of this Board was getting rich out of the State Fair instead of sitting here worrying about a $100,000.00 deficit. I tried to tell him there was nothing to that, and he insisted "Isn't it a fact that Banning and the other fellows get $25.00 a day and all expenses paid?" I had to explain the true situation to him again, but this will serve to explain to you the kind of ideas that rather prevail. If when you write these personal letters it might be well to get the correct information to your representative if you think it will help him out. Perhaps some of them need to be informed somewhat as to the relationship of the appropriations between the State Board of Agriculture and the State Fair. I suggested to one of them to get the annual financial report of the State Board of Agriculture and he wondered where he could get it. Bear that in mind, that a good </seg>
            <seg id="p038">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE many of these representatives may not be well informed on the prob - lem that faces you in this work. When you write this letter if you have any idea your representative is not well informed along the line of these very facts I would suggest you advance some of them in your letter, and he will be more inclined to support an adequate appropriation. By MR. CHARLES GRAFF: I don't want to get started talking again but I want to add a word to what has been said by most ot the men this morning. Our representatives in the Legislature will ap - preciate such letters as have been talked about here today. Most of this talk against the fair has come from interests, we know them, there are salaried men who never pay any taxes and who want to protect their own work. I have had an opportunity to go to Washing - ton, D. C, and appear before some of the Agricultural Committees at hearings where they have charge of problems vital to the interests of our state. Those fellows in Congress are lonesome down there and they are glad to see anybody from home, or even to hear from any - body back home. They don't know just what is going on back here and they like to keep in touch with the thought at home. It is not amiss to tell the congressman or even our representatives in the leg - islature what their people are thinking about and wanting done. They certainly appreciate it when they get a letter from some farmer out in his territory, even though the spelling .may not be quite up to par and the phrasing may not be so good but he notes from the signature that it is from a man of influence in his community, and he knows the writer stands high. He is going to recognize such a letter. When Senator Banning gets a letter from some of those old roosters in Cass County he is not going to throw it into the waste basket, hut it is likely he will show it to the Senator sitting beside him. Now I think if we' will follow the line laid out by Mr. Pfieffer or Mr. Hawk and others here this morning that we are going to accomplish a lot.

            <seg id="p039">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE years ago I happened to be in the place that President Reed is at this time. It falls to the duty of the President to appoint the members of the Board of Managers. I had worked along in fair work quite a good many years and I thought I had fairly good knowledge of the working qualifications of the members of the Board, and especially those who had done a good deal in County Fair work. I had in mind one man who was very active in all lines of Fair work and he was in - terested in fairs, and I though he would make a good man on the Board of Managers so I appointed Irl Tolen as one of that Board. Since that time I have never had- cause to regret that action. He has been a very useful and valuable member of the Board and very active in Fair work. It is a real privilege and pleasure for me now to place Irl Tolen in nomination for President of this Board of Agri - culture. By MR. FRANK SHUBERT: I desire to second the nomination of Irl Tolen. By MR. TOLEN: I am deeply grateful to my friend, Mr. Purcell for the splendid tribute paid to me. It has been a pleasure, however, to serve as a member of this board. I only wish I could convey to you what it means to me to be honored by the sentiments expressed. But I realize fully that there are times when there should be a change. I havo given this hoard in the past ten or twelve the best that has been in my power. I am grateful to this board, this convention, and its members who have urged me for this honor, but I am very much more interested in the success of this institution than I am in any Klory that might ronie to me. I have always been interested in the County Fairs and State Fairs. But I realize that it is necessary to make a change. I have just recently received an appointment at the hands of the State and I do not feel it would be best for me to under - take this work along with that at the same time, and while I will be glad to continue as a member of the Board and will remain inter - ested in the welfare of the State Fair I believe that it will be best if I do not undertake the Presidency. So I want to ask the privilege of placing a nomination one who comes from the soil, one who is Nebraska-bred and schooled and who has been a loyal member of this board. I place in nomination Mr. A. H. Miller, for President of this association. By SENATOR BANNING: I move the nominations be closed and the Secretary cast a unanimous vote for Mr. Miller for President. Motion seconded. Vote taken. Motion carried. By MR. JACKSON: I take great pleasure in casting the entire vote of this convention to A. H. Miller for President. By PRESIDENT-ELECT MILLER: I do not know what to say.

It was my privilege to appoint two or three members on the Board of Man - agers and Miller was one of them.

That has been so darned long ago, 22 or 24 years that I know what a valuable member Banning has been to this Board. He has served as Treasurer and earned the title as Watch- Dog of the Treasury.

I am always glad to do my part. By PRESIDENT MILLER: Who will you have for Treasurer? By MR.

I want to thank you for the honor you have conferred upon me today and I want to say this, that you have put upon me a great deal of responsibility in asking that any man take George Jackson's place when it comes to Fair work. I have worked many years with Mr. Jackson and he has made a record of service for Fairs so I know what it means to attempt to fill his place at this time. I suppose at no time in the history of the Fair was there more responsibility placed upon the Board of Managers and the Secretary that at this time. But I am willing to do the best I can, and I want you County Fair men out over the state to help me. I want all of you State Fair people to help me and I want to help all of you and I will be glad to help you in any way that is possible. I thank you again. By PRESIDENT MILLER: The State Fair is not run by the president and his two vice-presidents, but it is run by a Board of Managers. They are to be appointed four members in addition to the three offices I just named and those appointments are to be made by your president. So the Board of Managers consists of the president, the two vice-presidents and these four men I am about to appoint. There are five districts in the state. So I have taken into consider - ation the location of our three officers and selected these other four from the various districts so that there will be a fair distribution and I hope the appointment of these members will meet with your ap - proval. Taking into consideration the Districts which are already rep - resented in the election of the president and two vice-presidents I wish to appoint the following: R.

The Nebraska State Fair is conceded by all to be the greatest advertising medium in Nebraska. We are proud of its record. It not only advertises our resources, but finds buyers for our products.

            <seg id="p066">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS: At this time I will have a few words in which to make my report. As you know, it has been part of my duty to attend the International meeting at Chicago, that is the meeting of International Association of Fairs and Expositions, which was held on February 16-17, 1932, at Sherman hotel. You know the report is expected when one goes to those sort of meetings. I made notes of what transpired so that I would have something to report. It has seemed to me that in other years other fellows who have gone to these meetings never made much of a report so I have tried to be a little more explicit. Our State Association is three years in arrears, so I had no voice in the meeting and could not cast a vote on any thing. I don't know as it would have made any difference if I had been able to vote. This year the attendance was very light, there not even being a representa - tive from Canada. The big problem of all the Fairs was to adopt a budget to fit the times us every Fair except Missouri hud a loss in 1931. Missouri had a net gain of $236.00. They had cut their budget 50% for 1932. Kansas made a cut of 25 9c In their budget. Louisiana had not had their meeting yet. Oklahoma free State Fair at Muskogee had made 30% cut in their 1932 program. They received $S,000.00 from the state. Oklahoma City cut their 1932 budget $130,000.00. Took in $100, - 000.00. Had $33,000.00 deficit. Arkansas business men raised $22,000.00 to help support their State Fair. Did not report on budget. Mr. Chas. A. Nash reported on the eastern states Exposition of Springfield, Mass. Lost on account of rain $50,000.00. They cut their budget 50% for 1932. He reported that conditions in the east were better than out here in the west. He also suggested that abortion in cattle was getting serious and that it stood the fair managers in hand to watch it. Mr. Avery from Kansas said it was not justifiable at this time to take any official action on same but it was important enough that it should be watched. Mr. W. D. Smith, secretary of the Missouri State Fair, reported on speed. He thought that the race horse men should cut the races 50%. He believed that there would be plenty horses that would enter at that reduction. </seg>
            <seg id="p067">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS Mr. A. R. Corey, secretary of the Iowa State Fair would cut the races 15% at their fair in 1932. Mr. Walter W. Lindley, Lexington, Kentucky, spoke on how to maintain a race track. He said to cover the track in the fall with 6 inches of straw manure and work horses on same when the track was wet; that the horses would tramp the straw into the dirt and it would make a firm track. The loose straw would be removed after the horses had tramped all that the ground would take in. Mr. Ralph E. Ammon, Madison, Wis., view point of Fairs. He reported on 10 Mid-Western Fairs from 1912 to 1930. There were 550 commodity prices and that they were as high as 62 showmen competing for some of those prices. He also showed that general business had a lot to do with the slump in the fair business. The fairs had slumped 87% since 1919 and farming had slumped "&amp;%. In 1929 was the peak in attendance to all the fairs instead of 1920. The income in 1917 was $60,000.00 less than in 1931 and the cost of running the fair was 20c per capita and in 1931 40c per capita and that there was the largest attendance since 1920. Illinois State Fair held Sunday program. It went over big but cut the Monday attendance some. They have included a 4-H colt show under 2 years old. It proved to be a real success. Mr. Wallen, Presi - dent Iov.-a Implement Dealers, stressed that the Fair managers should recognize the implement dealer more than they do as the implement manufacturers did help a great deal to make a success of any state or county fair that did give them a chance to demonstrate their product. Mrs. Ethel Murray Simonds, Secretary and Manager of Oklahoma Free Fair, started discussion on having a state class for livestock. This discussion was prolonged by a good many taking part. Most of the speakers were in favor of a state class except Missouri. They thought some of the showmen were using the state class winnings to promote their herds, telling that they had winnings at the State Fair and did not tell that they had only won the state class. Mr. Reed said that it was only fair to have a State class as a lot of breeders within the state could not afford to fit their herds to go out in com - petition with professional showmen and their highly fitted herds. The Country Grocery Store. Mr. Raymond Lee, St. Paul, Minne - sota, told of the old show case, the old counters and Arbuckles coffee, up to date livestock, up to date shows and up to date meat cuts. The fellow who don't avail himself of the opportunity to boost his products is still sitting in the old grocery store surrounded by the old counters and Arbuckles coffee. He has not done himself any good and he is one of those who has helped to discredit exhibitor at the County and State Fairs. </seg>
            <seg id="p068">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE A motion to dispense with the election of officers was offered as the By-Laws stated that election of officers should take place in December. Motion carried. Now in conclusion, I want to make a few remarks about what I think of the organization. As a whole. In running through the pro - gram pamphlet checking the names of County Fair Association, I find the Iowa County Fair Association the only one registered in the program except our Nebraska Association, and I don't think the Iowa Association had a representative present, at least I did not meet him, I enjoyed myself at the meeting but as far as getting anything con - structive that might be of value to our Nebraska Association, I can - not say I did. The men that have preceeded me at these meetings have reported the same but I have never heard a report of what has transpired at those meetings. They have not given any detail report of same. I have tried to give you a report just as near as possible of what did transpire there and I am leaving you folks to decide if it. is worthwhile for our Nebraska Association to belong to the National Association. Now there are some other things I would like to speak a few words about at this time. Our program is not so long this afternoon but there are a lot of things that confront this association at this time. I refer not only to our own association but to the State Board of Agriculture. We can't remember a year when there lias been so many things confronting the County Fairs that we must plan on What we are going to do the next year. The Department of Agriculture has been charged by the newspapers of having received $300,000,000.00. The appropriations for 1917 were about that much too but in 1931 it was charged with $300,000,000.00. In 1924 it was about half that much. But the unjust part of this is that that department is charged with spending all this money when $174,000,000.00 of it was spent on highway aid. That does not go to Agriculture. Another $50,000,000.00 goes into Extension and Educational work: $14,000, - 000.00 goes into Experimental stations; $4,000,000.00 to the weather bureau, and a lot to Commercial Activities so when you get through only about $50,000,000.00 of it actually goes to Agriculture. So a good many people get the wrong impression of the Agricultural branch of the United States Government activities, or of work that is designed to advance the progress and welfare of Agriculture. What I am lead - ing up to is that there are influences that are opposed to the con - tinuation of some of this work, that are hostile to the welfare of State and County Fairs. They are hostile to the Extension Service. They are not so favorable to economizing in any other part of the govern - ment, except in what Agriculture is interested in. They don't have a word to say as to any other branch of the government. We have been living under a high speed, with the government taking care of </seg>
            <seg id="p069">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS i ■ ■ ■ '"■ . many things in business. But these people want to check only the Agriculture programs. Some of these interests are bringing up our state programs from time to time. We owe a duty to the State Fair and likewise a duty to the County Fairs. It is to those duties that we want to devote our energy today. We must face the attacks designed to curtail appropriations and an amount that would involve only a few cents a person in this state or a small amount per farm. These curtailments would not help out the situation of the unfortunate man but they would cripple the in - stitutions in which we are interested. Some of these people are work - ing through organizations that come into some of our counties. They are working for a salary. We don't know who pays their salaries but you can pretty nearly guess where the money comes from and that these men get a good salary. They will come into your county and attack the County Agent and use that as a means to reduce taxes a little bit. I believe it is time for us to get after such organizations and cor.teract their influence. Most of the men here today have been in Fair work for a long time, and have spent many years in building up these Fair Institutions. You should not hesitate to invite the attention of your neighbors and others in showing them what you have accomplished. You must combat this situation. We must meet their arguments and counteract their influence. Our State is not going to the dogs and I believe the men who are upon Capitol Hill will recognize the situation, but it is up to use to present it to them.

            <seg id="p071">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OP KA1R MANAGERS as a man can be to be asked to impose on this audience with such a sub - ject. I am asked to tell you Fair Managers how to run a successful fair on a pay gate during these times. I might give you some sug - gestions during normal times but when asked to do it in such times as these, I can only tell you what I told the Board of Managers in Adams County: By Mr. A. H. MILLER: I just want to say that our speaker was just elected president of the Adams County Fair. MR. VANCE: Yes, I was a little more fortunate than in the political race last fall. When I was running then for state senate I thought I would get out and do a little campaigning. I went over to Clay Center; ran across my opponent and I watched him for a little while. Then I went back home and told Mrs. Vance that I was going to be defeated, and she said, "what is the matter?" And I told her I had found out that Cloyd Stewart had been kissing all the ladies and I couldn't match that. Well the first thing we did at Hastings was to tell every body on the Board that they were working without any pay. Then when it conies to picking out your committees on the Board; have them picked by studying your men; pick men who will exercise patience and tact, as well as familiarity, in handling certain subjects. Some other fellow may be better on another certain subject. One man has a special talent for a certain task and another for an entirely different task. If your President knows just how to select these men it is going to help a lot. One year I would suggest that you want to get the pick of your home talent. That will help you In two or three different ways. It will leave some of your money at home. Your own men will get this money and that helps a lot. Then I would suggest you count on good prizes. Let the men folks come in on this. Figure on having your out - lying towns around the country help you out. See that they get in - terested in the program by having them put on some little plays, put up prizes for the best performances or pull off contests that will create interest in your fair and draw people from their towns or districts. Map all these things out and follow a hard and set program, show them you want them to keep boosting. Last year we got the Junior Chamber of Commerce interested and they formed a Jockey club. It is just like a special booster club for the Fair. Everybody in Hastings was wearing a cap and walking with a cane. One of our citizens hap - pened to be out in Denver during this time. He, with a couple of our boosters, were wearing their jockey cap and using their cane when one citizen out there asked another, "who are those fellows?" The other fellow was overheard to replay, "Those are a couple darned fools from Hastings, Nebraska, where everybody wears those caps, the women and all." I telljyou boys it was worthwhile. We got the pub- </seg>

I am suggesting that you consider using home talent. I don't be - lieve I can really stand up and tell you managers how to run a suc - cessful fair. Most of you could perhaps tell me something about it, but we can exchange notes and compare experiences. Another thing you must do, however, is to get your people behind your fair. We have had pretty good success at that in Hastings. As soon as one fair is over, is the time to start talking about another one. Get in touch right away with each department and tell them what you want to do. Inform people what their parts and their duties are. Have them all know they have work to do and what it is. MR. PURCELL: If I may ask Mr. Vance a question — I notice the next number on the program is concerning the Free Fair. I would like to ask if at Hastings you made any reduction in the admission. MR. VANCE: We made a slight reduction at the gate and it was suggested that we cut the price in two,- — down to a. quarter. Last year we charged thirty-five cents. MR. LEMLEY, Butler County: Mr. Vance we talked about these prizes between towns, how do you judge the awards? MR. VANCE: As to the judging that is very easy. You pick out a man or men from other towns not interested in the contest and let them judge it. A MEMBER FROM ANTELOPE COUNTY: We reduced the admis - sion from fifty cents to thirty-five. We had what we needed and I think about $2000.00 left. I think that is pretty good. MR. LEMLEY: The gentleman from Antelope County must have got a large crowd at a very low expense. A MEMBER FROM ANTELOPE: We did have a good crowd. MR. LEMLEY: We cut our gate every day at David City but we didn't see much of any diffeernce. MEMBER FROM DOUGLAS COUNTY: We had pretty good re - sults in our county in doing that. MR. E. R. PURCELL, Custer County: Broken Bow adopted the new plan last year. We issued what we called a thrift ticket. They are really a fifty cent value. We issued them in blocks and the busi - ness people bought them for general distribution. They were sold in advance only, prior to the opening of the Fair and we had something like $3000 worth sold in advance, sort of rain insurance. It was a </seg>
            <seg id="p073">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS good idea to get receipts cinched before the gate opened. They were sold only in blocks of ten for $:S.5O. It turned out pretty good. MR. ATKINS: Morrill County reduced the gate from fifty to twenty-five cents last year, automobiles were the same. Grandstand from thirty-five to twenty-five cents and bleachers fifteen cents. We had a splendid crowd. We broke a little better than even. We didn't have as heavy a loss as the year before. I think we had about $90.00 left to pay. We will probably use the same plan again this year. No one draws any money on our board except the secretary. Even the members of the board are required to buy season tickets. In the last two years there has been no comps and no one gets in free. A. R. HECHT, Buffalo County: The last two years we used a family season ticket, a ticket that admitted the entire family for the cost of $2. This has been a real life saver. It has made us some money in the last two years when in the previous several years we had lost money. We had the grandstand entirely full of people. Something which we did not have before. There may have been some abuse last year for the familys grew rather large but we might find some way to take care of that. MR. VANCE: Do you think it is fair to let in a family that may have thirteen or fourteen children on a $2 ticket and then charge just as much for a family with only two children? MR. HECHT: Our rule has been to bring only one car full. MR. PURCELL: How would it be with those who use a truck when they come? A MEMBER: What do you do with bachelors? MR. HECHT: Single admission tickets are sold for $ 1. The fam - ily ticket for $2. A MEMBER FROM FILLMORE COUNTY: We tried a scheme like Adams county. We didn't have a jockey club but we had a can - ary club. We cut our gate receipts to twenty-five cents and the same for grand stand. This organization that we called the canary club, got so thoroughly organized that they had about everybody in Fill - more county. They turned out by the hundreds and made our fair a great success. MR. JOHNSON SAUNDERS COUNTY: We never reduced our ad - mission. We still charge fifty cents and we let all cars in free of charge and have no other charges. We paid out. We gave them all the show we have for the first admission at the gate. Heretofore we got an extra charge out of about one out of every four that came in the main gate. It is a shame to have a good show and not have the </seg>
            <seg id="p074">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE people see it. There is one point Mr. Vance suggested about ap - pointing a committee to judge these prizes. I think that merits some attention. Every year we have had a committee judge our floats for the fair. We have had fine displays of school floats, probably as good as there was in the state of Nebraska but we have had pretty good satisfaction with the committees. No one else, other than the president who appoints them knows who these judges are and that saves getting into quite a lot of trouble. MEMBER FROM ANTELOPE: Permits me to say that the Whisker club pretty nearly lifted our fair out of the hole. We can give them credit for doing a great deal for us. MR. PIPAL of Richardson County: We had some trouble on this prize business from complaints on the awards. MR. VANCE: I would say down at Hastings that we got along fine on that phase. We got some pretty good plays put on and most of them drew good crowds. MR. CEDAR: The Mayor of Lincoln is here now and we will divert from this discussion and listen to a few words of welcome he may have to offer. MAYOR FRANK ZEHRUNG, Lincoln: I don't think there is any question in the minds of any of you but what you are welcome to our city, but speaking for the city of Lincoln, I am very glad to be here today to extend to you the official welcome of the city of Lincoln. I have just finished a council meeting and could not get here any sooner. I do not know how closely you are related to the State Fair. I do not know much about the present status of the state fair but as Will Rogers say, 'all I know is what I read in the newspapers' and from what I have heard about the conditions of the State Fair in Lincoln, I can say that all of the people in Lincoln are particularly interested in its welfare. I can hardly conceive how the people of the State of Nebraska could feel that they should not pay the debts of the State Fair. To us in Lincoln is quite an important thing. Not in a mere selfish way because of the State Fair at this time is not worth as much to the business interests of Lincoln in a financial way as it used to be. I mean by that in this way: For many years, about twenty-five or more, I ran a theatre in this town. I remember that what we lost during the hot months of the summer we figured on making up during the five or six days of the State Fair. I can look back during its earlier days and I do not remember how long it has been existing I think at least several decades in Omaha and Lincoln but I know the State Fair meant a great deal to the business interests in Lincoln during </seg>
            <seg id="p075">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS those days. I can remember when people used to walk the streets or sit in the depot all night because they could not find a place to sleep in Lincoln. In tho;e clays it was not an uncommon thing for people to stay up all night because they could not find a room. The fair was then a great thing for the retail merchants but today they come in and go out and camp on the grounds, or they think nothing of going fifty, sixty or seventy-five miles to their homes. So the interest in the State Fair is not a selfish one any more. It doesn't mean a great deal in bringing business to the City of Lin - coln. As I said, in years past the State Fair meant a lot to some business interests especially the hotels, theatres and restaurants. But that isn't true any more. Now more stress is laid on the 4-H club work for the boys and girls who are growing up. This inflex of hun - dreds of boys and girls, who are soon to be our citizens to come here during the State Fair is an inspiration. They may not spend so much but they provide an inspiration and a duty for us to keep the fair going. But I feel it is a duty of the whole state to put the State Fair on its feet. As related by your secretary's statement the money spent for the fair goes out all over the state and so many dollars goes to this county arid so many to that county. This is a proposition that you and I don't want to see killed. I imagine that the effect of cramp - ing or killing the State Fair in Lincoln would be very harmful on the attendance and maintainance of your county fairs all over the state. That might be rather destructive and that is why I mention the mat - ter when I come before you today. I can not tell you men very much about running a fair and you will not benefit from any oratory of mine but I am very glad to have this opportunity of speaking for the citizens of Lincoln. I am particularly interested now In the fate of the State Fair. I trust you men who come from about every county in the State will use your influence to see that this State Fair is not killed because I think there would be some thing done by the people of the State of Nebraska, if they did not have the State Fair. While it might take around $100,000.00, as Mr. Jackson has pointed out, and that seems like a lot of money to come out of our pockets — for the whole state it isn't very much when we consider the damage that would be done if the State Fair were allowed to stop, or this deficit was not paid. Again I say, that I am glad to be here and offer the welcome of the City of Lincoln. PRESIDENT CEDAR: I thank you Mr. Mayor for your splendid welcome. We will call up on our vice president to respond to this address of welcome. • </seg>
            <seg id="p076">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. OTTO PFEIFFER: Brother Fair Members, I don't see why the President has put me on this program but I am glad to comply. I want to say that we are certainly glad to be here. We are very proiid to be here once a year and to meet in the city of Lincoln. We rejoice in this hospitality as extended by the Mayor. We are proud of its colleges which a good many of those here have attended or to which they have sent their children. We are proud of the fact that Lincoln is the ideal city physically and morally. We are glad to ac - cept the welcome of the Mayor this afternoon and we know both the city officials and the Chamber of Commerce of this city will do what - ever is in their power to assist us and to extend to the Agricultural interests of the State of Nebraska their aid in trying to serve the State Fair and incidentally the County Fairs. We have more than a million dollars invested in the grounds and buildings of the State Fair. They are at the present time a valuable asset to the agricultural interest of the state. and it looks to me that it would be injurious to the county fairs more than ever in the past to even consider taking the State Fair or having in the future to put it back on the map where it is at the present time. We do not hesitate to ask our city brothers to cooperate with us in this task. I thank you. PRESIDENT CEDAR: The next topic on our program — Free Gate Fair — Erie B. Smiley of Seward. He cannot be here today and I will introduce the man who is going to undertake this task for him, — MR. STANLEY MATZKE, Seward: You fellows expecting to hear Mr. Smiley may be disappointed that he couldn't be here. He ask me to take this subject, for him about a Free Fair. I have only been secretary of our Fair for the last nine months. I am asked to tell you folks about a situation on which some of you have studied year after year. We faced a problem last year of doing something so that we wouldn't lose so much. You're asking me to tell about how to con - duct a Free Fair. The best I can do is to tell you how we conducted the fair this year. So I am doing this at Erie's request. As Mr. Vance said in his remarks the first thing to do is to arrange with your board as to how they will do the work and for them to arrange to do a lot of it themselves. We did this and we certainly had splendid help. Every one was assigned certain things to do and every one given special tasks. About ten days before the fair came on we found we did not have a sufficient program. In the emergency some of us decided that we could get up a home talent program, even in ten days. We got to work on a program with the result that the last afternoon we had more than 2000 people in the grandstand. That was in 1931. Smiley asked that crowd of 2000 people in the grandstand if they wanted that </seg>
            <seg id="p077">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS kind of a program again and the answer was overwhelmingly in the affirmative. As a result during the past year Mr. Smiley thought he must resign I become secretary of the fair and I went ahead with that idea. We got in touch with people generally over the county with the idea of carrying out this plan, and saving money and at the same time having no gate charge. A charge of twenty-five cents for all automo - biles that should enter the grounds, or in fact twenty-five cents park - ing charge. And we decided to charge twenty-five cents admission to the grandstand. Our idea, in short, was this we put Reader material in all five of our county newspapers. This Reader material was short and snappy and I sat down and ran off from thirty or forty short items, perhaps ten inches long or maybe only six inches long, maybe only half a column. We put this in the paper at Utica, Beaver Crossing, Milford, and those other towns that had papers they co-operated mighty well. As did the Seward papers. We got a large amount of space and we found this matter interested people. Then we appointed a committee to work out a program. They appointed sub-committees in every town in the county to work out the part that each town would want to take. You can find someone in about every town who will lead this way. The result was that we put on a three day fair at a minimum of cost and effort. We put on two afternoon and two evening programs which had a variety of entertainment, as interesting as you ever saw. We were able to make enough to apply something substantial on our $4000 debt that was hanging over on our grandstand. We had hands from Milford, Staplehurst, Bee, and from all around the county. We had vocal as well as other musical numbers. You would be surprised to find out how good an entertainment you can get right in your own. communities. A problem in the county fair isn't always how much money you can bring in but what you have to pay out. Results are measured somewhat in the amount of money that changes hands and how many exhibitors you have interested, and how many people attend your - programs and how satisfied they are with what you have to offer. We were glad to pay expenses and apply something like $2000 on this permanent debt. A fair is primarily an educational institution, and in the first instance for the benefit of the people of the county. We put on the fair with the idea of sustaining the local interest and encouraging a local spirit and we found out that is worth while. By keeping the prize money at home we encourage that local spirit. We had an enthusiasm with the fair in 1932 that our fair has never reached before. There were fifty-four new exhibitors came in.. Then. </seg>
            <seg id="p078">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In paying out the premium money we followed the same idea. I personally handed out every premium check that gave me an op - portunity- to talk with every exhibitor as he came after his premium check. Not only these fifty-two new exhibitors but a lot of the older ones were over enthusiastic in their responses about coming back next year. I outlined a little advertising we had and we didn't use any print - ed premium books. In other years our fair had done that. Our local newspapers were called on to put out a printed list of the premiums and they called the attention of the people to the fact they should save these. ' When the two Seward papers ran this they did it at a small cost. They got out extra copies and covered Seward county for the four weeks in advance. They did- this much cheaper than we could print a premium book. Another interesting feature was the baseball series. We put on a baseball game every day directly in front of the grandstand. This made it necessary to extend our program so that it was three or four hours long. We had to start at one-thirty and keep things run - ning until four-thirty or five-thirty in the afternoon. We rather plan in the next season to begin that part of the program at perhaps nine o'clock in the morning. We use ball teams from six Seward county towns. Then each town can bring in the necessary people to put on its share of the program, and this also serves to stimulate the attend - ance from the various towns, and balance the attendance. This pulls dozens of people to the fair who have never before been interested. We have also gained the advantage of putting on the fair for Seward county people. We find the home talent acts are rather interesting and the interest it has aroused in working out this entertainment creates enthusiasm in all the towns in the county. I don't know whether this could be kept up year after year but it has certainly helped us over a difficulty of two years. I might stress the part that the 4-H clubs have played but I sup - pose all of the Fairs have benefited along that line. I know we have produced one state champion in our county and made some other mighty fine records. Mr. Fouts, our County Agent has taken care of this phase of the work, and has given it a good deal of attention. One interesting feature we have is a coon race. We turned a coon lose and then we turned the coon hounds lose to trail him down and the entertainment thus provided was mighty pleasing. Another interesting thing was the Pumpkin Show. I could go on indefinitely with the de - tails. I don't know whether I have given them to you in as interesting a manner as Erie Smiley could if he was here but I tried to give you some idea of what we did to make a Free Gate Fair interesting. I thank you for your attention. </seg>
            <seg id="p079">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS PRESIDENT CEDAR: The next topic has been assigned to Mr. J. E. Martin of Madison county. District Meetings to Make Adjustments on Premium Lists, Free Acts and Shows J. E. MARTIN: I hardly thought that I would be here today but even if I cannot give you a speech I ■will give you a little experience we had up at Madison. I conceived the idea about a year ago in getting representatives from five or six county fairs together, at least, to go&gt; over their premium lists and let every fair decide on what they were going to pay. We started to go on down through the book. We had representatives from Madison, Pierce, Platte, Stanton, Nance, and. Colfax counties there. We made a revision of our book and we had a. little discussion as to almost every item. We found it was a pretty good idea for a group from six or eight fairs to get together and then; when one exhibitor comes to one fair he won't find that Madison county is paying more than Stanton county or vice versa and he won't meet these discrepancies, and we find that we can relieve ourselves of a lot of troubles when we go to pay our premiums. The same thing will hold true when we go to decide on what we should pay for music or for free acts, so that one fair isn't spending a lot more in trying to out do another. I think that is about all I have to say. MR. SCHULTE of Richardson County: We have a man in our county who has been putting on one of the greatest free fairs in south - eastern Nebraska and I would like to have Frank Pipal tell you how they have been handling the fair in Richardson county. MR. FRANK PIPAL: I don't think Mr. Schulte is playing ball quite fairly when he pulls me into this. But we were having some of the same troubles as the gentleman from Seward outlined. I was very much interested in that talk. But I do want to cite also a few of the things that we found were successful. We advocated limiting our premiums to our own county. Some of our corn and poultry premium awards when listed would give one the impression that our fair was over somewhat in Kansas because most of our main prizes were being taken by people from Kansas. We are right down in the corner where we are so close to Kansas and close to some of other Nebraska counties that we feared this situation, might be checking the initiative of our own people, but when we come - to a plan of trying to limit our own county we didn't find it any handi - cap because we got enough exhibitors of our own. This year we were compelled to confine the livestock exhibitors to&gt; three neighboring counties for the simple reason that we had no. </seg>
            <seg id="p080">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE place to house the livestock that was being offered from everywhere so we did limit it to the three neighboring counties. Out side of that we allowed entries from anybody in the country and we have a lot of fun. Our fair may be quite a little different from the average county fair. We don't have any fair grounds. We have no special buildings where we can house the livestock. We hold the fair right in the heart of the business district and we charge absolutely no fee of any kind. We have absolutely what you can call a free fair. We have no entrance fees or grandstand fees. Everything is absolutely free. We give a high class of entertainment. We have been told that we provide probably more than any other county fair or more than the State Fair. We hardy know what to do with the crowds that we can expect. We had people there from as far north as Omaha. When you bring into a place like Humboldt a crowd of 18,000 people, you can imagine the problem we had in just handling the people. If this increase keeps up it looks like we might have to borrow the State Fair grounds and move them down there. We haven't any present debts and we saved several hundred dol - lars out so as to be able to provide some sort of a building for the livestock exhibits. I understand some of you who have regular fair grounds find it pretty hard to make ends meet. So far the business men have been able to finance this project and what we have had has been donated free and our business men have been glad to do it. With the fair located right in the heart of the business district the business men have found it worthwhile to support the fair in every way that they can for it gives them such a good opportunity to meet the people close at hand, and to get a contact with the people that they could not get otherwise. If they don't get the benefit right then they feel that people will come back later on. We did not offer prizes for bands but we were fortunate enough that we had three state champion bands at our fair. In class A, Table Rock, in class B, Humboldt, and our own Junior band, in class C Dubois eleven miles away. We had these three champion bands within eleven miles of Humboldt, all having won their respective awards at the State Fair. The people certainly approved this feature. They turned out strong. While we couldn't raise as much money last year as some other times, we spent around one thousand dollars for free entertainment. But we got as much for the money as you per - haps would some times if you paid twenty-five hundred dollars for it. We don't have any other county fair close around us. So we have had big crowds and have been able to provide plenty of enter - tainment for them, and our main problem has become the question </seg>
            <seg id="p081">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS of what to do with the people and the exhibitors, who come in increas - ing numbers every year. MR. HECHT, Buffalo County: I have been wondering how it is you can get out of debt as you say in Seward county? MR. MATZKE: We have been trying to pay on that debt for the past seven years. We just simply are not able to get rid of it since this depression has come along. It was $9000 and I think there is about $7000 left on the amphitheatre and $1000 general indebtedness. There is nothing we can do about it but try to work out a plan to get rid of it. If anybody has any panacea for paying debts we will be glad to have it. I didn't intend that you should have the impression that we had paid it off. MR. PURCELL, Custer County: I would like to make one sugges - tion. Something like seventy counties having fairs, each one of those counties has a representative in the House and Senate. It is true we have laws governing the extending of aid or appropriating money by the county board. At the present time the highest amount authorized is $2000. It is possible for the board to appropriate another $2000. In Custer county the county board has done that. But I think it would be a good idea for every man Interested in these county fairs to see that these laws are not changed as to this provision. We want to hold what we have got now. I think that is the greatest task we can expect to undertake. This is probably more important than trying to figure out at this time the amount of our total indebtedness and meet it. MR. CHAS. GRAFF, Cuming County: I would like to ask the gentelman from Seward county if they own their fair grounds prop - erty and buildings? MR. MATZKE: The Seward County Agricultural Society holds title to the fair grounds. The amphitheatre was built by a separate organization thorough stock, though the agricultural society holds title to the grounds. That thirty acres is quite a valuable piece of ground. We couldn't use it though as a basis for profit. MR. GRAFF: But in event you disbanded your organization it would belong to Seward county, the indebtedness on the property would be also acquired by the county? MR. MATZKE: At the last legislature a bill was introduced and passed for the purpose of clarifying the law on that point. If we were disbanded the fair grounds would go immediately to the county, the fair grounds indebtedness going along with it. Or the Agricultural Society could apply to the county court for permission to sell them and the county clerk would bring an action in district court and then </seg>
            <seg id="p082">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE notice would be given that all persons holding claims against the county or rather the society could file them and they would be paid out of the money realized on a sale. We had an indebtedness of $9000.00 against it after the- amphitheatre was built. We have managed to run the fair and keep it going. We used what surplus we have had to apply on that debt. Then we made a new contract with the creditors. Our County fair now holds it in escrow, the fair association cut that down in three years by $1400.00 and it looks as though we should come out on it. It looks like we are not going to use one single dollar of tax money to wipe out this debt. MR. E. L. HUNT, Otoe County: Our fair is a little in debt. We bought some land and at the time we bought it, it was impressed on us by legal authorities that we could not use county appropriations for the purpose of clearing that indebtedness. I wonder if any of you have had any trouble with that point having been raised on you. MEMBER FROM SHERMAN COUNTY: That point has never been rased on us, whether we can do that or not. How do you finance your fair? MR. HUNT: From the county and other aid. SHERMAN COUNTY MEMBER: We finance through the gate mainly. ANTELOPE COUNTY MEMBER: We did the same thing. We thought if we could draw our county appropriation and apply it on our indebtedness of something like $5000.00 on land and buildings we could dispense with a fair but the board said, no fair, no appropria - tion, so we had to abandon that idea. MR. MATZKE: When this question first arose with Seward county, I was not with the Fair, but as County Attorney it came squarely up to me for decision. It was asked of me whether the county board could be made to pay the $2000 if it was used to apply on this indebtedness. They could take it and hold a fair and the $2000.00 was paid. Under the law it was necessary for me to hold they should use the money to apply for holding a fair and not for paying past in - debtedness. That was the way I felt under the law I had to hold no matter how I felt about it myself. J. L. QUIG, Holt County: We didn't hold a fair last year. I suppose the reason I am here is that no one else would come. If you are going to have a fair you can hardly pay out anything else so last year we didn't have any. MR. HUNT, Otoe County: Well I thought I made it plain, the difference between money taken in on the taxes and the rest of it. I </seg>
            <seg id="p083">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS believe those who adopted that law didn't believe in the use of tax money for that purpose. If you put tax money on to the payment of debts it is contrary to the interpretation we got of the statute. The money is supposed to be used to support the fair. When you as I understand it, operate a Free Fair it is unnecessary to use tax money because you are putting on a fair that is supposed to be self-supporting. It may cost the community a great deal more than if there is a gate charge. That difference is supposed to be met and returned to the community. If tax money is found necessary my contention is that you are putting it in an educational project. I think that is the only way you can meet the bureau of the legislature. You will have to be pre - pared to show that in your opinion at least it is a suitable project for the use of tax money. There is even then the question whether the use of the money in that way is justifiable. Those who favor it insist that the cultural advantage of it being an educational project justifies it. MR. J. S. STEELE, Kimball County: This last year we held a free fair and we used our county appropriation to pay such of our indebtedness as we could. We were successful in paying off some of our debts. We did that with permission from our county commis - sioners. We signed up a contract though that we would not ask for any money for the next two years at least, until conditions got better. I might tell you that I am down here as a member of the Third House the same as Mr. Hunt is. Like him, I was a member of the House two years. I know what pressure those fellows are up against. They are getting letters and telegrams every day urging them to cut out this or cut out that. It becomes a question to those men as to which things they can cut out and do the least harm. They realize that they must keep our public school system going some way; they must keep our university in operation. Their state institutions must continue to run and they should find some way of maintaining the Extension Ser - vice for the State of Nebraska. Those things are strictly educational features as well as farm problems. I fear that a lot of them feel that they should do away with some of the appropriations for the operation for county fairs at the present time. They feel they must keep things like the Extension Service going. That is the way a lot of them look at it even though they are trying to make cuts somewhere. A lot of us are hoping that the conditions will change in the next two years and feel that there should be enough money appropriated by the state rep - resentatives and senate so we can operate the fairs. If they cut their appropriations very much, under present conditions it would force a good many of the fairs to close this year. Even if we have to cut somewhere the question is whether this is the place to cut. Out in our western counties we pay approximately $20.00 a truck for car license and then we pay around $60.00 tax for gasoline. Taxes paid </seg>
            <seg id="p084">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE at the court house were $310,000.00 and with the gasoline and car tax it made a tax hill of $390,000.00. In our county we must derive an income from wheat and potatoes. Figuring around 600,000 bushels of wheat selling at 30c a bushel you find how far our county falls short at paying such a tax bill. Now what are we going to do with conditions like that. I am not trying to be a pessimist but I think you county fair men have got to face this situation as you find it. MR. HUNT, Otoe County: I believe that we are satisfied to main - tain the present appropriation. I haven't any other idea than the thought that this appropriation should be maintained. But I feel we should not under estimate the hostile support. You must meet if you are going to ask the boards or the legislature to maintain the county fairs on the basis of serving an essential purpose. In my county, and I rather suspect in other counties it is the same thing, I feel, if we must, we can operate the fairs on a considerably reduced appro - priation. I believe we would be able to do that as a matter of self - preservation. We can make considerable reduction in curtailed opera - tions rather than to face abandonment of the project. As fair associa - tions we must face the problem on the same basis as other activities do. It is preferable to curtail than to entirely eliminate and I would sug - gest that we reduce to the lowest possible minimum. I believe Mr. Steele will agree with me. Let's get along and not make any more demands on any of the counties for appropriations than we can pos - sibly help. It is my point that the legislature might agree with us on that same idea. PRESIDENT CEDAR: We have had a pretty good meeting so far this afternoon. MR. LEMLEY, Rising City: I feel that there is one point we might make to maintain. This county appropriation only amounts to about 80c a quarter-section to make that $2000, appropriation. I don't believe that is going to be a heavy drain on any one. PRESIDENT CEDAR: With us it would amount to about 50c a quarter-section to raise that amount of $2000.00. We have reached the conclusion of our afternoon program and we will now take an adjournment to seven-thirty. </seg>
            <seg id="p085">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS MONDAY NIGHT EVENING SESSION 7:30 P. M. PRESIDENT CEDAR: You will please come to order and we will start in with our program. The first number tonight is Home Talent Program for County Fairs, and this will be presented by Paul F. Taggart, Red Cloud. MR. TAGGART: When I was assigned this subject on Home Talent for County Fairs it reminded me of a story in regard to a sissy. The boy was getting to be pretty good size when some of the other boys decided to have some fun with him. They got him a date with a girl with not the best reputation and he went out with her. Along about ten-thirty the next morning his mother noticed him cry - ing and she ask, "Son, what is the matter?" He answered, Mother, I just can't tell you". She urged him to tell her and he insisted he could not. He said it was just awful and I can't tell. Then she got firm with him and he says well if you must absolutely know that girl insisted on kissing me and having me smoke a cigarette. The boy was dealing with trends that seemed to have outgrown his idea. Consider - ing the idea of talent for county fair entertainment, let's consider a few trends. Years ago when more of the coin of the realm was in evidence people could travel greater distances for their entertainment and they could pay considerably more for it then they now can. Then they demanded a lot of spectacular things. There was no such thing as home entertainment. They probably would not have listened to it. People drove miles and miles to attain amusement, and then they drove back. Now, in the first place a lot of them can't keep the Ford car running; in the second place they can't buy gasoline; and in the third place they want entertainment without spending much money for it. Today in our county there are many home gatherings, because they do not have money to spend for gasoline, nor money to spend if they did go somewhere where people have their own games at home, or grandpa gets out the fiddle, accordian, mouth-harp or Jews harp, and a good old fashioned time is in full swing. People are furnishing their own entertainment, having a good time and they like it. Incidentally, they are encouraging some very good talent. At these gatherings people talk and exchange ideas. No one seems to be in a hurry. Do they have a good time? Well, sit in on one of these for a little time and the question will be answered. It is my opinion that we, as county fair boards must take these </seg>
            <seg id="p086">86 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE things into consideration. In addition to this, let us consider some other facts. 1st. We as county fair boards realize, we have less money to spend. 2nd. A county fair is primarily educational. Is it not just as important that we place a premium on self-improve - ment, talent, ability, and community spirit of the people of our county as it is for the kind of grain or livestock they can raise? Can you not, by offering "premiums, if you please" for the best home talent play, group singing, public speaking, musical number, games, contests, etc., accomplish a two-fold purpose? That of providing good wholesome entertainment and at the same time develop the thing I mentioned above, namely, — self-improvement, talent, ability and community spirits and pride. In addition I feel this will accomplish some other far-reaching results. 1st. If the county people are presenting the entertainment, they and their relatives and neighbors, are coming to the fair to see John or Mary perform. 2nd. Who needs a few extra sheckles more than our people in the county? By giving them the opportunity to participate and Ret their money back they are going to feel more like coming to the fair, and especially more favorable toward that county levy on their tax re - ceipts which says County Agricultural Societies. 3rd. Some of this talent at least can be directed along a line which will not only be entertaining but highly educational. 4th. Considerable less money is needed to provide this type of entertainment than we have spent in the past. I realize that the things I have just added are treading on the toes of the professional entertainer. It is not my intention to do this, tor I think there is a place for him. We have got to have some good acts to go along with the above program. Because there is still that type of people that want something different and that still are able to buy their entertainment. But I do say, and I believe the professional entertainer will agree with me, that it is better to cut down on expenses, keep the people satisfied, and be able to run, than not to do so; and thus, kill the goose that laid the golden egg. A year ago, at this meeting, you heard Mr. Hecht of Buffalo county give you the set-up they have in their county. He stated that the Fair association was ready to give up the ship, and that the Farm Bureau took up the cause and made a success of it. </seg>
            <seg id="p087">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS In Webster county our fair board saw the handwriting on the wall before they had gone as far as they had in Buffalo county, as a re - sult they have had home-talent on the program for the past four years. Each year they have been able to reduce the debt previously ac - cumulated. Some years not so much, others more. Not a great deal was accomplished this year, due to some improvements that were made, and having about $470.00 dollars in a bank that closed its doors a couple of weeks after the fair. ;,.,.' We have had a number of things that have taken well, such as a greased pig race, pig and Ford race, ladies' driving contest, slow mule race, chariot race, potato race, man and horse relay race, and many other things, which a committee of Fair Board members with fertile brains, can figure out. Last year we had a rodeo, not very large, but it was well taken. This, of course, was outside entertainment, largely. In addition to this we had some home talent plays, which were exceptionally good. These were in the form of a contest with a guaranteed amount for each group, and a premium for the best one. They were given on a platform erected in front of the grandstand, and by use of a loud speaker system, which, by the way, worked satisfactorily. We used a tent to cover the platform since it had to be housed. This was taken down that the people might see the rodeo and other acts in front of the grandstand, in the day time. We will probably carry this type of entertainment to a greater extent, as outlined above, for the next year's program. Now let us summarize: 1. Conditions and trends are changing and we must change with them. 2. Home talent entertainment ideas coming to the fore. A. Economical. B. Educational. 1. Develops Talent. 2. Develops Ability. 3. Develops Community Spirit and Pride. C. Brings good crowds. D. Keeps money within county. MR. E. R. PURCELL, Custer County: There is just one thing about using Home Talent. One year, the plan meets with great suc - cess. The next year it is found pretty hard to get home talent to re - peat. The big question is whether we can go over the field year after year and keep up the interest. However, we have done it in our county with pretty good success. We had one town that put on a play and </seg>

            <seg id="p089">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OK FAIR MANAGERS MR. GRAFF: Does anyone here know about this royalty busi - ness. MR. TAGGART: I don't know much about how lenient they are or just how much they charge on these plays. PERRY REED: I think they ran into a little trouble on that at •Aurora at one time. We put on one of these plays and then that ques - tion came up. I don't remember just how much but they settled it very satisfactorily. MR. PURCELL: I know we had four towns enter. We offered a hundred dollars, seventy-five dollars, fifty dollars, twenty-five dol - lars and then we had judges who judged the plays. We let them select their own play, pick the director from their own town and if they put on a play that carried a royality and had confidence in them - selves and ability to win a prize, they could look after the royalty. They had one play that I think was strong enough to be an attraction at even the State Fair. The other three were more mediocre. That de - pends entirely on the director, and his ability to direct but I think almost every community has someone who is able to do that. MR. TAGGART: I think, that is the proper answer. Ordinarily in every community there is someone who will make such a director if you get the right person interested. Another thing that helps the situation along is the interest in the community. PRESIDENT CEDAR: Are there any other remarks on this topic? PERRY REED: How do you arrange the complimentary tickets? We just gave a ticket to each one in the play, whenever they played. MR. TAGGART: We gave them a ticket when they played and one additional night. PERRY REED: Has any one had experience where an out side director is used to put on the play? MR. GRAFF: Doesn't that cost too much money? MR. TAGGART: Down at Red Cloud they had some experience in the women's clubs and the American Legion people. Some one came in and put on the plays on a percentage basis. That worked very satisfactorily there but I don't know just how it would be on county fair entertainment. It would probably depend on just how cheap you could get that type of a coach. Generally you have to get someone who can work that sort of a thing out with the individuals without any regard to the cost of the play. They don't use such a high class of reportiore of place for the county fairs. Perhaps that </seg>

            <seg id="p091">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS 91 nature of their work year after year the managers of fairs do impose on the gullibility of newspaper men. Isn't 'that true? I know if I ask those gentlemen they will tell me that is true. Newspaper men are always anxious to give fair publicity every year. There are so many ramifications to fair work. If you will just. get the gospel out to the people it will do its work. Little short stories are perhaps the best you can get. You can take the extension work and go into it with some little detail. You could take hours and hours to just de - velop some project such as the 4-H club work. Women have shown m their clubs what you can do. There is a story m every home. Wherever there is a boy or girl doing their work you can find this story. There is the story m every woman who is engaging her inter - ests m some club activity. I almost wonder what could be brought out from these unheralded heroes and heroines. You have a field you can develop from one years end to another. It is a duty of your di - rectors of your president or vice president to figure out these stories about the people of your community. If you run across one of these stories the newspaper is glad to get it and will be glad to use it. There are some interesting things about that boy, or that girl, or that woman who is doing some club work, that is bound to be of interest to your readers. You are continually running across these incidents that can be taken by your local home town newspapers and be made an asset. Any country newspaper will respond to the call of his particular com - munity as his readers are more interested m what John Smith is doing than what Osceola, Humboldt or Auburn is going to vote bonds for a new courthouse. I will leave that for any newspaper man's judg - ment if that isn't true. Are you wasting a good opportunity. You can go into the home town newspaper fifty-two weeks out of the year with something about the county fair and what it is going to do to interest your people. Give it to them m little stories. You have got to interest your people if you are going to get them to do any thing about it one way or the other. You can not wait until it is just about time for the fair to open and then break out with a lot of display advertising. Your newspaper man will welcome any thing you can bring to him. You don't need to put it all m one story. You can bring a little story about race horses. Your superintendent of speed knows something about the horses and he can give you something for a short story on that subject. The automobile driver who happens to be m the auto races, something about them will make an interesting story. I don't think any fair is so small that it doesn't have a great many phases that it can present or will enable it to take its place m the fair work. Every fair is doing certain things that advance educa - tion, but your fair no matter how small it is the hub for community development and can promote interest m that great triumvirate, the home, school, the community. You should have the support of your paper m your community. You should have the support of your leg - </seg>
            <seg id="p092">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOAKU OK AGRICULTURE 92 islature. You should have the active backing of all of those who are interested m the progress of your community. There is much that can be said on the subject of publicity with other fairs but I think that has been covered by some things that have been brought out here. I think you have a member of your Board of Directors who will give some of his thought and attention and time to this program, who will get news and bring it to your home town paper, your success will be greater than you really expert it to be. MR. A.11. MILLER: I have been wondering if one of the Hoard of Directors m any county ought to be a newspaper man. Shouldn't the board have one newspaper man the same as it has an agriculturist? MR. TOLEX: Yes, Bert, but ordinarily a newspaper man is in - volved m a great many other things so that he can't give his entire time and attention to the publicity of the fair. I would suggest that you work through your County Agent who la around the county, is active and is observing, and he can get m touch with people all over the county and he can get facts that others might miss. The County Agent is perhaps the best avenue for news, if you have one who is active and who is interested m your fair. I might gay at the same time that it need not be the most active man on the fair board. Maybe Emerson Purcell will tell us something of their experience m faster county. MR. EMERSON PURCELL, Ouster county: When you get into this publicity proposition, maybe some of you recall that two years ago I gave you an outline of my idea of advertising fairs. Since then we got into a proposition from which we got a good deal of publicity. Last year we had a rodeo and decided to have a bull light. That bull fight drew not only a lot of publicity but it brought many hundreds of letters protesting from all over the county and even from the governors of other states. That was a great help. It all created con - siderable attention. It attracted people from great distances to this bull fight. As a matter of fact one woman came from Massachusetts to Broken Bow and brought her sixteen or seventeen year old boy be - cause she wanted him to see this bull light. They came from many different states. That kind of publicity helped m many ways but it did not all come at once. I think I spent about six or eight weeks. I directed the publicity m forty newspapers m many sections of the state because we expected to get people from the greater distance than usual, so we put out more matter than we otherwise would have done. We took notices, six or eight or ten lines, sometimes from four to six inches long and we put these notices m forty papers for six weeks or as long as I recall it as long as eight weeks. It didn't cost a great deal of money, something like $400, I think it was. </seg>
            <seg id="p093">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS 93 We kept playing up thin bull fight and playing up the rodeo be - cause we thought the people were getting interested now. We were getting the benefit of all Mr. Tolen has outlined. In each one of these papers we could put a little notice and we could keep hammering on this subject at a small expense and we could keep the people interested. We kept them interested tor quite a long period of time prior to the time o£ the lair. PRESIDENT CEDAR: What we would like to know is just how did you get by? MR. PUUCELL: Well, if you want to take the time to listen maybe it will be of interest. We contracted with a company that is one of the outstanding organizations of this country to put on a bull flght. Their man was going to Mexico City to bring the matadors. He was going to bring the bulls from Mexico. We wanted to put it on in a genuine way but we realized that we couldn't kill any bulls in Ne - braska. It was alright to pull the flght with the exception of torturing in- killing the bull. You will probably be interested in knowing that the bulls were shipped, the best they could get' from the Mexican border. He went to Mexico City to bring back the matodors. These bull fighters were all bull fighters that had plenty of notoriety. He got lo the border at HI Paso, Texas and they stopped them there. On account o£ them being contract labor they wouldn't let them come across. Then we had to put up a bond of $500 for each Mexican. So that it would assure the government that they would all be sent back lo .Mexico. Our time was short and it was considerable expense at - tached the phone calls, telegrams and such between here and Chi - cago and New York Hond companies. After considerable work we eventually put up the money lo assure that they would all go back. Then they were still unable to let them out of the doors and come into this country for the reason that they would all have to have a pass - port or some kind of a clearance from the Commissioner of Labor at Washington. Then we had to go through another siege and we had to get our representative in congress busy. We had the matadors on this side of the border at El Paso and in charge of the customs officer and they were held there from Monday until Friday and our fair was to start the following Tuesday. We got that all cleared and rushed them post haste to Broken Bow in time for the start of the. fair. It was interesting enough. We had representatives from one of the film companies there to take pictures of the event and they took news reels or moving pictures. PRESIDENT CEDAR: The next topic on our program is — What the County Fairs Mean to the Ak-Sar-Bcn by J. Isaacson, Omaha. J. ISAACSON, Omaha: I am kind of a novice in this business. I </seg>
            <seg id="p094">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 94 grew up with the newspaper business like my friend Bill Maupin. There has only been in the last few months since I became identified with the Ak-Sar-Ben that I have come to have this relationship with county fairs. In otherwords, Mr. Schellburg, the president of Ak- Sar-Ben told me very specifically what to say in this speech. As near as I can remember it, I am going to repeat it. I think we all realize that there is a place in the scheme of the Fair world for each and every project. For instance, the County Fair, the State Fair and the International shows such as the Ak-Sar-Ben each has its place. The county fair is a preparatory field and a training ground for the State Pair. The exhibits are shown there and they come on to the Inter - national show. The exhibits go through a sort of a elimination process starting with the County Fair. Only the best of them go on to the State Fair and from the State Fair they come on to the National shows, such as the Ak-Sar-Ben, Royal at Kansas City and the International Exposition at Chicago. Ak-Siir-Ben is quite proud of its record tak - ing into consideration it is only five years old and in that live years the Ak-Sar-Ben Stock Show broke all previous records. Some of these facts may interest you. We don't operate any Honky Tonk carnivals and we never have yet staged a bull fight. I think some of you may re - member when I managed the Automobile Speed Trials, the tryouts • with Speed Bradford. I have had some experience in those kind of things. But going back to the Ak-Sar-Ben Stock Show which is five years old last year. The American Royal was the only place that sur - passed the Ak-Sar-Ben Stock Show in its Hereford stock display. It might be remembered that the American Royal celebrating its fiftieth anniversary and the American Hereford Cattle Association is putting forth every effort to make a display there. We had' the fourth best show in the world with approximately 750 displayed in the Aberdeen- Angus division. We had exhibitors from many counties in this state and from many states. Two years ago there were many loyal supporters who though) this show ought to have some state aid for the Ak-Sar-Ben Stock show. I think they started out by requesting an appropriation of $40,000 for the biennum. They reduced that to $30,000, finally to $2o,ooo and finally they got nothing as so many of those things will do. We have gone on and developed this show so that we are very happy over the progress that it has made. Naturally, being connected with the Ak-Sar-Ben Organization and being from Omaha, I am proud of the showing they made and we feel the State of Nebraska should be proud. The Ak-Sar-Ben is a Nebraska institution. It is proud of our county fairs and of our State Fairs and all of these activities and it wants to take its part in helping to develop the county and state fairs. Just before the Ak-Sar-Ben show last year Omaha entertained Dun - can Marshall, the former Agriculutral Administrator of Canada. He </seg>
            <seg id="p095">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS 95 spoke at the Ad-sell League, and I can not repeat his remarks but I was very much impressed with one story he told. He told how when he was just a boy he had a calf that he thought the greatest calf in the world. He took it to the Provincial District Fair and he thought he was going to do something great at this Provincial Fair but I think his calf finished about twentieth down the line. This didn't break his heart at all. It didn't discourage him. He went back home and put in a year taking care of that calf and took it down to an exposition to take first or second money. He did register the next time and he decided to keep on trying until he could go to the greatest exposition in Canada. I just cited that as an illustration of what these kind of shows can do in encouraging the young people such as we have in our 4-H club projects. The Ak-Sar-Ben every year has been backed by the business inter - est. The livestock market authorities in Omaha have been. giving two tickets free to each shipper with a car load of stock for the Omaha market. The previous year there was twelve thousand of these tickets given out and last year there were twenty-two thousand given out showing the increase of interest in that project. The experience of the gentlemen from Broken Bow with his bull fight reminds me of our experience with the horse racing. I believe that the people of the state of Nebraska as well as the people of Omaha would have been better off to have had that continue, if the former attorney hadn't obtained an injunction against the parimutuel, so that we wouldn't have had to go down to the cigar store to do the betting you. might have been better off if you would have had the 8% or the $1:5,200 of the $165,000 that came in on that. I just wanted to point out that particular fact. I am not here to make a long talk, for I don't know enough about this business but I do want you folks to realize that Ak-Sar-Ben is something that exists, that it is helping Nebraska. I wonder if you know about our Den shows if you haven't been to any of them we want you to come. Every Monday night during the summer Ak-Sar-Ben stages this show and we entertain and invite the people from the dif - ferent sections of Nebraska and Iowa to be the guests of Ak-Sar-Ben. It don't cost a penny. You see a wonderful stage show, and usually a buffet lunch afterwards. You learn to know some folks just like your - self. Ak-Sar-Ben is very happy to have you. Last year, the Nebraska Apple Growers Association decided on a policy of giving their apples some distinctive trade mark name as is done with the Skokum Apples on the Pacific Coast. They came to us and ask us if they could use the name Ak-Sar-Ben and we gladly agreed. We were glad to make this contribution of placing Nebraska ■ on the map, for that is our name, Nebraska spelled backwards and </seg>
            <seg id="p096">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 96 we felt honored by their request. It may be that some other products will want to use the name Ak-Sar-Ben and we will gladly extend them the use of the name. We offer our co-operation in every way w" hav h , VZT Ce any ° ther Nebraska P r «'«ct the same as we may have helped Nebraska apples. I will be glad to answer any questions you may have.

            <seg id="p097">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS 97 be presented tonight. Mr. Frisbie, is just getting back from the stock show at Denver and will not be with us until in the morning. We will therefore borrow a number from tomorrow morning's program and ask Mr. Lemley to present his topic tonight — How County Fairs Get Their I'awcr and Light CHARLES LEMLEY, Rising City, Butler County: Mr. Chair - man. I wonder why they came and picked on me for this particular topic. On this kind of a subject I surmised you would want a lot of facts and figures, so I sat down and fixed up a questionnaire on five or six points or questions and sent them out. I got a few replies from some county fair secretaries. I first asked "How Do You Get Your Light and Power?" Then I asked, "Do You Re-Sell Power to the Concessionnaires, and Carnival Companies, etc.?" I got a few sarcastic | remarks back. Now, taking the first question, "How Do You Get Your Light and Power". One response said, "We buy it, just buy it. You damned fool, you don't suppose anybody gives it to us, do you." One letter came back and added to my question, "What does it cost?" came the answer, "la that any of your business — what the hell do you care?" Of course, I didn't feel that I got as many letters back as I should have for those I sent out. I am wondering if the stamps I sent out went where Pete Cedar's radio cavass of a year ago did. The only facts I can give you first-hand would be perhaps to re - view our experience at David City and then ask for a report from some other counties represented here today. Because of the fact that our city owns the plant, it being a municipally owned plant, we always thought they were a little lenient with us in costs. I'll tell you how we handled it up there. In the first place, we just set a few poles where we rather thought we would want the lights. We hitched on where we wanted the lights, and used them. When we got though they just sent in the bill. Xow as to the other part, when it comes to the Con - cessionaires, and carnival companies, we just let them hitch on and be metered by themselves and pay for it themselves; we have nothing to do with it. I understand there are various different ways of working this problem out and I would like to hear from some of you folks as to your own situations. Do you buy this over a meter; do you get it some other way? Do you re-sell to the concessionaries and carnival companies, or hitch them up direct to the facilities of the light people and leave them to deal direct. I checked back over our bills for the past few years; it seemed to me we were paying about $77.00 a year, about where we landed on the ampitheatre and it seemed a little expensive. I think the best way to get at this will be to have some of you </seg>
            <seg id="p098">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 98 fellows tell what your experience has been and we may be able to compare notes on this topic. Just give us the information on its cost to you? How you get it. I want to call on Mr. Hecht of Buffalo county. A. R. HECHT, Buffalo County: I believe we are on the Central Power Company — it isn't municipal. Our cost last year was $187.00. We didn't have a carnival. MR. LEMLEY: Did you get something back? MR. HECHT: We paid for everything;. The concessions paid I believe $1.00. That was for drops into their tents. We paid the entire bill. We got back probably $25.00. MR. LEMLEY: We were not connected up with the city on water. We used one windmill with a motor on it. Our bill for the power in 1932 was $33.00. What will someone else give us on these topics? MR. R. R. VANCE, Adiims County: I believe I have gone over this Question with you before. We are rather fortunate on our power and light problem. We have ;i municipal plant and we have never had anybody kick on it. They are just big-hearted with us. We don't pay a red cent, for water, light or power. They just simply put it in and give it to us. Further than that when we want anything within rea - son, we get it. I can remember when 1 was Grounds Superintendent. I lived not very far from the grounds on .St. Joseph avenue. I would wander down to the plant there and just casually say to the foreman, wouldn't it be rather nice if I went up there in the morning and found two, 35 ft. poles lying here and two of another length lying over there, indicating a certain point: and the ton-man, just said "Hell, yes." And lo and behold the next morning I found such poles at those very points. That would depend, of course, on how big-hearted your city is. I can really say the City of Hastings will do anything lor us within reason. We charge the concession men Jl.r.O a drop; if they want any more then it is 75c for additional ones. When it comes to power and light for carnivals, we don't pay for that and I don't know how much it is. We hitch them up direct. But anything for the fair grounds we get absolutely free. I know last year we had a situa - tion where we wanted a wire run through — where the booths are placed under the grandstand. It would have cost quite a little bit of money to have hired that done, but we just mentioned it to the city and they did it for us. WEBSTER COUNTY DELEGATE: I think our cost last year was $33.00. That includes concessions and all and we got something back on that. MR. VANCE: After all the city has done for us, last year they </seg>
            <seg id="p099">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS 99 went to quite an expense in erecting and maintaining a wonderful electric fountain. They ran a pipe across to that. Now that has been taken down and installed on Hustings avenue and is being made a sightly attraction for the city. We didn't pay a nickle for it, or its use. DOUGLAS COUNTY DELEGATE: We get light and power from the Nebraska Power Company. The light last year went to $236.00. One year it was $205.0(1 and another it was $261.00 and one time it was J3T2.00. The least I think was $151.00. We had a come back on that. MR. NEWCOMER, of Polk County: We get our light and power from the Iowa-Nebraska Light and Power Company. We are charged so much, wo got I think $15.00 from a carnival company. Concession men pay $2.00 to $2.50 a drop, for every drop they get. We paid lighting $20.00 and I think $10.00 for pumping. Mil. LEMLEY: Is there anybody here who hasn't the electric power for pumping? STOCKVILLE, Frontier County: We use a dynamo. We haven't electric connection lor pumping- We use a tractor; we charge so much for a cut-in-. So much for a drop, for light used off the produc - tion of our dynamo. We get enough to just about pay for what we use on the grounds. We just about broke even. We had the expense of hiring a man to look after the pump. MR, LEMLEY: I thank those of you who have given us some information on this topic. It is rather an important phase of our work. We may be just a little bit out of line in places, while other places are more fortunate. Some seem to find this cost rather high, and I trust something has been brought forth of some value to some of you. ;■;■ PRESIDENT CEDAR: This concludes our program for the even - ing.

PRESIDENT CEDAR: How Your County Superintendents, County Agents and Smith-Hughes Teachers Can Help the County Fairs. This topic has been assigned to Mr. Harry Gould, of Lincoln. MR. GOULD: Mr. Frisbie and I just got back from Denver and I don't know whether I am in shape to talk or not. But taking this topic and dividing it in its component parts. First: How Can the County Superintendents Help the County Fairs? Then we will come to the County Agents and the Smith-Hughes teachers. That is a rather big assignment — a sort of three-in-one application. I accepted it however, at the hands of Mr. Elliott Davis and President Cedar. Having at one time been a County Agent and having at one time been a County Fair Secretary, I surmised they figured I must have ideas on both sides of this question that I should pass on to you folks. It seems perhaps that we should have a County Superintendent or some - one who has occupied that post in the past discuss the first division of </seg>
            <seg id="p101">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF KAIU MANAGERS 101 this question, but I will tackle it — How Can the County Superintendent Best Help the County Fair? Well, the Smith-Hughes teacher, another division of this triple question may dove-tail somewhat into the same field. It is a three-way proposition yet it will overlap somewhat — as they are all educational activities; they would all like to help county fairs. The three officers named and the county fairs are all education - al institutions, or educational workers. They all have a duty to put the educational feature first and make it of primary importance. They have a common aim in their desire to develop the highest kind of educational progress according to the contribution of their particular line of work. The County Superintendent is an administrative of - ficer. He has charge of the daily routine of the schools. The county fair is a mirror of the progress of the community, a visual demon - stration of the progress surrounding and evolving from the educational activity of the community. They should work together on a joint task of stimulating the highest type of educational development in their joint community. L,ooking at this from the standpoint of the County Superintendent he finds an opportunity in the county fair. He can offer many sug - gestions and be helpful in laying plans to make the county fair edu - cational. He can be instrumental in carrying out these plans when mutually agreed upon. He comes in contact with the rural schools, and can especially promote the project work. The can, in fact, make that 11 part of the county fair. He is the best equipped agency for the fair officials reaching the rural schools. If you can have his coopera - tion you can easily reach the rural schools of the county. But you don't want to wait until the middle of the semester, but give him a chance at the outset. Get the County Superintendent interested and he can start right at the outset of the school year. He can get the plans made for exhibits at the Fair and stimulate the attendance. He can get the parents interested and they will help foster the project work and school exhibits. Now, let's jump to the last division of this subject. The Smith- Hughes teacher is more directly interested in the actual school work. He is in position to take direct charge of the project work. He can carry this work through the school year, and bring it to a climax when the exhibits are taken to the county fair. You ought to be able to get Smith-Hughes teachers interested in every county. He can do a lot to help interest both students and parents in this work; he can get them to exhibit their project work even if part of the preparation Is done during the summer when school is closed. Then along that line is Community Interest. There is where the County Agent comes in so strong. It seems to me the greatest thing the County Agent can do to develop the fair is in arousing community </seg>
            <seg id="p102">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 102 interest in the county fair. Mr. Frisbie will talk to you about the relationship of the County Fair and the 4-H Clubs and he will cover this part or overlap on it to a large degree. He may tell you that about ninety per cent of our club work is carried on in counties where they have or have had the services of county agents. This 4-H Club work is certainly one of the vital foundation stones in our county fair work. Nothing can be more far - reaching in helping to build up the County Fair than the spread and support of this 4-H Club work. It gathers and sustains the interest of the future citizens. I think the County Agent no doubt does a a great deal more than almost anyone else in bettering the county fair. I want to say this, that outside of the 4-H Club work, it seems to me there are a number of other things that the County Agent can be expected to do in developing interest in the County Fair. I know a good many of the County Agents in this state have handled a good deal of the detail work of the county fairs. I know in numerous coun - ties the Fair has been involved in pretty deep difficulties and along came the county agent with a plan, and lie has formulated a plan of action and developed community interest and has succeeded in bringing the county fair out of the kinks. Maybe they have paid off the debts, or made it a going concern and made it a valuable and distinctly successful concern. He is in a peculiarity good position to arouse a community interest or community consciousness, and got the people interested in the project. He can accomplish many things in the way of launching projects, contacting the people and leading then) into preparation for the fair. I don't know as I would want to say that your county agent would want to contract to pay off your debt; but I think you can probably look to him more than almost anyone else to get you out of a hole, and I believe your county agent can give you ideas and carry out plans to develop community attractions that will bring the people in when it comes to attendance. You talk about how you can maintain these fairs. We wonder how we are going to maintain a lot of institutions under present con - ditions. You come to a position where you must fall back on some agency in the long run that may prove to be a sustaining element. You have simply got to fall back on developing community interest in the county fair if you are going to bring crowds in to the fairs. When it is all said and done, what have you got to have? It is people, who are attracted by what you have to offer. You have got to have crowds to have a good fair. You can only get those crowds by having one community put on something that will bring the people of that com - munity in to attend. Then you have to build up something for some other community to present that will attract the interest and bring in the attendance of that community. The first thing you know, you have attracted the support and developed the interest of the entire county, </seg>
            <seg id="p103">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS 103 or your whole territory, in your fair. These are just in general some of the things for which you can look to your county agent. So we can say in summary, in conclusion that these three agencies, the County Superintendent, the County Agent and the Smith-Hughes teachers are the people within the County who can be responsible to a great extent for the educational development of the rural schools and arousing the interests of the rural communities, and they can be con - tinually working to this end. and they can do a great deal from the standpoint of developing the individual interest as well as developing the community interest. I would like to say, by the way, in passing, that I think the County Agent can do much more In the development of the County Fair by not acting us Secretary of that fair. I know there have been a good many cases where the County Agent has been the Secretary of the fair, and has been considered a good secretary. That has been a part of my own experience when I was a County Agent, not passing on how good a secretary I was. If a County Agent accepts that re - sponsibility as Secretary of the County Fair he becomes so engrossed with the responsibilities and details of the work and in working out the plans, he does not have a sufficient time and freedom to work out this community interest I have been talking about and that part must be neglected. The Fair Secretary has a real job just attending to the details of the work that falls on him as secretary, and he just can - not take sufficient time and additional energy to be developing the interest of the community, to an extent he could develop it if he were just acting as County Agent. So I feel that a capable county agent should not act as secretary of the Fair. I know there has been quite a tendency to force the Secretaryship of the fairs upon county agents and then expect him to also arouse and develop this community in - terest. I believe he can be of all the value I have indicated to the county fair, but he can best do it by being other than the secretary and he can best serve by staying over on the educational side of the task and remaining an educational agency in the county, rather than an administrative part of the set-up. The County Fair can then be a climax of his achievements for the year. ' MR. E. L. HUNT: We may not have the same idea in Otoe County as has been brought out here. It is not our idea to just have the County Agent and 4-H clubs help the fair but rather it is our idea to conduct the fair so as to help the 4-H clubs. It is our idea to have the fair as a sort of Achievement Days for the 4-H clubs. In that way we feel that the school and club activities have an incentive to work for and a way to present what they have accomplished. It gives an opportunity for the clubs to show the community what they are doing. I will agree with Mr. Gould that the County Agent should not be sec- </seg>
            <seg id="p104">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE retary or tied up with the fair board but left free to do his work of development. PRESIDENT CEDAR: We will now present the next topic on the program — Rotations of County Fairs to 4-H Clubs By I... I. Frisbie, Lincoln . MR. PISBIE: Mr. Cedar, and county fair folks, I wonder if that topic should be worded that way or if it should be "The Relation of 4-H Club Work to the County Fairs." Which ever way you want to put it the thought works out the same, that the county fairs and 4-H clubs must work together as no other two agencies could. When - ever these two agencies join with their efforts in connection with the fair there must be the greatest loyalty. The purpose of the Clubs is to render a service directed toward a better living. This work calls for better living and loyalty to my club, to my community, and to my country. I believe, Mr. President, those are the very things your county fairs are attempting to do. If there ever was a time when you need those principals it is in this year of 1O."S3. The 4-H club members are attempting to advance those things as exemplified in their mottos and pledges. The fairs should help them accomplish their aims. I can't help but think of what has been achieved in the develop - ment of the baby beef champion. It has not been very long ago since we produced our first baby beef champion and what progress has been made since that time. In this work our people have been getting better and better every year. It has been quite gratifing to meet with the success that we have achieved within the last week. Mr. Gould and I just got back from the National Stock Show at Denver where Nebraska had sixty-nine 4-H club calves, almost one-third of the club calves shown there at Denver. Out of the sixty-nine exhibited Nebraska came back with twenty-seven ribbons, out of those twenty-seven ribbons there were three firsts, five seconds, two thirds, one fourth, and three fifths. In that group they brought back the seconds in a group of five and the Grand Champion of the show. That Grand Champion was exhibited by Rex Nisely of Dawson county. You see Rex is one of our boys who has grown up in the 4-H club work. Rex went out to Denver and he took every precaution in exhibiting but Rex wasn't alone when it come to that division, there were three Nebraska boys trying for first place including our Japanese boy from Keith county. All of the boys had prepared their exhibits so carefully that when the judges came to their division they took more time in the study and comparison of those </seg>
            <seg id="p105">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS three exhibits than in any other class including the Grand Champion. The boys had taken such pains and prepared their exhibits so carefully that it seems to me that there was the thing that should be brought out in the discussion of this subject on the relation of 4-H clubs for county fairs. I think that most of our 4-H club workers and 4-H club leaders are glad to assist in any way possible in the development of the county fair if they know what is expected of them. Quite often I have gone into counties where you have some boys and girls standing around absolutely without knowing what they were to do. On the other hand perhaps the county fair authorities do not know what they could do. The result is that the fair doesn't get a very good response from the 4-11 club boys. It is very essential that there be outlined a very definite program for your work. The 4-H club people will live up to that program and put across every thing, in their power. There are a lot of lines of work that these 4-H clubs cover. This work is not confined to the boys alone. They take in practically every line of home economics, and agriculture. They can assist very ma - terially and in. almost every phase of your program. If you plan out in advance what you want, these organizations can give you a definite response. If they are given the proper time the clubs can do a great deal in getting the exhibits certified and moved from the county fairs to the state fair and on to the inter-state show. Another important point is that the clubs receive the announcements of the programs in plenty of time. Take for instance the case where the first information that a club has is within fourteen days of the show and after the entry day is closed. It is necessary to have cooperation with the show and you can not expect that when the information first comes to the ex - hibitor or to their club within fourteen days of the closing of the entries. An opportunity is lost that would have been saved if the information had been received in advance. Don't keep putting off the announcement thinking that next month is going to leave sufficient time for the 4-H club to prepare their work. It is only fair to the clubs to give them advance information to get ready. I don't think we have had many slips in Nebraska, but there should be a definite under - standing far enough in advance to enable proper preparations. There is another thing that would help, if we could have our judges explain more fully why they make some of the placements they do. That would make it easier for our boys and girls to attain the high stand - ards they are attempting. If the judges fail to assign the reasons they have for placing one exhibit over another our fair is going to lose some of its opportunity to be an educational institution. Now before we close there is another line of work to which we might give a moment. That is the demonstrations and they can do a </seg>
            <seg id="p106">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE great deal to help the county fair. On that, we could talk for hours. It is quite beneficial to have the demonstrations set up right in front of the grandstand. You can hardly realize the pride and inspiration with which the boys and girls take their place in front of the grand - stand and attempt to do their work in front of the whole crowd. They are inspired to give something new and something different. They are proud to appear before dad, mother and all of the neighbors. It is inspiring to hear a dad sit there and say "you know I just knew he could do that, but I hardly knew it was in Jimmie." This leads to the cooperation of the parents and the local leaders and every body else to put over the demonstration. Then there is another thing, the progress of these Style Shows. As busy a man as George Jackson has been with all of the other things he has had to do he has taken a keen interest in these Style Shows. There are a lot of other fellows just like him who want to see the girls of the State of Nebraska display their work that they have done in the clothing line and the interest in this work has been growing year by year. That work applies not only to the State Fair but the foundation of the showing that is made at the State Fair must be laid at the annual style shows that have been held at the respective county fairs. That is a big possibility for the county fair and I am glad to say that a lot of them are using it. It has proven to be quite an attraction in the entertainment line as well as in an educational way. Another featnre that has been drawing the attention of people is the Song Contest. That is a good way of developing the community spirit. I don't believe there is anything that does more to appeal to people than the Song Contest launched by the 4-H clubs. There are a good many things where these two agencies can cooperate upon and upon which I might elaborate. You can just pick out activities of the 4-H club and develop your plans to fit any of them but you must let the leaders know what is expected of them. Hut I want to impress on you that time for preparation is essential. It is hard to work if you wait until folks are busy with other things. There are a lot of people who are glad to have you depend on them but you must get out your program in advance so that the leaders and members will be able to respond to your suggestions. If they know in the spring what you want, the local leaders in the 4-H club work can get ready to meet it during the summer. Just take a glance at the remarkable development of this 4-H club work within the last twelve years. We had 5000 in 1920 and in 1932 we had 17,552. That tells the story. There are many other things I could say but I want to leave the few impressions with you. PRESIDENT CEDAR: We wish to thank Mr. Frisbie for his re - marks.

Nebraska is chiefly an agricultural-live stock state. The Fair is the show-window of Nebraska's greatest industry. Present conditions make it imperative for the continuance of county and state aid if the fairs in Nebraska are to carry on. A decrease in the number of Ne - braska fairs would be a step backward and the discontinuance of the State Fair, if such a thing should happen, would be a blow to the agricultural as well as all other industries of Nebraska that would take years to overcome. </seg>
            <seg id="p109">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS Therefore, we urge the necessity, greater at this time than ever before, of continued aid from the Nebraska Legislature and con - tinued support of 4-H clubs and other allied educational work by - county and state fairs. We urge the need of the greatest economy in all departments of fair work. We endorse the greatest efforts for a continued higher type of ex - hibits and the best premiums possible under present conditions. We insist on the elimination of all gambling and questionable shows on all Nebraska fair grounds. It is with profound sorrow we record the death of Joseph Roberts of Fremont, in October 1932, also a past president of the State Board of Agriculture. Also of R. M. Wolcott of Central City, in November 1932, also a past president of the State Board of Agriculture. Both of these members devoted much of their lives to county and state fair work. They were representative and useful citizens in their communities and in the state at large and were greatly beloved by their large circle of fair members and workers. Therefore, resolved that these resolutions in respect to their mem - ories be spread upon the records of this Association and copies be sent to the families of the deceased. Respectfully submitted, E. R. PURCELL, ALVAH H. HECHT" MR. PURCELL: I move the adoption of these resolutions. Motion seconded. Vote taken. Motion carried. PRESIDENT CEDAR: We now come to the last assigned topic on our program. That is What Do County Fairs Pay Their Help by Henry F. Kuhl, Bloomlield. MR. KUHL: As I do not know much about what other county fairs pay their help it is therefore my thought to start out this dis - cussion by telling you what Knox County did in 1931 and then asking some of you to give us brief reports. There is much variation in the amount they paid for labor. Some pay less than $100 and others more than $1000. Some pay considerable more for police service than others do. Some will average about 20c an hour. Some pay in a season ticket and there is an occasional possibility of a fair being policed on a volunteer or donation basis. Before the opening day of the fair we issued the workers complimentary tickets. Thus we got much of the work done on our county fair. We considered dollars </seg>
            <seg id="p110">REPORT OF NEBRASKA. STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE saved on the labor bill was that much applied on keeping up the fair I wonder if Mr. Vance would tell us what they do at Hastings. ■ MR. VANCE: I haven't very much to say. We have been paying our help by the hour and they put in many hours. Now we pay them a flat rate per day and then work them all the time that is required The men around the gates get about $2 per day, and the other help such as the police get about $3 per day but we get some help from the City of Hastings which gives us the help of ten or fifteen poice - men free. Our Superintendents are picked from the board and they don t get anything. They have been giving the Assistant Superin - tendent about U per day. We are figuring this year that we are going to cut wages all along the line and I believe we will get just as good help as ever. We pay the girl in the County Agent's office' I believe a total of about $120 for the year. She helps all through the fair, before the fair and after the fair. MR. E. R; PURCELL: I would rather have had Mr. Butler our president of the county fair here to have answered this question Yast year we didn't pay any salaries. The president of our fair Mr Butler put in a tremendous amount of time. The Secretary drew no salary whatever, nor did the members of the Board of Directors. Not onlv did these people work without pay but every one paid their own way into the ground. There were no exceptions. The gatemen, however were paid a dollar a day: we did pay a little to the judges who came from a distance. We found this drastic course necessary in order to get out of debt and we appreciated the cooperation of everybody in - deed. I think I told you about the Thrift Tickets that were sold in advance to the business men. MR. ATKINS OF MORRILL COUNTY: We paid our labor a $1 50 per day. They bought their tickets at 25c: which left them a H 25 per day. Every one connected with the fair otherwise, was asked to buy a season ticket and we had no salaries. We expect to use the same plan this coming year. PRESIDENT CEDAR: We don't want you to forget the banquet which starts at 5:30. I will appoint a ticket sales committee, Messrs Purcell, Winter, Jackson, Miller and Lemley. Now is there anything we have over looked before going ahead with the election of the of - ficers for the coming year. MR. R. C. JOHNSON: I was wondering if as our financial state - ment shows we have built up a surplus or reserve of $600 and if we could not cut our dues down to $5 instead of leaving them at $10 I •don t believe we need this large a surplus and we could also reduce 'the .salary of the Secretary to $50.

            <seg id="p111">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION Or FAIR MANAGERS }'•' ' ' "■' •■'■-'■ ' ■ $600. None of the expenses for 1933 have been paid yet. I wouio. adopt the suggestion that the gentleman makes about the Secretary's salary but I am not so sure about cutting down the dues. When some of these expenses are paid which will probably run around $350 for the convention we will not have so much. MR. JOHNSON: Don't you think we could get along even if the dues were placed at $5. I know that was the concensus of the opinion when this tiling came up in our Association at Wahoo. Some of them seemed to think $10 was too much. 1 think the report shows last year there were forty counties paid and we want eighty counties in. MR. HUNT OF OTOE: Along that line, I don't know what the necessary expenses are but can't they be curtailed anyway? This situ - ation is one that has been set up in years past. Now I know for one - that if our fair pays in I will advance this $10 but I don't know what will happen as to getting it back. I am wondering if that is the situ - ation that prevails very generally. Are there many other counties in which it would be necessary for some individual to advance this and take a chance on getting it back? I just wondered if that situation exists in many other counties. I don't think any of the people in - terested begrudge the $10. But I think the feeling would be better if $5 would cover it. MR. HECHT: Perhaps we shouldn't over look that the County Fairs Association is the only one that has an income. The State Board of Agriculture doesn't have one and if we reduce the Income of this association will it hurt the State Board of Agriculture? PRESIDENT CEDAR: I think this could be reduced very easily it' the State Board of Agriculture could get on their feet so they could pay their share of the bills. We are paying our own share and a good ileal of their share of the bills for this meeting. If they were so they could handle their part we could very well cut this down to $5 and still have some money left. Perhaps we could cut this down to $7 and with the surplus we have get along for a while. A MEMBER FROM HITCHCOCK COUNTY: I would second the motion to reduce the fee to $5 and reduce the Secretary's salary to $50. PRESIDENT CEDAR: Mr. Johnson, do you put your suggestion as a motion? I MR. JOHNSON: Yes. PRESIDENT CEDAR: It has been moved and seconded that the membership in this association be reduced to $5 a year and the&gt; salary of the Secretary reduced to $50 a year instead ot $100. Ara you ready for the question? </seg>
            <seg id="p112">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. JOHNSON: With the consent of my second I will withdraw the second part and make it in two separate motions. A MEMBER FROM HITCHCOCK COUNTY: That will be alright. MR. WINTER: I believe the books show that forty-one counties have paid their 1933 membership of $10. Mr. Johnson's motion doesn't provide that you get back $5. PRESIDENT CEDAR: This does not take effect until 1934 or rather it starts in 1934. MR. JOHNSON: That is the intention ol the motion that this should start in 1934. PRESIDENT CEDAR: The motion then i3 to reduce the fees from $10 to $5, to take effect in 1934. You have heard the question. Now if we would cut out this going to Chicago we could save $65. We haven't paid our membership in the National Association which is $50 a year. Now if we should pay that we would still have to keep up the dues at $10. If you think $10 is too much maybe it would be better to cut it to $7.50. MR. ATKINS: I think we will get as much money in dues at $5 as if we let them remain at $10. There are forty odd outside counties that may see fit to pay if the dues are placed at $5. MR. ELLIOT R. DAVIS: If I may be permitted to say a word be - fore you vote upon this, in regard to this $10 matter there are some bills not yet paid, and in 1931 we paid a lot of bills for the State Board of Agriculture. Those were paid in the 1932 report and there are some 1932 items to be paid yet. This should be about $350 when we get the bills paid unless you decide to pay the dues to the International which have not been paid for three consecutive years. MR. FRANK WALKER OF LANCASTER COUNTY: Even then you will have enough to start another year. I think you are liable to get more money at $5. The psychology of reducing at this time should meet the loss more than half way. And the balance you will have on hand. I believe you can get along for another year at $5. PRESIDENT CEDAR: The question that is before the house and which has been moved and seconded is to reduce the fees from $10 to $5 beginning with 1934. All in favor say Aye. Contrary no.

            <seg id="p116">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ANNUAL MESSAGE OP THE PRESIDENT OP THE NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION MR. C. Y. THOMPSON, West Point, Nebraska. James J. Hill, the great Empire Builder once said, "the farm is the anchor that will hold thru the storms that sweep all else away." And now after several years of the greatest disappointments and dis - couragements in our history it would almost seem, even this last anchor would be swept away. However, let us not lose faith in our calling. When we look back to those dismal years of the nineties, and recall the great pessimism then prevaling, on the eve of many progressive and prosperous years for agriculture which were to follow, it is well that we face the future with patience and equanimity. In the years since the war we have made much progress and built up a standard of living which temporarily embarrasses us. The question uppermost in our minds at the present time is, what are we going to do about it? Certainly we are not going back to the jungle age when our chief occupation was swinging on our tails, chattering, and mak - ing faces at one another. It is true that at that time we had to pay no taxes; nature took care of us then and some people still think that the world owes them a living. Rescarcli Should Continue. Dr. George F. Warren of Cornell University says, "scientific re - search, agricultural teaching, the use of improved machinery, are not the causes of the depression but are the major ways in which the de - pression can be met. The farmer or manufacturer who can not in - crease efttciency quickly will be left behind." While I do not believe that cutting costs of production and efficiency will in themselves over - come the present distressing economic situation of the farmer. I do believe as Dr. Warren has said, that these are the major ways in which the depression can be met. There probably never was a time when the experiment stations and the extension service meant as much to the farmer as they do today. The work of these institutions merits the support of every progressive, intelligent farmer in the state as well as the support of every other patriotic citizen of Nebraska I consider myself indeed fortunate to be affiliated with up-to-date progressive farmers in an association such as the Nebraska Crop Growers, which achieves its objects by cooperating with the Agri - cultural College, the Agronomy Department in particular and the Ex - tension Service; the primary objects being to advance the interests of agriculture in Nebraska by increasing the yields of and profits from farm crops thru improvement in seed and cultural practices, and by </seg>
            <seg id="p117">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION the discussion of social and economic questions relating to agri - culture. I believe depressions accentuate the need for lower costs in pro - duction, and therefore it behooves us to keep in close touch with the work at the Agricultural College thru our very efficient extension service in order to avoid costly mistakes as well as to learn to put into practice the best and most efficient methods of production. Just remember this — -regardless of increase in prices that may come from better marketing methods or improved financial conditions, the farm - er who has the lowest cost of production will reap the greatest reward for his efforts. Farmers Must Help Themselves. Farming as well as all other lines of industry have made radical changes in recent years, and strong back and weak mind methods in farming will avail us little in our struggle to meet competition from countries like Canada, South America, Australia, Russia, and other countries with cheaper lands and cheaper overhead than we have. We must remember that less than a third ot our population live on our farms, that our people are obsessed with the idea that they must have cheap food above everything else, and therefore the help we may expect from Congress will be only limited. Anyway, it is only after we have done our best that we can with good grace appeal to Con - gress for help. For this very same reason Congress and our state legislatures should under no circumstances under the guise of cutting taxes unduly cripple the institutions which so manifestly help farmers to help themselves. It is common knowledge that there is an organized attack on the United States Department of Agriculture, colleges of agriculture, the extension service and county agents, by speculative and sinister interests who are beginning to realize that their con - scienceless exploitation of the farmer is doomed, if the efforts on the part of the above institutions to develop cooperative marketing agen - cies is not curtailed. Their actions are not hard to explain. Accord - ing to the Bureau Farmer "the gross income of American farms in normal times is from 10 to 15 billion dollars annually, and the handling of this vast turnover offers unlimited opportunities for profit." In contrast to this allow me to tiuote further from the Bureau Farmer: "Nor are the organized farmers the only ones who recognize the importance of the extension system. The American Bankers Asso - ciation, that hard boiled body of men with a sharp eye for a dollar, who are always in favor of wise public economy say, 'any attempt to save taxes by dispensing with or limiting the efficiency of a good county agent is a serious step backward. Compare taxes and ability to pay taxes in counties with and without agents. The evidence is all in favor of the county agent. The county agent is an important </seg>
            <seg id="p118">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE and indispensable factor in the comeback of agriculture.' The argu - ment in favor of economy in government as a reason for doing away with the county agent falls flat before the irrefutable evidence that the taxable wealth of the county Is increased many times by the work of the county agent. It is a fact that dollars grow from pennies in - vested by taxpayers in the salary and expense of the county agent. The most outstanding evidence of this is found in an independent sur - vey made in the state of Kansas by the state Board of Agriculture. The survey covered, in exhaustive fashion, a period of 14 years, delt with the income of two counties— Edwards and Pawnee — counties in every way similar, lying adjoining each other. The survey covered two periods of seven years each. During the first period of the sur - vey, the counties were on a comparable basis. During the second period, one of the counties had the advantage of a county farm bureau and a county agricultural agent. The county with the county agent and the farm bureau showed in the seven year period a total agri - cultural income increase over the other county of $8/483, 252. 00, or better than a million dollars a year." Some Results of K.vUMision Work. Such results seem most too astounding to be true, but let me quote further from Extension Circular No. 2 6 prepared by our worthy sec - retary and assistant secretary, P. H. Stewart and D. L.

            <seg id="p119">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION ■ extension work in crops and soils 1922-1931 in Nebraska. Most of you are familiar with this work and besides time will not permit of going into too much detail. However, I feel that the work of our organization and that of the extension service has never been stressed enough, else every intelligent farmer and business man would be forced to concede the Rvalue of this work. Let us review the work done with barley. In the first place, figures on the average yields of oats and barley in Nebraska during 19 26-30 show that barley produced, on the basis of pounds of hull free grain per acre, 76% more than oats. When station tests show that the best smooth bearded sorts yielded from 15 to 30% more than the ordinary rough bearded barley ordinarily grown, the extension agronomists felt that they had some thing worth while to report, and with the assistance of the county agents they put on a statewide program of publicity and meet - ings to increase the acreage of barley in the state, with the result that at the present time 75% of the barley acreage in Nebraska is sown to Comfort, Velvet, Glabron, and Trebi barley and the acreage has in - creased from 240,000 acres in 1927 to almost a million acres in 1932. "Corn of course is our principal crop and the Nebraska Experi - ment Station was one of the first to carry on tests designed to de - velop corn of the highest yield and quality. Beginning in 1905 and up to as late as 1920 the Nebraska station conducted tests with rough deep gerneled type, the kind generally selected by farmers at that time and the smooth dimple dented, more shallow kerneled type of e;u\ Altlio these tests showed a decided yield advantage for the smooth type, and the results were first published in bulletin form in 1909, Nebraska farmers as a whole continued to select the rough type of seed as late as 1921 to 1922. This was because organized effort to bring the results of these experiments to the attention of farmers was not as well developed previous to 1920 as in more recent years." Beginning in 19 21, extension workers in crops and soils introduced corn type demonstrations on the farms of the state. These demon - strations consisted of selecting from the farmer's own corn a number of rough type seed ears and a like number of smooth ears. These were planted side by side by the farmer and yield comparisons were made in the fall. Twenty-one rough and smooth selection demonstrations were conducted in eight counties during the first year. County agents held meetings at these demonstrations at husking time and determined the results. For the 21 demonstrations, the smooth selections yielded seven bushels per acre more than the rough type. In 1922 farmers grew 5 8 such demonstrations in 28 counties with the smooth out - yielding the rough 7.5 bushels per acre. The introduction of sweet clover into almost every part of the state is another notable achievement of the extension service. Some </seg>
            <seg id="p120">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Corn type demonstration*, winch comparrtl roujjh nnd smooth seed ear*, were conducted on 3)8 farms during 1931-27. In these comparisons! the smooth selection* averaged 5 bushels more than the rough need ears selected from the game lots ol corn. years ago it was classified as a noxious weed, but today it is com - monly recognized as one of the most valuable crops that we grow. It flourishes on soil that is too thin to produce profitable crop's and when used as a rotation crop has been known to double the yield of corn on very thin soil. I remember a few years ago the low lands around Fremont produced nothing but wild hay. Today farmers seed sweet clover with their small grain on these same lands and get more and better hay than they had years ago, and their small grain crop is velvet. As a soil builder, pasture, seed, and hay crop it is probably more valuable than any other crop we grow. During the 1922 to 1932 period county extension agents held 009 meetings, tours, and demonstrations on sweet clover, and many articles for farm papers were written with the result that the acreage has been increased from less than 30,000 in 1920 to 1,042,000 in 1931. I could tell the same story about wheat, alfalfa, and other crops, to say nothing of the millions of dollars saved combating plant and animal diseases and weed control, but I feel that anyone who is not convinced by the facts and figures here presented is taking the attitude of the Irishman who said he was open to conviction, but he would like to see the color of the man's hair who could convince him. Ex - tension Circular No. 26 is chuck full of facts and figures which prove indisputably the great value of extension work and I recommend it for your perusal. Nothing is more costly than ignorance, it is only an enlightened agriculture that will weather the storm. Relation of Efficient Production to Profit. It Is inconceivable that any governmental or state activity which increases the taxable wealth of a community far more than the cost </seg>
            <seg id="p121">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION of the activity should be eliminated. But let us beware, lest penny wise pound foolish tax slashing deprives us of the greatest resource we have to build a profitable and endurable agriculture. Let us not be deceived by the specious argument that the extension work only aggrevates the present economic situation by teaching us how to produce more when the market is already glutted with farm produce. Efficiency in production does not necessarily mean greater produc - tion. It is better to raise 50 acres of corn at a profit than it is to raise 75 acres at a loss. Turn to page 67 of our last annual report and we find that 25 bushel per acre at 35 cents pays $8.75, a 35 bushel yield at 35 cents $12.21, a 45 bushel yield at 35 cents is valued at $15.75. These figures are based on average figures from 6C con - testants in the eastern section of Nebraska and bring out forcefully the point. I am trying to make. Twenty-five acres could be left in the rotation as sweet clover pasture, alfalfa or other rotation crop, which would give a farmer more time for recreation and to improve his mind by rending good farm magazines and bulletins and to attend to the details of his business which often means the difference between fail - ure and success. These farmers who complain of working from 14 to 16 hours a day are using their backs more than they are their heads. You have to mix brains with brawn on the farm these days if we expect to make farming a success. Let us not be deceived by the large amount that is appropriated for the Department of Agriculture, which for 1933 is said to amount to $186,000,000, for 76 per cent of it was appropriated for national high - way construction, $12,500,000 for national forests, besides the ad - ministration of many other activities which have no bearing at all on agriculture. The Bureau Farmer tells us that the federal cost of the entire extension service is one-fourth of one per cent of the federal expenditures, certainly not a munificent sum for a department of such vital importance to the welfare of the farmer and the nation. THE ECONOMIC SITUATION — PRESENT AND FUTURE RALPH H. COLE Rural Economics Department. For more than three years the economic and business affairs of the world have been gripped in a storm of depression. Millions of wage earners have found themselves without employment. Farmers and business men have suffered heavy losses. People everywhere are asking how much longer must this state of affairs continue? Not only is this a frequent question but it is one upon which few people feel sufficiently certain of themselves to attempt to answer it definitely and specifically. Perhaps the one exception is Roger Babson of Boston, Massachusetts. In December, 1931, he published the then popular statement that the "Depression is over," and with minor qualifications </seg>

For example, bank loans have been re - duced materially, corporation indebtedness has been cut down and much of the 3 billion dollars worth of retail installment paper has been p;iid off. At the same time the national debt has been increased from 1G to about 20 billions of dollars. While the total debt has been reduced some during the past three years, the valuation of total wealth in the country has been reduced much more, until now the two are about equal. In other words, we owe approximately as much as we own. Dr. Warren of Cornell Uni - versity says there are just two things that can be done: 1. One is to adjust the price level to the existing debts. 2. The other is to adjust the debts to the price level. What Can We Do to Correct Situation. Other truths concerning the Situation in which this country finds itself might be enumerated. It avails us nothing, however, to merely recount our misfortunes.

It may be well to repeat the statement that this whole problem is a very difficult and complicated one, and one upon which there is much disagreement. I am perfectly willing to admit that I know very little about it. Therefore, the most that I can do is to bring to you the opinions and lines of reasoning of men who are qualified to speak on the subject. Many proposals for dealing with the economic situation have been made. The more important ones may be placed in three general classes as follows: I. Changes in the monetary system of the country. II. The so-called Farm Relief Programs. III. The adoption of measures to facilitate trade, or — to place it in the negative — the removal of barriers to trade. </seg>
            <seg id="p124">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Changes in the monetary system include such plans as: 1. Remonetization of silver. 2. Revaluation of the dollar. 3. Adoption of the commodity dollar. 4. Inflation of the currency by issue of paper money. The so-called Farm Relief Programs include such proposals as: 1. The Domestic Allotment Plan. 2. The Debenture Plan. 3. The Equalization Pee Plan. 4. Present Agricultural Marketing Act. The removal of trade barriers may be accomplished by: 1. Adjustment of the disparity between prices of raw materials and finished goods within this country. 2. Reduction of tariff rates and removal of trade restrictions (Milling quotas, embargoes, etc.). 3. Settlement of the War Debt question. a. Exchange major part of debts for 1. Reduction of foreign tariffs. ■ . 2. Removal of trade restrictions. 3. Agreements to definite limitation of armaments. 4. International Monetary Agreements designed to stabilize ex - change rates and World Prices. Three Important Obstacles to Recovery. From this point on I should like to discuss briefly with you what many economists consider the three most important obstacles which stand in the way of economic improvement in the United States— and, we may as well add. in the world at large, for the economic rela - tions of the two are inseparably linked together. In support of this point I should like to quote to you a statement from the "Report of the Land Grant College, Special Committee on the Agricultural Situa - tion. On this Special Committee were: Dean H. W. Mumford, of Illinois College of Agriculture H. R. Tolley of the University of California. Dr. G . F. Warren of Cornell whom many of you heard last year. Mr. M. L. Wilson of Montana State College. Their statement is as follows: "Economic interdependence among nations has become so great that no branch of our economic life, and no considerable part of our agriculture, can long escape the effects of serious contagion in the world's economic and political life. So long as economic instability and political insecurity continue to prevail in many countries, the restoration of prosperity to the farmers of the United States will be hampered." </seg>
            <seg id="p125">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION To repeat, the three most important obstacles which stand in the way of economic recovery at the present time are: 1. Disparity between prices of raw materials and finished goods. 2. Trade restrictions — including high tariffs, milling quotas and embargoes. 3. Instability of foreign exchange rates due to uncertainty caused by war debt and reparations questions. Disparity in Prices. In November, 1932, the index of farm prices stood at 54 as com - pared with the pre-war (1909-14) base of 100. The index of prices paid by farmers for commodities bought stood at 106 for the same month — nearly twice as high. Transportation rates, telephone rates, commission, and yardage charges, and prices of far machinery, are practically as high as the}' were 3 years ago. Prices of many other goods and services, although reduced some, are still much higher than prices of farm products. Because of relatively high prices of the goods which he buys, and the low prices of what he has to sell, the farmer is not able to buy very much manufactured goods. Because the farmer can buy little the market for factory goods is poor and many laborers are thrown out of employment. Because laborers are out of work they are unable to buy as much food as they need and the demand for products of the farm continues to be weak. The very basis of trade is equality in the rate of exchange. Re - move that equality and you destroy trade. A significant statement in this connection appears in the August issue of the National City Bank Letter. "The disparity between the prices of what the farmer sells and what he is accustomed to buy, has increased until, as recently reported by the Department of Agriculture, a given quantity of the farm staples will buy only about one-half as much of the other things as over the five years ended in 1913. This is not to the advantage of other groups in the industrial system. On the contrary, it has been their undoing. It is destructive of trade with the agricultural population of this country." Every organized group, business concern, or individual which re - fuses to adjust prices downward in accordance with changed conditions is doing its part toward prolonging the depression. This point is well illustrated by an incident described in the National City Bank Letter for October. "A paper mill, the owners of which, having under consideration an opportunity to shift from coal as fuel to crude oil, laid the conditions before the railroad company by which it was accustomed to receive </seg>
            <seg id="p126">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE coal. The reply expressed regret at inability to make a more favorable - rate and said: '• 'I am sure you are conversant with the conditions confronting the carriers at the resent time and appreciate the seriousness of our situa - tion, and if you should determine to change your fuel it would cause us to suffer a very severe loss in revenue right at a time when we can least afford it.' "To which the paper company replied rather curtly as follows: " 'We are engaged in a business that must meet changed eco - nomic conditions or else close up. It is obvious that we cannot meet the changed conditions and deal with companies who refuse to meet changed conditions.' " We may leave this phase of the question by saying that one of the most pressing needs is an adjustment in prices which will restore normal trade relations between the producers of raw materials and the producers of finished goods. Tariffs mid Trade Restrictions. The second obstacle in the way of economic recovery is high tariffs and trade restrictions. Many of you have read or heard what tre - mendous benefits the corn-belt farmer has reaped from tile Hawley- Smoot tariff enacted about 3 years ago. I should like to aB ree with many of my friends and some of my relatives who sincerely believe that the Hawley-Smoot tariff has saved them from bankruptcy but 10 cent corn 25 cent wheat, and 2% cent hogs have made me Just a little bit skeptical. There are those who believe that we should pursue our high tariff po icy to the bitter end and that we should reduce production ol agri - cultural products to a domestic basis. We have been exporting 50 per cent of our cotton, so per cent of our lard. 35 per cent of our tobacco and 20 per cent of our wheat.

            <seg id="p127">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION Reduction of production to a domestic basis is one proposal. The alternative is a course of action which will enable us to regain our foreign trade. The latter, we believe, would have a much more bene - ficial effect upon the agriculture of the country. There are only two ways by which foreign countries can pay for farm products which they purchase from us. One is in goods, the other in gold. Due to limitations of the gold supply the only basis of a per - manent export trade is to take goods in payment. Our present tariff rates are so high as to allow very few goods to come In. Other coun - tries have followed our noble example and many of them have gone us one better by using embargoes, milling quotas and other types of trade restrictions. As Dr. Warren expressed it in a talk at Chicago last September, "Tariffs and trade restrictions are a part of the whole general move - ment to preserve home markets, — 'to preserve our own business for us.' " This tendency has been particularly noticeable since the first pinch of the depression in 1929. We tend to build a fence around "our own farm," "our own town," "our own county," "our own state," and "our own country." Then we want to sell all we can to the other fellow but we do not want to buy anything of him. Inasmuch as he wants to do the same thing, we do not do very much business. In the long run exports are paid for with imports, and if we want to export cotton, wheat, lard, and other farm products of which we have a surplus, we must expect to import goods of equal value. In - deed, if we are to insist on a payment of the war debts, we must import enough more than we export to equal the value of the debt payments. The United States is now the leading creditor nation in - stead of a debtor nation as it was through a long period of the coun - try's history. Therefore, a restoration of our foreign trade involves two things: First, a reduction of our own high tariff rates; and second, a reduction of foreign tariffs and removal of trade barriers in the form of milling quotas and embargoes. This does not mean free trade at all. It means reworking our present prohibitive tariffs in such a way as to make them merely protective. f Dr. Benjamin Anderson of the Chase National Bank of New York City, in an address before the Illinois Manufacturers Costs Associa - tion last November, had this to say with respect to tariffs: "We could consume everything that we produced in the United States if we had the proportions of our production properly balanced. But as our activities are at present proportioned we haven't, looking at our country alone, the proper balance. Part of our industry creates an ex - port surplus, and, if it lacks the necessary export market, the whole </seg>
            <seg id="p128">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE industrial balance Is broken. Our farmers must sell abroad on satis - factory terms if our manufacturers are to prosper." In an earlier address last year in Philadelphia, Dr. Anderson said We are in the midst of a severe business depression which is world - wide. The most serious obstacle in the way of early recovery is the state of our foreign trade. The most serious obstacle in the way of the revival of our foreign trade is our high protective tariffs The quickest way to get out of the existing depression is to reduce our tariffs so that our foreign customers may sell more goods here and get more dollars with which to pay interest upon their debts to us and with which to buy our goods. If we do not buy we cannot sell. n we do not buy enough we cannot sell enough." Note: World Herald, December 30.— Debtors Would Pay Gladly With Goods. The conclusion may be logically drawn that a reduction In tariff rates and in trade restrictions here and in European countries would not only benefit agriculture but would have a beneficial effect upon general business in the United States because the prosperity of indus - try is so largely dependent upon the buying power of the American farmer. Problems Resulting: I'lom War. The third obstacle to economic recovery is the instability caused by he war debt and reparations questions. From our own point of view it is not a question of our right to collect these debts, but rather the" ones on «n ™ '" ™ m ™ 1 -" At first thought, the sense «„, w we , aff ° rd to aceept Payment?" will sound pure non - sense.

            <seg id="p129">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION I£ we are to sell wheat and cotton to England we must reduce our prices sufficiently to make up for the depreciation in her currency. Why? Because if we do not she will buy from some competitor of ours whose currency has depreciated along with her own. Now, where does the debt situation fit into this? A short time ago England paid her installment which was some 95 millions of dollars. She paid in Bold. The effect of this payment was to depreciate our currency still further. And what of the effect upon prices of goods which we export to England? In order to sell, we must further reduce prices enough to make up for the depreciation in the pound sterling. Not a very satisfactory way to improve the position of the wheat, cot - ton, and hog farmer, or to generate confidence needed to start the wheels of industry turning. To me there seems to be considerable logic in Dr. Benjamin An - derson's reasoning when he says, • ". . . the intergovernmental debt fabric, including reparations is one of the major causes that brought about the crisis and the great depression, and the unsettled state of intergovernmental debts is one of the main cai\ses that perpetuates the depression." He further says, "I do not believe it to our economic advantage to insist on immediate payment." The National City Bank takes much the same position in its pub - lication for August. "It is pertinent to ask what are these annuities, payable over a period of sixty years, worth to us in present value in comparison with the need for some stroke of policy that will inspire confidence, support credit and open the way for international coopera - tion to end this depression? There is need for international coopera - tion upon the subject of money and the exchanges and upon many existing conditions, but there is little chance for such cooperation until reparations and war debts are out of the way. Insistence upon these abnormal payments is a bar or any organized effort to re-establish normal industrial and trade conditions." TAXKS AND THKIR RELATION TO ECONOMIC RECOVERY L. E.

            <seg id="p131">NEBRASKA CKOP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION not wish you to think that I do not recognize that there are many oiner opportunities for reduction. . . There is doubtless some place where public expenditures can be decreased in every unit of government, whether state or local. On the other hand, there are some expenditures that cannot be decreased and others for certain purposes that must necessarily be increased. For example, right here in Lancaster county, because of the large amount of unemployment, we have had to increase our tax rate for this par - ticular year because the drain upon public funds to meet the needs of the destitute is greater than any reasonable reduction we can make in other expenditures. The problem of meeting this emergency is such a fundamental one, that it has to be cared for as long as it is possible so to do. 1 As most of you doubtless know, only about 12 or 13 per cent of the money raised in Nebraska from the general property tax goes to the state. The other S7 or 8S per cent goes lor the expenses of local government Under local government we include counties, townships, municipalities, and school districts. It is very evident that it is im - possible to make any very material reduction in the cost of govern - ment where but little money is being expended. In order to get any material reduction it is necessary to reach the places where the largest amount of money is being spent. It is necessary to modify this state - ment a little bit because there is some difference in the class of ex - penditures. For example, there is no question about the reduced cost of living. The people in the various state institutions can be fed more cheaply than was possible a few years ago. On the other hand, there are expenditures, such as the cost of light and fuel in which it is prac - tically impossible to make any material reduction. The inmates of the state institutions must be kept warm as well as being well fed. Highway Costs Are High. The first tiling to which I wish to call your attention is the cost of constructing and maintaining Nebraska highways. I wonder how many of you realize how much money the State of Nebraska has spent on its highways in recent years. From 1!)15 until June 1932, highway expenditures totaled over $2."?7,000,000. Most people realize that we have been spending a large amount for highways, but nearly everyone seems to think that the most of it is coming from the gas tax, the auto - mobile licence fees, and federal grants. Very few persons realize that over half of our expenditures for public highways has been raised by general property tax. Money raised for roads and bridges in town - ships and counties by means of the general property tax has amounted to over $121,000,000 since 1915. In addition to this some revenue has been secured from the inheritance tax. </seg>
            <seg id="p132">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE A little investigation in Lancaster county revealed that in the past five years the county has raised about $750,000 for highway use in addition to auto license fees, gasoline tax, and inheritance tax. In other words we have levied an average of $140,000 to $150,000 per year on general property for roads and bridges. Good roads are a fine thing, but I doubt if they are so vital and fundamental as matters of health and education. Is it not possible that we have been going too fast during the last few years in the matter of road expenditures when present economic conditions are considered; Is it not possible that we could decrease our road expenditures in deference to present conditions and yet not suffer any material injury? Is it not possible that it might be a good thing to confine road expenditures for the next few years to the receipts that we get from the gasoline; tax the inheritance tax, federal contributions, and auto license fees, and cease levying property taxes in townships and counties for roads and bridges'' If any slight law adjustment is necessary in order to make this change possible, should we not ask the legislature to make such a change? The township and county must maintain bridges, but it ought to be possible to use the receipts from the gasoline tax for repairing old bridges or building new ones. We have had a tremendous Increase during the past ten years in the amount of money received from the gasoline tax and from the federal government, but it has not brought any decrease in the general property tax. Property tuxes levied for roads in Nebraska counties during the past biennium have exceeded $7,000,000 per year which is more than the total general property tax for the state government of Nebraska. High Costs of Feeding Prisoners. One of the opportunities for reduction in expenditures has to do with charges fixed by the state law. An example of this is salaries fixed by statute. Now, I do not think it wise to get too cheap men in gov - ernment matters. In many cases in the past we have suffered by hav - ing cheap men in charge of government affairs. Nevertheless under present conditions, some reduction in salaries fixed by law is undoubt - edly warranted. Another fixed expenditure is the matter of feeding prisoners in county jails. An allowance of 75 cents per day for meals for each prisoner is provided by state law. This is too much It is -x graft in certain counties. Here in Lancaster county we have for some time been paying about $1000 per month for the feeding of prisoners You have doubtless read of the large cost of feeding prisoners in Douglas county. A few days ago, a claim for some $30,000 for feed - ing state prisoners was sent to Lincoln to be presented to the state leg - islature. These men had been convicted and were confined in the Douglas county jail. The county collects 75 cents per day from the state. The county pays the sheriff and collects In turn from the state. Along with this bill there were bills from other counties I </seg>
            <seg id="p133">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION mention Douglas merely because it is an outstanding county. Warden Fenton estimates that it costs him from 30 to 35 cents per day to feed each prisoner at the penitentiary. Of course, the volume tends to lower costs somewhat. In Lancaster county the sheriff lives in the jail. It is furnished free. He has to buy food and pay for a part of the work, but prisoners do a large part of the work. The claim has been made that the sheriff of this county profits to the extent of $3000 or $4000 a year for feed - ing prisoners. Attempts to reduce the cost of feeding these county prisoners have failed repeatedly. Under the influence of the depres - sion, it should be possible to accomplish this. At the present time there is an overflow of inmates at the Lan - caster county poor farm. A woman in Lincoln has rented a house and is boarding and rooming some of this overflow for $10 to $15 per month. The sheriff is being paid $22.50 per month when every - thing but food is furnished by the county. Here is an opportunity to effect a reduction in the cost of government by changing the pay - ment for, if not the method of, feeding prisoners. Mileage Allowances Excessive. Other changes needed in the statutes concern the mileage allowance in counties for travel by automobile. At the present time the state allows 10 and 15 cents per mile for certain specified officials. The state government has been allowing 5 cents per mile upon expense accounts. Most men consider that 5 cents per mile is fair for the use of a small car. I was informed yesterday that the head of a large corporation whose employees travel over practically all the state and do not con - fine their travel merely to paved and gravelled roads, finds that the actual cost is between 3 \l&gt; and 4 cents per mile. This cost includes depreciation, gasoline, oil, tires, repair, and replacement. Budgets, Purchasing, and Printing. The business methods employed in the counties should receive con - sideration. ■■ We have nothing that can be called real budgeting in the counties and nothing that resembles a centralized purchasing Bystem. The business methods now in use in all businesses of any size are not those that are employed in the counties. The counties are still using the same methods that were used 50 years ago. There is no real budget, no officer who prepares a careful estimate of what he is going to spend during the year, and no allotment of so much that may be expended per quarter as is done in the state government. A real bud - get is required in order to bring about greater economy and efficiency. We have found that the accounting system in Lancaster county is not the worst in the state. The levy in Lancaster county for many </seg>
            <seg id="p134">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE years has been below two mills which is one of the lowest in the state. The levy in Douglas county is about 4 mills. Because of our unsatis - factory system of accounting, we have had difficulty in assembling and presenting facts so that they are easily understandable. We have had difficulty in finding from the records of the highway department how much money is being expended for grading, how much for graveling, and how much for maintenance. In any large private business where a cost accounting system is followed, the amount expended for each specific purpose is a matter of record. The buying of supplies for the counties is not done as it is in the ordinary large business. In no county is the purchasing placed in charge of some one person. As you doubtless know, we have a pur - chasing agent for the state of Nebraska. We also have one for the University of Nebraska. It makes no difference whether the University is buying a bull or a book, the purchase must pass thru the hands of the agent. Of course, the purchasing agent does not determine what kind of microscope or bre%d of cattle is to be bought. He does not pretend to be an expert in all lines, but the purchases must be made and approved by him and the records kept in his office. The system has undoubtedly resulted in economy. The same thing should be done in the larger cities as well as in the counties of the state. A better purchasing system will help in reducing the expenses of govern - ment. In many counties the cost of printing is unduly large. I have been told that in the basement of some of the county courthouses there are stacks of old books and blanks that were ordered in excess of actual needs. Is it not possible to have looseleaf record books for the use of county treasurers so that the cost of binding will not have to be duplicated? Many of their books are never completely used. I have been told that there is an opportunity for a very material saving in the printing costs of nearly every county of the state. When we con - sider the possible savings in !)3 counties, the aggregate is considerable. While conducting our research in Lancaster county, we obtained some very interesting information as to the methods of doing busi - ness. As you probably recall, we attempted a few years ago to do away with the fee system of paying officials and put everyone on a salary basis. It was planned that every fee should be paid into the county treasury, but as often happens the job was not thoroly done. Features of the old law have been left that ought to have been changed. Under the old system, if the sheriff did something for the county he presented his bill and paid himself and his assistant out of the fees. Few persons realize that part of this system is still in force. The sheriff still bills the county for fees, collects from the county, and then pays it into the county general fund. This causes a large amount of </seg>
            <seg id="p135">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION 135 extra work. The county treasurer still hns to pay himself fees for col - lecting county taxes and puts the money aside In a separate fund. Then he turns it back again to the county general fund. The amend - ment to the law did not make the change complete. As a result, there is extra bookkeeping and additional cost. The county clerk of Lan - caster county has had the law changed insofar as it applies to him. If lie does anything for the county he does not have to be paid a fee for it and then turn the fee back to the county. The same change in the law should be made as to the sheriff and the treasurer. Con sol illation of Public Offices. One possible place for saving in public expenditures is thru the consolidation of offices. We have too many county offices. Some con - siderable consolidation has already taken place. In a number of coun - ties the county clerk is also clerk of the district court and county assessor and register of deeds. Nevertheless, there are many counties where there could be greater consolidation than there is at the present time. There are G7 counties that have a separate clerk of the district clerk. Now there is no need for a separate district court clerk in as many as 07 of the 93 counties. There is a need in Lancaster county which has four district judges and in Douglas county which has 8 dis - trict judges, but not in all the C7 counties. I have been told by the attorney general of the state that there is a real need for a separate -clerk of the district court in not to exceed 5 or 6 counties of the state. Even in Lancaster county, it would be possible for the county clerk to serve as register of deeds and employ a clerk to assist him instead of the county electing an official who must be paid a much higher salary. The need for consolidation is, of course, greater in the poorer, less populous counties. County Supervisor vs. Commissioner Plan. There is an opportunity for reduction in the cost of government thru the abolition of the system of township organization. In 27 counties the supervision system or township organization is used. All the other counties have what is known as a commissioner system of government. We have then in the state two rival systems of county government. The facts show, I think very clearly, that the supervisor system is considerably more expensive than the commissioner system. It is doubtful whether there is any material increase in efficiency to offset the additional expense. Let us take for illustration the counties of Custer and Lincoln. They are exactly the same size, 9 townships long and 8 townships wide. In Custer county under township organiza - tion, we have 31 boards with 9 7 members to do the work that in Lin - coln county is performed by one board with 3 members. It seems unnecessary to employ 97 men to do the work that might be done by 3 men. It is true that the unnecessary expenses are largely driblets. </seg>
            <seg id="p136">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE but doing away with so many driblets will result in very considerable savings in the course of a year. This matter has been investigated in Illinois and other states. I have here a statistical comparison of Lincoln county which is under the commissioner system and Custer county which has the town - ship organization. The area of Lincoln county is 2.53C square miles and of Custer county 2.5S8 square miles. The population of Lincoln county is 25,627 and of Custer county 2G.189. The valuation of Lin - coln county is $37,0G0,C30 and of Custer county $40,834,764. In 1930, the Lincoln county tax was $110,340.41 and the CuBter county tax the same year was $313,773.33. The per capita cost in Lincoln county was $4.30 and in Custer county $11. US. The average cost of county government in Lincoln county per square mile was $43.51 and in Custer county $121.20. Undoubtedly if an average of ten years was taken, the difference would not he so great. On the other hand, records show that it would be material. Let us take two other counties: Seward, a supervisor county, and Saline, a commissioner county. Seward county has an area of 574 square miles, and Saline county has an area of 573 square miles. The population of Seward county in 1930 was lti,93S and o£ Saline county 16,536. The assessed valuation in Seward county was $1(&gt;,494,6G7 and of Saline county $47,423,530. The amount of taxes in Seward county was $149,874.54, and in Saline county $128,5S7.t&gt;7. The per capita cost in Seward county was $9.40 and in Saline county $7.SG. The average cost per square mile in Seward county was S2G1.U0 and in Saline county $270.00. Comparison of the 27 counties under the supervisor system with the 66 counties under the commissioner system shows that the aver - age cost of the commissioner system is considerably lower than that of the supervisor system. The township system dates back to the days of the horse and buggy. There is no longer any real need for such small units. Here is an opportunity for increasing efficiency in gov - ernment, and while reducing the cost. Yet how strong a desire do we find among the taxpayers to make this reduction? Nine of the counties under the supervisor system voted last fall upon a proposal to change to the commissioner form of gov - ernment. The change was voted down in every case. There is a great deal of talk about reducing taxes, but when such reduction calls for changes in old forms of local government, the majority of men do not seem to favor it even tho it could be effected without loss either in efficiency or essential services. What I wish to urge is that there is an opportunity for reduction in cost thru a reorganization in county government. The statement may sound a little strong, but it is only too true that the greatest Incompetence, inefficiency, and waste in </seg>
            <seg id="p137">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION government is found In that part of the government which is closest to the people. This is contrary to the theories that we hear, but it is a fact substantiated by actual record. I am speaking particularly about the counties and townships. The movement for reorganiza - tion and improvement in government has been going on for years thruout the country, but has not yet made much of an impression on the counties. We are practically right where we were 50 years ago. The breaking up and scattering of responsibility, the lack of budgeting, the lack of accounting, and lack of centralization make for inefficiency and waste. ■■ '■' : .'..'." .. ■'■' ■■ ■■■) : ■ .-■' Many Tax levying Units. We need better business methods. Authority should be concentrat - ed in some one executive head to be responsible for the general con - duct of the business of the county. This is particularly essential when the expenditure runs up to several hundred thousand dollars a year. We should have some consolidation of different political units which levy taxes. The state of Nebraska has 93 counties, 477 incorporated cities and villages. 700 school districts, and numerous sanitary, drain - age, and irrigation districts. We have within the state over 7,500 separate and distinct units each of which has the power to levy taxes. Naturally the same property pays taxes to three, four, or even five taxing units. In Lincoln we pay a state tax, a county tax, a sanitary district tax, a school district tax, and a municipal tax. These five taxes totaled for the year 1932, $28.72 per $1000 of assessed valuation. In McCook the total taxes for 1932 are $47.42 per $1000 valuation. Most of our counties were organized, our towns started, and school districts established when conditions were very different from those of today. The days of the lumber wagon and horse and buggy are gone. There is no longer any reason for having so many minute divi - sions for governmental purposes. There is too great a difference in size between the larger and the smaller units. If, for instance, the people in Cherry county with 5,979 square miles, Custer county with 2,588 square miles, and Lincoln county with 2,536 square miles are able to transact their county affairs satisfactorily and have no desire to divide into two or more counties, why is it necessary to have such counties as Hooker, Arthur, and McPherson so small in area and with so few people? It is really a good deal like a small town with 5 churches. There are enough people to have one good live church, but when the folks attempt to support five, each of the churches is over expensive, half starved and inefficient. A consolidation of adjoining counties would, in many cases, work for a very material reduction in the cost of government and a decided increase in the caliber of officials and the quality of service. The consolidation of small counties would make it possible, for example. </seg>
            <seg id="p138">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE to employ a county engineer or a county health officer of a higher type who would render more arid better service at a reduction in cost to the taxpayers. However, as a matter of fact, we can hardly expect the consolidation of counties to proceed rapidly when we recall the bitter fights that have been waged over the location of the county seat of a single county. Human nature comes in to stand in the way of logic and reason. But tho consolidation be impossible, is it not possible and practicable to pass legislation that will open the door to cooperation between adjoining counties in law enforcement, and the administration of health, poor relief and highways? I submit these as some, tho by no means all, of the opportunities for sane, commonsense reduction in expenditures and hence in taxes, that will not cripple any essential services, but rather with increase efficiency and promote public welfare.

Why should we discuss such a problem as the surplus, and does It have any practical interest more than merely serving as something to debate and argue about? Well, I think, it does, because there are two rather distinct schools of thought with respect to this matter of production and whichever one prevails with the majority of people will determine a good deal the course we are going to follow to get out of the difficulty we are in. In our diagnosis we have to return to the recorded experiences of the past because we don't live long </seg>
            <seg id="p139">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION enough to go through more than one of these things and maybe tnat is enough. But we have been through such depressions a good many times before and we always get out. The beauty of it is that things usually shape around and we are ready to start out of it before we find the remedy. There are only two ways out. Either prices, wages, debts, and other fixed charges are scaled down to raw material prices and we start over or prices are in some way raised to somewhere near the levels at which the bulk of debts were contracted. The choice is a good deal like choosing to take either a licking or castor oil. Either is not to our liking. The Much Discussed Surplus. There is this question with regard to the surplus problem. Just what do you mean by surplus? I think you can state the surplus problem in common language so that any person can understand it and I think you can see that a lot of the argument about which we are suffering from, overproduction or underconsumption, crumbles when you state the problem clearly. If the shoe pinches the foot, what is the matter, is the shoe too small or the foot too big? There is the problem. Now you can follow the Cinderella practice of trimming the foot down to fit the shoe, or change the size of the shoe. That is what we are up against. I A pile of more than 15,000 hushcls of wheat on a western Nebraska farm. Al - though wheat production has increased particularly in the Great Plains area, figures show that on the basil of population in the United Slates there was a_ lower per capita production on the avcraRe for the ten years following the Wor'd War than in the ten year period preceding it. Factors other than total production are affecting our markets. Now, I think you can see how clearly that statement embodies the essence, and really, the fundamentals of this situation if we just back up a minute to see how we got here. Perhaps the question of how we got here is no longer of as much interest to use as the ques </seg>
            <seg id="p140">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tlon of how to get out. There are a good many explanations as to how we get into these periods. They are valuable in a discussion insofar as they might give us some notion as to how we might get out. I suppose you could name a hundred or two hundred things that this Bo-called depression or whatever you want to call it, is attribut - able to. Back in 1893 to '96 we had one and laid it on to Cleveland and the Democratic party, in 1932 and '33 on Hoover and the Repub - lican party. So it goes. Back in the one that ended in '43, they laid it on to old Andrew Jackson and the Democratic party — passing the honors around as far as parties and personalities are concerned. What Precedes a Depression. Take our own experience. It happened in Lincoln; it happened in Manhattan. Here is about what happened 12 to 15 years ago; seemingly happened in almost every other period of this kind. In that period when we were producing cattle and hogs, hotels, school buildings, — more of them each year, we continued to increase de - mand quite fast enough for a number of years. We get into these periods after practically every war. It is true of production in these kinds of periods that it works about like this. Here is a factory we will say that is producing machinery of some kind. It must turn put this year enough machinery to replace what has been worn out of that which was already in existence and produce enough more to take care of added demand because of increased acreage and more crops. Demand is not only to replace the old but to take care of the new de - mand. That is true of all kinds of equipment and manufacturing busi - ness. They must use so much of their output to take care of that which is worn out and manufacture an additional amount to take care of the increased demand. Suppose demand is increasing 10 per cent a year for several years. You can see perfectly clearly that that can't go on from now until eternity. You see the rate of increase is going to slow down. Demand doesn't have to fall off. You see the only thing it has to do is slow up the rate of increase and industry soon has more plant capacity than it for the time being needs. That is one thing that happens in those kinds of periods. About 12-15 years ago we fellows would get our check at the first of the month. That was our income for the month. We went down town with that income in our right hand and we bought with it and in our left hand we took all the credit that the bankers or mer - chants would give us, and we bought with that. And Uncle Sam and the county and local governments were doing the same thing; we were all in the same boat, and it is pretty hard to blame the other fellow; pretty hard to find the fellow whose skirts were entirely clear. We were buying with our total income and buying with all the credit we could get. Uncle Sam was doing the same thing, spending all he </seg>
            <seg id="p141">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION could raise by taxes, plus all the credit he could get by selling liberty bonds, and victory notes. Most of the people around the world were doing the same thing, and that is what they generally do when a bunch of countries get into a war. Nations have the same alternatives that you and I have. When they get backed up into a corner in a pretty tight scrape, they must have food and materials. And when they are backed into a pretty tight corner they will imake most any kind of promises to get these things. Government promises are like yours or mine, the more of them they make the less likelihood there is of their keeping all ot them. But under those circumstances they do just like you and I would do if we were cornered and someone was about ready to lick the stuffing out of us. j They will make promises as long as they can get people to take them. Individuals did the same thing. That thing we call credit is a funny thing. When you go down to the bank to get it, it is credit. When you go to pay it, it is debt. You don't say you are going to go down to the bank and get some more debt. You have heard many say they were going to get some more credit. That is what we were doing 12 or 15 years ago. Govern - ments and individuals were all doing that sort of thing. We had speeded up production, demand hadn't fallen off, but had ceased to increase at the same rate. We had a little more than we could sell. Nevertheless, we kept on spending as we did. We now have a total debt of between 150 and 200 billion dollars. We had been spending the total national income plus all of the credit we could get. It is perfectly clear that when we bought things — wheat, cattle, dry goods, and all with both hands that is with total income plus credit, market prices were bound to be good. What Finally Happens. Here is what always finally happens. Not only does the demand cease to keep increasing at the same rate. One of these days we get our check an we did down at Manhattan and went down to the bank. We found some old promises had fallen due and then we had to take our income and split it in two parts. Part of it only could now be spent for pork chops, beef steak, potatoes, clothes; the other part had to go to pay interest and principal on debts. When previous to this time you had total income plus all the credit we could get, buying your wheat and hogs and dry goods and now you have only part of the .income going into the commodity market, you can see very well that if you have the same number of hogs and cattle that they are going to sell for less per unit. And they will, until some of the income that is going into this debt channel is through going into that channel and starts going into commodity markets </seg>
            <seg id="p142">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE again. Next, this is what happened. The first remedy each one of you and I had to see, for we couldn't wait for a Hoover or Roosevelt remedy, was that of expense reduction and each individual consequent - ly began to cut expenses. That was his remedy. What the individual has done himself largely is that he has whittled down his own ex - penses. Now then that was all right as a starter. We had to do that. However, when each individual reduces his expenses he reduces someone's income. Many IJu.sinrss Taxes Incurred. We complain that taxes are way high. The government, however, is not the only one taxing us. I wish someone would add up and have for comparison what business has taxed and is taxing the people. Mr. Krueger apparently put on quite a little tux; Mr. Insull put on a pretty good tax. Inefliciency grew up in the boom period, not only in gov - ernment but in business. Things have changed even in school teach - ing and preaching. I expect the preachers will pray a little harder in these times. The rest of us have to work a little harder. Cutting expenses has forced this upon us. But we couldn't wait for any other remedy. A simple thing we lost sight of. Sometimes a little bit of a medicine is a good remedy where too much of it doesn't go so well. Notice this, and it looks as simple as arithmetic but we overlook it in discussing serious plans of working. If I cut my expense and every - body else does the same and we keep on at it, in other words, we are going to dig ourselves out by cutting expenses, it is just as sure as fate that if all of us cut expenses we are going to cut the national income. We could go back to where we wouldn't be bothered by expense ac - counts or income accounts. Kveryone would be out raising his own living. We will not go to that extreme, but we will raise more of what we need. We could go back to the state where expense accounts or income accounts won't worry us any more than they do a monkey. We could pick up nuts, raise what we eat and get along without any account keeping. But what I wanted to point out is this. If we keep on with the thing that was a good thing to start with, cutting total income and at the same time dividing it between the commodity markets and old debts contracted at a high level, we are going to de - finitely commit ourselves to a low price level as the basis for future price recovery. Having definitely committed ourselves to a low price level the next procedure is that we are by some definite hook or crook, in some way or other, going to cut down the amount that is paid on debts. If you just let the matter run its course, it will settle itself like it always has. We will come into the time when a lot of those debts are repudiated. Income is small but with debt payments gone, it will be going over into the commodity markets more and more. One </seg>
            <seg id="p143">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION philosophy can be summarized by saying that we did produce 100 much, at least our production outran the increase in demand. We reached a point where rate of increase in demand fell off. That check - ed the rising tide of demand for other than replacement goods and as soon as this was checked that started some unemployment. There was soon some unused factory capacity and then, when on top of this, we had to go to splitting income, without using a lot of credit, we further lessened the possible demand for products. With the same number of units of production we fixed ourselves for a low price level, and either we will accept that low price level, scale debts down as the next step to that and start over again or else we have to take the only alternative there is — do something to raise price levels. Price Level und Debt Relationships. Now ideas on this surplus problem or the attitude that men take toward it largely determines, their attitude toward these two ways out of the depression. It determines first whether they are going to say that relative to the incomes that people have and are likely to have, with part of that income necessarily being applied on old debts, we are going to be definitely committed to a low price level. If we pro - duce the same quantity of goods that we are producing their remedy is going to be to do several things. One is trying to scale debts down some. The other is trying to get commodities cut down in quantity somewhere in proportion to where the income is. What is happen - ing to what is paid on debts is this. You know what happens to your insurance check. You paid your premium a year or two ago. That check went into Omaha, Chicago, or Milwaukee, wherever the head - quarters are. In less than six months that was back in the hands of some Nebraska, Kansas, or middle west farmer as a loan on a farm or in the hands of some working man as a loan on a house and lot. In other words, it was put back to work pretty soon. Now what happens to it when it goes in? Doesn't much of it come back. At least it isn't flowing very fast toward Kansas. Now what is happening to it? It is piling up in banks. That is the reason that banks have more money than they ever knew of before. Some people say we are in a cock-eyed world and it will take a cock-eyed plan to get us out. But we aren't like we were in '93. Then we were worse off for money than England when she made payment in December on her debt. Back in '93 if we made a payment on what we owed Europe, it took so much gold from our reserve that it hurt our banks. That isn't the case today. We have more gold than we know what to do with; more hogs, more cattle, more corn than we know what to do with; more men than we know what to do with; more acreage and more money. It would be pretty hard to conceive of a pasture out here fenced in, all the alfalfa, tankage, corn, and feed of all kinds, and a bunch of hogs in there with more feed than they could eat, and </seg>
            <seg id="p144">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE at the same time to see some of those hogs starving to death. The hogs would have more sense. That seems to be the main thing we are short on. But nevertheless, that is where we are in this proposi - tion. Now the people who see too much produce for present incomes believe that in that sense the foot is too big if income must stay that way for a while and it is going to stay that way until we do some - thing about it. This first method of low prices and debt reduction is the way we have gotten out of other major depressions. If I were going to bet I would bet we would get out this time about like we did in the past. Certainly if we leave incomes as they are you can see that if you produce as much wheat and cattle and hogs as before and only part of reduced income goes for commodities the rest of it going on debts piling up because receivers are afraid to reinvest it. your stuff is going to be cheap and therefore you have over-produced in that sense. Has Total Production Iteally Increased? You have over-produced and will be over-produced, not because the amount of farm crops and livestock has increased faster than popula - tion. It hasn't. Farm production has been fairly stationary since 1925. You can't very well lay* the drop in prices since 19 2!&gt; to in - creased farm production because it has been fairly stable since 1925 and it didn't all pile up in 1920-31. In fact, farm population in proportion to farm production in these bad times has increased. Population seems to have gone right on. The facts are that farm pro - duction because it has stood still has really gone down since 192!) relative to population. So in that sense you haven't overproduced at all. But relative to the income that is going to lie available accord - ing to the first plan of getting out of the depression — on that basis you have overproduced. We have too much stuff to get any kind of a price if the total to be spent is to be further reduced. Why Do "People Hold Money? You say, why do these people pile up the money received as pay - ments on debts? That happens in every one of these periods. There is as much money In the country as there was in 1928. People aren't using it as often. Why do they pile it up? Well, if you had taken a thousand dollars three years ago and stuck if off here in a bank or some place where you could get it, without interest, could you have made a better investment? If you just stuck it away and could get it all back, it will buy so much more today of other things that it returned more than bonds. Seventy cents on the dollar would look pretty good to the owners of stocks. That is why people have piled up money — the same reason the farmer holds on to wheat when he thinks price will rise. So if there is nothing done and we are going to go in that fashion, it means low prices, and it means our next step, </seg>
            <seg id="p145">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION which we are right now setting our foot in, is to scale down debt. We can't do this in the United States lawfully on any big wholesale scale because our laws protect the sanctity of the creditor and debtors contracts. There are legal recourses, creditor and debtor com - promises, bankruptcy, and as a last resort repudiation. These take time — no use to get impatient. If that is what is going to be done and scaling down debt has already started, reducing interest rates on debt and other fixed charges will likely be part of the program. If we are going to reduce our expenses, reduce the total income and part of that income has to go to pay part of past promises, then there is going to be little enough for commodity buying that we are com - mlted to low prices for a time at least. The next thing is to scale down debts as has just been said to where a man can pay. If we don't*. do anything, somewhere in the future we are going to run into debt repudiation and the thing will settle itself. Production Not Uniform In All Industries Another group of people take this view of the surplus problem. You know and perhaps have heard the old economic theory maintained that there is no such thing as general overproduction. The theorist argues on this basis. If you produce twice as much stuff as you are producing, and I do the same thing, or if the farmer doubles his pro - duction and everybody else does likewise, the farmer not only in - creases his supply of hogs and cattle, but lie has also increased the means by which he can demand other commodities. Of course the joker in that is this. If one fellow doubles and the other cuts his half in two then it doesn't work so well. If you double your number of cattle and the number of hogs, they argue you have not only in - creased supply but the means of demanding other goods. If every - body would produce all they could they would not only increase the supply but the means by which they could demand other products. Everybody would have more when more was produced. Well, it doesn't work so well in practice for the simple reason that we don't and couldn't step all production up at the same rate because farmers' production is controlled partly by weather and he would have trouble in controlling the weather. We can't step all production up at the same rate. Therefore we get some industries a little out of line. Some could be increased, others decreased. When we have to swap a lot of the abundantly produced commodity for less of the scantily produced commodity, we get out of balance. Shall Income On Production Be Adjusted But adherents to the under-consumption theory maintain that even though you can't have perfect adjustment between supplies of com - modities, we have got to use our money and credit system as a shock absorber to take up part of the jar. Their view is that it will take us so long by the debt scaling method to get out that there "will be </seg>
            <seg id="p146">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 146 many more bankruptcies and much more suffering. After all when you go to digging out by saving you can go to a certain degree in that direction but beyond that you are saving on the expense account at the expense of the income account. You are putting a man out of work in one place, putting one on at another and collecting from the fewer fellows that are left at work to take care of the unemployed. If you put the men on the Red Cross list, you still have to pay them that way, or someone else does. After you have cut down to the point where human efficiencies can do little more you can't go very far beyond that by continuous saving. So this second group holds to this idea, that after all the nigger in the woodpile has been the change in income. This is the thing that happened hack in 1928 and 1929. Practically all of the decline in income since 19 29 has been due to price, not to different quantities produced. They maintain that the thing that happened and caused there to be an overproduction, if there be one, is too little to spend relative to the supply of goods. They say the remedy is to do something to make it possible for these people to get a bigger income than they are now getting. Since they have pro - duced as much income in goods there must be more money and credit to exchange for the goods. We know, of course, that this means just the reverse of this other plan in several ways. Here is a man who has a $10,000 loan on this farm. Now either according to this first man he is going to scale down that 10,000 to 5,000 we will .say, or if he is going to get all 10,000 of it, he is going to scale down the value of each one of those dollars. Both methods have been proposed. The second group suggests that we get away from the surplus problem by changing income instead of changing production and to change the income without changing production would change the value of the dollars in which income is measured. In this case, the man would still get his $10,000 but it wouldn't be ?10,000 like the present dollar. That plan, however, has some drawbacks. It pre - sents difficulties. At The Fork In The Rand There are then only two broad roads out. and as I have said it is a good deal like the time when as kids we got into trou.ble. I can remember there were only two ways — one was a licking and the other castor oil. Either was bad. That is the way it is with these two ways out of the depression. There is no magic about either way, although we always hope in these periods that some fairy will appear or some magician will come to the stage and give us a trick whereby everything will be paid without us spending anything. The longer we stand at the forks of the road and debate which fork to take the longer we will be getting to destination. We have been down both roads before. There is no "buggerman" down either. Most of the experi - ence is pretty clear cut. Although there are some new conditions, </seg>
            <seg id="p147">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION 147 human nature has not changed as much as styles. The first road commits us to a low price level and the scale-down of all prices and debts. The other road is one in which we try to raise the price level. One proposal to make it so there won't be an over-pro - duction is to change the value of the dollar and make it possible for people to pay their debt off faster without scaling down debts. This is to be done by Congress making the mint price of gold around $30 an ounce, for instance, instead of approximately $20 as at present. The theory is that since each dollar is redeemable in a less weight of gold, it will be worth less and, therefore, wheat would bo worth more. This does not happen over night by magic though if it happens at all. Once the change has been made the dollar will exchange for less gold. In domestic commerce, however, trading is usually done without ever asking gold for paper money. We prefer the paper in ordinary times. The morning after, therefore, a dollar bill would still be a dollar bill to most of us. However, because the dollar would exchange for less gold, it would take fewer English pounds to buy a given number of American dollars. Wheat quoted in dollars would now be cheaper for the Englishman because at the same number of dollars in the United States, the Englishman would have to give fewer pounds. If this would cause the Englishman to become a more eager buyer of our wheat, then wheat prices would rise. If other things like tariffs and debts interferred [with his buying, then we would have preformed no economic magic. That is the way reducing the value of the dollar would work if it worked at all. This would take time. To the extent that prices did rise dejbts could be paid off easier if paid immediately. France raised prices that way, but French prices are now falling about as fast as anywhere. There is this way out — by working on income. Many bankers and men in the east are afraid of this second method. A lot of us out here are afraid of this method and used to the first one. But you can see this second method means tampering with money and it gives men the "heebeejebies." There is some question about using this method. It is not all smooth sailing. For that reason a lot of people in the east who don't believe the allotment plan will do so much would much rather have people working and thinking on the voluntary domestic allotment plan or some such plan which has to do with the reduction of the quantity of goods so they won't be thinking of doing the other thing, namely, tampering with money and the value of the dollar. I don't know whether we have answered the question of what constitutes the surplus problem or not. We will have produced too much for the income we are likely to have available if we don't do something along this second line. We have too much if we follow the first plan of getting out. If something were done along this </seg>
            <seg id="p148">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE second line, so that the Income were changed, then relative to the number of people and especially hungry people and the amount that people could consume, why, we aren't over-produced, and that is about the answer to the surplus problem. It all depends upon how we are to act. Relative to what it looks like will most probably be our course, we are overproduced for sale purposes. My Observations of Korean Lespcdcza H. E. Huston, County Extension Agent, Tecumseh No doubt most of you have heard much about this crop. My re - marks shall be based on observations of the crop as it was grown by the few Johnson county farmers who tried it on their farms last year. Please keep in mind however that this is a rather new crop in Nebraska and that there have not been enough farmers grow this crop in the state or in Johnson county to establish absolute con - clusions about its adaptability or value. No doubt, as more farmers try the crop in, the future t and as more land is seeded to it, some dif - ferent observations and conclusions to these I will give you can be made. 1 personally knew of 13 farmers who seeded approximately 35 acres of their lands to this crop last spring and I have received reports from 12. I personally made field observations of the different fields during the year. Lespedeza is a native of eastern Asia. According to the U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, it was introduced in this country previous to 1S4G. The exact date of introduction is unknown. In 1S46 Thomas C. Porter of Monticello, Georgia, found a plant that was new to him. He sent it to the Gray Herbarium and learned that it was Lespedeza striata and that it was not native to the United States and that it must have emigrated from Japan. Lespedeza is also known as Japan Clover, but the name lespedeza seems to be more common. This species is well adapted to the southeastern part of the TJ. S. and is one of the most valuable forage plants for that section of the country. Another species has recently been introduced from Korea though it is also found in Japan and China. This is known as the Korean lespedeza. It seems to have a wider range of adaptability than the Japan clover. Like the Japan clover, Korean clover is an annual and reseeds itself each year. It is the Korean lespedeza that was grown in Johnson county last year. &lt; Some of the men who grew lespedeza last year did so out of curi - osity. They, had heard so much about the crop that they decided to make a test of it. One or two who had been having difficulty in securing satisfactory stands of clovers and alfalfa thought, according to the information they had received, that- it might answer their problem. </seg>
            <seg id="p149">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION 1033 Trials I was furnished 20 pounds of the Korean clover seed by the Agronomy Department of the Agricultural College -which was dis - tributed to five men. The seed was placed in different parts of the county and in areas of varying soil types. The acres of land seeded to Korean lespedeza in Johnson county last year ran from 1-5 acre plots on the farms of the five men men - tioned, through % to 1 acre each by six others, to 7 acres by one man and 1G acres by another. I feel that there were enough men seeding the crop on enough different soil types in different parts of the county and in large enough acreages to make a very fair test. The seed was sown in late March by some and in early April by the others. It was so\vn broadcast by all of the men. Part of the men seeded it on winter wheat that had been severely injured by winter killing. The rest of the men seeded it without a nurse crop. The method of covering the seed varied. Some covered it by harrow - ing, a few seeded on land that had been especially prepared by disk - ing and harrowing, then seeding the crop and covered by rolling. Some few did nothing but scatter the seed, and did not work it into the ground at all. One man seeded a small plat in an old patch of tall weeds. Excellent stands were secured by all. Comparisons were available on some of the farms where sweet clover and alfalfa were seeded in the same fields alongside of the lespedeza. In each of such comparisons the stand of lespedeza was much better than either the sweet clover or alfalfa. In fact rather poor stands of sweet clover and alfalfa were secured on these particular farms, but the lespedeza showed a perfect stand. This was of interest because in the comparative tests the sweet clover and alfalfa had been seeded on the same days as the lespedeza was seeded and the seed bed treatments were the same. We had no comparisons with red clover although on two of the farms the farmers reported that in the past they were unable to secure satisfactory stands of red clover. Some of our lands are acid and on most of the tests the lands seeded to lespedeza were sour, very badly eroded, and run down. This did not seem to make any difference to the lespedeza. Just as good stands were secured on the poorer fields as on the more fertile lands. Rate and Amount of Growth As to the amount of growth secured we were pretty much disap - pointed. The rate of growth was rather slow. The growth of les - pedeza did not compare favorably with sweet clover or alfalfa. On the farms where there was a comparison both sweet clover and alfalfa grew much more than the lespedeza. Of course, since lespedeza does </seg>

The average height attained by the crop on all of these farms was about 6 to 8 inches. On the better soils the growth was around 10 to 12 inches high. The samples I have here are representative. Our conclusions are that where red clover, sweet clover, or alfalfa can be grown there is no particular advantage of growing lespedeza, except for some special purposes. Only three men reported having secured enough of a stand to be able to make any hay. Two of these three secured hardly enough hay to pay for putting it up. The third man was well pleased and secured a nice lot of hay. The first two men have no trouble in growing other legumes. The latter has not been able to grow clovers or alfalfa satis - factorily on his farm. He secured some nice hay and all of his live - stock eat it readily. He reports that his milk cows prefer the lespedeza hay over good alfalfa hay. This man secured 8 tons of hay from 7 acres. IjOspeileza for Pasture Only a part of the men tried to pasture any of their seedings. They report that livestock like it very much. The one man who sowed his seed in a patch of weeds secured a fine stand, but the cattle soon picked it off close to the ground, and in fact kept it eaten off so close that there was no stand left.

One man pastured 12 horses and cattle on 4 acres from August 1 to November 1. All of the tests, except the one that was killed by pasturing, set seed At' first the growers were unable to find the seed. They did not know how to find it. The seed pods are covered by leaves and unless one examines the plants closely he does not find the seed. The plants blossomed in early September and matured most o£ the seed . by frost time when the plants were killed. Ample seed was set to reseed the fields lor next year and it is expected that excellent stands will come on these fields next year without further seeding. In general the men who grew lespedeza were disappointed. Only one man of the 13 who grew the crop expressed favor lor it. This man is enthusiastic about it. The rest probably will not try it further. On most of our farms we can grow such good red clover, sweet clover and alfalfa that lespedeza does not show up at all favorably. How - ever there are some j places where it will be of much value. Since lespedeza is a legume and will enrich the soils in the same manner as do other legumes, and since it will produce excellent stands on poor eroded, worn out, and acid soils where we have difficulty in securing good stands) of clovers or alfalfa, it no doubt will have a place in getting suchi lands in condition to follow with our common legumes that will produce more pasture and hay. According to ex - tensive liming tests nia'le in the county a few years ago, all those soils need where other legumes fail, is a little fertility to enable the plants to extend their) root systems down G or 8 inches to the subsoil where there is plenty of lime. Lespedeza may be able to furnish enoush fertility on such soils to aid in the establishment of other leeumes, and if it does, then it will be of considerable value. Lespedeza should be of value in seeding down hillsides to prevent erosion and to furnish some pasture where such lands may now be producing only weeds. It should be of value to the orcbardist who wants a cover crop, but does not want a rank growing crop. Since it is an annual, it will reseed itself each year. For the man who can grow good clovers or alfalfa, lespedeza probably will not be of material value; but for the man who can not grow these crops and who wants to build up his soils, perhaps secure some pasture and a little hay, lespedeza may be worth much. At least it holds some promise. In Johnson county we expect to con - tinue the observations next year of those fields that were seeded last year Perhaps we will have more to say about this crop in the future.

H. STEWART Dept. of Agronomy, University of Nebr. I recently sat in a meeting with a number of men from south of the Mason Dixon line who were discussing lespedeza. The enthusiasm of these men for lespedeza and the tales that they told reminded me of some of the very enthusiastic talks that I have heard Nebraska farmers give on sweet clover and alfalfa. There seems to be no question about the value of lespedeza to our south and east. Mr. Huston has very well summarized our Nebraska observations for the season and there is little to add. The problem is to find the northern and western border of adaptation for the various varieties and strains of lespedeza. I think none of us believe that this new crop will be of particular value for land on which alfalfa, red clover and sweet clover will start and grow readily. Because of its small yield, it is by no means a competitor of these excellent legume crops. Lespedeza may have a p'.aco in permanent pastures even on the good soils of south-eastern Nebraska. It is on the thin eroded land and on fields inherently low in fer - tility and particularly low in lime that lespedeza has real promise. I saw this past year a number of demonstrations which convinced me of the fact that lespedeza will grow and make a very satisfactory yield &gt; considering the productivity of the soil, on these tliin and infertile fields. Judging by what we know of other annual legumes such as soy - beans, hubam sweet clover and others, we would not expect Korean lespedeza to benefit the soil as much as alfalfa, sweet clover or red clover. It does not have the large fleshy deep tap roots such as sweet clover produces that results in the addition of much organic matter and which greatly improves the tilth and texture of the soil. I should like to present a few brief extracts from letters received from men who grew lespedeza during the 19 32 season. L. C. Chapin, Vice-President of the First National Bank of Lin - coln, was encouraged last spring to try a bushel of Korean lespedeza seed on a very thin unproductive Shelby soil on a farm which he manages in Nemaha county. Mr. Chapin writes as follows under date of November, 8th, 1932. "I never heard of lespedeza until last spring at which time I planted about three acres down on the farm in Nemaha county </seg>
            <seg id="p153">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION on an exceedingly poor piece of land where I had been unable to get either fed clover or sweet clover started. I am very much pleased with the results and shall increase the planting next spring. We got a good stand of lespedeza on this little tract and the tenant reports to me that the cattle would hardly give it a chance to grow. They seem to gather on that little piece of land con - tinually. It seems to grow quite rapidly, but not more than six. eight or ten inches high in any case. It came into flower r;ither late, hut I am of the opinion that the fall was late enough, that plenty of seed developed to make a good stand another year. It is really a forage crop worth while looking into, especially (or land such as we planted this on." John Jack of Humboldt &gt; Nebraska, in reply to a letter asking for his observations wrote: "In regard to the Korean clover I sowed this spring, I must say it had an awfully poor show. It was put on the very poorest old sour washed off Gumbo patch in the country. It had been what we call a gumbo spot down here but it had washed off until it was white and couldn't be penetrated with sweet clover, burrs or weeds of any description. The Korean lespedeza is growing from 6 to 10 inches high now and is stooling out wonderful. As to feeding value, I can't. say at present. I expect to sow more next spring. I think every seed grew that I put out." Another letter which reports the results secured with lespedeza on sandy soil near Bellwood in Butler county was sent in by J. P. Morbach under date of August 23, 1932. "I sowed 3 0 pounds of the Korean lespedeza seed last spring and got a good stand. It was sown on light sandy soil and I have been using it for hog pasture all summer. I have had 42 hogs on about 1 V&lt; acre. Of course, it is not very tall, the hogs have kept it down and during the month of July we had no rain at all. For a while I thought it was going to die out but since the rains it has been doing fine. In another year from now we can tell more about it. If it will reseed itself, it will be a wonder - ful feed. I really believe it will grow where other clovers and alfalfa will not." We kiiow very little about seeding lespedeza. Experience in the states now growing a considerable acreage indicates that early spring seeding on a firm seedbed with or without a nurse crop should be satis - factory. In other words, it can be seeded as one would seed sweet clover. It seems worth while to try lespedeza on permanent pastures, particularly in south-eastern Nebraska. If stock do not eat it off so close so as to prevent seed from forming, lespedeza may have a real value on such fields. When we learn more about handling the crop, we may be interested in the Kobe and Tenn. 76 strains which grow somewhat larger than the Korean variety. The strains may not develop seed in this state but if the seed is cheap on the market this may not be so important. </seg>
            <seg id="p154">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE SOIL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES TO MEET PRESENT DAY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS M. F. MILLER, University of Missouri The subject assigned me is a difficult one. Most all subjects deal - ing with practical agriculture are difficult during these trying times. As a matter of fact, the man who can tell us what is best to do under the present circumstances is a real prophet. What I shall say must be taken as one man's opinion. Unfortunately, in times like these farmers are inclined to disre - gard the maintenance of soil fertility. This always happens during period of depression. We forget our cropping systems and allow our land to erode, neglect the proper care of farm manure, and in regions where fertilizers are used, their application is cut to a minimum. In Hie flrst place farmers haven't much money to spend on soil improve - ment. In the second place farmers are discouraged and they are therefore inclined to be more careless about methods of handling their soil than in normal times. They are looking out for every dollar they can get and they will compromise on systems which will bring them immediate cash regardless of the effect on the land. This is the Bort of psychology that we are facing today. However, in a group of farmers like this, which is really a select group from different parts of the state, there are men who can actually do something in fertility maintenance. This is not an audience of average farmers. As a matter of fact, one can not do much in influencing average farmers in matters of aoll Improvement, but the thinking farmer is still in - terested in maintaining the fertility of his lands. There is no doubt that throughout most of (he corn belt the fer - tility of the soil is running down. I am speaking particularly of the fertility of the average farm. This should not apply to the farms represented by the men in this audience. The evidence regarding soil deterioration is not. shown in crop yields since they are just about the same as they have been for some decades. However we must remember that during the last quarter of a century we have greatly improved our systems of soil and crop management through the use of better implements, by great improvement in the quality of seed sown and through the adoption of other means of improvement. I have been able to observe this particularly in my own state and I am sure that the same conditions exist here, but in spite of these improve - ments the average crop yields have not increased. This means that there are one or more factors which are tending to keep the yields down. The Results of 40 Years Cropping We have some very interesting experiments on the station grounds </seg>
            <seg id="p155">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION at Columbia. For forty years we have been comparing cropping sys - tems with and without the use of legumes and fertilizer and you might be interested in some of the soil changes that have taken place. The amount of nitrogen in the soil is, generally speaking, the best index to the fertility of the soil. As a matter of fact, the loss of nitrogen is one of the prime causes of our declining yields. Where corn has been grown continuously there has been a loss of one-half the nitro - gen in the surface seven inches of soil, which is about the plow land. Tliis loss has been approximately 2000 pounds of nitrogen per acre. Forty years of continuous wheat has reduced the nitrogen content of tliis soil layer about 1500 pounds or 4 2 per cent. Even in the four year rotation of corn, oats, wheat and clover, where no manure or fer - tilizer was applied the loss has been 1100 pounds or 31 per cent. It will be seen therefore that even with a good cropping system which includes clover every four years, but with no manure returned, this nitrogen supply has not been maintained. Nitrogen Losses Great In the State of Missouri we have about one-half of our land in corn. 4 5 per cent to be accurate. Under such a cropping system, where the land is at all rolling, the average farm is by no means main - taining its nitrogen supply. It is losing nitrogen not only through the crops which are removed, but by erosion as well. Erosion losses in Missouri are greater than those in Nebraska, but according to some figures by Professor Russell some of your lands have lost nitrogen in about the same Way as those in Missouri. Where he has analyzed the virgin soil and compared this to old fields which have been in cultivation in wheat or other crops for many years, he has found losses in nitrogen ranging from 50 per cent down to about 25 per cent with an average running somewhere around 30 per cent for the eastern part of the state. Such figures indicate that we are in a more diffi - cult position with reference to fertility maintenance than we have ever been before. The cost of building up land should always be con - sidered. We therefore should not allow the land to run down further if it is at all possible to prevent it. Depression Times Practices What are some of the things we may consider with reference to soil management during hard times? I think one of the first matters is a rather general one, but it is very important. It is this. We should try to handle our good lands well and allow some of our poorer lands to go back to pasture or into other uses. In periods like this when prices are low, the handling of poor lands is not profitable. This is a self-evident fact. We should therefore put these lands to other uses, preferably uses which will maintain the fertility of these lands, such as seeding to </seg>
            <seg id="p156">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE grass or legumes. "We should then transfer our principal efforts to the more efficient handling of the better lands. This is good economics and good farm practice. In Missouri we have been carrying on a campaign through our extension service for the purpose of increasing the legume acreage. This was originally known as the "Clover and Prosperity" campaign, although this name is not particularly appropriate at this time. By clover is not meant clover alone, but any legume that is adapted to the land whether it be alfalfa, sweet clover, red clover, soybeans, or Korean lespedeza. This campaign has made some progress. In con - nection with clover growing we have recommended the use of lime. As a result the tonnage of lime increased from about 10 000 to 450,000 tons in six years. However, we can not talk lime effectively now because farmers haven't the money to buy much of it. The ton - nage dropped to about 100,000 tons last year. The legumes that are being grown during these difficult times are those which do not require lime. The acreage of soybeans has increased tremendously. Just now the acreage of Korean lespedeza is going up by leaps and bounds. This is a good pasture legume for thin lands that is becom - ing very popular in Missouri. The acreage increased from about 10,000 three years ago to almost half a million last year. It would seem to me that in the State of Nebraska where, because of a good supply of lime in the soil, you can grow alfalfa and sweet clover much better than we can, this is a line time to increase the acreages of these crops. This means that you would cut down the acreage of grain somewhat while the legumes would take their place. This will keep up your good land to a higher state of productivity and through the greater amount of protein feed supplied you will be able to feet a better balanced ration which will make your grain crops go farther. One can thus maintain the same number of bushels of corn for instance, on a smaller acreage which makes each bushel cost less to produce and when fed with a good legume ration the return should be greater. This is a general recommendation, but it is one with which most economists will agree. Legume Crops I should like to mention specifically some of the legumes which it seems to me might well be pushed in Nebraska. For a soil building crop there is not much doubt that sweet clover stands first. On our lands at Columbia, where we use a little manure or fertilizer, we can grow enough sweet clover, when it Is sown in oats or wheat in the spring, so that by April of the next year, when this is plowed under for corn, it will carry from 100 to 150 pounds of nitrogen per acre. With the land here, which is still better adapted to this crop, the crop should contain still larger quantities of nitrogen. It would seem </seg>
            <seg id="p157">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION that with the present low prices for seed, sweet clover is a crop which should goa long way in intensifying the productivity of your better lands. I should like to say a few words also regarding Korean lespedeza, for the less fertile lands which might be taken out of cultivation. While Missouri is somewhat farther south so that we can doubtless grow tins crop more readily than you can, I understand that it has made seed as far north as Lincoln, and I have little doubt that It will grow satisfactorily to the northern boundary of the state. Of course, on your better lands where you can grow alfalfa, sweet or red clover these are to be preferred, but in Missouri we find it very difficult to improve on the Korean lespedeza for poor and eroded lands. Of course, the crop is not used much for hay. It is mainly a pasture crop. It is easy to grow, requires no lime and not much fertility. It grows on hot dry seasons almost as well as on average seasons, and when one has said that he has said a great deal. Of course, the growth per acre rarely exceeds a ton and a quarter of dry hay on upland soils, but since it is so easy to grow it certainly is a legume to try. I think one can predict that if this depression con - tinues, the use of Korean lespedeza will spread farther and farther. Erosion Control There is another matter I think we should consider in connection with a soil management program at this time. Naturally, most far - mers are short of money, but, nevertheless, where one has some available funds there never was a time in recent years when one can do as much in the way of soil improvement for a dollar as he can to - day. Labor is cheap and materials are low in price, and from this standpoint it is the best time to improve the soil. Take erosion con - trol for instance, in Missouri our erosion losses are greater than yours. Nevertheless, in the eastern third of Nebraska, particularly in areas where much corn is grown, erosion is probably the most important factor in causing soil depletion. However, erosion control is mainly a matter of consistent labor and the adopting of good cropping systems. If one will put legumes in the cropping system and cut somewhat on the acreages of grain crops this is one of the principal means of erosion control. We have some very interesting figures on erosion losses from experiments at Columbia. About 15 years ago we started a series of experiments in which the amount of water running off the land and the amount of soil eroded were determined accurately for different systems of cropping and cultural treatments. The slope was a moderate one of a little over 3 V2 per cent and the results show what one can do In erosion control by proper crop management. For in - stance, a bare plot which was kept cultivated with no crop on it has </seg>
            <seg id="p158">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AGRICULTURE lost soil at the rate of about 40 tons per acre annually. Right beside this is a plot which has been in continuous corn and this has lost soil at the rate o£ 20 tons annually. Where continuous wheat has been grown the erosion loss has been reduced to 10 tons an - nually, while a good crop rotation, such as corn, small grain and clover, has reduced the loss to 3 tons. The least loss is from a plot under continuous bluegrass, which is only one-third of a ton per year. The lesson to be derived from these figures is that a good crop - ping system including a legume, such as one should follow on good land these days, has reduced the erosion to almost negligible quantities, while under continuous grass the loss is so small that it would take 25O _„ 247.3 \\&gt; TONS OF SOIL WASHED OFF s\V PEI?

It would seem also that at this time, instead of allowing our poorer lands be cut up by gullies, they should he seeded to some sod covering such as grass or a cheap ■ clover to hold them until times improve, while at the same time they may be used for pasture. There are other things we can do in controlling erosion. The filling of washes as they start is mainly a matter of home labor and is not particularly expensive. The use of terraces is coming in Okla - homa, Arkansas and Missouri. I understand that you are doing some of it in southeastern Nebraska. This again is largely a home labor matter and has great possibilities in erosion control for men who will learn how to do it. As a matter of fact, erosion control can be handled by any farmer who will really give it regular attention, and with very little cost. There is another matter which I should like to mention that has possibilities in the way of growing clover during this period of depression, on lands that are somewhat sour, and where a man does ncit feel that he can afford to lime the soil. We have been experi - ment ing on a scheme whereby one can use a small amount of rather finely ground limestone and drill it in with the legume seed rather than to apply a heavy application of lime. This plan is being used some in other states, and while it is somewhat experimental as yet, it seems to work pretty well, especially where the soil is not too acid and not too infertile. In seeding red clover or sweet clover this finely ground limestone is put in a fertilizer grain drill while the clover seed is put in the Brass seeding attachment und both the seed and the lime are drilled into the ground together. By this means it has been pos - sible to get about as many satisfactory stands by using only around 300 pounds of finely ground limestone as with applications of two or throe tons of the ordinary ground limestone, and, ol course, at much less cost. The lime thus applied brings about a better inocula - tion of the clover and supplies some readily soluble lime to the clover roots. This has real possibilities as a hard times measure. DISCUSSION J. C. RUSSEL Department of Agronomy, University of Nebraska The few words that I have to say by way of discussion ol Pro - fessor Miller's talk are only to emphasize some of the points he has made. Our own experiences are always more valuable than any the - oretical ideas that we may have and you will pardon me i£ my re - marks appear to be somewhat personal. The tenant on an estate with which I happen to be connected insisted two years ago that he be allowed to plow up a certain 30 acres of virgin pasture. He was behind on his pasture rent and </seg>
            <seg id="p160">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tbere appeared to be little prospect of immediate payment and as he offered to break up the 30 acres for the first crop, we let him do it. Last year that 30 acres was in wheat. It yielded 28 bushels per acre. Old land adjacent handled in exactly the same way went 10 bushels to the acre. It had been under cultivation for about 50 years with no legumes and very little manure. There was a first hand object lesson of the virtue of soil fertility on a farm that I had known intimately all my life. The estate got one-third of the crop as rent. The wheat was sold for 30 cents per bushel. Out of each bushel raised, the estate Rot ten cents. The gross rent income out of the 2S bushel land was $2.80 per acre. Out of the 10 bushel land, it was $1.00 per acre. Fifty cents per acre went for taxes. The land carries about the usual mortgage and the interest was $1.15 per acre. The net rental income from the 28 bushel land was therefore, $1.15. On the 10 bushel land_ in - stead of a profit, there was a loss of 65 cents per acre. If. somehow, the price of wheat could he boosted to 90 cents per bushel, the poor land would have returned a profit, but it would have been only $1.35 per acre as compared with $6.75 from the good land. Normally the farm carries about 250 acres of wheat and all except the 30 acres men - tioned is low producing. Obviously it is being farmed to wheat iit a loss at present prices. The total loss last year to the estate was about $115. I have no idea how much the tenant lost. Many of you farmers are in the same situation. You are farming your land today at a loss. After you have paid your interest and taxes, you have nothing left. The estate about which I am telling you has on it some more virgin land. Shall it be plowed up? It may be necessary if low prices continue, for there has got to be some profit somewhere. How - ever, in plowing up virgin land, we realize we are selling the best year's of its productivity, the cream of its fertility t for the lowest price that soil fertility ever brought. If there is any way possible to handle the situation without breaking up any more virgin land, and thereby save its valuable fertility for the future, certainly it is wisdom to do that thing. There is one thing that might be done. We might pay the $1.65 per acre over head of interest and taxes out of pocket for 2 or 3 years, until prices get better and let the land lie idle. If the state would provide tax exemption of some sort for land thus taken out of cultivation, or if mortgagors would reduce their interest so that the overhead would be somewhat smaller, it might be the very best thing for many of us to do. However, there are probably no prospects of such a solution as this. </seg>
            <seg id="p161">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION The theoretical solution, as far as our own interests are concerned, is perfectly obvious. The productivity of the land must be restored. Somehow it must be converted from 10 to 12 bushel wheat land, as it is now, into 2S bushel land. The way to do it Is well known to all of us — legumes. There never was a more opportune time. Seed and labor lire cheap, and land rental for other purposes is low. Putting the land to legumes stops the sale of soil fertility for a pittance&gt; restores the soil against a better day, and hastens that day, by helping to reduce the excessive acreage of grain that tends to depress farm prices. Undoubtedly there are many farmers in the very situation that I have illustrated. Many of them, admittedly are in no position to do anything about it by themselves alone. They cannot divert their land at this time from cash crops to legumes. With them the problem is in - come, not outlay. To put land to legumes does mean outlay. In the case mentioned, the soil must first be limed. This will cost about $2.00 per acre. The seed will cost about $2.00 additional. Then there is labor and the overhead charges of interest and taxes, until the crop comes into productivity. As I figure it, the first year's outlay may cost as much as $8 per acre. It will take not only money but nerve to invest in a soil building program at this time. History tells us that many big fortunes have been made by wise investments in times of depression. There will be fortunes made out of this depression undoubtedly. We farmers who know no other business tlian agriculture are in no position to reap a harvest in stocks and bonds. We are in a position, however, to in - vest of our time and labor and such cash as we can get hold of, in tile soil that we do know something about. And, if we can do it now when times are hard, we most certainly will reap a harvest -when times are good again. Question: How do you proceed to increase the fertility of your soil? missel: The case used for illustration happens to be located in a section where there is a good lo:'al market for alfalfa, and the plans are to put the land to alfalfa as fast as possib'e. Very shortly this will be producing a greater cash income than wheat would give and at the tame time the fertility will be increasing. Question: For quick fertility, do you not think that sweet clover has alfalfa beat? I own a farm four miles south of Lincoln. I sowed it to oats and sweet clover. The first fall I pastured it with dairy cows. The next year it was again pastured and then plowed down. The first year 1 got 41 bushels of wheat per acre from it. The next </seg>

Russel: Sweet clover is certainly the crop to grow if you have the live stock to consume it. Question: Some people are prejudiced against selling alfalfa They say that you are losing too much fertility that way. What is your judgment about the comparative amounts of fertility lost by selling alfalfa and by raising and selling corn? Russel: I am not prejudiced against selling alfalfa. With it you can build up your soil and still sell your hay, and in that respect it is a better cash crop than corn. However, if you have land that needs manure and have or can buy stock to feed, it is much better to feed both alfalfa and corn and keep all of the fertility at home on vour own farm. REPORT OK TIIK 103S NEBRASKA CORN YIKM&gt; CONTEST P. H. STEWART AXD D. I,. GROSS Nebraska College of Agriculture Prom the standpoint of number of completions, the 1032 Corn Yield Contest, was the most popular one over hold. One hundred and seventy-nine completed in the Senior contest, and one hundred and Hfty-nine reports were received from Junior contestants From the standpoint of profits, however, the contest was anything but satisfac - tory. With corn figured at 15 cents per bushel, yields very much above the average were necessary to show a profit. The 10P.2 contest was conducted in the same manner as in previous years. The state was divided as usual into eastern, central western and irrigated regions. All irrigated land, regardless of location was Placed in the irrigated region. The eastern Nebraska region is com - posed of that part of the state lying east of the west line of Knox county south to Merrick, thence along the Platte to the west side of Butler then south to the state line. The west lines of Keya Paha Ut own. Blalne, Custer. Gosper and Red Willow counties make up the western boundary of the central region. All counties west o£ the central region compose the western region. Rules of the Contest "Any person more than IS years of age may enter a field of corn of ten or more acres on which he must submit a report giving rota - tion, cultural practices and labor data. Contestants are scored on the basis of 65 per cent for yield. 25 per cent for profit per acre, and 10 per cent for the quality of the product. "Rent was charged on the share basis, this being arbitrarily set at 2-5 in the eastern and irrigated sections, and 1-3 in the central and </seg>

M:in labor was valued at 15 cents per hour, and horse labor at 10 cents per hour, this to cover machinery depreci - ation. Husking was charged at 3 cents per bushel to cover labor, wagon, team and board. Tractors were ligured on a scale ranging as follows: Two bottom plow tractors $0.90 per hour, 3 bottom plow tractors $1.20 per hour, and 4 bottom sizes $1.40 per hour. This also covers depreciation on the machinery which they pull. Except for a I'i'w fields which, were obviously low in yield, 20 pound samples of ear corn were taken at husking time for shrinkage i shelling and mois - ture determinations. Yields were figured on shelled corn with 14 per cent moisture." </seg>

In central and west - ern Nebraska, the necessary yields were 40 and 38 bushels respective - ly. Average yields for eastern, central and western Nebraska were 35 bushels, 20 bushels and 16 bushels, respectively, which indicates a loss of from $1.75 to $2.25 per acre. </seg>
            <seg id="p166">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE One hears much discussion at the present time to the effect that all information which shows how yields might be increased should be withheld from the farmers. The argument is presented that the farmer is already producing too much, and therefore he should not be informed as to how he might produce more. The figures presented in the above paragraph demonstrate the fallacy of this argument It is only thru high yields that the farmer has any chance whatever to break even or to get a fair return for his labor. Nebraska farmers are well aware of the fact that in order to get high corn yields, land must be rotated with legumes or other crops which take it out of grain production. Thus information from Experiment Stations and from thoughtful farmers tends to reduce the acreage of the grain crops, while at the same time it increases the returns per acre The net result is no increase in total production, but a greater economy of production and a lower unit cost of the grain produced. The argument against farmers gaining greater knowledge regard - ing their farm operations is but one example of the unsane thinking now so prevalent, and brought on by the economic turmoil thru which we are passing. As an instance, we are told that farmers are produc - ing too much, and therefore we have low prices for farm products An examination of the facts will refute this idea. Leaving out the war period, which in many respects was abnormal, and comparing the ten years preceding, to the ten years after the war, we find that Ameri - can farmers produced less per capita in the last ten years than in the earlier ten year period. Production per capita. Pre-war period compared to post-war period. Cattle 64 head. .55 head. 14 0 /shead nif' H °K* GO head. .52 head. 13.0 head l\%. Blaming the farmer for the low price of farm products (because of a so-called surplus) in the face of the above, reminds one of the man who became angry with his wife, and took a swift kick at his dog to give expression to his feelings. We need sane thinking in the matter of the farmer's problems He has on his farm his costs of operation, living expenses, taxes and in many cases, debts. The individual farmer himself cannot do other than to make his farm produce to its highest limit. That is his only chance for bread and butter for his family and himself. He has his acres, and each one is encumbered, if not by debt, at least by taxes and overhead of operation. Would we have him lay aside some of his </seg>
            <seg id="p167">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION acres? Or would we suggest that he use slipshod methods in order that his production be reduced and likewise his income? One official in high state, suggests that the sooner we liquidate the farmers, the better it will be for the country. One prominent editorial writer suggests that the farmer go back to nature, let the cholera take the hogs, the smut and rust take the small grain, the T. B. take the cattle, the worms take the fruit, and the grasshoppers, chinch bugs, Hessian fly, cut worms and disease take the rest of it. In this way, he contends, our production would be reduced to consumptive de - mands. No doubt it would and then some. He, of course, is burden - ed with the idea that farmers have increased their production when as a matter of fact they have reduced it in relation to the number of consumers. He assumes that research and education directed to - wards a better agriculture is designed to bring about greater produc - tion, when in reality it is all directed towards greater economy in unit production, and rarely results in a greater total production. Be this all as it may, the fact remains that our production per capita has de - clined rapidly in the last ten or twenty years. Were it not for the break down of our economic system, with its resulting unemployment and reduced food consumption, these same effervescent humans would be drooling about the impending catastrophy of a food shortage and the high cost of living. We need to have little fear of either a short - age or a surplus. The American farmer will take care of both, if he is given an equal opportunity with other industry. 1 Farming is a competitive industry. Every farmer competes asiainst his neighbor. Farmers in Nebraska are competing against those in Kansas or California. American farmers are competing against those in Canada, Argentine, and Russia. Should we visualize our farmers at the mercy of foreign competition, subservient to the whims of nature, ignorant of economic laws, and with their only hope of a decent living insured by a subsidy in the form of prohibitive tariff walls, and governmental fiat? Or should we visualize an independent and aggressive agriculture reaching out and embracing' research and education to the end of the utmost in efficiency, organization, and independence, with the ability to cope. with foreign competition and changing economic conditions? The American farmer is well on his way along the latter course. Shall we now ask him to face the other way? Efficiency of Farm lrfibor. . The American farmer is reputed to be the most efficient in the expenditure of labor of all farmers over the world. Nebraska farmers, according to available figures, are among the leaders in this respect. The story of increasing labor, efficiency on Nebraska farms during the last 9 years, is a remarkable one.

            <seg id="p169">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION a farmer could handle 100 acres in 1924 and 190 acres in 1932. In western Nebraska, the figure would be 150 in 1924 and 250 acres in 1832. The question arises as to where agriculture is headed if it continues with its present trends. There arises the philosophical con - sideration as to what our dreams or our ideals are regarding ' the future of Agriculture. Present trends would seem to lead us eventual - ly to an agiculture that is largely commercial, with but a relatively - few engaged in it, and: farms of much greater acreage than at the present. There are those, on the other hand, whose ideals lead them to think of the European type of Agriculture as more desirable, where - in the farms for the most part are but small acreages, where a large per cent of the people are engaged in agriculture, where farming is a mode of living rather than an industrial enterprise, and where cash income is such that the farm boy and girl have little opportunity for advanced education that would fit them to follow their natural bent. Perhaps a compromise of the two will be the eventual outcome. The most recent census data show that in America as a whole there is both an increase in the number of small acreages, and in the size of the larger farms. In other words,- the medium sized farms are be - coming fewer in number, because of their limitations in the use of large machinery. Land near large towns is being broken into small tracts, where little equipment is necessary to operate them. A greater number of small tracts near industrial centers, which would serve as homes for industrial workers, would no doubt be good for society in general. The size of the land units for general farming might then well be increased to accommodate it to the most efficient use of labor saving machinery. Soil Fertility And Yield In times of low prices, the need of high soil fertility is of even greater importance than in periods when almost any kind of a yield will return a profit. With corn at 15 cents per bushel or less, it is only the very high yield which return a profit. Based on average power and machinery costs, the following table shows the number of bushels of corn necessary to break even under the various rental charges and costs of man labor. </seg>

Table 3 demonstrates that for eastern Nebraska, and for the valley and irrigated lands further west, the need of building up soil fertility to a state where high yields are possible is the only means of produc - ing corn profitably during these times. Farmers who own and operate unincumbered farms and who are not pressed for funds would do well to seed a good share of their land to legumes or pastures, thus being in a position to reap the full advantage of high prices when they re - turn. For central and western Nebraska, upland, this practice can be pursued only to a limited extent because of the hazards of dry weather which in these areas adversely effects crops grown on soil high in fertility. The 9 year record of years since the fields were seeded to grass or legumes demonstrates the truth of this.

All of the winners in the contest, grew their crop from seed of the relatively smooth type. During the 9 years of the contest not a single winner grew the rough type of seed in his contest field. Tests on rough and smooth seed have repeatedly demonstrated that smooth corn can be expected to out-yield rough seed from 10 to 15 per cent. Many growers have the idea that continuous selection of smooth seed from year to year will cause the variety to "run out," and become less productive. Ex - perience of farmers does not justify this. Our highest yielding varie - ties are those which have been selected for smoothness for a good many years. The highest yielding field in the eastern Nebraska con - test in 1932 was planted to seed which has been selected toward the smooth type for 20 years. Market Corn Show The market corn class of the annual corn show held during the week of Organized Agriculture was the largest so far held. One hundred and seventy samples were on display, and the quality was exceptionally high. These samples represented field run corn taken from the contest fields at the time yields were determined They were judged by H. E. Nelson, Federal Supervisor of Grain Grading, Omaha; R. W. Sage, Trans-Mississippi Grain Co., Omaha; and Elvin Frolik, College of Agriculture, Lincoln. Market qualifications were </seg>
            <seg id="p172">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE considered entirely in the placing. Since all of the samples were low enough on moisture to meet the standard for No. 1 corn this was not a factor in placing, except that samples having a high test weight were given the preference. Test weight, damaged kernels, purity, starchi - ness, and size and uniformity of kernel were the principle factors upon which the corn was placed. J. Emmett McArdle of Elk City, Douglas county, won first in the eastern section and Grand Champion of the show. His sample was of the Krug variety. It is interesting to note that six of the top ten places in eastern Nebraska were also of the Krug variety. Altho this variety does not show well in the ear corn class, it shows up especially well in the shelled class. The kernels have a peculiarly bright even lustor, and usualy weigh heav - ier than the other dent stains. Mr. McArdle's sample weighed G3.4 pounds per bushel which is 8.4 pounds above the requirements for No. 1 grade, and 7.4 pounds above the legal weight per bushel.

History Of The Winners In Kucli Section Mr. Wm. F. Miller of Herman in Burt county, the winner in the eastern section with a yield of 100.3 bushels per acre, grew ten acrea on bench land which was broken from alfalfa one and two years ago. Three acres of this land were in corn last year and the other seven were broken from alfalfa in the fall of 1931. The whole ten acres were then disked in the spring of 1932 and the corn was then planted with a lister on May 20th. The kernels were dropped 9 inches apart and a good stand was secured. The corn was cultivated three times. A two-row lister, 4-row go-devil, and a two-row cultivator were used. All work was done with a tractor. Mr. Miller used but 3.2 hours per acre in handling hjs corn up to husking. His seed was a smooth Blair White — Silver Mine cross which he has had for 20 years. His sample won 4th place in' the Market Corn Show. Mr. C. L. Nelms of McCook, Red Willow County, was the winner In the Central Section. He grew his ten acres on low land which was in alfalfa for a number of years from which it was broken four years ago. This land was in corn in 1929, '30, and '31. The land was disked this spring and listed, June 12th in rows 39 inches apart. The seed used was a smooth type of Reid Yellow Dent. Mr. Nelms culti - vated his corn but 'twice, and spent but slightly more than one hour </seg>
            <seg id="p174">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AGRICULTURE per acre in growing his crop. A tractor and 3-row machinery were used thruout. His yield was 72 bushels per acre. Mr. Tyre Nelson of Curtis, Frontier county, scored highest in the Western Section. His yield was 60 bushels. His corn was grown on bottom-land that has been in corn for several years, having been broken from the sod 15 years ago. He used smooth Yellow Dent seed, listed May 15 in 40 inch rows. A two-row lister and cultivator were used. The corn was cultivated twice with a tractor. 2.3 hours were spent per acre in growing the crop. Slump and Sons of Sutherland. Lincoln county, produced 112 bushels per acre, the highest on record since the contest was started. This corn was grown on irrigated land in the Platte Valley. The land was in beets the last two years, and alfalfa preceding that. The corn was listed May 12 in 4 0 inch rows, with kernels In inches apart. The Sub-Station Yellow variety was used, which is a smooth type de - veloped, at the North Platte Experiment Station. The corn was culti - vated three times with two-row go-devil and cultivator. A tractor was used for disking and listing, and the cultivation was done with horses. 5.1 man hours were required per acre. Junior 4-H Corn Yield Contest It is believed that the Junior corn yield contest, as a part of the regular 4-H corn club work, has been a worthwhile feature. While the records of the Junior contestants have not been summarized as a whole, the prizes and medals awarded have, we believe, added to the success of corn club work which is particularly important at this time. Depression times, such as we are passing through, are important and critical for the boys and girls of the farms of America and to the nation as a whole. It is not the doing without of a few material things we had during the boom days that is going to do any serious and permanent damage. It is unpleasant to give up some of these things which during good times were looked upon as a regular part of our standard of living on the farm. The real significance and effect of depression days lies deeper than the material things. Let us analyze the situation in order to make this point clear. This nation, constituted as it is, is as sound, prosperous and stable as its Agriculture. In the past, some people of the industrial east have perhaps challenged and doubted that statement but they now realize it. They are coming to appreciate the fact that the farmers of the nation are the foundation of its prosperity and development. We need a still greater national appreciation of the importance of Agriculture and the farmers of the nation as a stabilizer, not only during current times but for a generation ahead.

Today the boys and girls of the farm and America are hearing much about the Agricultural situation, its disparity of Agricultural prices and those of other products, and the farm debt situation. Consciously or subconsciously, farm youngsters are considering these radio press and farm home discussions in the light of their future ambitions, desires and vocations. Can the majority of them help but decide that they do not want to be farmers or farmers' -wives? The constant din in their ears about farm relief and all it involves cannot help but leave its impression. These youngsters do not see the other side of the situation. They know little about city conditions with its unemployment, its bread lines, the community chests and all of the sordid things these involve. The farm boys and girls in their impressionable age see but one side of the picture. Since, as was pointed out in the opening paragraph, Agriculture is of such vital importance to the nation as a whole, is the state and national government justified in carrying on activities designed to maintain it at a high standard? Normally, home life and the discussions about the family table and in family circles are such that the youngsters are brought to see the good things of farm life. This is not so true during these times. It is estimated that ordinarily one out of three farm reared young - sters leaves the farms for city vocations. This is but natural and not to be decried. The farm cannot use them all. The records that these country bred youngsters have made in industrial, political and professional life are commonly recognized. Coolidge, Hoover and a list without end could be named. But it is vital to agriculture that the one-third of the farm bred youngsters who leave the farm is not the top third from the standpoint of intelligence, ambition, heredity, and environment. Agriculture needs the help of a part of this top group. What can be done nationally to point out to at least a fair share of the outstanding farm youngsters, the possibilities and pleasure of a life spent on the land. Probably outstanding in this regard is 4-H boys and girls club work. The attitude toward farm life engendered by this activity is sure to be felt for a generation after the youngsters have been in 4-H club work. Too many see in club work only the possibility of present financial gain or the prize to be won. These things, while important, are in the end much less vital than the love of the land, the livestock, the farm home and its surroundings that are a part of every well conducted 4-H club. Incidentally during these times when farm incomes are low or en - tirely lacking, club work supplies wholesome diversions and. social </seg>

These are things in which the whole family can find profitable and pleasant enjoyment. The 4-H club activities for the most part pay their costs for the members. Let us stop this work for the time being, is suggested by some. We can get along without it. This would be a good policy if we could also stop TIME itself. But what of the boys and girls whose birth - days go marching by during this depression period? From the stand - point of present needs as well as from the standpoint of a long time state and national policy in Agriculture, we need more, not less, work of this type. The cost is not great and the returns will be coming in for years. </seg>

            <seg id="p179">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION OUR BEST VARIETIES OF WINTER WHEAT ANI&gt; PROSPECTS FOR BETTER OXES C. A. SUNESON Nebraska College of Agriculture. Away back in my school career I recall having had to memorize a groat nuinber of poems. Most of them have long since been forgotten, but one short one stuck. I recall it as follows: Four things a man must learn to do If he would make his record true: To think without confusion clearly; To love his fellow men sincerely; To act from honest motives purely; To trust in God and heaven securely. The title of that poem is "Four Things." I have four things to propose for consideration in the evaluation o£ our (in Nebraska) best winter wheat varieties of today and those of the future. Here they are in question form: (I'm not a poet!) ( 1 ) Does the variety conform to the general attributes of a hard red winter wheat? (2) Is the variety sufficiently wlnterhardy? (3) Will the variety meet my requirements as to standing ability? (4) Does the variety possess special disease or insect resist - ance? Thru their own sad experiences fortified by those of our experi - ment stations our farmers have learned that hard wheats are better adapted to our conditions than soft wheats, and that in most of the state hard winter wheat is more productive than hard spring wheat. It was this basic discovery that elevated Nebraska into the ranks of the leading wheat producing states. linked with the story is the variety Turkey — a name broadly applied to countless public and pri - vate seed importations from Russia and nearby countries. Some of these seed consignments represented the best variety of our yesterday, and even today in a few instances deserve some recognition. The importance of winterhardiness in Nebraska is quite apparent since you no doubt realize that little winter wheat is grown north of this state. Many years ago the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment station recognized that the various so-called Turkey wheats differed in their winterhardiness and likewise that individual plants within these lots differed in their winterhardiness. From this knowledge came our Nebraska 60 which even today is our most hardy, truly </seg>
            <seg id="p180">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE adapted wheat. We have varieties which are more hardy, but un - fortunately they are all too late maturing. In this connection I might let you in on one of the many problems in wheat improvement. There seems to be a close and definite association between late matur - ity and superior winterhardiness, or, stating it the other way, a strong impediment against our getting a wheat very much earlier than we now have without sacrificing winterhardiness. Progress is being made, however. Some Goals in Wheat Improvement. Standing ability typified by lodge and shatter resistance have long been recognized as of importance, but the advent of combine harvest- Ing has increased their importance. The new variety Cheyenne, de - veloped at the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, is a very notable contribution of particularly impressive standing qualities for a hard winter wheat. In other respects this new variety very closely resembles Kanred, a closely related variety with which many of you are familiar. Cheyenne has given the highest average yield of any variety tested at the Experiment Station during the past 5 years. This is our proof of merit. Our present efforts in Nebraska in the field of disease and insect resistance are centered on smut and Hessian fly. Roth of these could be prevented (smut by seed treatment; and Hessian fly by timely seeding), but unfortunately advice of this kind is not always heeded and the effect is punishment of both the innocent and guilty. Ap - proximately 19 per cent of the 1!&gt;31 crop marketed in Omaha graded smutty. In some years this figure has been as high as :!!) per cent. This means that both the yield and quality of our wheat crop is seri - ously affected by smut. Fortunately we now have in advanced stages of testing an unusual collection of winter wheats which appear to meet other requirements as well as being practically immune to our stink - ing smut. One of these will probably be distributed soon. The past season emphasized the need for a Hessian fly resistant wheat. We have been working on this problem since 1930. Tho we have very highly resistant types, unfortunately none of those in ad - vanced stages of testing meet other requirements. The fact that we have our finger on fly resistance means that it is only a matter of time before we will be able to produce an acceptable variety, however. That, then, is a hasty presentation of what we consider the char - acteristics of a truly good variety for Nebraska. Let me list the vari - eties again in their order of recognized greater perfection: — Turkey, Nebr. 60, Cheyenne, and in the near future a smut resistant variety. Fly resistance is also promised soon. </seg>
            <seg id="p181">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION The Wheat Testing Program. That is our improvement program, but its success depends in a large measure upon you men and your seed distributing activities. You need faith in what we do, and to get that you must understand our philosophy and methods. In the first place we are interested in. long time reactions, and concern ourselves with individual year re - sponses only for the light they cast on requisites for improving or evaluating long time yields. Let me illustrate (Fig. 1). In this com - parison Nebr. 60 and Turkey from which it was selected are com - pared for a 22 year period. During the period Nebr. 60 has yielded more than Turkey in 15 years, in two years the yields were the same, BffllWiHfi 10 "I 1 I — — NEBR.6O -- — TURKEY ° ,.M -13 "If 7 1» SI « M W •«» "SI •** Comparative yields o Nebraska CO and Turkey wheat at the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station at Lincoln during the period 1911-1932. and 5 years of the period Turkey outyielded Nebr. 60. The average net gain of 1.7 bushels per year for Nebr. 60 during the period is of interest. Of greater interest in an improvement analysis is the fact that in years where severe winter injury or winter-killing occurred, Nebr. 60 was always superior, while the most frequent cause for Nebr. 60 yielding less than Turkey was to be found in the presence of Hes - sioii fly in large numbers. Hessian fly resistance added to Nebr. 60 would therefore help materially in eliminating one of the hazards from winter wheat production. It is these hazards in production, rep - resented by the low points in Fig. 1, in which we are particularly inter - ested. We believe that there is much more to be gained by eliminat - ing hazards than by! fostering strains which yield higher in good years and lower in adverse years. Obviously all hazards cannot be eliminated giving us a constant yield from year to year because of the importance of weather. We </seg>

Note the difference in loduitiK which is due chiefly to tolerance to hessian fly.

Likewise smut resistance would not only improve the quality and yields of our wheat, but would eliminate expense and labor associated with seed treatment. A word about the scope of our tests. I'm sorry that time does not permit a detailed comparison of several varieties. This would in - clude field, laboratory, and greenhouse tests designed to compare the varieties as to time of maturity, plant height, capacity for tillering, •winterhardiness, shattering, lodging, test weight, milling and baking qualities, response to different seeding dates, smut susceptability, leaf and stem rust susceptability, Hessian fly resistance, yield, etc. Many of you have probably regarded the comparative yield tests which we make as our greatest job, but mere yields have come to mean less and less to us unless we can also explain why we get a given result. A further supplement in oiir program is provided thru active cooperation with the U. S. Department of Agriculture and other state experiment stations in the hard winter wheat territory. By means of this association the most important new contributions of the several states are indexed as to geographical adaptation. Hence we believe that our varietal analyses are in the end unusually thorough and void of personal bias. Time Requirements for Tlioro Testing. Contrasted with this sort of comparative evaluation is the short memory and potency of the present on many farmers. This past year Kawvale, a new variety developed by the Kansas Experiment Station, </seg>
            <seg id="p183">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION yielded almost twice as much as Nebr. 60, and looked even better than that comparatively. The contrast was good for the eye to look upon and many a farmer in the state would have been eager to get seed of this new wonder had it been available in this neighborhood last year. In so doing he certainly would have acquired a variety with exceptional resistance to Hessian fly— the only thing about the variety revealed in a 1932 yield test. That by the way is only a part of one of the "four things" which I suggested be considered. What of the other three? Strangely, all suggest caution. Kawvale is not a true hard wheat, its winterhardiness is not adequate for Nebraska, and it is shatter susceptible under our conditions. In the southeast section of Kansas where it is recommended none of these disqualify - ing factors are in operation, except a tendency toward shattering which is minimized by the extensive use of binders in harvesting. Here then is a variety singularly attractive under certain conditions, but which "under the skin" has some very marked weaknesses which only time and disappointment would disclose to the individual farmer. From this discussion of the variety Kawvale, which I believe to be a very acceptable variety for parts of Kansas, and which we are using extensively in our breeding work for Hessian fly resistance, I hope to have impressed you with two thoughts: (1) that our best wheats must meet certain specific requirements based on the environ - ment under which they are to be grown; and (2) that long time or unusually diversified and thorough comparisons are the only safe, dependable guide in choosing a new variety. THE SPRING SMALL GRAINS IS NEBRASKA ARTHUR ANDERSON, Nebraska College of Agriculture The use of productive, adapted varieties is essential to efficient crop production. Since varieties may respond differently under vary - ing environmental conditions, their comparative merits can only be effectively determined by several years of careful testing. It is the purpose of this paper to discuss very briefly some of the more import - ant and promising varieties of oats, barley, and spring wheat grown comparatively at the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station dur - ing recent years. Oats. Adaptation. A very important principle to bear in mind is that climatic conditions in Nebraska generally favor early-maturing vari - eties of small grains.

In gen - eral, the same relationship holds with respect to the other small grain crops. Varieties. Comparative Experiment Station results for several promising Kherson iind Burt varieties and selections and a number of miscellaneous varieties are reported in Table 2 for the 4 year period, 1920 to 10:!2. The average relative yields reported in this table are based on the original Nebraska Kherson which yielded 62.6 bushels per acre. Nebraska No. 21, a white grained, relatively stiff-strawed oat, yielded 3 per cent more than the original Kherson from which it was selected. In comparative tests extending over 14 years, the aver - age increase has been approximately 5 per cent. Edkin and Iogold, Kherson selections made by the United States Department of Agri - culture and the Iowa Agriculture Experiment Station, yielded 6 and 7 per cent, respectively, more than the ordinary Kherson. These two varieties were particularly outstanding in 1932 because of their re - sistance to stem rust infection. The Burt group averaged about 3 per cent higher in yield than the Kherson group, with the individual varieties and selections yield - ed from I! to 12 per cent more than the original Kherson. The Com - mon Burt which has been grown at the Nebraska Experiment Station since 1905 yielded 3 per cent more than the original Kherson during the 4 years, 1929 to 1932. Burt, C. I. 293, also yielded 3 per cent more than Kherson from 1929 to 1932 but it was the highest yielding variety tested during an earlier 14 year period. Its yield was ma - terially reduced in 1932 as a result of a heavy stem rust infection. Three relatively light colored selections from common Burt, Nebraska Number 517, 51S, and 520 were among the highest yielding varieties tested. Nebr. No. 517 was outstanding in yield during 1929 to 1931 but its yield was materially reduced in 1932 due to stem rust. On the other hand, the yields of Nebraska Burt Numbers 518 and 520 were relatively high in 1932 due to their resistance to stem rust infection. Brunker was the highest yielding variety grown in 1931 but one of the lowest yielding in 1932 due to rust infection. The yields of Swedish Select illustrate the inadaptation of late varieties to Nebraska conditions. During each of four years, it yielded materially less and averaged only 76 per cent as much as com - mon Kherson. Kanota is a. Fulghum oat which Is widely grown in Kansas. It has not proved superior to Kherson in Nebraska. During recent years, considerable interest has been shown in hulless oats for special feed purposes. Varieties of hulless oats formerly avail - able were unadapted to Nebraska conditions. When correction Is made for hull, S. Dak. No. 7, an early-maturing hulless variety yielded 5 per cent more than Kherson. It also yielded more than Kherson. </seg>
            <seg id="p186">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE during 1927 and 1928. Markton, although not well suited to Ne - braska conditions, is of interest because of its resistance to smut. A large number of attractive selections (Fig. 6) from a Markton-Iogold cross are being grown which are resistant to both smut and rust. These selections will be tested further for yield and other desirable characters. Barley The introduction and rapid distribution of productive smooth awned barleys and Trebi, a productive rough awned variety, together ■with a growing recognition of the relatively high productivity and feed value of barley have resulted in a remarkable increase in the acreage of this crop during recent years. This increase has been from approximately 250,000 acres in 1927 to almost 1,000,000 acres in 1932. The more productive varieties now available may be ex - pected to yield from 15 to 20 per cent more than the common six - row sorts formerly grown. In addition, the struw of the smooth-awned types supplies a satisfactory roughage which approaches oats straw in nutritive value. Trebi which is relatively well adapted to both irri - gated and dry-land conditions in western Nebraska appears to be well suited for combine harvesting. Varieties. Comparative yields of the more promising varieties grown at the Experiment Station during recent years (192S-19:!21 lire reported in Table 3. Common Six-row has been used as a b;&gt;sis in calculating the relative yields. As a 5-year average. Trebi yielded was the most productive rough-awned barley tested during this period. It was fully as productive as the Highest yielding Bmooth-awned vari - eties. Trebi has also been outstanding in yield at most of the experi - ment stations in the North Central states. The six smooth-awned varieties grown during the r&gt; year period yielded as follows: Bon Ami 4:i.:i bushels. Comfort i:i.9 bushels, Flynn 45.3 bushels. Spartan 15.4 bushels, Glabron 17. t; bushels, and White Barbless (Wis. No. :!7) 48.5 bushels per acre. During this relatively short period, the last four named varieties appeared especially attractive. Flynn is the earliest ripening variety of the group and should prove relatively more productive under adverse weather conditions during late June and early July. Spartan is a very attractive two-row selection. Glabron is a tall, stiff-strawed selection and is one of the most promising varieties for Nebraska con - ditions. White Barbless (Wis. No. 37) was the highest yielding variety tested. There is no evidence, however, that it is actually superior in yield to Trebi and Glabron, and it is rather lodge suscept - ible on fertile soils. Ezond, another smooth awned variety, has also shown unusual promise during the 3 years it has been tested. Colsess, an awnless variety, has yielded relatively well but is not recommended </seg>

Trebi, for example, is considered a relatively poor malting barley regardless of the condi - tions under which it is grown. The malting qualities of other vari - eties suitable for Nebraska conditions have not been sufficiently well established to merit a recommendation in this respect. Spring Wheat. ■■ ■ ■. ■ ■ . . ■ ' Although it has become relatively unimportant in contrast with winter wheat, spring wheat still remains a crop of considerable im - portance, particularly in the northern and western sections of the state.

Marquis, due to its relative lateness and rust suscepti - bility, is also rather poorly adapted to Nebraska conditions. It still remains, however, a very important variety. The results for Marquis and a number of other important varieties grown at the Experiment Station during the last 5 year period are reported in Table 4. Two new varieties, Ceres and Komar, originating at the North Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station from a Kota-Marquis cross yielded 15 to 26 per cent more than Marquis. 1 Komar which was the highest yielding common spring wheat tested during this period ap - pears to be materially superior to its sister selection, Ceres.

            <seg id="p189">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION THE SEEDSMAN'S INTEREST AND PLACE IN THE CROP IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM MR. J. B. SHEEHAN, Griswold Seed &amp; Nursery Company. The seedsmen, I might say, are vitally interested in and dependent on the success of the farmer. The seedsmen have always been inter - ested in anything that pertains to the betterment of agriculture such as the dissemination of new varieties. Take, for example. Comfort barley. Seedsmen played a prominent part in the dissemination of that variety in Nebraska. The seedsmen during the past few years have had a good many problems, the same as has been true of the farmers. You will ap - preciate somewhat our problems when you stop to consider that in order to distribute seed it is necessary for seedsmen to assemble these stocks during the fall months, process them, and get them in shape for distribution thruout all sections of the United States. That re - quires a great deal of work, a great deal of expense, and considerable capital. Our men go into the field to size up the crops, and to get an idea of production of the same items in other sections of the United States in order to estimate total production and thereby develop a basis for prices. Take, for example, a year ago when we had here in Nebraska an unusual crop of alfalfa seed. We wanted to find a market for that seed, not only in the state but outside. We all knew that there was enough seed held in the farmers' hands to take care of the various individuals in the different communities, and we had to immediately start in to find sections where they wou,ld be interested in using some of our seed. I might say that at considerable expense we were able to do that, and right now the big bulk of the alfalfa seed has been sold. I remember when I first came in contact with the seed business in Idaho. At that time the seed producing sections in Idaho were more or less in their infancy. It was very easy to buy seed as you could go out to the farmer's place, and find seed of a uniform high quality. That condition has changed, due to the inroads of foul weeds, such as fox tail, buckhorn, and others. Those things have necessitated the seed dealers equipping themselves with various improved machinery to handle the different seeds. It is probably safe to say there are many seed houses which have in their house now machinery amount - ing to an investment of as high as two hundred thousand dollars. We have a dodder machine, a buckhorn machine, and various types of seed cleaning machinery to remove the different kinds of weeds that may appear from time to time in different sections of the country. All this requires a big investment. </seg>
            <seg id="p190">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In addition to the seedsman's investment In machinery, his invest - ment in seed starts in at the time when harvest starts. There is also considerable speculation in buying seed which must be held 6 to 9 months or more', In case of corn or wheat, one can buy it today, and sell it today. He can market it, or hedge his crop. But with alfalfa seed, it is a dif - ferent proposition and alfalfa is one of our big crops in this section of the country. The field seedsmen have no basis at the time they start in buying in the fall on which to handle this seed other than what they may know about production, and also what they may anti - cipate in regard to the farmers' demand In the spring. We had an illustration of this two years ago. Red clover moved at very fancy prices to the farmer. But I don't believe there was a dealer in the United States who didn't lose from five to six cents a pound because of the fact that there was a good deal of clover left in the farmers hands all thru the consuming section. The seed gradually faded away from farmer to farmer, but seedsmen still had the seed when the new crop rolled around. Considered on the basis of a carload of seed, that is quite a trimming to take. You cannot find a millionaire among our seedsmen. We have here in Nebraska an area for producing seed of various types. I will give you some idea of Quality of our seed and some of the things which I think need attention in producing and handling seed crops. Within the past seven years Nebmska has developed Into one of the best sweet clover seed producing sections. We got the right start. The quality of seed produced is very high grade. It is more or less free from mustard, thistle, and many oilier weeds so prevalent to other sections. I would say off-hand that from a stand - point of quality and surplus of production, it is one of our leaders developed within the past seven or eight years. We occasionally produce a good crop of alfalfa seed. The quality is usually fair to good and the purity satisfaction, due to the tact that the fields from which the seed has been raised are more or less free from weeds. Outside of a few Isolated areas, alfalfa seed production In Nebraska is an uncertain proposition. You will re?a!l that last year we had one of the highest cropj in history. Men came in our seedhouse who had grown an average of 10 or 12 bushels per acre. This was an unusual situation. We are on the upgrade in alfalfa seed production because of the fact that alfalfa seed is the best paying crop farmers in the state of Nebraska have had. We can produce a crop of hay and then produce a crop of seed. A good many gross as high as $60.00 to $75.00 per acre on the seed crop alone, and still have a permanent stand left, and a crop of hay also. </seg>
            <seg id="p191">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION In this section of the state we produce quite a bit of red clover from time to time. I think the quality of seed of red clover we are producing here in Nebraska as compared with other crops is very poor, due to the fact that I do not think proper attention has been given to the fields. Many weeds are present, particularly dodder, foxtail and even buckhorn appears here and there. Generally speaking, the quality of red clover is not to be compared with the quality of the sweet clover or alfalfa which we raise. There are a good many problems in connection with the seed busi - ness as many of you know, not only from a standpoint of production, but also from a merchandising standpoint. We have here in Nebraska the state seed law which we consider to be probably as good as that in any section of the country. We seedsmen who merchandise seed have to tag and label every bag of seed we send out. Some have to hare their own laboratories to take care of this work. The state seed laboratory is kept busy all year testing samples of seed to be dis - tributed. We seedsmen feel that all that can be done is being done in connection with the handling and distribution as pertaining to the seed law. Of cour.se, the appropriation is small, and about the only in - .spection that can be done is with the dealer who is distributing seed. But the law also states that the farmer who sells seed to his neigh - bor for seeding purposes, also puts himself in the light of a seed merchant and should have his seed handled and tagged as to purity and germination when it is sold. Se'fctions from a Marktnn-losoM cross. Many of these selections arc resistant to the form of smut and rust commonly present in Xehraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p192">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Now lets consider the man who buys seed. It is up to him — the individual who is going to plant it — to insist on what he wants. He should have it tested before he puts it in the ground. He should see that the seed conforms to the seed law and that it does not contain foul weeds. In connection with red clover, we turn down samples of seed every day which we cannot buy because they contain some foul weeds. That seed disappears some place — goes into the ground here and there. You can get a free test by sending a sample to the State Seed Laboratory. You do not have to take anyones work for it other than the final analysis. The individual can get his home grown seed a little cheaper than buying in town. As a result he buys it,. We have found a good many of our. weed seeds, such as dodder, and buckhofn, and bindweed have heen distributed in this manner. There is no excuse for buying mid putting seed into the ground without knowing those weeds are in it. There is no expense to him to have it tested. Send a representative sample to your Seed Laboratory. Every lot of seed wo sell is tested as to purity and germination and the individual who buys it can get it tested, and assure himself he is not getting a bunch of foul weeds on the land. In connection witli alfalfa in the state, I want to mention another service which the seedsmen are in and which has been a big item and expense in handling the crop. I refer to the verification of the origin of alfalfa seed. Every individual who is in that service is compelled to account to the government for every lot of seed purchased. .Of ' n t V.Lft l^MMI^tf^HBEt' ' ' ' 'I'Vi j ■ "^HHaS^"~~ ** K~ fSJLL nffiiJt^E i Jin ~MTMwrJ'rnifi* ' rjJ ''^^^B 'Ail •-,/' "*s^-,^- ". ,-■ *' ; . ■ ■ Seedsmen are of distinct servire to Agrfcillture: .

            <seg id="p193">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION course we have had in the past seed of undesirable origin, not adapted to this locality. If a man. wants Nebraska seed, Dakota seed, Montana seed, he can get it thru this service. We pay for the service of pro - tecting the individual buyer. The government assumes authority in checking records and we feel it is a service which is worth a good deal when you consider the fact that Nebraska is one of the largest con - sumers of alfalfa seed in the United States. There isn't anything olse in particular that I have to say other than the fact that the seedsmen's problem is pretty much identical to the farmer's. Our success depends upon the success of the farmer. The movement of the seeds is mainly due to the service performed in processing, and distributing it. In other words, with a big seed sur - plus, if all o£ the seedsmen fall out of the market and none buy it, it would be a pretty hard job for the farmer to move his seed. Wo have a man here that I would just like to say a word. Ne - braska is honored with having the president of the American Seeds - men Association, Mr. E. T. Itobinson of the Robinson Seed Co. of Waterloo. MR. E. T. ROBINSON President, American Seed Trade Association. We arc all of us engaged in an honorable business. The farming business is one of the oldest and most honorable of all businesses. The seed industry is so closely allied to it that it cannot be separated. If we follow our history sufficiently we find that the first civilization was very closely tied with agriculture. The first roaming herdsmen in the old world developed the first civilization. Our profession today is a result of that civilization, so I feel we are in an honorable pro - fession and I am proud to be in it. As president of the American Seed Trade Association, we feel that we have the interests ofjthe farmer at heart. The members of the asso - ciation thruout the United States are doing everything in their power to improve the quality 'of the seed, to help in its proper distribution, to supply the proper seeds for the proper territory, and do all this at a proper price. ■ As Mr. Sheehan has said, there are no members of the seed trade who have made tremendous fortunes. W^e have operated at just as low a margin us possible. We have a highly speculative industry that requires the investment of large sums of money in certain seasons of the year with the hope and expectation of a profit at the end of the season. I was glad to hear Mr. Sheehan mention the profit in the growing of alfalfa. It recalls the talk delivered in Chicago at the International </seg>
            <seg id="p194">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE urop improvement Association meeting where Professor Ralph Crini of the University of Minnesota advocated the wider planting of legumes and pasture, his theory being that the grain acreage was vastly greater than necessary, that the price of all grain, had been brought to unheard of points and that the increased planting of legumes and pasture would automatically reduce grain acreages and thereby decrease; pro - duction and that the income from pasture and legumes would more than compensate for the loss in grain acreage. It is a known fact that alfalfa as a hay crop returns a very good income. It seemed wise to me and most of the American seed trade that there he an increased acreage of pasture and legumes at the expense of the small grain and corn. One thing, if you plant alfalfa it is a three or four year crop and it will take that much acreage out of the grain area for quite a considerable time. It isn't a one year proposi - tion so that, on the whole, it does seem a good move and I would be interested if Mr. Thompson's organization would consider that. CROP IMPROVKMKXT WORK IX THE COrXTV AGENT'S PROGRAM MR. K. C. FOUTS Seward I was a bit amused as I looked at. this topic assigned me. The first thing that interested me is that it assumes that the county agent has a program. Once in a while we hear something of a question as to that. The program is to the county agent like the highway with its row of fence posts down the road. It is what we follow. We need the program in order to know at all times where we are goins. In making this program we work with our executive board and community committee. And an agricultural program for community progress must necessarily be more than a temporary program: it is a long time program and there is where our improved crops program comes in. You look o%'er the work of any one year in any given com - munity and perhaps you are not very much impressed. Hut if you will consider the work of that community for five or six years you will note a difference. It is only six or seven years ago that we brought in an entirely new method of treating wheat against smut. It is but a few years that we have had the use of copper carbinate. In the last two or three years we have seen an increase in the acreage of barley. We have seen the increase of new varieties, such as the smooth bearded Velvet, Comfort and Glabron. In any one year these changes do not take an apparent place in our program, but look back over a period of a few years and these changes take quite a place in our program. While the county agent is apparently spending work in emergency items, his real job is .computing that long time program. </seg>
            <seg id="p195">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION In Seward County. I feel very fortunate in having a group of what I think are as good cooperators as one can find anywhere. They make a comparatively small number of the total number of farmers, probably about two or i three per cent, but we don't need every farmer to be a producer of registered livestock in order to have places where we can flnd foundation stock for the rest of the county. Neither do we need every farmer producing pure strains of grain and studying from the standpoint of the crops breeder. Two or three per cent of our farmers growing pure seed is, I believe, a fair representation and enough to do the community a world of good. We are pleased to work with the Nebraska Crop Growers associa - tion, and each year when its representative comes, we go about the county with him and have him meet the men who have applied for certification. Should we have even less than one per cent of our farm - ers growing some crops not so great in demand as others, we are still keeping alive within the county a source of supply of good seed. Last year we had but five cooperators, which was considerably less than usual, yet I venture to say that the work of these five men will be felt for several years to come. Last winter in the northern part of the state where crops had failed, they were seeking seed. They were able to find 13 cars of satisfactory seed oats in Seward County. That is one of the evidences of a long time program. All of that seed was not certified, but I think practically all of it was not more than two or three years removed from certified seed. There is a spirit of cooperation and good fellowship found in threshing clubs. There is the desire to help the number who has certified grain to keep it clean. Many who do not certify go through their fields and rogue out the rye from wheat and the barley from oats. I wish you could see some of our fields in late June. Field after field of wheat is free from adulteration; no rye is seen sticking up here and there. We have several threshing clubs in which all members rogue out the rye so there is none left in that threshing ring to carry from one farm to the other. Also it is much the same spirit found with the man who has smutty wheat. He feels a sense of obligation to his neighbors. When all members of a club treat their seed, it indicates they are thinking about the possibility of spreading smut through the threashing machine. Some times we hear of a man with smutty wheat allowing the neigh - bors to thresh first. The desire to be fair with neighbors helps spread the practice of treating for smut. Between May, 1931, and May 1932, of the cars of wheat shipped from Seward county to the Omaha market, only 13 per cent were graded smutty. From one shipping point, out of 45 cars, but two graded smutty. A crops program followed by a few men has influence and gets some actual results thru the whole county. </seg>
            <seg id="p196">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE" In corn we have been running some variety tests. Herman Ebers of Seward, has made the tests the last two or three years. Some 15 to 20 corn growers in the county cooperated in submitting varieties for planting. Varieties from over the state were also used. At the same time, method of cultivation and rate of planting comparisons were made. In addition to our small grain and corn we have some variety tests on winter killing with alfalfa. These tests need to be carried on for several years as the variation of seasons the last three years indicates any one year's results inconclusive. We need the long time program. I think this winter killing demonstration helps the Beadsmen as well as the farmer. After the winter of about 1925-1 !)2(i, there were some varieties that had a bad name in some localities. About half the alfalfa winter killed In some communities. After we had run winter killing variety tests, we decided perhaps the variety wasn't to blame. Rather, the origin of the seed was questioned. At least one variety with seed of known origin has proven its worth although it was under suspicion at that time. It is a distinct advantage to have a place to sell surplus seed. We have a local seed house and other seedsmen nearby. You know how much easier it is for some folks to drive a few miles than write a letter. Our seed houses nearby are a distinct advantage in either buying or selling. The seed house buys and sells and usually he ex - tends his operations over a wide territory while the local pure seed grower usually sells his own product only. Sometimes there is a little resentment against paying a premium over the local market to the man who has gone to the expense of keeping his fields free from mixing with other grains, threshing them separately and binning them separately; but this resentment is with little understanding of the program of the pure seed grower. It is really the desire to buy for less. But usually we find people willing lo give a little premium to the man who goes to that trouble as they appreciate the advantage of a better product. It is pretty discouraging to raise any crop to sell for seed at the same price as the other fellow who has ordinary grain. But with the recognition accorded the pure seed grower in the community, he usually gets the premium to which he is entitled for the service he has rendered the community. </seg>
            <seg id="p197">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION HOW AVE HANDLE OUR SEED BUSINESS HERMAN EBERS, Seward. I am not going to give you a formal talk this morning but will tell you in an informal way how we handle our seed business on the farm in Seward county. One of the things which I would like to mention first is the foun - dation of the business. We must build a good foundation in any - thing we do. In building this foundation, I like to take into consider - ation the ideas of folks who are in a position to know from knowl - edge, experience and observation. One that I take into consultation, above all, is the county extension agent. I hope you take him into consideration when you are thinking of purchasing seed. In purchasing a new variety of seed, there are several things which I like to consider, such as, the integrity of the person from whom I buy the seed, the history of the seed itself, and its development, the characteristics of the crop, and the purpose for which it is to be used. I like to give careful consideration to the preparation of the land, the date of seeding, the treatment of the seed, and other cultural prac - tices. Then, while the crop is growing, it needs very little attention for a while and nature will supply the sunshine and the rain. If we have done our work well, this will help nature materially in her part of producing the crop.. During this period of growth, as the good old Book tells us, we read that during the night the devil went out to sow weeds. I find that he is still on the job. In growing certified seed, we find that previous to the coming of the representative of the association to make the field inspections, that we need to be on the job. Last year the junior member of our firm, who is ten years old, did not like to go out into the field and pull out the weeds. I don't menu by weeds — morning glories and milkweeks and sunflowers, but I mean other varieties of oats, wheat or other crops. These are weeds in grain of a different kind. But this past year he took a different attitude. He took pride in working a while in the morning and in the afternoon, and lie said, "I'll bet that when the inspector comes along he can't find any weeds over here." That is not only pleasing to Dad but I think it is the virtue we are build - ing and the standard we are setting for our future farmers, and there should be a just pride in it. . I don't like the idea of just trying to get by. In binding and thresh - ing the crop, we like to see that the machines are free of grain which may cause mixtures. In shocking, we like to see that the crop is kept entirely separate. When threshing, I like personally to see that the racks are swept clean before they start to the field. I have found from experience that if one is courteous that the average thresherman </seg>
            <seg id="p198">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE is usually willing for you to help him remove grain that may be in the machine. This takes from about 5 to 10 minutes. Likewise, we like to see that all wagons and bins are clean. We cannot depend on some - one else to see that these things are done, but must ourselves see that they are done. Then we follow this up by seeing that the threshed sample which is sent to the Crop Growers' Association is suitable and a representative sample. If we have done our work well all along the line, we can compliment ourselves and we are quite sure to be pleased with the outcome. If we have failed just a little, in some part of our work, it may may not be quite so pleasant. Advertising and Correspondence. Now for the advertising of the seed. We do not do much of it. Again the county extension agent takes a prominent part, in that the exchange list which he issues is sent to many farmers. It is brought up to date about January of each year and each farmer receives a copy. There is nothing high powered about it but merely states what you have and the price which you ask. That is the way we reach most of the farmers in our county. We have done some advertising in the classified section of newspapers and our experience has been that about 4 or more issues brings best results. We like to tell the people, what we have, that the seed is recleaned, the bags are furnished, and that the price is a certain amount depending on how much is taken. I find that it is well to tell the prospective customer something about the crop so he may have full information about it. In the letters responding to your advertising, I think you should be simple, explicit and to the point in answering. Use some stationery that indicates that you have some quality and that you know what you are doing. Have a letterhead which is neat, but not overdone. A good type of stationery will help materially, and above all be prompt. If you can answer a letter and got it out to your prospect so he will wonder at the shortness of time that elapsed between his inquiry and your reply, he is impressed and the chances are more favorable for you to make a sale. Price is an item about which most of you differ. I have found that when you ask too little for anything, the prospective customer feels that it is no good. It is just as important, however, not to ask too much. Another point, when you make a sale, send them a sales card and keep complete records. Our seedsmen have told us today of the seed law. Every member of the Crop Growers' Association should be familiar with the seed law and realize its value. Unless we comply with the law in labelling the seed, we are simply hurting our own business. r Service in sending out seed is a great item. I recall getting a tele - phone call one night for about 10 bushels of oats for a party in Kan - sas. He wanted the seed sent out immediately. I don't know what he </seg>
            <seg id="p199">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION meant by immediately, but I took it to mean next day. At five o'clock the next morning, he called wanting another 50 bushels of seed sent with the 10 bushels. I said I was sorry but the shipment had already gone. My man had already returned from taking if to town. For three years, whenever that gentleman was in need of seed, we re - ceived the order. There are a number of other things which we might mention but in conclusion let me mention just one. The greatest pleasure I get from my business of selling seed is to follow up on the sales and discuss with buyers the results which they have had. I think three out of six years I furnished seed to the fellows who had the best seed of Nebraska 21 oats at the winter show. That is the thing which pleases me. I like to see the fellows who purchase seed at my farm make good. PRODUCING HYBRID SKKD CORN ON THE FARM T. A. KIESSELBACH Department of Agronomy, University of Nebraska. A great deal of interest has arisen during the last few years among the members of the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association in the ques - tion of when the corn growers of this state might undertake producing their own hybrid seed corn. This is due in part to the demonstrational tests conducted by our Extension Specialists,' P. H. Stewart and D. L. Gross, in co-operationn with county agents, Eastern Nebraska farm - ers, and the Experiment Station, and also to the favorable publicity given hybrids in several other states. Seeing is believing. It would seem that the time has now arrived, and I predict that some of you here assembled will actually be engaged in such an enterprise on a small scale this coming season. As you gain the experience of produc - ing this kind of seed, and even more attractive hybrids than now available become established, you may wish to expand the acreage of your seed corn Held. Good hybrids increase the profits and pleasures of raising corn. If the present promise of hybrid corn materializes in actual farm prac - tice as it has to-date experimentally, then a new era in corn produc - tivity will have arrived. Think of the advantages of corn that is especially lodge resistant, that more tenaciously holds its ears, that is practically sucker free, that has a more uniformly good quality of grain, and that yields around 15 per cent more than the average farm variety. That is the prospect we have to offer you for Eastern Ne - braska at this time. It is my purpose this forenoon to talk over with you some of the </seg>
            <seg id="p200">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE problems which need to be considered in the production of hybrid seed. But before so doing let us examine the results of this last year's and earlier co-operative tests of hybrids and varieties and see what encouragement they may offer us to grow this new kind of corn. Co-operative Corn Variety nnd Hybrid Tests of 10:52. In these outlying tests which were co-operative with the Agricul - tural Extension Service, and the Farm Bureau and a farmer in each of the counties of Cass, Douglas, Burt, and Madison, 28 hybrids were compared for yield and other characters with 7 representative com - mercial varieties and the co-operator's own seed. Careful methods of testing were employed so as to insure reasonably accurate results. 1 The same lots of corn were also included in the tests at the Agri - cultural Experiment State. The data for all "5 lots as secured from the 5 different tests are included in Table 1. The 27 hybrids which were tested at all 5 points were all double crosses and included 3 commercial hybrids purchased from seedsmen in Illinois and Iowa, three experimental hybrids from the Iowa Agri - cultural Experiment Station, and the balance were experimental hybrids made by the Nebraska Station, using inbred linos obtained from various sources. One can probably get the best conception of which are the best by averaging the 5 tests. Of the commercial varieties, Krug turned out to be the highest yielding. Since this is coming to be recognized as one of the most desirable standard yellow varieties for Eastern Nebraska, it is used as a basis for comparison in these data and its yield is considered as 100 per cent. Other varieties ranged from nearly as good down to 20 per cent less yield. These results with ordinary farm varieties confirm those of past years by way of indicating striking differences in yield between lots of corn as obtained from various farmers. 1 In the outlying co-operative tests results are based on 3-row plats replicated 3 times. The seed was dropped at a double rate and thinned to a uniform stand in the seedling stage. </seg>

The Wal - lace No. 311, obtained from the Hi-Ilred Seed Corn Co., averaged 54. S bushels which is the same as for Krug. Funk 365, from the Funk Seed Co., and Field hybrid, from the Henry Field Seed Co.', yielded 53.3 bushels, or 9S per cent as much as Krug. The outstanding corn of all these tests was, Iovya Hybrid No. 13, obtained from the Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station. It was at the top at each place and averaged 37 per cent more shelled firain than did Krug and 43 per cent more than the average for the 5 best varieties. The most productive Nebraska hybrid was Nebr. No. 23S. This yielded ID per cent more than Krug and 23 per cent more than the 5 best varieties. To summarize these tests, all the varieties averaged S per cent less than Krug while all hybrids averaged five per cent more than Krug. This is a difference of 13 per cent in favor of all hybrids over all varieties. The five best hybrids averaged 29 per cent more than the 5 best varieties. The 3 commercial hybrids averaged 1 per cent less than Krug. t The fact that one of the hybrids yielded as little as 67 per cent of Krug may serve as a caution that all hybrids are not highly produc - tive and a great variation exists among them. </seg>

This hybrid ranked first in the co-operative test of those made by the Nebraska Station, giving 1!) per cent higher yield than Krug. It is this hybrid of which seed stocks are now available for farm distribution on a small scale to interested growers. Should some other hybrid prove definitely superior to this one in future tests, it will be a simple matter to distribute new seed stocks.

We will of course know better just what we may expect after some of the newer hybrids have been tested successively for several years. We prefer to consider that hybrid corn is still in the experimental stage until our growers have produced their own seed and found it so successful that they persist in using it. The Experiment Station will at. the same time continue its efforts to develop new foundation inbred lines and superior hybrid combinations. Tlie Faroncrs's Hybrid Seed Field. Available Seed Slocks for Natural Crossing Plats. It is proposed that the Agricultural College distribute, to interested growers the seed of two unrelated single crosses between inbred lines. These two single crosses would be planted in a natural crossing field to produce double crossed seed. The co-operator would pick his seed from this for his following year's general field or for sale. The Experiment Station would maintain the 4 selfed lines involved and keep up a supply of the 2 single crosses for further distribution when required. As previously mentioned in this paper, the double cross now under consideration is Nebr. No. 238. The Experiment Station has avail - able s bushels each of the 2 necessary single crosses known as Nebr 211 and Nebr. 253. While this is second generation seed and in itself Will yield only about two-thirds as much in the natural crossing plat as if it were first generation seed, the productivity of the resultant double crossed seed will not be thereby affected. It has been found that first and second or third generation hybrid seed, may be used interchangeably as parents of the double crossed seed. Amount of Seed Required for Natural Crossing Field. Most growers will probably wish to have only a one acre natural crossing plat the </seg>
            <seg id="p208">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE first year in order to acquire the necessary experience. For the pur - pose of keeping the procedure as simple as possible this first year and uniform among the various farms, it is planned to supply each seed grower with 4 pounds of each of the 2 single crosses for every acre in his seed plat. Location of Seed Field. In order to assure reasonable purity of the Double crossed seed to be produced, it is important to have the natural crossing field isolated from other corn to such a distance that foreign pollen from other corn will not be carried to it by the wind. It is important in this kind of seed corn production that we definitely control both parents. A distance of 60 rods from other corn In con - sidered fairly safe and as far as is practical on most farms. In locat - ing the seed plat it is often necessary to know the neighbor's planting intentions. If such an isolated field can not be provided, there is little use of undertaking hybrid seed production. ' Planting Plnn. The two single crosses will be planted in alternat - ing 2-row plats. If the seed field should be 16 rods long, 4 4 rows will be required to make approximately an acre. Hybrid No. Ill will be planted in all odd numbered plats and No. 253 In the even numbered plats. The reason for 2-row plats is to simplify the planting with common 2-row machinery. The 2 lots of seed may be placed in op - posite planter boxes and by planting back and forth. 2-row plats of each will result., Under Nebraska climatic conditions, it would be fairly satisfactory to plant 2 rows of the female to 1 row of the male parents, but for the sake of simplicity only that method requiring equal size plats will be described. Detasscling. The cross between the 2 single crosses is effected by detasseling one of them, which is then in turn pollinated by the other. In the case at hand the even numbered rows planted to Hybrid 253 will have the tassels removed one by one soon after they appear and always before they begin shedding pollen. As the silks appear on these detasseled or female rows, they will become pollinated by Hybrid 111 which is to serve as the male parent. These cross pollinated ears on the detasseled rows comprise the double crossed seed to be planted in the commercial field the next year. It becomes apparent that this detasseling must be thoroughly done when it is realized that any self pollinated seed will yield only about two-thirds as much the next year as if it had been cross pollinated. Frequency and Cost of Detasseling. The total length of time dur - ing which the plants of any hybrid field may shed pollen is commonly about 18 days. This may vary somewhat with the season and the corn. By doing the work carefully so as not to skip tassels, every other day should be adequate. This is done by walking up and down </seg>
            <seg id="p209">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION the female rows and removing the tassels by an upward pull. With a little experience, one can soon tell just what is the best time to do this. It is least difficult if one waits until the tassel is practically out of the boot but before danger of shedding pollen. If the tassels are chopped off, some of the leaves are also likely to be removed and this results in yield reduction. At Lincoln a corn field is commonly in full tassel and shedding pollen at a maximum rate about July 25. The earliest tassels in such a field may shed pollen about July 15 and the later ones continue until August 5 or 10. "Eternal vigilance" to avoid missing tassels is essential. If the pollen period lasts IS days it will be necessary to go through the field about 9 times in an average year to do a thorough job. Cost of Detassclirig. The experience during 3 years at the Experi - ment Station as to the time and cost required to detassel in a natural crossing field may be of interest. These results are recorded in Table 5 which is self-explanatory. It might be well to state that in the natural crossing fields reported in this table, the female plats con - sisted of either 2 or 3 rows to 1 row for the male plats. At the hot-, torn of the table, the time and costs are calculated on the basis of 2-row plats of each parent as is recommended for this first year's experience. Table 5.

            <seg id="p210">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE According to the above figures, to detassel a one-acre natural crossing plat planted 2 rows of pollen parent to 2 rows to lie detasseled would require 1.4 hours of labor every 2 days which over the pollen - shedding period of IS days would make a total of 12.5 hours. It .would be conservative to assume a 2-hour labor requirement every other day during an 18-day period to detassel one acre. At 25 cents per hour the cost would be $4.50 per acre. One would seem conservative in allowing a total of 18 hours per acre for detasseling which, at 25 cents per hour, would cost $4.50. The time would average about 2 hours an acre on alternate days. This assumes detasseling 9 times and spending an average of 2 hours per acre each time. Harvesting. Those rows from which the tassels had been removed bear the double crossed seed and these may be harvested and saved for seed for the general planting the next year. The tassel rows were self pollinated and should not be used as commercial seed. Care should be taken not to mix the seed from the 2 kinds of plats because open pollinated seed produced on the male rows will yield only about 2-3 as much per acre as the first generation double cross seed produced in the female rows. No chances should be taken with using ears for seed that have fallen to the ground. Preparing The Si-ed To Plant. The seed may be prepared by shell - ing together all sound ears without careful type selection. The ears are all about equally productive. The seed ears should doubless be butted and tipped or else the shelled corn should be graded before it is used or offered for sale. The public demands well appearing seed. Added Cost Of Producing Hybrid Seed. It is of interest to specu - late a little as to the probable added cost of growing hybrid seed corn compared with picking the seed ears from an ordinary variety in the usual way. The two chief additional items are a somewhat higher cost for the seed stocks, and the labor of detasseling. For a 1-acre natural crossing field these may be about as follows: Cost of 8 pounds of seed at 25c $2.00 Cost of detasseling an acre; IS hrs. at 25c $4.50 Total '. $6.50 Assuming a yield of 50 bushels grain per acre, only 25 bushels of the crop from the natural crossing plat will be double crossed seed. The balance Is satisfactory for feed. After sorting and grading the 25 bushels of double crossed seed, 16 bushels of well prepared seed may be expected. These 1G bushels were prepared at a cost of $6.50 above that of preparing ordinary seed or an increase of 40 cents per bushel. If second generation parental seed stocks are used the added cost of growing a bushel of seed would be somewhat greater than this </seg>
            <seg id="p211">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION as the yields would probably be about 10 per cent lower per acre than for standard productive varieties. Just what increased returns may be expected by planting this double crossed seed which cost 40 cents per bushel additional to pro - duce? It appears conservative to estimate a 15 per cent increase in yield over an ordinary variety. Assuming a 40 bushel per acre yield from an ordinary farm variety such as now commonly planted, a 15 per cent increase from suitable hybrid seed would be 6 bushels per acre. Since 1 bushel of hybrid seed should be ample to plant 7 acres, the total increase from 1 bushel of hybrid seed would be 7 x G bu. or 42 bushels. If 70 acres were planted to 10 bushels of double crossed seed which had been produced at a total extra cost of $4.00 above ordinary seed, the gross increased yield of corn on the 70 acres would be 420 bushels. From these figures of increased production, a pros - pective purchaser of hybrid seed can calculate what he could afford to pay for the seed. In addition to increased yield he should expect a crop that is superior in grain quality and vegetative characters. Commercial Aspects of Hybrid Seed Production The College of Agriculture wishes to be entirely conservative in its recommendations regarding hybrid corn. Convinced of the sound - ness of the theory which suggests that properly "made to order" hybrids should be superior, and having seen the superiority of certain hybrids demonstrated for so many years in experimental plats, it now seems that the farmers of our state should be given a try at them. This may perhaps most wisely be done on a rather small scale at first and the thought of extensive commercial production of hybrid seed pigeon holed until you are experienced in its production and both you and your neighbors are convinced of its superiority. Nebraska plants approximately 10 million acres of corn annually. This requires in the neighborhood of 1,200,000 bushels of seed. As - suming that the hybrids now available may be adapted to 1-3 of this acreage, 400,000 bushels of seed would be needed to plant the 3 1-3 million acres. All farmers are not going to have the time or the temperament to produce their own seed by the new method. This means that there may be an opportunity for others to produce a surplus for the seed market. Eventually, if hybrid seed corn comes into demand, it will doubtless be produced under the inspection and certification service of the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association, the same as are a number of other farm seeds. It will then be necessary to provide rules of production which insure purity and high productivity. Under careful inspection as to detasseling and isolation of the seed plat, it will be possible to work out a system whereby the growers can maintain their own seed stocks for several years at a time. This </seg>
            <seg id="p212">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE is done through the use of advanced generation hybrid seed in the natural crossing plats instead of first generation seed. This practice becomes more involved and has a number of pitfalls which positively must be avoided and for this reason, to begin with, we will recommend renewing your seed stocks the second year by a new supply from the Experiment Station. This seed •will be sold at a price that is con - sistent with its cost of production. In other states where hybrid seed is now being produced com - mercially, some of the larger growers have installed artificial drying equipment. Though its use, the seed ears may regularly be harvested and dried before frost injury and sound germination and good keeping qualities are thereby assured. Because of the added cost of seed production careful seed preservation is recommended. In the case of small scale production this can usually be done without artificial dry - ing. That farmers can successfully produce hybrid seed corn has been fully established in the states of Minnesota and Iowa, where a number of growers are crossing seed stocks distributed by their Experiment Stations. There has been a ready demand in those states for this seed because of its recognized superiority and because even at a charge of $4.00 per bushel, it requires only 50 cents per acre for the seed. It should perhaps be emphasized in closing that seed should not be picked from commercial hybrid fields for planting a second year because it would be second generation seed. In case of single crosses involving only 2 selfed lines the second generation crop will yield only about 2-3 as much as the first generation seed, while the reduction will average about 18 per cent in case of second generation double crosses involving 4 selfed lines. Thus it would be advantageous to use first generation hybrid seed each year. It will be interesting to observe the progress and results with hybrid seed corn in Nebraska during the next few years. BETTER FARM PASTURES R. R. THALMAN Lincoln It is an old but accurate statement that says "nothing will take the place of good pasture in livestock management." Under present conditions, it is next to impossible to profitably maintain a breeding herd of beef cows without it. On the other hand, good pastures and livestock make a combination hard to surpass by any other type of agricultural pursuit. Livestock on pasture are living in their most natural environment and nothing seems to be more conducive to the health and contentment of an animal than grass. It supplies an abundance of protein, vitamins, and minerals so essential to the well </seg>
            <seg id="p213">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION being of older animals and normal growth of the young. It furnishes a place for exercise, fresh air, and sunshine, all of which hold a" mighty important place in the prevention of disease. Unfortunately, how - ever, too many farms upon which livestock are kept are entirely with - out pasture, or else the so-called pasture is little more than a place for exercise, being almost devoid of vegetation, especially during mid - summer when good grass is most needed. This condition is brought about by two factors: (1) not all farms ever contained an area suit - able to native pasture, and (2) pasture lands of native sod have been allowed to deteriorate beyond rejuvenation. The cause may be due to an increase of weeds to abnormal climate, to bad handling of the livestock, or various allied conditions. Whatever their cause, poor pastures are too much in evidence. In many cases the only logical corrective measure for rundown pastures seems to be the plow, replacing the native sod with annual or short-lived perennial crops. Thus, temporary pastures are slowly gaining headway in the Corn Belt. Interest in these temporary pasture crops has been slow in develop - ing, but it must come into common use if the farmer who raises live - stock is to obtain the maximum pasturage from a given acreage. Even the most casual observer recognizes that the native pastures, which have for the most part been taken by blue grass, are not re - turning enough on the investment. One of the chief criticisms of the permanent pasture is its low carrying capacity. The unfavorable growth habit of blue grass in this territory also adds to the interest in some of the temporary pasture crops. Unlike blue grass, these do not dry up and become unpalatable to livestock during the hot summer months of July and August when succulent pasturage is most needed. In the opinion of many practical stockmen and farmers, these ad - vantages of the temporary pastures in the Corn Belt more than offset the extra labor and expense of frequent seeding. Temporary pastures also lend themselves to the production of hay if a surplus of pastur - age should occur. They fit into a farm rotation system which makes it possible to maintain or rebuild the fertility of the soil. This is especially true where legumes are included in the pasture plans. Temporary Pasture. Crops The most important and commonly used temporary pasture crops in this region are sweet clover, sudan grass, and winter rye. In the more easterly sections of the state and the Corn Belt, it is quite com - mon to sow oats with the sweet clover as a nurse crop. Such pas - tures fit admirably into a rotation plan which makes forage available In abundance throughout the entire pasture season, from early' in April until after frost. Just when each of these crops will furnish pasture, of course, will vary from year to year, but generally speaking one may expect in southeastern Nebraska the pasture season to be about as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p214">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Rye — April 1 to June 1. Sudan grass — June 20 to October 1. 1st Year Sweet Clover — June 15 to November 1. 2nd Year Sweet Clover — May 1 to August 1. Native sod (blue grass) — May 1 to November 1. Sudan may be planted immediately following rye on the same piece of ground, in which case the Sudan pasture is available around July 1. Similarly, the opening date for first-year sweet clover may be altered from the above by sowing oats as a nurse crop. In this case, pasture is available a week or 10 days earlier. Because of the increasing importance of the pasture problem, parti - cularly the temporary pasture, the Nebraska Station started an experi - mental pasture project last spring. The first of these experiments was just completed and it is the object of this paper to briefly summarize the results. More data are necessary before sweeping conclusions can be made, but it is gratifying to know that the results of this test are in close agreement with several years of practical experience with such pastures at the University. Results From Pasture Test Yearling steers were used to determine carrying capacity and the results secured are reported in steer-days per acre of pasture. A steer-day is used to represent -4 hours of continuous grazing for one animal. Duing the time the steers were on pasture, April IS to October 14, a total of 179 days, they gained an average of 240 pounds per head, or 1.37 pounds daily. No significant difference in gain existed between the steers on blue grass or any of the temporary pastures. Their physical condition on all pastures was excellent and no signs of bloat occurred in any of the sweet clover lots. These re - sults agree with 17 years of pasture experience with the University breeding herd. On the basis of yield, the temporary pasture crops were far in the lead of native sod. The latter produced 145 steer days' pasturage per acre as against 159 for rye, 165 for first-year yellow sweet clover, and approximately 200 for the white variety, 220 for second-year sweet clover, and 177 for spring seeded sudan grass. Sudan planted on the same ground immediately following rye produced 153 steer days per acre, which, when added to the rye, gives 312 steer days of pasturage from one acre. Difference in yield of forage between the native sod and the temporary crops is even more significant when length of the pasture season for each crop is considered. Rye and second-year sweet clover carried three steers, first-year sweet clover and sudan grass 2 steers, and native sod 1 steer per acre during the pasture season. The common criticism of native sod (blue grass ( drying up during mid - summer did not apply the past season. This was probably due to a </seg>
            <seg id="p215">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION ■"."•.-' mucli-greater-than-normal rainfall during July and August. Even under such favorable conditions, it did not yield with the temporary crops. On tlie basis of yield, it would appear that the temporary pasture plan is the best way of increasing the carrying capacity of farm pastures. No one such crop, because of the comparatively short pasture season, will be a competitor of native sod. The practicability of temporary pastures, therefore, depends upon a combination of two or more crops that will insure a long and continuous grazing season. Two different plans designed to take care of this problem might be presented. Both have been used at the University with marked suc - cess. A Rye And Sweet Clover Pasture Plan One of the most satisfactory pasture plans includes rye and sweet clover. Rye is introduced into this rotation since it extends the grazing season approximately one month by furnishing an abundance of pasture in April and early May before the second-year sweet clover is available. The ground used for the rye can be replanted to corn intended for silage or to sudan grass iu case the first-year sweet clover acreage does not prove sufficient. This plan makes pasture available fropi about April 15 until frost and gives a much higher carrying capa - city per acre than does blue grass. • In planning the acreage necessary for such a combination, the carrying capacity of the second-year sweet clover should be taken as a basis, if sudan is used to follow the rye. This is desirable since first - year clover gives a lower carrying capacity than the second-year crop. Basing the acreage upon the latter insures against too much pasture during the latter part of June and the forepart of July. While there is some overlapping of the first and second-year sweet clover, the growth obtained upon the first-year crop during June and July will not make the pasture unpalatable to stock. Should it seem desirable, and especially if oats are used as a nurse crop, the pasture could be cut high and the hay taken off without serious damage to the follow - ing pasturage. Should sudan not be used as a supplement to the first-year sweet clover, it might even prove economical to fall plow a portion of the first-year sweet clover to prevent a wastage of pasture the following season. Under this plan, more sweet clover would be planted each year than would be needed the second year for pasture. A Rye, Sudan, And Blue Gross Pasture Plan In certain localities farmers maintain that it is impossible to use sweet clover as a pasture crop without danger to cattle or sheep from bloat. Obviously these men would not use sweet clover as a pasture crop. A plan is, therefore, suggested which includes rye and sudan </seg>
            <seg id="p216">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE together with blue grass. Rye coming on about April 15 and con - tinuing until June 1 gives an abundance of early pasture and at the same time gives the blue grass an opportunity to make considerable growth before it is needed. If sudan is planted on the same ground following the rye, it will not be available until about the first week in July. If corn or some other crop is planted on the rye ground and an area reserved for spring-planted sudan, the sudan pasture will be available some three weeks earlier, or around June 15 or 20. In either event, there will be a period from June 1 to June 15 or July 15 (depending upon whether sudan is planted following rye) when it will be necessary to turn to some other crop for pasture. Blue grass can be used during this time. It will have made a heavy growth and will probably not be pastured for more than 3 to 5 weeks. Because of this short pasture season, the blue grass can be grazed at the rate of 3 or 4 steers per acre. The sudan will furnish good pasturage dur - ing the remainder of the summer or until frost, unless taken by chinch bugs in September. Should this occur, it would be possible to go on to the blue grass again for the late fall pasture. The advantages of the rye, blue grass, and sudan grass pasture rotation. are several. The carrying capacity is increased practically two fold over straight blue grass. Furthermore, pasture is available at all seasons in abundance, and there is little danger from being short of pasture during July and August as is so frequently the case with blue grass. Should there be an overabundance of sudan for pasture at any time during the summer, a hay crop can be taken off. The next growth which comes on in a short time can be pastured again. There is positively no danger of bloat in the livestock, but caution should be exercised in pasturing sudan after frost because of its poisonous properties at that time. Discussion on Mr. Thallium's Talk P. H. STEWART Department of Agronomy In the chart which Mr. Thalman has shown you, it will be noticed that there is a period between the time when rye pasture plays out during the fore part of June and the time when sudan is ready for pasture when we have little, if any i feed from any of the temporary pasture crops except sweet clover. In northeastern Nebraska, farmers in many cases have had a considerable amount of bloat on sweet clover pasture. Many farmers in that part of the state are not inclined to take chances on sweet clover pasture. Although, as Mr. Thalman has pointed out here, at the College of Agriculture, we have had practically no trouble, yet I believe when sweet clover is being pastured we should keep in mind that there is always some potential danger. The time of greatest danger is in May and early June when we are pasturing the </seg>
            <seg id="p217">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION second year sweet clover crop. At this time the growth is rank and luscious and often we have periods of wet weather. It is during this time of the year that the men in the northeastern part of the state have their greatest difficulty in pasturing sweet clover without losing stock from bloat. One hears many theories and plans for avoiding bloat. Some men suggest the use of plenty of salt, others would put lime in the stock tank, others would make the livestock go considerable distance for water, while others perhaps would do just the reverse and see that the water is immediately available. Some farmers like to take stock off the sweet clover pastures at night although, on the whole, it seems best to turn them into sweet clover and leave them there. It has been observed that cattle on sweet clover pasture seem to crave dry feed. It seems worth while to have a stack of hay or straw available to cattle on sweet clover pasture. Those farmers who hesitate to use sweet clover pasture will be in - terested in the use of a permanent pasture to fill in the gape between fall rye and sudan grass. I have Just been checking up on the price of seed of the various grasses used in a permanent mixture and find that they are selling at about 50 per cent of the price in 1929. From the standpoint of the cost of establishing permanent pasture, it seems to me that now is an excellent time. I have observed that on many farms during the time when grain prices were high, much land located along creeks and subject to more or less flooding was broken out for cropping purposes. There is also considerable land on steep slopes where erosion is a factor that is be - ing cropped. Such fields and fields which are becoming low in fertility might, during these times of low prices, be put into perman - ent pasture grasses. A number of different mixtures might be used but I believe, on the whole, brome grass together with meadow fesque, orchard, red clover and sweet clover should be used as the main in - gredients. PRESENT DAY RECOM3IENDATIONS ON ALFAJLFA PRODUCTION BY H. M. TYSDAL Nebraska College of Agriculture As an introduction to this topic before a group such as this com - posed of those primarily interested in crops antl those primarily inter - ested in livestock, I would like to point out a rather significant fact. It is no doubt rather generally recognized that livestock production and crop production are closely related, but the closeness of this relation - ship may not be realized. The annual report for 1930 of the Nebraska Agricultural Statistics gives Nebraska's rank compared to other states in both crop and animal production. To obtain a comparison between </seg>
            <seg id="p218">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE crop and livestock production only those crops which seemed to have a direct relationship to livestock were considered. Nebraska's rank in corn, wheat, oats, barley, wild hay and alfalfa averaged for the live year period, 192G-l!l.'(0, 4.2. The livestock rank in value and produc - tion for horses, mules, milk cows, other cattle ? swine, and sheep for the same period is 4.2. This means that compared to all other states Nebraska, for the period 192G-30, stands about fourth in both crops and animal production. These figures do not take into consideration the important pasture resources of Nebraska. In still another manner this close relationship is shown by the fact that the annual value of all crops for the a year period 192G-30 is 1310,365,000 whereas the value of all livestock and livestock products for the same period is $328,798,000. And so it is that livestock men are interested in prob - lems of crop production and crops men are interested in problems of livestock production. To come more directly to the subject assigned let us first consider the general trend of alfalfa production in Nebraska and see if this will throw any light up on the major present day problems in alfalfa production. Variations in Alfalfa Acreage Two major declines have occurred in alfalfa acreage in Nebraska since 1911^ one in 1917-18 and the other in 1928-29 as can be seen IjiO I -j i s - 1.300 +- —^ j- 1,240 + — 5 &lt;— L I V~° I X / T MEAT Or* 20^ LARS r 51.050 h t [-1 !« — -t -W •00 + * wo --/ 800 -^^S* 7J0 f- J __ __| F»O 4 NtBW. iCWl ,STi TISTICS l»ll "13 'IS IT 1» -21 '23 'ZS "27 *29 *30 There have been two periods tUirinp the past 20 years during which the acre - age of alfalfa in Nebraska dropped off rapidly. Winter killing and alfalfa wilt have been the major causes of losses of stand. </seg>
            <seg id="p219">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION In Fig. 1. The first may in part be explained by the advent of war in 1917 but many will recall the disastrous winter of 1916-17 when the Nebraska wheat acreage dropped from over 3,000,000 to less than 600,000 acres. The great drop in 1918 may be largely explained by the very cold winter of 1917-18 when the average minimum temper - ature for January was the lowest for any corresponding period during the 20 years under consideration. It therefore seems safe to attribute a large part of the reduced acreage of 1917 and 1918 to winterkilling. To substantiate this deduction it is found that the yield in 1918 was the lowest during the period 1911 to 1930. When it is known that under controlled conditions the first crop of alfalfa may be reduced in yield as much as 80 per cent from cold injury to the root, both the low yield and reduced acreage may readily be explained by the cold winter of 1917-1S. The decrease in alfalfa acreage occurring in 1928-29 is not so severe as in 1918 but nevertheless dropped below the twenty year aver - age of 1,110,000 acres. One of the chief causes for this decrease in acreage can be traced to the increase in the bacterial wilt of alfalfa in addition to the rather more than usual winterkilling during the winter of 1927-28. It was during this period that acreage of alfalfa in Dawson County, the largest hay producing county in the state, de - creased by over C % thousand acres, and it was also at this time that the Agricultural College became actively interested in the alfalfa wilt problem. The wilt disease not only kills out the stand, but in the process also greatly reduces the yield. An infected plant has only a small percentage of the growth of a healthy plant — one of the char - acteristics of the disease being the dwarf habit of growth of the plants. A third important factor in determining yield is moisture, although surprisingly enough the average annual yields as reported in Ne - braska Agricultural Statistics do not closely reflect the average annual or seasonal rainfall. For example^ 1926 and 1930 were two dry years, and while the average yield for 1926 was lower than normal, the 191G, another dry year, the average yield was above normal. It is 1916, another dry year, the average yield was above normal. It Is clear that the amount of rainfall will influence the yield, but the fact that good yields may be obtained in spite of the rainfall is one of the outstanding characteristics of the crop. The secret in addition to irrigation no doubt lies in the ability of alfalfa to draw upon the subsoil moisture when such is available. During the last twenty years, therefore, it has been demonstrated that at least three factors aside from economic conditions have been of major importance in determining the fluctuations in acreage and production of alfalfa in Nebraska. To repeat, these factors are winter - killing, bacterial wilt of alfalfa, and moisture. </seg>
            <seg id="p220">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE To what extent are these factors under the control of the grower f and how can their ill effects best be combated? Let us first consider in a little more detail the problem of winterhardiness. The Winter Hardiness Problem Twenty regional strains of common alfalfa obtained from various parts of the United States were planted at Agronomy Farm in 1922. Nine years of actual yield data have been obtained and if the ten highest yielding strains are chosen it is found that all of them orig - inated as far north as Nebraska, or farther north, with the exception of one lot from Kansas, while the ten low yielding strains came from regions to the south. On further analysis it is found that the yields are in almost direct relation to the stand remaining after a period of nine years. Controlled freezing tests made in the greenhouse by the controlled hardening and freezing method developed at this station show varietal differences similar to those obtained in the field, except that instead of being obliged to wait two, three, or live years for the right winter to come along to freeze out the susceptible varieties, the correct temper - atures can be had and results obtained in two months in the green - house. Both the field and control tests have born out the recommendation that in general southern seed is not adapted to Nebraska conditions. Good Nebraska grown or northern grown common or the hardy varie - gated alfalfas such as Grim and Cossack are sufficiently hardy for Ne - « Hardy Approved alfalfa seed which comes from nld fields is, on the whole, doir - ablc for NcbrasVa conditions. A list of growers of Hardy Approved seed is issued an - nually by the Nebraska Crop Growers* Association. </seg>
            <seg id="p221">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION braska conditions. The class of seed known as "Hardy approved" is desirable because it comes from old fields still maintaining a good stand. These fields have been inspected by agents of the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association. It is highly desirable for buyers of alfalfa seed to take advantage of the present knowledge and services which enable them to have a fair chance of success in alfalfa production by first of all being sure that the seed they obtain is suitable for their climatic conditions. As indicated above, however, winterhardiness is not the only factor which must be considered in choosing the variety. Let us now con - sider briefly the problem of the bacterial wilt of alfalfa as it may in - fluence cultural practice and choice of varieties. The Il:irt&lt;-i-iiil Wilt Problem For the benefit of those who are unfamiliar with bacterial wilt the following description is taken from Nebraska Bulletin 240, — "the disease can be readily recognized in the field by the dwarfing and yellowing of the plants; the bunch-growth effect produced by the many and shortened stems; the small, chlorotic t rounded, cupped leaves; and finally, the yellow or brown discoloration just below the bark of the tap root." In 1027 agricultural experiment station and extension workers planted demonstration plots, consisting of several varieties each, at various locations in the Platte Valley. Disease readings made in cooperation with the Pathology Depart - ment give the following results as an average for three separate farms. Stand Wilt fall Stand full 1032 reduction 1032 % % % Local Common 54 44 20 So. Dakota Grimm 22 78 50 So. Dakota 12 77 23 13 Dawes County Common 58 40 23 - Among these four varieties Grimm stands out as very susceptable, having been reduced to u decidedly unproductive stand even before 1932, and showing a high percentage of infection in the remaining plants. The other varieties belonging to the common alfalfas are somewhat intermediate in wilt resistance, maintaining the stand more successfully thnn Grimm and having loss wilt infection. It should be noted that these four are all of the hardy types, so to the wilt disease can be attributed most of the decrease in stand. The variety known as Cossack was included in some of these trials, and showed almost </seg>
            <seg id="p222">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE as much susceptability to the disease as Grimm. These experiments therefore clearly indicate that Grimm and Cossack should not be plant - ed where the wilt disease is a factor. The susceptibility of these two varieties has been repeatedly shown also by artificial inoculation tests conducted by the Pathology Department. It was through these wilt studies that Turkestan came into prom - inence because of its apparent wilt resistance. This having been dem - onstrated, Mr. Westover, of the United States Department of Agri - culture, went to Turkestan in 192!) to gather various lots of seed from known districts of that country. These have been tested for cold and wilt resistance. In general, most of them have shown considerable wilt resistance, but have varied greatly in cold resistance depending on the part of the country where they originated. Turkestan is a large country, and those strains from the southern section were markedly less cold resistant than those from the northern section. For this reason it is not safe to make a general recommendation of Turkestan alfalfa seed. It may be worth trying in small quantities, however. Ill localities where wilt is especially severe. More recent explorations by Mr. Westover include trips to Africa, Spain and other parts of Europe, with the result that we are now testing more than ROD strains or varieties from almost every part of the world. Those same strains are being tested by other stations, including Wisconsin, Kansas, and California. Hnrdistnn Alfalfa. A new variety tested by the experiment station and now beiiiu in - creased for commercial use is known as Hardistan which is probably of Turkestan origin. This variety, somewhat similar to Turkestan in its characteristics, originated from an old field in central Nebraska and has proved as resistant to the wilt as most of the Turkestans and is also cold resistant. This year the Agronomy Department has about 40 bushels of this seed for distribution to be used (or 'seed increase, and when sufficient seed of this variety is produced it will be one of the best varieties available at the present . time for wilt conditions, and will be of known pedigree and origin because the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association is certifying the seed right from the start. In addition to variety, what cultural practices or other means can the individual grower take advantage of to combat the wilt? Cultural Practices and Stand Maintenance. Time does not permit us to give a detailed account of experiments on this phase of the problem. Briefly, it has bijen found that cutting the crop more than three times a year weakens the stand so that it becomes more susceptible to the attack of the wilt organism. It may not be serious to cut four crops in any given year, but is is known that </seg>
            <seg id="p223">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION continuous cutting of more than throe crops weakens the plants both for winter survival and wilt resistance. It is up to the individual grower to decide for himself which he would rather do. Another factor which mtght.be considered is the rotation of crops. Where it is possible it is advantageous to rotate the crop, in other words, do not put alfalfa right hack on land upon which diseased alfalfa has been growing. While the wilt disease come in rather slowly in any field it come in more rapidly where alfalfa is sown right hack on dis - eased alfalfa ground. In a set of duplicate plots in the Platte Valley near Cpzad, the average of five susceptible varieties of alfalfa planted in 1929 on ground just plowed out of diseased alfalfa now have more than 50% of the plants diseased and already sufficient dying to reduce the stand 27%. .lust across the irrigation ditch on land never before in alfalfa, the same varieties have an average of 37% wilt and have shown no decrease in stand to date. Thus while wilt is appearing in a field never before in alfalfa, it is not coming so rapidly and will no doubt mean some difference in the length of time a productive stand remains. In general, however, the conclusion has been reached that cultural practices will not solve the problem but that we will have to look to resistant varieties to overcome the disease. This is emphasized by the fact that in the above test plots, resistant varieties planted right back on the diseased alfalfa field show much less wilt than the more susceptible varieties sown on land never before in alfalfa, and show - no reduction in stand. These data can be briefly tabulated as follows: On land just plowed On land land never in out .if alfalfa alfalfa .

The resistant varieties listed above are not desirable in other characteristics, and the object of the cooperative program between the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station and the United States Department of Agriculture, is to com- </seg>
            <seg id="p224">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE bine desirable agronomic characteristics with as much cold and Wilt resistance as possible. To this end there are now under test for both cold and wilt resistance several hundred selections, some of which have been carried for two or three years and give promise of produc - ing a strain with the maximum of cold and wilt resistance and of desirable agronomic characteristics. Varietal Recommendations. Our present recommendation in regard to alfalfa varieties must depend on whether the alfalfa is to be grown where wilt is severe or is relatively less important. Where wilt is of relatively less import - ance, as on the uplands of eastern Nebraska, the hardy northwestern Common or the hardy variegated varieties such as Grimm and Cos - sack are considered most desirable. These are to be preferred to Turkestan since Turkestan in all tests at the experiment station is somewhat lower in yield than the better varieties. If it is expected to produce a seed crop at any time Grimm or Cossack may not be desirable because the discrimination against these varieties may become more and more pronounced as the bacterial wilt becomes more pre - valent. Under wilt conditions, it is advisable to plant such a variety as Hardistan when it is available, or Turkestan or I-adak, a new variety introduced from India. In the meantime, if these are not available a hardy, northwestern common is the best obtainable. The third problem which I wish to touch upon briefly is that of soil moisture, or more precisely, subsoil moisture. The Subsoil Moisture Problem. According to work done at the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment station, alfalfa uses as much as 850 pounds of water to produce 1 pound of dry matter, whereas corn uses only 2 7 0 pounds of water to produce 1 pound of dry matter. On this basis it requires "2 Inches of rainfall to produce 5 tons of alfalfa per acre. In spile of this fact, alfalfa, is one of the highest yielding crops grown in Nebraska. Alfalfa roots have been found to penorate in our mellow Nebraska subsoil from 25 to 3 9 feet, furthermore than draw practically all of the available moisture from the subsoil to these depths. When one re - members that a great quantity of water is stored in the subsoil ((&gt;% per ft. is considered equal to one inch of water and most of the sub - soil contains at least 6% available water), it is easy to see why alfalfa yields as much as it does. In other words, besides using the seasonal rainfall alfalfa draws on a great reservoir of subsoil moisture. Other crops such as corn and wheat cannot penerate to such depths as alfalfa and therefore cannot make us of the deep seated reserve moisture supply. </seg>
            <seg id="p225">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION At Lincoln about six years is apparently sufficient time for tlie alfalfa to draw all the moisture it can get from the subsoil. In 1930, which was exceptionally dry, a 3-year-old alfalfa field yielded 5 tons dry hay per acre, actual weight, while an eight-year-old stand planted on a field which had been in alfalfa 18 years before yielded 2 tons per acre. Two tons compared to 5 tons is a great difference in yield, but this difference can be attributed entirely to lack of subsoil moisture in the field which had been in alfalfa previously. Data have been obtained which indicate that the moisture is not restored in the soil very quickly after the alfalfa is plowed out. As a matter of fact it is difficult to compute the time it would take to restore the soil moisture to a depth of 30 feet when other crops are being grown on the soil. Certainly after 20 to 25 years the soil is still dry 15 feet below the surface. This has been substantiated by 3G foot .sampling in several hundred fields scattered over the state. While there is a slight difference in the severity of the problem, being less severe in the very eastern and northeastern section of the state, the same general condition was found in all parts of the state. In other words, when a field of alfalfa is plowed up and cropped to corn, wheat, or other crops every year, very little moisture penetrates into the deep subsoil, the crops using practically all the annual precipitation, liven one or two years of summer fallow apparently does not materially restore the deep subsoil moisture. Irrigated sections naturally do not have this problem, but in some subirrigated valleys, where the water is from 15 to 25 feet below the surface, there is, after alfalfa has been on the land, often a dry layer from about the 5th to the 10th foot through which new alfalfa roots penerate very slowly or not at all. This layer may require several years to become moistened, and if alfalfa is reseeded immediately greatly reduced yields may be expected. It should be emphasized, that this deep subsoil moisture depletion does not materially affect annual crops such as corn and wheat, be - cause the top layer of soil is just as dry after wheat as after alfalfa and the annual crops do not depend on the deep subsoil moisture as does alfalfa. Poor yields of corn and wheat following alfalfa in un - favorable seasons may be traced to other causes. . The fact that alf - alfa draws on the deep subsoil moisture should not militate against its use, as this is another of the many advantages which alfalfa has over other crops. The results show clearly, however, that if there is a choice of fields for the second planting of alfalfa, the field which has not grown alfalfa before should be chosen in preference to one which has grown alfalfa. </seg>
            <seg id="p226">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE DISCUSSION BY A. K. HECHT County Extension Agent, Buffalo County. The experiment station has done considerable work on alfalfa due entirely to the demand made by the organized farmers in Buffalo and Dawson counties, because these men wanted some information on alfalfa that up to that time had not been available. I started in the county agent work in Dawson county at the par - ticular time when the big cut in acreage occurred in 1917-1918 (in - dicated on chart). Being a green county agent, when farmers came In and asked me why they were losing alfalfa stands, I could not an - swer their questions. I wanted to make a hit with them, of course. I got busy and went out around and looked at fields, talked to farmers, wondered what was causing the trouble. To our surprise we found some fields that were not dying out, altho they had been treated ex - actly the same. Something else was in the picture in addition to winter killing. We organized a tour bark in 1910 and asked Professor Burr and Professor Snyder to take part in it. They came out and we visited about nine or ten farms where we could show the difference between varieties. We came to one field In particular that I will never forget. It was a field where on the east was one variety, then another variety, and then a third kind. The hogs would walk thru the first strip to eat the second. They would not touch the alfalfa on either side of the center lot. I asked why they would eat the strip in the center and leave those on either side. Snyder said, "Ask the hogs. I can't tell you." We kept on that way for a number of years until the second big reduction in acreage came in 192G as Mr. Tysdal has pointed out. Then the farmers organized, came to the college, and asked for work on alfalfa. They went to the legislature and got money for the research work. And we got some place on the problem in the last five years. As I see it, if you are going to plant alfalfa and ever expect to raise seed from that alfalfa, regardless of where you live, do not buy Grimm or Cossack unless you get it at a considerable discount. Due entirely to the fact that Grimm and Cossack are wilt resistant, the Experiment Station has had to modify its recommendations. But dis - ease and the winter hardiness questions are not the only questions that are of interest to alfalfa growers. There is another question con - fronting us right now, which is putting a better quality of hay on the market. We are losing lots of money because we are producing an Inferior grade of hay for the market. We have been working on it some, but I am sure the Experiment Station is going to help answer that question too. We are interested </seg>
            <seg id="p227">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION in getting rid of stack spots in alfalfa. One man in our county has done something that I think is good. He is baling alfalfa in the sweat and putting it In his barn for storage. He takes the hay out of the barn any time after he puts it in up to the first of March and it loses practically no moisture. In fact, it loses about 1 per cent moisture. While the hay is in the sweat it holds its color, holds its leaves, and holds the moisture. You see that the man who is buying that hay will get a superior product, it has the leaves, it has the moisture, and the color. The leaves do not shatter off. There is practically no waste. This man has been doing this since 1919 and it is another thing that you men might be interested in in trying out on your own farm, altho I do not suppose you will. Not many of his neighbors do it. They do not think it possible to have only one per cent shrink when hay is baled in the sweat. The man I mean, Mr. Knobel of Odessa, is in the room here today and will be ready to verify what I say. He weighs his hay, weighs it out, has done it for a number of years and has figures to prove his statement. Mr. Knobel of Buffalo county has made himself a Master Farmer by handling alfalfa hay as I have just outlined to you. I am sure you have plenty of hardy fields in your community, and buying seed from those would be better than buying seed from any place. Buy in your own. community because you should get better re - sults than if you take a chance. GRAIN AND SWEET SORGHUMS FOR NEBRASKA D. L. GROSS. One who is unacquainted with Nebraska conditions, and having examined the figures on production might wonder why sorghums crops are elevated to a position on this program. The total acreage of sorghum crops in the United States is but G, 400. 000 acres. Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas make up 90 per cent of the total. Nebraska acreage is but four-tenths of one per cent of the total or 240,000 acres. All of the sorghums grown in Nebraska could be grown in Lancaster county, and there would still he room for more. The acreage of sorghums in Nebraska is made up about as follows: Two-thirds of the sorghum forage, one-fourth goes into sudan, and about 1/12 into grain sorghums. Why Sorghum Crops Are Grown. Sorghums in Nebraska play a much more important part in our agriculture, however, than our acreage indicates. Practically all of our sorghums are grown in small patches for forage or pasture pur - poses. Take the sorghums out of the south Platte area and it would seriously effect the stability and the success of farming in that area. </seg>
            <seg id="p228">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Few farms in that territory, particularly on the upland, are without at least a small acreage of the sorghums the fodder from which often constitutes the only form of roughage available to carry the stock thru the winter. The great calamity that fell upon the northeastern coun - ties in 1931, in the form of a drouth which destroyed practically all crops, would have been much less dire had those farmers been ac - customed to growing a little sorghum for winter feed, and a little sudan for pasture. Farmers of the southcentral and southwestern Nebraska long ago learned the lessons taught by dry years. In many years in the past, drouth has been as severe in these areas, as it was in the northeast in 1931, but the farmers have been able to carry on without outside aid. The drouth evading qualities of the sorghum crops was their salvation. It is interesting to note that because of the realization of the need of these crops as feed insurance in case of drouth, and as a result of a. series of meetings conducted by the agricultural extension service. the acreage of sorghum crops in the northeast area increased. 232 per cent in 1932 over that of 19:'.l. It will be well if this lesson remains in the minds of all farmers in Nebraska. The 1931 season taught us that no place in Nebraska Is free of the danger of severe drouth. The northeast section of Nebraska is the most productive and the most reliable section of the state from the standpoint of weather condi - tions. This only emphasizes the importance of our 1931 lesson. This experience needs to be taken to heart by every farmer in the state. AVe do not want another area of our state to suffer as that area suffered, or to be severely effected that many years will be necessary to over - come the damage done both to the people and to their livestock industry. Acreage Is Increasing. There is at the present time an apparent trend to greater interest in sorghum crops in Nebraska. The acreage of sudan particularly has shown considerable increase. This crop now forms the base of all our ideas on temporary pastures. For the hot dry months there is noth - ing to take its place. Its drouth resistance, together with its ability to stand abuse, make it a crop the value of which we have too little appreciated. Experimental pasture work at the experiment station indicates that in Lancaster county a good sudan pasture under normal weather conditions will carry two head of yearling steers per acre for a period of four months, June 1st to October 1st. Other pastures may have a greater carrying capacity for a short period, but none of them com - pare to sudan for the hot months of the year. A discussion of the sweet sorghums used principly for winter </seg>
            <seg id="p229">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION roughage would not add a great deal to what has already been said. There are many good varieties now in use in the state including the black and red amber, sumac, Kansas orange, honey drip and others. All of these furnish excellent and very palatable roughage to carry stock thru the winter, or to use for silage purposes. Any of them can Atlas sorgd grown at the Nebraska Experiment Station in 1932. This crop is worthy ot more extensive testing as a fodder and silage cr«ip. be expected to produce a greater tonnage than any other crop growu for this purpose. Prof. Gramlich, who follows me on this program, will no doubt tell you of his experience with Atlas sorgo, a new sweet sorghum recently obtained in Kansas by crossing a sweet sorghum on a grain sorghum. The result is a sweet sorghum with a high forage yield, and with a stiffer stalk than is commonly found in sweet sor - ghums. It seems to be particularly . adapted for silage purposes, producing a good yield of grain as we\l as a heavy fodder growth. Farmers report that it is relished highly by cattle and horses when fed as dry fodder. New Grain Sorghum Varieties. There perhaps has been greater progress in the development of new and better adapted strains of grain sorghums than is the case with other sorghum types. Earliness of maturity and high yield of grain have been the chief objectives. The development of earlier maturing strains holds perhaps the greater interest for us here in Ne - braska. The old types of grain sorghums were adapted better to Oklahoma and Kansas than to Nebraska. Early frosts here often have destroyed prospects for bumper yield of grain. With the new early strains, it is now hardly safe to say just how far north in the state </seg>
            <seg id="p230">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE gram sorghums may be grown safely, while previously only in the southern tier of counties were they grown and there only to a limited extent. A report this year from Todd county. South Dakota, indicates that even there the early strains can be depended upon to produce a good crop of seed in normal seasons. Nebraska, of course, will never become a sorghum state, such as Texas or Oklahoma or even Kansas. We produce a good crop of torn too regularly for that. Besides, the grain sorghums require special methods of handling at harvest time, the grain does not store as well as corn, and should we grow a surplus over feed needs there is no stable market. We must look upon grain sorghums, therefore as a supplementary crop and one which in some years, by evading the drouth, would serve as a pinch hitter to take the place of corn which failed to come thru. Of the new strains of grain sorghums now available, the yellow kaflr, Western Blackhull, and Club kaflr seem to" offer the greatest promise. These kaflrs are of medium height, they have a stiff stalk and are ideal for harvest with the corn binder. There are other earlier strains such as the Wheatland milo, Sooner milo, and Dev mil,, that would no doubt be adapted to western and northern Nebraska These strains produce their heads rather low but at a very even height which makes it possible to harvest them with the combine. Cultural Practices. An important consideration in the handling of grain sorghums is tfle matter of seedbed preparation and time of seeding. The results of the Fort Hays, Kansas experiments along this line are quite re- </seg>
            <seg id="p231">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION markable. Wide variations in yield are obtained by varying the till - age methods and time of seeding. The accepted practice at that sta - tion is to plant the grain sorghums on land which was in small grain the year previous. The land is listed as soon as the small grain crop is removed. Following this it is cultivated with the gpdevil in case the growth of weeds and volunteer grain make this advisable. The land is life in the ridged condition over winter to catch snow and to prevent loss of soil thru blowing. The ridges are worked down in late March or early April, and tilled again in addition in case weeds develop. The seed is planted with the lister by nosing out the old furrow. The reason for this is that the soil is warmer in these fur - rows than under the old ridges. Sftftsfe' 0 !^.! ".--.■ ■ - Beaver niilo, on right*, and Wheatland milo, on left. These are two of the new promising short varieties of grain sorghums 'adapted to combine harvesting. Late planting is advisable for the grain sorghums because a cold soil greatly reduces the germination, and because the later seedings yield better than the earlier ones. At the Hays Station in Kansas, the June 15th planting have outyielded the May 15th planting about 10 bushels per acre. Here in Nebraska, the best date would no doubt be near June 1st or perhaps slightly later for the southern counties, and for the very early maturing strains in counties further north. It must be borne in mind that a good share of this greater yield secured by late planting is due to pre-planting tillage methods which bring the weeds under control. In conclusion I might say that because of the introduction of new, higher yielding and earlier maturing strains, together with our in - creased knowledge of proper tillage methods, we can expect an in - creased interest in grain sorghums, particularly in southcentral Ne - braska. It would seem that a modest increase in acreage would fit very well into the general conditions of that area. A greater use of sudan for pasture purposes should also seem advisable, to alleviate </seg>
            <seg id="p232">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE some of the pasture problems, not only In southern Nebraska but in all parts of the state. The acreage annually sown to sweet sorghums for fodder purposes will probably not increase greatly, but there will perhaps be changes in the varieties used. Discussion by H. J. Gramlich A number of years ago, Dr. Gains made the statement in a sort of philosophical way ( that in all the years he had spent at the University there had been only one in which we hadn't had to suffer from drouth. During the growing season between the first of June and the first of September, there is usually a period of three to six weeks when we were praying for rain. That is, I think, where the grain sorghums and other sorghums come in. Here at Lincoln during the past 25 years, in growing silage corn, we notice our crop is often badly burned. In recent years, we have turned to sorghums as possible substitutes for corn. This year we had an abundance of moisture and got good yields. I think sorghums have a value for us as ensilage crops and as fodder crops. In fodder, the disadvantage conies from the smallness of the seed. The seeds are so small they go thru the animals undigested. It is very expensive to grind fine enough to crack the seed. At the Kansas Experiment Station, they have grown cane for en - silage for a good many years. Compared with corn — they have found the two almost equal in feeding value for fattening cattle; that is, a ton of cane, is equal to a ton of corn. They have also used kafir. Lately they have been growing Atlas sorgo. We are trying to use some of their ideas to see how well adapted they are here. When Atlas cane was seeded about the middle of May, it ripened without trouble. This last season we plowed rye under and put the land to Atlas sorgo. With the abundance of summer moisture we had t it came on nicely. We cut it the first of October. The growing season is about four months. We are using seed off that crop. Apparently the germination is between SO and 9 0 per cent. The problem of ripen - ing here does not seem to be a problem. Sorghums are low in protein. Chemically and from the sFandpoint of palatability they are much like corn. This last year the Atlas sorghums made 14 tons of silage on one field. Corn made about 13 tons. This was a very heavy yield of corn, probably the heaviest in 20 years. On the average, we may expect about 7 tons of corn silage per acre. As a ten year average here in Lincoln, I believe cane would make at least 33% per cent more silage or fodder than corn. </seg>

Thompson in the Dairy Building auditorium. The secretary's report was ac - cepted as it appeared in the printed report. The treasurer's report was read and accepted. A. H. Biermann, Chairman of the auditing committee, consisting of Elvin Frolik and himself, reported that the Treasurer's report as presented was correct. Moved by Biermann that report be accepted. Motion seconded and carried. A. E. Deering, Chairman of nominating committee, placed in nomination Carl Day, First Congressional District; Bert Mott t Fifth Congressional District; A. H. Biermann, Third Congressional District, as vice presidents; and P. H. Stewart as Secretary and D. L. Gross as Associate Secretary. Biermann called for additional nominations from the floor. F. D. Keim moved the nominations be closed and the secre - tary instructed to cast a unanimous vote for those nominated by the committee. President Thompson told the members that they were not to get the idea that the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association is a perpetual organization, and that it was sometimes good to have new blood on the board. They would be glad to hear any suggestions as to names. Mr. Keim explained that the nominating committee had no intention of "trying to hog the situation." "We just felt,' 1 he ex - plained, "that these men have not been in very long and they are certainly very representative men of the various districts and for that reason were chosen." The motion was carried, and the secretary cast the unanimous vote for the nominees. Mr. Gross asked if the meeting should pass on funds for judging teams. Mr. Stewart explained that that was usually left to the Board of Directors, as much depends upon the amount of money received in the appropriation. Thompson suggested that instead of the membership acting on the question, that they tell the board of their opinion of that kind of work. Anton Frolik spoke briefly of the trips of the College judging team to the shows. In speaking of the influence of the trips, Mr. Mott said, "I haven't very much to say along that line. My impressions are from my boy t who attended the Kansas City Royal and the International at Chicago. He never had the chance at home to get the benefit he got there from the large classes exhibited, and he said he derived more knowledge along the line of judging grains at these shows than he would get </seg>

If we are to produce better crops, and better' grains, it is certainly consistent to have competent judges to judge it. I believe it is to our interest to encourage this kind of work, that we may have com - petent judges to judge these exhibits. We all know it is hard enough to get them and nothing is more unsatisfactory than a judge that does not know his business. For the small amount that we have contributed I believe personally, that the work is worth while and I would enter - tain a motion that we continue to make that appropriation if we have funds and leave the matter to the Board of Directors."

B. HIGGINS, Beatrice SECRETARY L. K. CROWE, Lincoln MR. H. P. DAVIS: I would like to announce that the president of this association, Mr. J. B. Higgins of Beatrice, is unable to come to this meeting because of the death of his mother. The association has sent its condolence to Mr. Higgins and of course we sympathize with him at this time. As far as I have observed, the vice president, Mr. Herman Rolfsmeier, is not here. That accounts for the fact that I am presiding at this annual meeting. Inasmuch as the president and vice president are not here it will not be necessary for the president protem to deliver a presidential address, so we shall eliminate this part of the program. I trust that you will consider that you have listened to a presidential address and we shall proceed with the meeting. The flrst point is a report of the nominating committee and I will ask the chairman of this committee, Mr. L. H. Daft to present the re - port. Mr. Daft. MR. L. H. DAFT: Mr. Chairman, and members of the association: The nominating committee has had its meeting and we are pleased to submit the following names as officers and board of directors for the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association for the year, 1933: </seg>

DAVIS: It has been moved and seconded that the re - port of the committee on resolutions be accepted. All in favor signify by saying Aye. Contrary, the same. The motion is carried. At this time I want to make one or two announcements which are important. At 9:30 tomorrow morning there will be a meeting o£ the Nebraska Dairy Development Society. I hope that all of you will find it possible to attend. The Dairymen's Association Banquet will be held at 6:15 tomor - row evening at the Grand Hotel. Those of you who have attended our banquet in previous years know that there will be a good time in store for everyone. There will be no long speeches to detract from the evening's entertainment. The capacity of the hotel is limited to one hundred and fifty so you had better get your tickets early. Tomorrow at 2:00 in Room 207, Dairy Building, the Nebraska Jersey Cattle Club will meet with Mr. A. A. Rhodes as president. All you Jersey men should be there. The Holstein-Friesian Association will meet in the Dairy Building also. I trust all the Holstein breeders will find it possible to attend. Nobody ever boosts by staying away from the meeting. Our program is well chosen today. The first part of the program deals with the progress made during the past year in the Better Sire Contest which is being held in this state. It is doing as much as any other one thing to build up dairy herds on a good foundation. I take pleasure in presenting to you Mr. M. L. Flack of the Extension Service. Mr. Flack. MR. M. L. FLACK: Mr. Chairman and friends: In the past, we have talked quite a bit about improving our herds. This improve - ment has been mostly along the lines of feeding and testing and not dealing so much with our herd sires. This year in the Dairy Herd Improvement Association all herds in Nebraska averaged 315 pounds of butterfat and about 6 per cent of the herds were over 4 00 pounds of butterfat. When one considers that we have the average this high for our herds in Nebraska we will have to use great care in selecting our bulls. In order to find out more about the sires in use in Nebraska we put into effect a "Better Sire Contest". This contest has been in op - eration two years and much progress has been made in that time. You may wonder how a contest of this nature is conducted. The method we used is a follows: 1. The testers were asked to send m the names and numbers of </seg>
            <seg id="p249">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION all the sires in their respective associations. 2. The pedigrees of these sires were run and sent back to the testers to be put into their bull books. 3. Sometime during the year the tester was to secure a picture of the bull and attach it to the pedigree. 4. The tester was to secure all the "daughter and Dam" compari - sons and record them on the backs of the pedigrees and in this man - ner prove the bull as soon as possible. 5. You may wonder how the bulls were judged in this contest. The judges considered three points: type, pedigree, and suitability. In deciding upon the type, the judges used a picture of the bull and information supplied by the tester. The pedigrees, of course, spoke for themselves. The suitability of the bull in the herd was judged largely by the herd average. If the average production of the bull's ancestors was lower than the herd average, he was graded down in suitability. If his production was higher than that of the herd he was graded up in suitability. At this time I would like to show you three pedigrees in order to give you some idea as to how they were scored. This first pedigree has but very little production on the immediate ancestors. The only production is in the fourth generation and this is too far back to be of much value. The transmitting ability of a bull of this kind is rather doubtful. The second pedigree which I am showing you has good production on every animal for four generations back and it happens that this bull's daughters average 4 43 pounds of butterfat while their dams average 435 pounds of butterfat, which is an In - crease of 8 pounds. This bull, which has a good pedigree, is now a proven bull on this level of production. The owner of this bull knows that his herd sire has been of value to him and he will not be sent to the butcher. This is one advantage of the sire contest. The third pedigree I am showing you is a good one also, and very much like the second. This animal has ten daughters averaging 34 0 pounds of but - terfat, whose dams in turn averaged 240 pounds of butterfat. Here we have 100 pounds of fat increase. This bull is still In service and no doubt will be kept in service for a good many years. One point which I wish to emphasize is that the sire contest Is a quick method of proving bulls and that is a thing we need if older bulls are to be kept in service and not sent to the butcher. There are many other advantages, some of which I wish to men - tion: 1. It gives the breeder knowledge of the kind of bull he is using. </seg>
            <seg id="p250">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 2. Pedigrees on the bulls assist the members in trading one for another. (This year several members within the association traded bulls.) 3. It creates in the breeders a desire for better bulls. 4. It eliminates the grade and inferior purebreds from herds in Nebraska. There have been over 100 inferior bulls eradicated in the two years of the sire contest. The following charts show improvement made in the bulls. You will notice that the 1932 results are much better than those of 1931. </seg>

            <seg id="p253">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION The judges this year were, I believe, more critical and scored the bulls closer than they did last year. Considerable credit must be given to the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association for their help in pro - moting this project. We also are indebted to the Holstein, Jersey, Guernsey, and Ayrshire State Breed Associations for their help in back - ing this project. MR. H. P. DAVIS: I know you have enjoyed the discussion of this project and I want to say that it is doing a great number of things. It is giving an opportunity for the breeders to see the progress that they are making in their breeding. People are being given the help that they wanted and they are now progressing rapidly. In preparing this program we had three things in mind: (1) the improvement of the herds of the state; (2) the production of good quality milk; (3) the marketing of that milk. I take pleasure in in - troducing Doctor P. A. Downs, who is going to talk on the subject of "Can We Produce Good Milk?" He is interested in helping this par - ticular community and other communities who want to produce good quality milk. Dr. Downs. DR. P. A. DOWNS: Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: The title that has been assigned to this talk can be answered by the little word, "yes." This fact has been definitely proved by dairy farmers in all parts of the country. However, the real problem is how to best produce good milk without a lot of extra expense. It is my hope that in the next few minutes with the aid of the slides that I may be able to give you some suggestions regarding the production of good milk on the average farm which will be of value to you. The yearly production of the United States amounts to about 120, - 000,000,000 pounds. Of this some 55,000,000,000 pounds are con - sumed as fluid milk and cream, with an equal amount used for manu - facturing purposes. The aim of those interested in public health is to provide milk to the consumer which is: first, free from disease producing bacteria; second, from healthy cattle; third, produced by healthy milkers; fourth, free from dirt or other foreign material; and fifth, low in bacterial count. While the requirements just mentioned apply primarily to fluid milk, the milk intended for separation should also be sanitary, be - cause it is also a food product. It has been found that the carelessness of a few producers often lowers the quality of the general supply. Such conditions can bo pre- </seg>
            <seg id="p254">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE vented only by supplying the producer with a knowledge of the most important factors in the production of sanitary milk. In presenting such information two general divisions can be made: A. The necessary equipment (only that absolutely necessary) ; B. The essential methods. In reality sanitary milk depends upon: first, the attitude of the producer; second, the methods used: and third, the equipment. These facts should be kept in mind by those interested in better milk, and arrangements should be made to maintain the proper attitude on the part of the producer. Costly barns and equipment do not necessarily mean good milk, and milk produced under these con - ditions is often spoiled by lack of interest or negligence on the part of the dairyman. Going back to division A, the necessary equipment, we can list it as follows: 1. Milk pails. The pails should be in good condition. Covered pails will help to keep foreign material from falling into the milk. 2. Hot water. A supply of boiling water should be available. 3. Brushes. Oood stiff brushes should be on hirnd for washing utensils. 4. A draining rack. A place should be provided away from &lt;lnst and dirt where utensils can be stored. 5. Milk cans. These should be, in good repair so they ran be kept clean. I 6. Wash bucket iind cloths. Separate pails must be used for washing cows. 7. Chlorine sterilizers. Where low count, milk is to be produced some such product can be used to good advantage. 8. A dairy thermometer. An accurate thermometer should be on every dairy farm. 9. Cooling and storage facilities. Some suitable cooling method is absolutely necessary for the production of good milk. It will be noted that no elaborate or expensive equipment is nec - essary. In considering division B, the essential methods (in five steps) the following is suggested: Step 1. Before starting to milk, rinse all cans and utensils with boiling water or sterilizing solution. This will remove many bacteria that may have grown in the utensils and also remove any dirt or dust </seg>
            <seg id="p255">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION that may have accumulated in them. It has been found that the great - est contamination of milk usually comes from the utensils. Step 2. Before milking clean all cows. Wash all the udders and teats and wipe flanks with damp cloth. Step 3. Cool the milk to below sixty degrees prompty after milk - ing. Any method that will do it will be satisfactory. Use the thermo - meter and watch the temperature. Step •(. Store the evening's milk so that it will be below sixty degrees at all times. Bacteria grow rapidly at temperatures above sgcty degrees. Bacteria are very small plants, some spherical like a ball and others long like frankfurters. In size they are approximately twenty-five thousandths of an inch in diameter. They grow by fission or division, one dividing into two and those two into two more and so. on. Some bacteria are able to divide every twenty to thirty min - utes. In that case a single organism would produce some 1,000,000, - 000 organisms or over in fifteen hours. Of course all of them do not continue to divide at that rate, but it does indicate the possibility of bacterial growth. Milk held on the farm for fifteen hours, that is evening's milk held over night and delivered the next forenoon, furnishes an ideal condition for bacterial growth unless it is kept cool. The following figures show the increase in bacterial growth in ordinary farm milk when held fifteen hours at different temperatures. 50 degrees. Very slight increase in number of bacteria GO degrees. Number of bacteria increased 23 times 70 degrees. Number of bacteria increased 470 times SO degrees. Number of bacteria increased 2100 times flO degrees. Number of bacteria increased 4500 times. This plainly shows the need of cooling milk and keeping it cool until it is delivered. The only safe way is to use the thermometer and keep the temperature down. Step 5. Clean all utensils without delay after milking. First, rinse with cold water; second, scrub well with stiff brush in warm solution of dairy alkali; third, rinse and scald with boiling water; fourth, allow utensils to drain and dry on rack until time to start milking again. There are several other things to keep in mind. Everything that the milk touches should be clean. Separators and milking machines must be kept clean the same as other utensils. Good milk can be produced without undue expense. The cow has done her part by producing sanitary milk and the responsibility now rests upon the dairyman. </seg>
            <seg id="p256">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. H. P. DAVIS: I feel that we all comprehend the point that Dr. Downs has made clear. Milk is no better than when it is produced. If It is not clean it is not the cow's fault. Let us live up to our re - sponsibility. After we have learned how to produce good, clean milk, one of the next factors is how to dispose of it. That is one problem that is fac - ing us today. I think it is a privilege for us to have discussed before us today this subject. I want to introduce to you at this time, Chan - cellor E. A. Burnett, who will in turn introduce the next speaker, Dean Chris Christensen. Dean Christensen graduated some years ago when Chancellor Burnett was the Dean of the College ot Agriculture. Chancellor Burnett: CHANCELLOR E. A. BURNETT: Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentle - men: It is a great pleasure to be with you this afternoon and to in - troduce a man who grew up among you and whose parents came to this country from Den-mark in early years. They were pioneers in Buffalo County and I believe the fumily is still living either in Buffalo County or very close to it on a little farm they purchased at a low price and have developed for fifty years, while they were rearing a family of children, one of whom holds a responsible place in the agri - cultural work of the nation. Another, I believe, is living on the farm and for the others I have not had the opportunity of getting the his - tory. I venture to say there are more of this family which came tip from the pioneers and have secured the advantages of education both locally and out of the community and are contributing their services to the improvement of our agricultural situation. I remember ten or fifteen years ago the speaker of the afternoon came to me and said that he thought it would be possible witli the recommendation of the University of Nebraska, for In- was then a graduate of this university, for him to secure a scholarship to go buck to Denmark to study the agricultural situation of that country, especi - ally with relationship to milk and bacon products and some other types of agriculture which were carried on there. We got the nec - essary endorsements and some few months later Mr. Chris Christen - sen started for Denmark. I believe we heard from him once or twice during that year and then he was bark here among us and very short - ly he was asked to occupy a responsible place in the Bureau of Mar - kets at Washington. He furnished a great deal of data upon which the market system was made up and which was furnished in turn to the states. At one time he was chairman of this Bureau. I confess that I did not follow him all the time. I do not know whether he was asso - ciated with the Farm Board or not. A little later, leaving the employ of the government at Washington, he accepted a position as Dean of Agriculture in one of the best developed state universities, one of </seg>
            <seg id="p257">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION the most responsive and responsible state universities in the middle west, the University of Wisconsin. He succeeded a man who had made a national and international reputation not only in agricultural edu - cation, but the molding and shaping of the agricultural industry of that state and ol the nation. This man had been once or twice around the world studying markets and I will not stop to tell the things which he did. But Mr. Christensen was asked to accept the position as dean of the College of Agriculture and director of the Agricultural Experi - ment Station of the University of Wiseon. That is the position which he occupies at the present time. He has come that far after having been born and reared on a Buffalo County farm and I have inserted that fact not because he needed that introduction at all, but as an indication of the opportunity which may come to any boy or girl growing up on a Nebraska farm who takes the advantage of the educa - tional facilities which are near them and then making the very best opportunity for intelligent promoters in the service of the community. Because throughout all this period I am confident that the thing which was uppermost in the mind of our speaker was not his personal suc - cess. He never had time to look for a position. Something was al - ways waiting for him when he was ready for it. I have lived through forty years of public service and I have observed that during that period the opportunity has been waiting for the man rather than the man having to go out and look for opportunity. He needs prepara - tion and ability to do the things which someone wanted done. The time is not far away when that will be true again. No one preparing himself fur public service need doubt that matter for a moment. I am reiterating this illustration to show that the College of Agriculture was the opening through which one man coming up from a Nebraska farm found that Held of service, and he is back to you today to talk upon ;i very practical question relative to the dairy industry. One tiling which I have not recited and I am not very familiar with, but perhaps the gentleman could tell you, is his wife and the twins. I am not up to data on that. I want to present to you Mr. Chris Christen - sen, dean of the College of Agriculture and director of the Agricultural Experiment Station of the University of Wisconsin, who will speak to you on "Some Problems on Milk Marketing". Dean Christensen. DEAN CHRIS CHIUSTENSEN: Thank you Chancellor Burnett. Ladies and Gentlemen: I cannot help taking this opportunity to ex - press personally a great deal of gratitude to Chan-ellor Burnett for his leadership in this college and what his leadership in this institution has done in the case of my life. I endorse one hundred per cent what he has said; that is, in times like these when prices are low and in - stitutions are failing and people are being so discouraged, there is one thing that has not depreciated in value and that is education. There is a real premium on the young men and women that are really pre- </seg>
            <seg id="p258">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE pared, and furthermore, it is going to be the work of our educational Institutions and our trained men and women experiencing education, and in a broad sense not only the training of students on the campus but in research work that has been done, and the extension service, that is going to help agriculture and many of the industries closely identified with agriculture to get the problems before us. I personally am optimistic with respect to agriculture and farming and I am tak - ing that position in Wisconsin. I feel that from the standpoint of the College of Agriculture in Wisconsin and Nebraska that we have a great responsibility and a great opportunity and we are doing a thing at Wisconsin that I want to refer to briefly. I want to say, Chan - cellor, that I got the germ of this idea on this campus. A large number of students who spend the four years in school and possible more go into the teaching and research fields of agri - culture. That is fine and we are going to continue that service of training for professional lines. nut we are also going to put our - selves to the task of training for the position of farming. In the nineties the founder of the college of agriculture at Wisconsin or - ganized a farmers' short course. It was different in that it did not attempt high-school work. This course was very popular in the nine - ties, but in the last ten or fifteen years it. has faded out. During my first year at Wisconsin I reorganized the short course purely on the basis that we need to restock our farms with trained young men and we can get them through that course. The work was being taught by some of our best men on the campus and I took two barracks on the campus and asked the regents for ?S,000 to rebuild them into a short course dormitory. I took the pavilion and rebuilt that into a dining room and I opened up our short course on a reorganized basis on December 19. We had a large increase in enrollment. We have had difficulty convincing the farmers that the college of agriculture trains men and women for the position of farming and rural leader - ship. What agriculture needs is men and women skilled and well in - formed and prepared and trained to think because farming in the future will need brains as well as brawn. The dairy farmers of Nebraska, as well as the farmers of Wiscon - sin and other states, must face squarely certain fundamental consider - ations in their farm business. Must. Employ Group Action One of these fundamentals is that of efficient manufacturing and distribution. We can readily appreciate that the low cost production of quality products depends largely upon the ability and initiative of the individual whereas to secure efficient manufacturing and dis - tributing, we must rely upon group action. That is, with the family - sized farm which is so characteristic of the agriculture of America, </seg>
            <seg id="p259">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION the job of marketing the product must be done collectively. The average farmer does not have sufficient volume to warrant or justify the investment and expense of operation involved in the processing and marketing of the product. ■ Marketing, therefore, is just as much a part of your farm business as are the cultivation of the crop and the care and management of the herd. After the farmer has gone to the expense of putting a cer - tain investment into a cow, providing the barn and dairy equipment for her care, a certain outlay for feed and labor, is it not good busi - ness for the farmer to spend some time and perhaps a little additional money to see that the product is marketed satisfactorily? In several milk market areas dairymen have invested from $10 to $15 per cow in marketing equipment, and organization. For example, on the basis of around 2,000,000 (actually 2,150,000) cows in Wisconsin, a ten-dollar-per cow investment would aggregate $20, - 000,000 — a large sum of money. Yes, but Wisconsin farmers already have an investment of $80 per cow, or $100,000,000 for production purposes. But it is safe to assume that they have not invested one - eighth of that amount in the marketing of the products from these cows. It is also safe to assume that similar figures for Nebraska dairy - men would not be as high as for Wisconsin, where cooperative enter - prise in the manufacturing and distribution of dairy products is more highly developed than it is in this, my native state. Does this rela - tionship not suggest the advantages which promise to accrue from greater attention and more expenditures on the marketing end? Manufacture Is Not the End In this connection what are the manufacturers of industrial goods doing? Do they think that they would be adequately paid if they produced their goods whether it be shoes, automobiles, or some food product and then waited for a market to come to them with an offer. No, they are realizing more and more that they are not through with their jobs when they have produced even a superior product. They assume responsibility in seeing that their commodity reaches the users and that it meets full approval for quality, price, and service. Why does not the case of the dairymen parallel that of the other producers? If the dairyman is to receive satisfactory returns on his investment of land, seed, fertilizer, machinery, livestock, and labor he will have to interest himself in marketing, as well as in producing the product. Fluid Milk Markets Hnve Own Problems Many of you who are here today are, no doubt, interested in the </seg>
            <seg id="p260">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AGRICULTURE fluid milk markets of Lincoln and Omaha. Producers, furnishing city markets such as these with their daily milk supply, are more localized in their organization effort than are those who unite for the purpose of manufacturing their raw product into finished articles, such as butter and cheese, and merchandising these in distant metropolitan centers. Dairymen, producing milk for fluid "milk markets, are as a whole further advanced in their organization effort than are farmers in any other branch of the dairy industry. They have gone farther in study - ing and understanding their markets and in acquainting the consumer with the value of this important food product. Fluid milk marketing associations, and private distributing agencies, have done a fine job in promoting the use and sale of milk. The work of our dairy councils has likewise been very helpful. .Milk Producers Have Three Types of Organization Organized producers, in fluid milk markets, have extended their group action to one or more of three stages. The first, and most common, is the bargaining association, such as you have organized in this market for the purpose of soiling collec - tively to those who are to distribute the milk to the ultimate con - sumer, and who are to manufacture the surplus milk into one or more products. The Pure Milk Association, of Chicago, is an excellent example of a successful association of this type. A bargaining' asso - ciation owns no plants or equipment beyond what it might have as an office or a small laboratory. It is, as its name implies, a bargaining and service association. The second type of fluid milk organization is found typified In the Twin City Milk Producers Association, of Minneapolis and St. Paul. This organization attempts to supply the distributors in the city with their daily requirements for fluid milk purposes. The association, it - self handles all other milk produced by its members, and mauutac - tures this milk into butter, cheese and condensed products. Instead of bringing the surplus milk into the city itself and haying it manu - factured by numerous different agencies not equally well equipped for this purpose, the association has its own country plants to which the milk is delivered and in which the surplus milk is manufactured into products for resale. The third stage in the development of fluid milk associations is found in the types which not only manufacture the surplus milk, but which have actually entered into the retail distribution of the fluid product. This type of association is found less frequently than either of the other two and has had varying degrees of success. </seg>
            <seg id="p261">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION In sketching these three types briefly you will find from experi - ence that no associations have started in the first step without bar - gaining associations. Any that have had successful cooperation upon the part of the distributor have remained as bargaining associations. In some markets where distributors have not been cooperating the bargaining association has gone to the second type of farm plant and the third step of taking over the marketing. While there is a definite tendency for producers to extend their activities farther and farther into the market, conditions within any particular market will determine how far it is desirable for an associ - ation to go. . In addition to these three types within any one milk zone, several milk organizations are uniting to handle the problem of an inter-zone character due to the ease with which milk can be shipped from one city to another. Why the -Producer Association Is Needed There are many problems in a city milk market which justify the existence of a producers' organization. The first of these is the prob - lem of quality milk. Each city usually has its own health department and health ordinance governing its supply of milk. City distributing agencies also direct considerable attention to quality. It is important to note, however, that in order to obtain the highest quality product the full cooperation of the producer is required. The effective part that producer-owned associations have taken in improving the quality of milk has been demonstrated upon several occasions. One distributor in a Wisconsin city was credited with this remark: "The farmers' association did more in six weeks in improving the quality of milk than we were able to do alone in six years." Some years ago the farmers in the Chicago milk area vigorously opposed the tuberculin test. The producers in that market today have chosen as a name for their organization, "Pure Milk." If an asso - ciation were organized for no other purpose than for the improve - ment of the product, its existence would be justified. In many of our large milk markets, particularly in the East, pro - ducers have adopted, as part of their program, a leveling out of sea - sonal production of milk in order to give the cities a constant supply throughout the year. Each producer is placed upon a base and sur - plus price plan, and those who produce uniformly from season to sea - son receive a relatively higher price for their milk than do those who have a high spring and early summer production followed by a very low production in late summer and fall months. </seg>
            <seg id="p262">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In some instances the associations have gone farther and as - sumed a measure of control over the total quantity produced in the market. This has been done largely by limiting the base amount that each producer could deliver. I am not suggesting that the base and surplus price plan be adopted in your market here until you, your - selves, have given it considerable study and decided whether or not it is a plan you wish to support. It is important that we appreciate the extent to which the public welfare is based on a regular and wholesome supply of milk. The consumers are represented through their health departments, which are backed by special health ordinances on milk. The distributors in a market are usually small enough in number so that it is relatively easy for them to meet and consider their mutual problems. On the other hand, the individual farmers are so numerous and so widely scattered that their welfare can best be safeguarded through some type of producer organization. Moreover, the interests of the producer are too large a factor in the market to be safely ignored by either the distributor or the general public. His representation can properly extend to the bargaining table at which the price of milk will be determined, to the conferences in which the regulations con - trolling quality or sources of milk are to be governed, and to the actual checking of weights and tests of milk to assure him of fair trade practices. • Form of Organization In the actual operations of producers' associations it is important that we give consideration to a few fundamental principles which are too often overlooked. First of all, farmers must be organized along business lines. The organization should be designed to meet the par - ticular needs of the producers and of the markets which are to be served. This may mean merely a bargaining association, or it may mean an organization that will actually handle the product itself. The organization set-up must, of course, meet all legal requirements both in its charter and contractual relationships. Management, Is Important Articles of incorporation, by-laws, contracts, and highly developed organization and selling plans are, however, worthless scraps of paper unless there are, within the cooperative, men with business ability, vision, and experience to formulate and guide the organization's policies and supervise administration. In the erection of a building you may have all the materials and equipment available, but you rely upon men actually to construct the plant. For it is not enough to have the parts and the blueprints, but </seg>
            <seg id="p263">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION you must look to the brains of man to direct the assembling of the machine and to guide its operations. There is more to this than the papers and the by-laws and the board meetings, etc. The responsibility for management, in a cooperative association, begins with the members of the organization. They are the stock - holders and owners of the business. It is the members who select the directors of the association. In electing directors qualified to direct the iiffairs of a cooperative business association, the members of the organization have not only a great responsibility but an obligation to their group enterprise. Members of cooperative associations, who complain about the directors and management, too often have failed to perform intelligently their first and most important duty. The score of cooperative associations that have been in difficulty, with whom I have advised, have been confronted with this proposition that when members complain about the managers and directors you will find !l!» out of 100 members have fallen down on their first responsibility of the selection of the managers and directors of their association. They were incompetent from the business standpoint. There are activities that ought not be handled by the association that should be handled through other organizations. That association should stick to the one job of marketing milk. The control and direction of a cooperative cannot be left to any one individual. While this may be done in a small private business, it does not apply to large businesses which have become such an im - portant part of the business structure of America. The management of any large commercial organization requires team responsibility. You will find failure when an executive committee or a director has the responsibility and you can look back through the papers and see the private corporations left to the management and responsibility of one man that have failed. The same thing will hold true to a co - operative of this type. Directors, therefore, constitute the high auth - ority of the business affairs of a cooperative association. Their re - sponsibility, their job, and their duty are very definitely implied in the term "director". They cannot shift this task onto the shoulders of other directors or onto the employees — it is their job. Broadly speaking, the duties of directors of a cooperative busi - ness association may be divided into three major groups. (1) Directors must formulate business policies that fit the needs and conditions of the marketing task to be done. (2) It Is the duty of a board of directors to select competent managerial executives and, then, for the manager to carry into execu - tion the policies upon which the board has agreed. </seg>
            <seg id="p264">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE (3) Directors should not only sec that their policies nrc actually put into execution, but they should also keep in touch with the results and appraise them. It isn't enough to meet and formulate policies and then forget about them. You want to have your financial statements and the re - port of the operations from time to time. You may find that some policies after they have been in effect are not getting the results that you would like to get. In that case adopt a new policy in its place. Price Negotiations Price negotiations, between the producers' association and the milk distributors, should call for more than merely once-a-month meetings of these agencies to bicker over the price of milk. There is a dire need in many milk markets for a recognition on the part of distri - butors, producers and consumers of economic facts and forces which influence the welfare of the market. Producers' associations, milk dis - tributors, and even consumers, now view their market almost entirely from a short-time basis. Farmers and distributors, alike, are in , business on a long-time basis, and it is imperative that they look upon their business relation - ships from this viewpoint. Any program that may be developed and any price policy that may be formulated should provide for the city a uniform flow of high quality milk at reasonable prices. Usually fa - vorable prices are of little permanent value if they cause the cur - tailment in milk consumption, encourage undesirable trade practices, or unduly stimulate the production of milk. When negotiating prices it is important for distributors to demon - strate that their operations are as efficient as reasonably can be ex - pected and that their handling methods and sales program promote the greatest possibile consumption of the product. In determining the retail price, consideration should be given to the purchasing power of the consumer, which 3t the present time has in many instances been reduced to a fraction of what it was a few years past. Other factors to weigh are the competition of competitive products in the market and how well the consumption of the product is maintained. In determining the appropriateness of the price to the producer the market must, of necessity, consider the alternative uses for the pro - duct, such as its manufacture into butter and cheese. Our observa - tion has been that under normal conditions producers within the city milk shed can maintain a differential of from 25 to 4 0 cents per hundred pounds of milk, not at the farm, over its value at that point for manufacturing purposes. This is the equivalent of one-half cent </seg>
            <seg id="p265">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION or more a quart. Whether the differential is within this range or above or below it will depend upon conditions within the market itself. It is likewise desirable too, to keep a proper relationship between base and surplus milk. If this spread is too wide it invites competitors who will at - tempt to buy on the average or flat price basis and undermine the original basis of sale. It is desirable to determine whether the production of milk within the market is being unduly stimulated, or whether there is a tendency for producers to direct their farm enterprise or the sale of this product in other directions. No price formula can be set up which will prove satisfactory under all conditions. Regardless of the importance of the definite price plan a'nd price policy, producers and distributors must stand ready to mak^ any adjustments which market conditions de - mand. After all, there is no substitute for good business judgment. Careful Financing Is Needed There is probably no single factor which is more important in the continued success of a cooperative association than is its financial policy. Adequate sums of money must be available to meet all nec - essary expenses, including those pertaining to current operations, re - tirement of debt, and the building of adequate reserves. In the actual operations of the association it is, of course, highly desirable that every effort be extended to operate the association on as efficient a basis as possible. Beyond this, however, there are problems of financing which are too often overlooked or inadequately handled. The most important financing problem for a milk bargaining association is the creation of an adequate reserve fund with which to meet unforeseen contin - gencies and with which to strengthen the bargaining position of the producers. There is probably no single factor as important in effective bar - gaining for the sale, of milk as is the ability of the organization to handle the product itself upon short notice. To do this requires an adequate policy of financing and the establishment of ample reserves. The more accumulation of capital does not imply that the producers' association will enter into the distribution of milk. It is probably best to avoid the actual 'handling of the product if satisfactory arrange - ments can be made with the existing agencies. It is, nevertheless, im - portant for the producers to be in a position where they can assume this responsibility if the conditions in the market make such action necessary. The milk market is always subject to Influances which may pro- </seg>
            <seg id="p266">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE duce, overnight, an acute market situation. Those resulting emer - gencies differ from the ordinary problems upon which the board of directors and officials are constantly deliberating. In many cases these are relatively temporary, and usually arise from conditions over which the management has little or no immediate control. Yet they constitute business risks with which the association must be pre - pared to deal. This can be done best through a reserve fund which can be accumulated by small deductions made regularly in the sale of the product. Need Reserve Fund to Meet Contingencies Several strong dairy cooperatives are constantly accumulating re - serves. One of the outstanding features of the very successful Mary - land State Dairymen's Association, which sells its milk in Baltimore, was its pioneer work in building up an adequate fund for contingencies. Although this cooperative is a bargaining association and owns no plant or equipment, it has accumulated a special reserve fund ap - proaching a million dollars. The payments to this fund are based upon a percentage for each 100 pounds of milk sold. The producers of the organization consider the amounts paid Into tins fund ;is their best investment. These cash resources, large enough to meet the probable market contingencies, enable the association to command the respect and co - operation of the dealers. The fund also enables the association to guarantee to the producer that he will receive payment for all suilk sold, and that he will have a market for his milk at a price justified by supply and demand conditions. Many of the milk bargaining asso - ciations in the United States, including the Maryland-Virginia .Milk Producers' Association: the ■ Connecticut Milk Producers' Association; and the Pure Milk Association of Chicago, have adopted a policy pro - viding for a reserve by deductions. Other associations are beginning to realize that in order to hold their place they must establish a reserve for emergencies, and that such a reserve is an important factor In strengthening one of the common weaknesses of the bargaining type of association. The exfstence of such a reserve fund places the producers' bargain - ing association more nearly on a parity with respect to bargaining power with the dealers and with cooperative dairy marketing asso - ciations which own and operate their own facilities for the physical handling of the product. Aside from strengthening the producers' bargaining power and serving as a kind of business insurance, such a reserve may provide the nucleus for enlarging the association's ser - vice to members. While you are building up a reserve of this kind the members are getting something more than the monthly check. </seg>
            <seg id="p267">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION They are also building up a reserve fund in which they have an equity. You will find that In difficulty if you put the two together, the mem - bers' equity in the reserve and what they get monthly, they are getting a price better than the one who Is not in the association. The Membership Must Be Kept Informed After an organization has been set up and its business operations well established, the management has too often assumed that the only problem of the association is to care for the business transactions. Members are, after all, the owners of the cooperative association. They are the ones that have the final judgment on the broader ques - tions of policy and success. If the judgment is to be sound it must be based on facts, and part of the job of the management of a co - operative is to place before the members such factual information as will give them a thorough understanding of the association, its poli - clies, its problems, and its success. More specifically, members should be given an annual or semi-an - nual statement of the financial status of the organization. They need to know rather clearly the broad policies of the organization on finance, sales, membership relations, and the like. Such specific information as salaries and operating costs might well be given and they should be presented both as they relate to actual amounts and per unit of pro - duct handled. In case of salaries paid employees, the real test is not the amount but the ability of the individuals and the results obtained. Most of all, the information to members should be accurate, complete, and understandable. The patron's contract deserves mention in any discussion of mem - bership relations to a cooperative association such as this. There is need for a closer bond of union than the mere organization structure itself provides. It is also a factor entering into the bargaining strength of the association. This membership contract should be protected and enforced. At the same time it is highly essential to point out that membership contracts alone do not furnish the required strength for negotiation upon price. Neither will it guarantee the adequate sup - port of the members of the association. No single factor will do more to gain the active and continuous support of the individual members of the organization than will a thorough understanding of the asso - ciation and its efficient operation. Do not be afraid to keep the directors and members informed upon the problems and finances because after all the real difficulties arise when some of the problems have been kept from the members. While if you keep them informed there is no group of people who are more fair minded than a group of farmers. </seg>
            <seg id="p268">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Summarized into a single sentence it is essential that a producers' milk organization give its major consideration to five fundamental con - siderations for continued successful operation: proper business or - ganization; capable management; intelligent pr'ce negotiations; ade - quate finances; and ■well-informed, responsive membership.

Although it is very difficult to measure the value of this type of educational work, as no direct results can be pointed out, it does seem reasonable to conclude that some of the seeds sown, reach fertile ground and will develop in proper season. The interest shown wherever these exhibits are displayed would indicate that they have a value of attraction and appeal to the observer, and that some picture of the thought portrayed will remain. If we can leave a pic - ture in the minds of people of the value of dairy products, the proper - method for the care of milk, or improved procedures in herd manage - ment, then it is n&lt;|t unnatural to assume that some time, as proper - conditions present themselves, these suggestions will be put into prac - tice. For the last several years the exhibits sent to county fairs have been comprised largely of material that would be an aid to the pro - ducer in improving methods of feeding, breeding, and management of his dairy herd. Emphasis has also been placed upon procedures to be followed in the production and care of clean milk and cream. 'The need this year has been for information that would lead to a greater consumption of milk and its products. With this idea in mind this association has procured from the National Dairy Council of Chicago, charts entitled, "Keep Your Health Up and Your Food Co.st Down" also two "cut out" posters, one entitled, "Milk Helps You Win" and the other "Choose Your Lunch Wisely." The chart as well as the cut outs are attractively colored and have received many favorable com - ments. Wherever requested, this material as well as a supply of the pamphlet "Living Well at Low Cost" has been supplied to county fairs and this has served as the central theme for a display of locally produced dairy products.

            <seg id="p284">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 4-H CLUB WORK One of the many projects of this association is the support of the 4-H Club Dairy Cattle and dairy demonstration teams. Each year the association contributes a sum of money to be used in helping to de - fray the expenses of these boys and girls to the national dairy show where they compete with other state's champion teams for national honors. The appreciation of this help is best expressed by quotations from letters written to the secretary of the association by boys and girls who made the trip to Waterloo, Iowa this year. A few of these follow: "I wish to express my sincere appreciation for the opportunity of attending the "Waterloo Dairy Cattle Congress. It is very encouraging to boys and girls in dairy club work to have an organization such as yours interested in our work and progress. Having been interested in showing, I have wanted to attend the "Waterloo Show and this desire was fulfilled through your organization. I was interested in seeing some of the outstanding dairy' cattle In the country as I have had some dairy judging work and have been inter - ested in showing cattle. My trip was most enjoyable and educational and I want to thank you so much for having made it possible." Sincerely, EMILY SE J ANGAARD, Omaha, Nebraska. "I am going to take this opportunity to thank you for making it possible for me to go to Waterloo. Iowa and represent Nebraska in the national dairy demonstration contest. If it had not been for your liberal contribution, the other delegates and myself would not have been able to make the trip to Waterloo and uphold the laurels of our state. In closing I want to thank you again for what you have done for the 4-H Clubs." Yours truly, DONALD OHRT, Bennington, Nebraska. "I have found that it was through the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association that the Nebraska dairy judging team secured the trip to the National Dairy Show. On behalf of the Seward County judging team representing Nebraska at the Dairy Cattle Congress at Waterloo, </seg>
            <seg id="p285">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION Iowa, I wish to thank you for your cooperation with 4-H Club workers and leaders. I thoroughly enjoyed the trip, for It wos my first trip out of the state. It was a fine trip and the Dairy Cattle Congress was very edu - cational, and the great display of livestock was exceptionally interest - ing." Very truly yours, PALMER WELSH, Seward, Nebraska. "I am again back at school work after having taken the trip to Waterloo, Iowa which your association has made possible. It was a great show. We just heard that our team from Nebraska was placed first and we realize that without the Nebraska Dairymen's Association the trip would have probably been impossible. We are of course very proud of the fact that we were picked as the winning team and wish to thank you for the part you and your association lias played." Sincerely yours, VERNON ROTTLER, Madison, Nebraska. "As one of the members of the Nebraska Dairy Demonstration Team who represented Nebraska at the National Dairy Show this year, I wish to thank you and the association very much for the financial support you have given to me in going to the National Dairy Show. I certainly enjoyed the trip very much and appreciate the attitude you take toward 4-H Club work." Very truly yours, ARLAND L. SCHMITT, Lincoln, Nebraska. "I wish to thank you for making it po^s'ble for us to go to Water - loo, Iowa. This trip was very educational." With many thanks, ORLO REDIGER. Milford, Nebraska. "While this is rather late to be telling you that I feel indebted to the State Dairymen's Association for their sending our Seward County 4-H Club Dairy Judging Team to the Dairy Cattle Congress at Water - loo, Iowa, yet it is a fact that I am not overlooking. </seg>
            <seg id="p286">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Club work has brought a lot of real experience to me, and I am glad to have had this trip with the chance to compete in judging to top It off. Thanks." Very truly yours, PAUL ROLFSMEIER, Seward, Nebraska. No greater confirmation of the value of this expenditure could be had than the evidence presented in writing by those who have actually experienced the benefits. The association believes that much good can come to the Dairy Industry in Nebraska through the stimula - tion and training through 4-H Club work. This work will receive the support of the association as long as it is possible to do so. </seg>

The dairy cow for centuries has heen called the Friend of Man - kind. That she is the true friend of the|Nebraska dairy farmer has been demonstrated in this agricultural depression. The subnormal agricultural conditions of lD."i2 have emphasized the high economic value of the state's dairy industry. Nebraska producers received twenty-six million dollars during the past rear for dairy products; the cash value of these products exceeded tne combined cash value of wheat, oats, barley, rye, potatoes and sug:.r beets by one-half million dollars. It was equal to one-third of the combined value of all crops.

            <seg id="p317">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION with a keen appreciation of the value of dair.y products as an all-year "cash crop", Nebraska farmers are milking more cows and making greater efforts for more economical production, than ever before. Numerous farmers have frankly admitted to the Society's representa - tives that their weekly milk and cream checks have provided them with funds for the purchase of necessities not raised on the land. The present price index for all agricultural products stands at 56, wh'ile that of dairy products stands at 68, 14 points higher. Chart No. 1, attached to this report, shows the yearly average of index num - bers for dairy products compared with all other agricultural com - modities for the five-year period 1927 to 1931 inclusive, and for the first ten months of 1932. Taking the years l!)30 and 1931, the total income from all farm products other than milk declined 44.6% below the income from the same source for 1929. The incpme from milk shows a decrease of only 30.4%. The National Dairy Council's figures show that during the current year the dairy industry has aided more than ever before in sustaining the best portion of the farmer's in - come. During 1925 dairy products furnished a little less than i5 per cent of the total farm income. From the 1929 peak, from sources other than dairy products, income dropped 44 per cent, while income from dairy products declined only 30 per cent. During the current year dairying was the one industry which produced no exportable surplus. That normal consumption has been maintained is shown by the butter storage situation on December 1, 1932, in comparison with the previous year and the five-year average, reported by the U. S. Department of Agriculture: December 1st December 1st December 1st 5-year average 1931 1932 Creamery butter. pounds, 79,223,000 42,242,000 37,208,000 </seg>

Chart No. 2 attached to this report shows the relative cash value of Nebraska's total 1932 crops and of dairy products. Chart No. 3 shows the growth of dairy production in the state from 1021 to 1931. While the growth has been rapid, it should be noted that it has resulted from increased efficiency rather than from increase in numbers of dairy farmers and of dairy cattle. The num - ber of cows milked increased 26 per cent, but the production of milk increased 71 per cent. In this factor of efficiency lies the whole ob - jective of the Nebraska Dairy Development Society, whose consistent principle has been "Not More Cows", but "Better Cows, Better Cared For". The increase in economy of production, and the widening of the margin between unit cost and the market value, whatever it may be, is the Society's goal, and the result of its program, now entering the tenth year of its activities, is substantial proof not only of the sound - ness of this policy, but of the need for the state-wide program which has been carried on through that period of time, in cooperation with the Agricultural Extension Department of the Agricultural College, the several breed associations, and other agencies, for the improve - ment of dairy cattle through testing, breeding, and more effective and intelligent management on the farm. That the high producing unit is profitable even under exisiting conditions has been demonstrated without question. The Department of Agriculture's reports show that the average production of the 220,000 cows tested in Herd Improve- </seg>
            <seg id="p320">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOA III. &gt; OF AGRICULTURE ment Association in the United States (luting 1931 was 306 pounds of butterfat, returning $9 5 per unit over tlie feed cost. The analysis also shows that the cow producing only 130 pounds of butterfat re - turned $12 over feed cost; on the other hind, a 500-pound butterfat producing unit returned $188 over feed cnst, sixteen times as much. While the income over feed cost under present conditions will be con - siderably lower than in 1931, the returns will show the same relative margin between the high and low producers. Nebraska Herd Im - provement records for 19 31 reported by the Dairy Extension Depart - ment indicate an average production of all the 10,051 Herd Improve - ment tested cows of 313 pounds of butterfat, with a return of $S0 over feed cost, while the average production for all Nebraska cows was 170 pounds of butterfat and a return of $37 over feed cost. Chart No. 4 compares production and returns above feed cost' of the average of Herd Improvement Association cows, and of all cows milked. It is often asserted that we are milking too many cows for the good of the industry, but this is true only in the sense that we are perhaps milking too many low producing cows. The data on Charts 3 and 4 emphasizes that the high producers are still large profit pro - ducers. In contrast with the total number of cows milked by Ne - braska farmers, some 650.000, the present production could lie main - tained with fifty per cent less animals showing an average output of 300 pounds of butterfat annually, with a very material reduction in cost of feeding, expenditure of time and effort, and with collateral benefit in other directions. During the nine years of its activity the Society has pursued a definite program for the betterment of the dairy industry of the State, involving herd testing for production, the use of more pure-bred dairy sires, the control of disease such as tuberculosis and contagious ab - ortion, the furtherance of 4-H Dairy Calf Club work amonjx the boys and girls on the farms, improvement of quality of dairy products, and encouragement of consumption, and particularly by educational meth - ods through direct contact by the Society'^ experts with dairy farmers. In addition to this programmed work, the Society has obtained, di - rectly or cooperatively, the benefits of ajmore adequate classification and premiums for dairy cattle exhibits at the Nebraska State Fair, a minimum production requirement for calf club animals, a highly suc - cessful Dairy Cattle' Exhibit at the National Dairy Shows of 1929, 1930, and 1931, and participation in abortion conference with state officials and the staff of the Dairy Extension service for prevention of spread of this disease and for the adoption of adequate sanitary regulations. </seg>

DAIRY HERD IMPROVEMENT: Testing through establishment of dairy herd improvement asso - ciations makes possible the elimination of unprofitable producers and their replacement with heifers from high producing ancestry. This is the only practical method of proving sires and making progress in breeding, and it encourages more economical feeding and more economical and efficient management. Dairy Herd improvement work is under the direct supervision of the Dairy Extension Department of the Agricultural College, and too much credit cannot be accorded to the efficient staff of this extension service. The Society's part in this work is cooperative, in the effort to encourage herd improvement at farm meetings and in personal conference. Chart 5 shows the growth ot herd improvement testing in Nebraska during the past nine years. In 1924 two associations covered the area outlined in red; in 1932 the work had been extended into G3 counties covered by the shaded area. The work has made splendid progress, and has really benefited the industry fur beyond the individual association members. The need of further extension of herd improvement associations is apparent from the fact that only one and one-half per cent of Nebraska's dairy cows are tested. BETTKR HERD SIRES: • ' ■ ■ ■ ■' ..'■■■■ The use of more high grade dairy sires, having ability to trans - mit capacity for higher unit production, offers an excellent oppor - tunity to improve our dairy herds at small cost.

            <seg id="p322">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE-BOARD OF AGRICULTURE herds. This project presents some difficulty, but it is highly import - ant; good sires are scarce and difficult to secure, and often the maxi - mum value of a good bull is lost through improper management. The Society has considered this one of its major objectives, and has con - sistently encouraged the use of more good herd sires and their expert management. The work has been followed up through meetings and demonstrations and farm visits, and by the selection and purchase for Nebraska farmers and breeders of 453 purebred bulls of good type, satisfactory breeding, and with high producing ancestry. In these selections the policy of drawing from the State's sources of supply has been maintained as far as possible, and when necessary to locate the best blood obtainable with availbale funds, to search carefully in estab - lished producing areas, principally Wisconsin. It has been the Society's requirement that dams of herd bulls so selected must have a minimum annual production record of 400 pounds of butterfat. The average of all the dams of the 453 sires selected, in point of fact, was over 550 pounds of butterfat. The soundness of this policy is shown by the blue ribbon and championship awards gained by many of these bulls and their offspring at local shows, the State Fair, and at the National Dairy Shows, as well as by the uniform; high production transmitted. The location of the 453 sires selected by the Society, In Nebraska counties, is illustrated on Chart No. 6. I T-T«.*rllt[® I *T®'^T®"i^^ S£ l®i' os Chart No. 6.

The Society has embraced every opportunity of cooperation with state and local authorities in prevention and eradication of live stock diseases. In recent years, contagious abortion, commonly called Bang's disease, has become a serious menace toj our cattle industry. It mani - fests itself in lower production of milk, loss of calves, slow or non - breeders, and udder diseases. Many authorities estimate that a loss of </seg>
            <seg id="p323">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION several million dollars is sustained annually by Nebraska farmers as a result of this disease. The Society has been instrumental in sec - uring concerted action of all agencies interested in the improvement of the dairy industry in the state, for the promotion of a vigorous program to control this disease and- to assist the individual farmer to clean up his infected herd. The following points are emphasized: 1. The need of adequate state live stock sanitary regulations to prevent the importation into Nebraska of infected cattle. At the pres - ent time Nebraska is one of the few states not requiring a blood test before permitting importation. This can and eventually will, unless provided against, make Nebraska the dumping ground for abortion infected cattle from other states. When a Nebraska farmer ships dairy cattle into Iowa, or in fact thirty-one other states, he must fur - nish certificate that the animals have been blood-tested and are Iree from contagious abortion, but an Iowa farmer, or one in any other state, can ship into Nebraska and distribute freely as many infected cattle as he wishes, without restriction. It is of the greatest import - ance that this State should require the blood test and freedom from this taint, for the protection of its dairy industry. 2. Until provided by law, farmers should of their own volition require a negative blood test of all cattle brought into their herds, by purchase or trade, even though they may come from their next door neighbors. 3. Assistance of farmers in cleaning tip infected herds by use of the blood test, and adoption of sanitary measures, wllich have been outlined and distributed, and are available on request to Dr. Van Es, Chairman of the Nebraska Animal Pathology Department, at Lincoln. This program is being made effective through meetings, demon- Chart No. 7— Location of 874 Dairy Club Members in 1932. </seg>

Nine years ago we were frequently advised in many quarters that Nebraska would never make dairying successful because Nebraska farmers did not like the business. This comment is no longer heard. Many Nebraska farm - ers have made dairying one of their major operations, and have de - veloped into enthusiastic and efficient dairymen. The enthusiasm and knowledge brought to the industry by Dairy Calf Clubs has been a material factor in bringing about tliis change of sentiment. The work is conducted under the supervision of Mr. L. I. Frisbie, of the Agricultural Extension service, and has grown from lfli) members in 1923 to 874 in 1032. Chart No. 7 shows counties in which these boys' and girls' calf clubs are located. During the past nine years several thousand Nebraska farm boys and girls have received a thorough training in the art of successful dairying. The training of Dairy Calf Club members through the three-year project includes cattle judging and selection of dairy character and breed type; raising dairy calves and development of dairy heifers; feeding and management; importance of good dairy sires, their selec - tion and control; disease control; the importance of quality of prod - uct, and increased consumption. The competitive factor acts as a healthful stimulant. Nebraska club members have given public dem - onstrations each year on the above subject in their home communi - ties, at the State Fair, and at the National Dairy Shows. It should be borne in mind that the value of club work is not con - fined to the young club member, but actually benefits the parents and often the neighbors as well, and some projects even benefit the State as a whole. In October, 1931, when the fifteen Nebraska club mem - bers exhibited seventeen dairy animals at the St. Louis National, they gained nation-wide recognition for our State by placing every entry "in the money", with two blue ribbons, one for an individual and the other for best group, and winning more money per animal than any of the other twelve competing states in the club division. Following the club show, three Nebraska club heifers were entered in open classes of the National, and again all placed in the money, with Cleo Hoy's yearling Guernsey winning first. Junior Champion, and finally the coveted grade of Grand National Guernsey female of the 1931 Na - tional Dairy Show, the first time in the history of the National that a </seg>

This Guernsey was selected, as a calf, by the Nebraska Dairy Development Society, as were eleven others of the seventeen entries, including the blue ribbon winners. The Society during its nine years oi" existence has selected 939 dairy .calves, its experts have conducted or participated in 1,045 meetings with an estimated attendance of 42,000/ and additionally have made 2.6G2 farm visits for demonstration and advice. The Society's Manager and Assistant Manager assisted in the training of judging and demonstration teams, and in the conduct and supervision of exhibits at the State Fairs and at the National Dairy Shows in which Nebraska entries participated.

            <seg id="p326">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I ' IMPROVEMENT OF QUALITY: This is a subject which is extremely important, and deserves greater attention than it has been given. The records indicate that a large per cent of the eighty-five million pounds of Nebraska butter produced last year scored 89 or less. usual differential between 89 and 92 score ranges from 2 to 3 cents per pound. Our creameries are efficient in the manufacture of butter, but it is impossible to make high score butter from poor quality cream. A loss is also sustained in poor quality fluid milk sold. Careful estimates show that poor quality is costing our farmers several million dollar.? per year, through im - proper handling of the product, souring, off-navored and low grade cream. This loss can be prevented by! proper handling of milk and cream after it is produced, and at the source. It is the Society's pur - pose to encourage improvement of quality, and this purpose is being put into effect by meetings and demonstrations, and by cooperation with the Dairy Extension Service. Demonstrations have been given in many communities on the importance of cooling milk and cream, the building of practical home made milk cooling tanks, and the production of clean milk, through the best methods of handling and cooling immediately after the milk is taken from the cow. These demonstrations have been effective in .he use of more cooling tanks and other sanitary equipment and improved methods, but the work should be extended much further and into other communities. INCREASED CONSUMPTION OF DAIRY PKODUCTS: To make the dairy industry sound and permanent, we must con - stantly look to an increase in consuntion to absorb expansion of production. It is exceedingly heartening to note that at the end of 1932 consumtion had kept pace with increased production, The National Dairy Council's reports lndlca :e that the large production of butter in 1932 has all been consumed, and that, the storage holdings are much below the five-year average, and it is encouraging to the future of the industry that this large consumption has taken place in a period when the buying power of consumers has been low. The Society has endeavored to further consumption of dairy products, in the interest of health and economy, at many meetings. The splendid material in the comprehensive charts Prepared by the National Dairy Council have been displayed to advantage and explained in over a hun - dred public schools, civic and women's clubs, and several hundred general meetings in Nebraska. Demonstrations by 4-H Club members have been an important influence in increasing consumption. The demonstrations on "Producing Clean Milk" and "Keeping a Well Filled Milk Pitcher on the Table", have been effective. Quality and increased consumption go hand in hand and in the interest of economy and public health these demonstrations, carrying a vital message from </seg>

SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES IX 1932: During 1932 Manager O. H. Liebers and Assistant Manager M. N. Lawritson addressed 395 meetings, with a total estimated attendance of 17,400. Two hundred seventeen of these meetings were devoted to Dairy Calf Club work. Forty-three were for the discussion and study of value of pure-bred sires, and 135 for general purposes. Farm visits to the number of 1,123 were made by the Society's representa - tives: 605 for instruction of club members and leaders; 250 for furtherance of the better sire campaign, 2 68 on general dairy prob - lems. The Society received and responded to 3,644 calls for service through the office, of which 1,688 were handled by correspondence, 1,083 by telephone, and 873 by personal conference. The Society assisted 109 breeders and club members in the purchase of 155 foun - dation animals; 36 were club calves, 76 foundation females, 43 pure - bred sires. The average cost of the 43 sires was $105; the average production of their dams was 661 pounds of butterfat per annum. SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES FROM 1924 TO 1932 During the past nine years the Dairy Development Society, co - operating with the College of Agriculture, the Extension Service, and assisted by a group of farmers, business and professional men, bankers, and others interested in this important movement for the benefits of the state, has conducted a practical and well denned program to build a sound and profitable dairy industry. It has kept within the scope of its purposes from the start, necessarily limiting its activities, with a relatively small fund available each year, devoted wholly to actual field work in the employment of its two experts well qualified by edu - cation and experience, without overhead expense, to the furtherance of the economic status of this industry. Its principal objectives have been the development of more thoroughly trained dairymen, with a wholesome love and enthusiasm for dairying, improvement of effici - ency and economy of production by herd testing, better sires, better management, and disease control; and the improvement of quality of product, and increased use. To make this program effective, the Society's representatives have discussed dairy problems at 2,831 meet - ings in 91 of the 93 counties of Nebraska, with the astonishing total of 340,000 persons in attendance. They have made, on request, 7,689 farm visits, and rendered service to 27,996 persons, in addition, by correspondence, telephone, or office conference. They purchased for 1,710 Nebraska breeders, farmers, and club members, an aggre - gate of 3,748 foundation dairy animals, including 453 purebred sires, carefully selected for type, breeding and production record, and 939 club calves of good breeding and dairy character, whose dams pro- </seg>

It was interesting to try to find out what the old records would tell us. We find there was a constitution proposed aid adopted in 1906. No minutes of this meeting seem to be recorded and there are none for 1907 but we find them for the 1908 meetii.gs. At that time Mrs. W. G. Whitmore of Valley was the president and Mrs. Val Keyser the secretary. Here is a list of the past presidents and secretaries as far back as the records show and we will hand them to the present secre - tary to be recorded in this year's record.

I am happy at this time to present Mrs. Capwell who will bring you the President's greetings. Mrs. Capwell. Greetings — Mrs. Capwell: I am happy to be here, happy to say "Welcome to you all" as we begin the twenty-eighth session of the Nebraska Home Eco - nomics meetings of Organized Agriculture. We want you to enter into the spirit of these programs, attend every session if possible, and leave with renewed courage and a determination that for your home you will seek only the best things — the things which allow for a complete development ol every member of your household. For many years we have met here to hear about "The Home Beautiful" and "The Homemaker Herself" and the inspiration re - ceived by many of you who have attended can never be measured. Many pleasant associations have been formed, many lasting friend - ships have begun in these meetings, and once more we are here to study together the problems that confront the homemaker of today. It is a strange thing that this terrible crisis in our country has demonstrated the importance and strength of the family, as in this generation at least, it has never been demonstrated. Never </seg>
            <seg id="p336">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE since this nation was founded were there so many people within its borders suffering for the barest necessities, many facing the prob - lem cf losing their homes for which they have sacrificed for years. Was there ever a time when every ndividual, and every com - munity, was so money conscious, employment conscious, and food conscious? It is not easy in times of financial uncertainty like these, when over-taut nerves are strained to the breaking point, with the struggle to keep the family courage up and the family expense down. It is hard to retain the exalted vision of service and achievement with which we set out so confidently on our careers as hoinemakers. Anyone can go along with the current but it takes energy, resource - fulness, sacrifice and faith to go against the tide and these are the qualities we need today. I "Not for many years lias America been so dependent on its womanhood as it is at present. Seldom in our history lias there been a greater need for the vision, tbe Certitude anil the faith which are the peculiar attributes of women, to ' now, if ever, homes must be kept intact, family ties niust be made stronger and men's minds and efforts must be directed toward these happier and more pros - perous days that the New Year will brln ;." Family relationships are sorely trieti at a time when every energy must be bent upon keeping the physical needs supplied. A young mother, writing about the poverty and hardships through which she was passing, told of her two beautiful babies, the loyal love of her husband, and the happiness of her home. She dosed her letter with this remarkable sentence: "We have very little to live on, but we have everything to live for." He who has much to live on may be desperately poor, while he who has something to live for may be independently rich. To lave motor cars, line houses, beautiful clothes, rich tapestries and art treasures may mean that one Is still unhappy, restless, cynical, and without joy. To have honor, faith, courage, ideals, and vis-ion means that one is enriched so that no disaster can ever make him i bankrupt. It is a good thing to have money and all that money can buy, but It is good, too, to check tip once in a while and make sure that we have not lost the thing that money cannot buy. This economic crisis has cut through the artificialities of our living and we are standing face to face with the grim realities of life. The home must build up the spirit for the next day's effort. The sense of well-being that comes from a well-regulated, orderly home, makes a decided contribution to the morale of its members. It helps the family as a whole to make the most out of what they </seg>
            <seg id="p337">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION have. We need to look back as well as forward to see bow people lived in the past. Somehow, the sturdy pioneers found a content - ment in family relationships that we need to encourage. An old man said i "Funny old world, all ups and downs, but no matter how many downs, there are always some ups." Shall wo look for some of the "ups''T It is true that the greatest economy needs to be practiced in every home, especially the rural home and those homes where unemployment exists. Our standards of living may be changed — we hope they will not be lowered — but many changes may take place with no detrimental effect upon the health or happiness of the average family. This may bo an opportunity for a "back-to-the-home" movement. There will be more time for family companionships, more home - grown foods used and perhaps a better living accomplished because of bettor planning. There will be more time for reading and music in the home — for we have less money for outside amusements. We must, recognize the needs of our family for relaxation and recreation in their fight against individual depression or discourage - ment. Young people who are denied college life this year may take a most helpful pre-college course in their own homes, if we as mothers direct their reading and other activities. I have come to the conclusion that a year spent in the average farm home between high school and college would give every young person a better understanding of the problems of life. College life would be more appreciated and more easily adapted to their needs. After all it is "through adversity rather than success that character is formed." While meeting with the program committee this year. I was much impressed by the genuine personal interest that these women feel in your problems. Their chief concern seemed to be to put something upon this program that would meet the needs of each one of you, something that would increase your appreciation of your homes, emphasize your responsibility and in some way make your lives happier and more effective. 1 have enjoyed meeting the teachers of our Agricultural College as well as the state workers who are helping. our Home Demonstra - tion Agents put across the lessons that they are giving us this year. The work accomplished through our agents is affecting thousands of homes by adding a touch of beauty, an added comfort, a saving of labor, encouraging keeping home accounts, and suggesting little economies that will improve our standards of living. In hundreds of different small ways the country home has been touched and improved. The influence of these little things is a force that is </seg>

Two little girls hurrying to school were afraid they would be late. "Let's stop and pray t " one suggested. "No, let's pray as we run," was the. reply. So let that be a lesson to us as homemakers in the year 1933. "Let's pray as we run." ■ In closing may I quote from a poet whose name I do not know? "God broke our years to hours and days. That hour by hour and day by ilay Just going on a little way, We might be able all along To keep ourselves heartwhole and strong. Should all the weight of life Be laid across our shoulders, and the future, rife With woe and struggle, meet us face to face At just one place We could not onward go; Our feet would stop and so God lays a little on us every day, And never, I believe, on all the way Will burdens bear so deep Or pathways be so steep But we can forward go if by G od's power, We only bear the burdens of uhe hour."

            <seg id="p340">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Mrs. Eva Morse comes from Omaha where she is the supervisor of Adult Homemaking Education in the Omaha schools. Pier work has given her a wealth of experience from which to offer suggestions to homemakers. Mrs. Morse. WHY MOTHERS GROW GRAY MRS. EVA MORSE You recognize the title as taken from the cartoon that appears in our daily papers. The scene is laid in a modest home where mother does the work with some interference or some help, as the case may be, from two early adolescent children. One cartoon that I recall pictures the boy sitting on his sister's coat while she struggles vainly to pull it out from under him. The implication in the title is that the behavior of children in their teens or near teens is so trying that mothers are reduced to such a state of anxiety and despair that their hair turns prematurely gray. As we look at tliese pictures we are impressed by the fact that the mother seems to be making a contribution to the disorder. She is shocked speechless or she is angered to retaliation or she is moved to violent fault-Iinding. I have an idea that if we talked to that mother she would confess that slie was at the end of her resources, that she didn't know what to do with them. She would explain that she had told them to behave; that she had punished them in every way she could think of, but it didn't seem to do any good and that she was just about exhausted ■with the struggle. Quite likely she would add that she hoped she could live until they were old enough to have some sense. This mother is an everyday character. We not only meet her frequently but we often take the part; She does not see that the pivot of the whole situation is herself.! She is never quiet t never understanding, never adult. She is quite as much responsible as the children for the disorder. What she is unconsciously doing is to make bad conduct interesting. For instance if those children always get more attention when they are disorderly than they do when they are good they aTe going to continue to act that way. I was watching a young mother dress a little youngster. Just as she was ready to slip the garment over the child's head he ran away. If she had run after him laughing and calling him a darling little rogue, what would have happened? He would have continued to do it be - cause it was an interesting game — but she did not, she merely stood </seg>
            <seg id="p341">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION still with the garment in her hands, and an expression on her lace that said, "We don't play this way." She understood the influence on the child of her own reactions. We have a right to conclude that the reason some mothers grow gray is because they do not understand the psychology of youth. The activity of children often annoys the adult because he does not know that it is a necessary condition for development. The human being does not develop standing still as a plant does. To grow he must satisfy an urge that drives him to investigate, to experience. This child comes into an utterly strange world that must be understood; he starts with :i helpless body that must be developed. This is his big task. He knows what to do. He must be active, he waves his arms, lie kicks, he uses his voice. We must not say how can we keep him quiet but how can we give him opportunity. We know that human beings are happiest when they are busy. We all rccoKnize the fact that the human being needs to be busy, that even our leisure time cannot be a time of doing nothing. The severest, the crudest punishment that can be meted out to a person is to deprive him of activity. We appreciate this in dealing with our children. But we some - times are like the man who had six boys. He knew that for his own peace of mind they had to be busy but he did not appreciate the fact there was some choice in the kind of business they had. He kept them working all the time. All vacation they worked regular hours. During the school year they had to work after school hours. Then if there was any time left they did their school work. At one time lie had nothing else in mind he wanted them to do, so he sent them into the field to cut grain by hand although he knew the threshing crew was to be at his place in the afternoon. The boys could not help knowing that he was merely doing it to keep them busy and that it was no help. It was like setting them to piling up a cord of wood and then making them unpile it so they could pile it again. This kind of activity merely antagonized them. It is right for children to help carry the family load but there is an urge in them that is quite as important to their spiritual growth as thirst is for their physical — an urge to do something creative — that is, an urge to plan — to execute the plan — to test the thing after it is done. It is quite important that the child learn to put away his toys but after he has learned to do it there is nothing creative about the task. It does not answer this deep-seated hunger to express. But the child who is sitting at the edge of a sand pile with a basin of water, who moistens the sand slightly and mounds it over his bare foot and </seg>
            <seg id="p342">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE i ■ . sits patiently waiting until the sand has taken shape and then carefully draws his foot out of the pile and leaves a hole, which is a ham; who then breaks up little sticks and makes a fence and picks up pebbles and calls some ot them sheep, some horses, and some cows; who plants trees and lays out roads, is doing a creative thing — something that satisfies his soul and makes him happier and healthier. It is all right for the adolescent to assist with the chores. He should help carry the family load. But he is not finding expression in that job. But if he has found a place on the creek where he can build a dam and control the water so it turns a little wheel he is doing some - thing creative that helps him to self-control, growth, and happiness. This is no idle fancy. It is the way of growth and it is just as neces - sary to all around happy development as dry feet are to the little chicken. Parents who see this need for expression do not grow gray in raising their children. Even when we recognize the needs of the child we do not always guide him wisely because we do not know that telling is not teaching and that he does not learn through our doing. Someone has said that the child is egocentric (that is, devoted to himself) for the first seven or eight years, in order to protect himself from hiB parents. The parent so often wants to make a plaything of him that he would be made dependent if he did not protect himself. The wise course to pursue is to see that he is physically cared for, clean, quiet, and well nourished, that he lives under a regular regime and that he is surrounded by a life that calms while it offers oppor - tunities for development. As soon as he is old enough to get into things (which is his way of adjusting to the unknown) we nag instead of teach. We should recognize that curiosity is as much a necessary part of his make-up as breathing. He needs an environment where dangers are eliminated as far as possible but where he has opportunity to handle, feel, push, reach for, and learn about material and space. If there are things he must leave alone we must teach him and not just tell. The mother who says, "I have told you fifty times not to do that" is merely revealing her own inefficiency. Telling is not teaching. We talk, talk, talk and it has no effect except that it becomes an an - noyance or an opiate. When we have something to tell a small child we must make sure he gets it. First, we must have his attention. We get that best by putting ourselves on his level and talking to him face to face. Then we must be sure that it is something he can understand and that it is within the range of his capacity and interest. Talking at a child's head without knowing whether he is getting it or not is a good way to </seg>
            <seg id="p343">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION develop habits of inattention and indifference. After we get the child's attention we must teach him what we want him to do and make the opportunity for him to do it. I think one of the most pernicious habits we can indulge in is for the parent to start moralizing and fault-finding in the morning when the child is getting ready for school. The teacher can Invariably tell what kind of home-leaving the child experienced. This not only applies to the child but to the adult as well. Again and again when a work - man is found careless in the morning he confesses that he had words with his wife before he left home. It may have been his fault. I don't know, but the facts are that if you want to have your family do its best during the day, it is up to you to see that there is no re - minding of unpleasant things or fault-finding in the morning. Too many of us teach as the little boy taught his parrot. His mother came into the room and was horrified to hear him swear. She protested, but he justified himself by saying he was teaching the parrot what he must not say. Our mastery of mathematics would be slow, if we studied that 2x2 does not make 5, 2 x 2 does not make 6. Yet that Is the way we try to teach our children. When we teach we get understanding and activity from the one taught. These young people need to feel secure. In these days of uncer - tainty we are likely to let our worries dominate our living. We often think that children are so carefree that they do not notice what is troubling their elders. This is not the case. They do not have the experience to evaluate the things that are happening so they are nagged by them in quite needless ways. Looking back into your own youth, do you not recall times when you were filled with a vague anxiety and even terror about some situation that could quite easily be explained by the older people in the household, if you had confided in them. A good illustration of that is the story of the little boy whose playful uncle told him he would grow horns on his head if he ate molasses on his bread. One day he felt a bump on his head and he asked his mother to feel and see if he was growing a horn. She was busy and she absent-mindedly ran her hand over his head and said she could feel a horn there all right. He worried and worried; how could he wear a hat? How could he go to school? Everyone would laugh at him. He got into such a state that he couldn't sleep. Upon investigation his mother found out what the trouble was and set his fears at rest. At these times when we are all so hard hit. we need </seg>
            <seg id="p344">REPORT OK .NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OV AGRICULTURE to be careful to keep such an atmosphere in the household that the children are not unduly worried. I talked with a young woman out in the state a few months ago. She said that they had lost part of their farm on a mortgage — they had hung up their Ford because they couldn't afford to run it. The truck picked up their milk and they had nothing else to sell but eggs. They were only three miles from town and she and her husband each made one trip a week with a basket of eggs. She said, "You know principally we bring back library books. We have enough to eat but of course we have no clothes. If this keeps up the country is going to be filled with fat. naked farmers. We are doing so many things together. We take the three children out with us and we clear off places that need picking up. We are starting a little rustic house that we can train vines over. 1 canned lots of tomatoes l;ist year so the children can have that and as long ns I can get the cod liver oil for them I am not going to let anything worry me." She has learned one of the most important precepts of MenUil Hy - giene: To live fully but one day at a time. William Osier, one of the greatest of medical men. said that whatever success lie had made was because he bad learned to plan carefully — then cease to think of the plan but to live richly and fully one day at a time. We do not help tomorrow by worrying about it. But if we put the best we have into joy of living today, tomorrow will be the easier. If we can keep such an atmosphere in the home our children will not be robbed of their right to serene living. Parents may keep from becoming prematurely gray (a) By making it their business to understand the needs of the children and then learn to guide them instead of trying to thwart them. (b) By observing themselves so they learn that the parents' reaction is the biggest part of a behavior problem. (e) By learning that children cannot live happily nor develop normally without something to do but that much of it should be of their own choosing and that they should plan and execute this work of their choice. (d) By appreciating that children should be raised in bright - ness and light and we should not burden them with our troubles. That the sanest, most wholesome way to live is to plan carefully — then to live joyfully just one day at a time. During 1931-32 Dr. Rebekah Gibbons of the Home Economics De - partment took a year's leave of absence and made a trip around the world. Today she is going to share with us, who have never had such an opportunity, some of the interesting things she saw while on her trip. Dr. Gibbons. </seg>
            <seg id="p345">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION' HOMES IN MANY LANDS DR. REBEKAH GIBBONS On my trip around the world I spent most oi my time in India so can tell you most about India life. This costume which I am wearing is the sleeping costume. I have just wakened up. I will now roll up my sleeping mat which as you see has no spring or padding in it. This particular mat was made in the jail where Ghandi has fasted. I must get up before dawn to go and get water because I am ashamed not to have a servant to send for water and do not want the neighbors to see me. I take my big brass bowl on my hip and bring it back on my head. I bring enough water to last for the whole day. My stove is a small fire pot. Cakes of cow dung are the fuel. When the fuel cakes get low I must make extra ones. I visited a health center where the cow dung was behind the door and found that the woman working there had found it on her way to work and had taken and placed it behind the door until she would go home where she would take it with her. As soon as I have the food ready, I heat water for the ceremonial bath which must be taken before eating. For the high caste this is an extremely complicated affair. I cannot see any for - eigner after the ceremonial bath is taken because it would take too long to take another one before eating. I bring the food to my husband on a fresh banana leaf when serving a feast but for breakfast I will bring it on a circle of leaves. It consists of a heap of rice with pepper water on It. The higher castes serve it with curry of potato, eggplant, beans t mutton, fish, etc. He takes his fingers and mixes the rice and water together forming little balls. He will not get his fingers wet higher than the first two joints. He then flips the food into his mouth with his thumb. He drinks water without touching it to his lips. We eat twice a day and have rice and water both times. The children will eat next if there is anything left and then I will eat. No one has enough to eat. There are practically no fat people — perhaps two in a village wealthy enough to have enough to eat. Xow the India mother will give the baby a bath. When the baby is picked up he grabs for the mother's hip where he is always carried and snatches her garment wherever he can get a hold. The mother sits on a low box with feet outstretched, takes the baby by the arms and lays it head downward between her shins. She pours the water over the baby and rubs it a little, then turns the baby over and repeats the ordeal. The water runs off the baby before it reaches its head. She may have soap and if she does it is used very sparingly to make it last as long as possible. There is no towel so she takes the baby to the fire pot and throws in some rosin on the fire and turns the baby slowly from front to back and toasts its body over the heat. This makes the baby smell so good and makes the body soft. </seg>
            <seg id="p346">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The mother then has the family rice to pound. She puts the rice on a post hollowed out in the center, then pounds it with a mallet. With each blow she lets go, then grabs it as it comes back. She will spend an hour and a half pounding husks from rice for the family for one day. She has no sewing to do as pins and needles and thread are never used in garment making. Twice a week she will go over the floor and walls with cow dung, clay and water mixed together. It makes an odorless, dustless covering for floors and walls. There is no comfort in the home in India because there is no chim - ney and no windows. There is a little low door into which you have to stoop to get into the house. The house is made of mud as there is no wood to build it. It is with great difficulty that they secure one stake of wood for ridge pole. The roof is of thatch. There are no chimneys so that the smoke fills the house and when one steps into the room the tears run down the face. The smoke can be seen pouring out all over the thatched roof while the cooking is being done. There is no covering on the floor and the floor is on the same level as the ground outside the door. The sleeping mat lies on the floor, if they are fortunate enough to have a mat. There are no chairs, no table, no dressers. Only a little pile cf brass vessels in the corner near the stove and a brass light hung from the ceiling in which a wick burns. Otherwise &gt; the house is perfectly empty. A guest must sit on the floor unless someone runs and borrows the one chair in the village. The sleeping costume is made of one piece of material and is from seven to fourteen yards in length, depending upon the wealth of the person who owns it. It is draped over .the body without pins, needles, threads, or anything. Under it is worn either no blouse or a short blouse. It has many pleats laid in without the needle. The garment is tied in a knot in the front, "before draping over the body. A sari is worn on the head and when a woman sees a man coming she pulls it over her face until the danger is past. Often when work - ing she winds the back of her costume over her head. The costume is very modest. The most important part of the costume is the jewelry. They must have jewelry or they are very unhappy. She wears glass bracelets because she cannot afford gold or silver. She has her hands massaged until they are black and blue so that she can get a whole row of bracelets on her arm. Married men wear four little silver rings on the toes. They wear head ornaments, many earrings and necklaces. The family wealth goes into ornaments instead of putting money into the banks as there are no banks. They use very few stones as they are too expensive. They call bracelets "bangles". </seg>
            <seg id="p347">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION The women put a red spot in the center of the forehead to snow that they are not widows, in some parts of India. The men's costumes &gt; are amusing. They have copied the American man's shirt with the ex - ception of the collar but they wear it with shirt tails napping on the outside of knicker-like pants which are draped on. Then shoes, hose and garters are worn like the American man and the expanse between the garters and the bottom of the knickers is bare. The holy men wear a loin cloth only, sometimes a turban. They are very dirty and smear the body with ashes. They carry a begging bowl. In the high caste family the baby wears a little gold belt, other - wise babies wear nothing or many wear a woolen cap with a little tail hanging down the back. It is of heavy wool with three pompoms on It. I found the homes in other lands much like India — In Egypt, Pales - tine, and Slam. I made a very interesting friend in India who took me through a high caste home. This home had a beautifully carved door covered with lovely brass ornaments. It contained many rooms through which we went one after another. They were perfectly empty. The baby was hung from the roof in a piece of cloth with the corners tied together to keep the mosquitoes off. We were not per - mitted to see the kitchen as a foreigner would pollute the food. While I was paying my respects to the hostess at the outside door a boy came driving the cows through the street and I was gently pushed aside by a cow who walked through the beautifully carved door and into the house and through to its own room in the house. The cow is sacred and has much more space than the family. In very small places where there is just one room, the cow shares it with the family. In Burma the houses are built high because it is wet. In Java a bamboo raft makes the house. They are very decorative. I visited the temple where there were a lot of very large monkeys. I took corn to feed the monkeys and, thinking the children would enjoy doing it, I gave some corn to them and turned around to see the children eating it. They were perfectly willing to see someone else feed the monkeys but they were so hungry that when the corn was given to them they could not resist eating it. When I returned from seeing people so poor and working in such a hard way and was told there was a depression I could not feel it. It cannot phase me much after seeing people living under those con - ditions—cold and hungry. I am glad to be in the United States. </seg>
            <seg id="p348">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AGRICULTURE TUESDAY AFTERNOON MRS. HOWARD F. CAPWELL, Presiding We will begin the afternoon program. I am sure you will be glad to hear the speaker. She comes from Washington from the office of the Extension Work. ,She is a Nebraska girl. Many of you know her, and I am sure that you will be glad this afternoon to hear what she has for us. Miss Mary Rokahr will now lead the Panel Conference Discussion. (In preparation for this discussion a group of ten persons conver - sant with the topic to be discussed were chosen. They were asked to sit around a table facing the audience and do their thinking out loud. The purpose of this method as set forth by H. A. Overstreet, who des - cribed it in the "Journal of Adult Education", January, 1932, under the title of "Capturing the Depression Mind" is as follows: "Thinking is going on — fundamental, reconstructive thinking. The best thing that adult educators can do is to let people in on the thinking t let them think with it and through it. and even beyond it. We have had enough of being lectured to. Give us the opportunity to roll up our mental sleeves and be in on the job — and we shall probably be sur - prised at the vigor of our own mental processes." The panel members had no set speeches, each person added his best ideas as they fit into the general discussion. The audience was asked to take part in the discussion after the panel members had finished presenting their views. One hour was allowed; forty-five minutes were devoted to the panel discussion and fifteen minutes in which the members of the audience made their contributions. Two case families with typical situation's were set up, and the dis - cussion aimed to offer suggestions to them for the problems they were facing. Panel members came prepared to discuss the situation as set up for the Taylor and the Fisher families as described on the following pages. A folder giving the facts for both family cases was placed in the hands of the audience that they might better know the limiting circumstance for each family.) Panel members were as follows: Miss Mary Rokahr, discussion leader Mr. Arthur George, representing Farm Management Miss Matilda Peters, representing Home Economics Department Miss Dorothy Norrls, representing Home Extension Agents • Mr. N.

THE ROAD AHEAD MISS MARY ROKAHR, Discussion Leader Miss Ilokahr: For our discussion at this meeting we will use the panel conference club meeting which we have used in a number of ex - tension conferences and if you will be willing to cooperate with, us I am sure we will all find it interesting. I have asked Miss Brown if she will listen to the discussion and summarize it for us at the end. Do not expect us to solve this question entirely. We are all going to think and talk together. We cannot make the decision for the Taylor family, but the information that we can glean together and the helpful ideas may he of assistance to the Taylor family as well as to ourselves. The Taylor family are losing their farm; but, are to remain as renters. How should they face the situation? Cas&lt;- Xo. 1 — Mr. and Mrs. Taylor are farm owners, operators. Mr. Taylor is forty-two years old, Mrs. Taylor is forty, Glen is fifteen, and Boyd is eleven. They are farming one hundred sixty acres, with wheat, corn, and livestock as the major projects. Eighty acres of this farm were inherited by Mr. Taylor from his father. The other eighty were purchased in 102G. This farm is located five miles from town, and three-fourths of a mile off the highway. They have five milk cows f sixty liens in winter, eight brood sows, and raise a fine garden. The house is a square, frame, two-story type. They have running water, bath, furnace and plain furnishings. The telephone has been removed. The radio batteries have run down and have not been re - charged. The Taylors have a Chevrolet car which is driven as little as possible. They go to town once each week. The kitchen and dining room floors ore covered with linoleum. The kitchen linoleum is some - what worn. The remainder of the house has hard wood floors. The Taylor are conservatively dressed. In the past they have purchased much of the clothing but more is being made at home now. Mrs. Taylor does her own laundry work, cans vegetables and fruits which are home grown, and makes bread and soap. Mrs. Taylor belongs to an Extension Project Club. The family generally go to church and they belong to a community club. Both of the boys have completed some 4-H club projects. Mr. Taylor was </seg>
            <seg id="p350">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE a high school graduate and Mrs. Taylor was a rural teacher before her marriage. The net cash income in 1931 was $254.00. It was necessary for Mr. Taylor to let the life insurance policy lapse this year. Glen in high school has had to drop some athletic activities because of their cost. Glen is willing to do extra work and make sacrifices in order to stay in school. He rides a pony back and forth to school. I Mr. and Mrs. Taylor want Glen and Boyd to have advantages of school and training for u vocation. Mrs. Taylor is conversant with new homemaking knowledge due to attending project meetings. She is now very worried due to the financial outlook. She has grown irritable. Her attitude is being reflected in the daily family relationships. Mr. Taylor has ceased to worry about finances and is grateful to know that he can provide food and shelter for his family. Under these circumstances how can the community help the Fisher family? Case No. 2 — Mr. and Mrs. Fisher are tenant operators of a one hundred twenty acre farm. Mr. Fisher is twenty-three years old and has been through the eighth grade school. Mrs. Fisher is twenty - three years old and has been through the tenth grade. Mrs. Fisher has done- housework before her marriage and has poor standards for homemaking. There is a baby six months old who is lussy and requires considerable attention. The Fishers moved in from another state to try farming, having been unsuccessful in other jobs. They settled in this section because Mrs. Fisher's father lives in the neighborhood. Mr, Fisher has always been directed by someone else. It is a new venture to start out farm - ing for himself. Mrs. Fisher's father financed them in Retting started on this farm. This farm is owned by an Eastern landlord. They are to pay two-fifths share crop rent. The house is a frame building somewhat run down in condition and hard to heat, no bath or even kitchen sink. Two windows have broken glass. The porch is not enclosed i a hand power washing machine stands out on the porch. What farm machinery is needed is borrowed from father-in-law. The Fishers have three milk cows, four brood sows, twenty hens, two teams of horses and a 1930 model A Ford. They do considerable driving about the country. Mrs. Fisher might be found any afternoon wearing a soiled' dress, hair uncombed, and morning housework not yet done. She does not belong to any community organization, although her sister-in-law has invited her to project club meetings. This year for the first time she attempted to can some vegetables. Due to lack of training and </seg>
            <seg id="p351">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION experience she had spoilage. The Fishers are willing and interested in learning better ways and anxious to do better, realizing that they have failed to make use of opportunities to learn but must do so from now on. Discussion of the Taylor family Mrs. Nelson: It is mentioned that the net income for 1931 was $254 but I did not know there were any facts in the story saying they were keeping accounts of any kind but perhaps they are, but if not, I wonder if it would not be a good suggestion that they keep farm and home accounts of the inventory they have left. Miss Rokahr: I think from the setup of this particular family that they probably did not keep accounts. What things do you think might turn up that would indicate that they might have which, if they took an inventory t would make them realize that they had much left. Mrs. Hill: Would you name in comparison the man who had lost his job in the city? Even though they had lost the farm, they have shelter and the opportunity to produce most of their food; space for recreation for their boys and opportunities for things of that sort. Mr. George: The story alsp states that they had a certain amount of livestock and poultry and that if they had been farming there or as renters, and are going to remain farmers, they probably have a good deal of equipment, machinery, horses, and a cellar of canned goods that will keep them through the winter. I might emphasize a little this matter of keeping accounts. It seems to me if they had come down to this stage in their business operations and have not kept ac - counts that by keeping not only a general set of farm accounts they may also keep some special enterprise accounts, such as dairying, poul - try raising, and they might find out what enterprises were more profit - able and then might be able to turn toward those enterprises which are most profitable. It indicates a pretty one-sided sort of a farm in that their energies have been turned mostly to corn and wheat. Their dairy cows are few in number and the poultry flock is rather small. I believe if they had kept a record during the last few years they would have found that they would have had a larger income from poultry and dairy than they have had from wheat or corn. Mr. Hoag: I notice there is a lack of legumes on this farm. If this farm is m a locality where alfalfa could be grown there should be a considerable acreage of alfalfa, and if not, some sweet clover; and I had the same idea as Mr. George that there was not enough livestock on this farm. Too much of their energy has been directed to the rais - ing of wheat and corn and we know at the present price of wheat and corn that they could not have had much income from those. They should have had a larger flock of chickens, more cows, hogs, or some </seg>
            <seg id="p352">REPORT' OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 0 other type of livestock with which they would like to work. This boy who is in school says he would be agreeable to lessen his athletics In order to help on the farm. Mr. Gaines may be able to figure out a way that he can go on with his athletics. The other day I visited one of our neighbors who happened to be laid up. He had two boys going to school; one boy happened to be sick, too. The mother was out do - ing the chores at six o'clock. The older boy was at school practising basket ball. Mother said he could not come home until after six or he would not get his letter. I think in thi3 case It would have been better for the boy to have been home doing the chores than to be earning one of those letters for his jersey. Another thing that was mentioned is the account book which should be stressed. A County Agent told me when coming down here that the account books last year showed where there were big leaks on many of the non-paying farms. If they had discovered those leaks a couple of years sooner it might have saved them. Perhaps in this case an account book for both the farm and home would be of help. I think that the attitude of the neighbors toward this family should be one of helpfulness. They should show them that their standing in the community was as high today as be - fore they lost their farm and help them to feel it was through' no fault of their own that they had had this loss and help them to win it back. Miss Rokahr: I am rather interested in that point you brought up. Do you think that the attitude of Nebraska communities is such that the people who have lost their farms feel that it has been a failure on their part? How can the community help the family after they have lost their farm? Mrs. Watson: One of the troubles of this family is that their morale is so low. Mrs. Taylor has grown irritable. Her attitude is being reflected in the daily family relationships. Mr. Taylor has ceased to worry about finances and is grateful to know that he can provide food and shelter for his family. Mr. Taylor needs encouragement. The mother is at a very low state of morale. What can we do to en - courage her? Miss Rokahr: What do you suggest? ' ' Mr. Gaines: I think Mr. Taylor is to blame for it all. He probably handles the bank account, all livestock, all machinery, and tells just what they will buy and sell and the reason why his morale is up is because he knows all about the situation all the way through. If Mother Taylor and Glen could handle this cooperative account record so that she could realize what they were really up against, her morale would be better. I think the best thing in the who'.e business is the fact that this boy is willing to give up something in order to help the family. If you can get that boy and his mother together, you can re- </seg>
            <seg id="p353">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION store her morale. ■ '-■.' V ' ' ■ - . Miss Rokahr: I think Mr. Gaines has brought out a very good point. How could they work it out? I do not like to think that Mr. Taylor is all at fault. How could Mr. Taylor have worked this out? Mr. Gaines: I think that keeping records is one of the things to bring about family cooperation. Everyone helps. We do not mu - tually understand anybody unless we work together on their problems. 1 think that is one of the valuable things relative to keeping accounts. Miss Norris: I think Mrs. Taylor is still very much interested in her family because she realizes what the food needs are. She cans, raises a fine garden, bakes, makes soap, goes to project meetings, com - munity meetings, and church. At some of those places it seems that she should be able to get a brighter outlook. Miss Rokahr: Then you would suggest that she continue going to these project meetings? Miss NorriH: Yes. Maybe she feels badly because the linoleum is so old, but she should not let that keep her from the meetings. Miss Rokahr: She has a problem because they have cut down their travel and do not drive their car more than once a week. Miss Norris: We usually find that someone in the neighborhood i.s always willing to stop and take someone to the meetings. Miss Rokahr: Then the woman would have a way to go to these meetings. Mr. Hoag: The women always worry about the kitchen linoleum or the curtains. Prom the man's viewpoint I would worry more about the radio. I think that Mr. Taylor in some way should try and get the radio lixed up because you can get a great deal of information on the radio and a good deal of entertainment for the family. Miss Rokahr: How much does it cost to keep the radio batteries lixed for a year, Mr. Pouts: One dollar a month or twelve dollars a year. Miss Rokahr: Out of $254 that they have for a living, where could they do some adjusting in which they might be able to take that $12 and put it in some batteries for the radio? Miss Peters: I wonder if the boys could not carry on some project to help keep up the radio. Mrs. Watson: What would it be, though? Miss Peters: 1 know of a family who had several boys who helped </seg>
            <seg id="p354">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE a lot by raising popcorn and sweet potatoes and marketing them. Mrs. Nelson: The market is lacking now. Mrs. Hill: But there is still their poultry and livestock projects that boys of that age could work with to bring in some money. Certainly $12 a year. Miss Rokahr: I was thinking in terms of analyzing a little more carefully their home food budget and whether they could in some way increase their garden. Some of the women are doing more canning and making their own bread, cheese, and other staples on the farm. It may be they could find some item which they could cut down and get the $12 for the radio. Mrs. Nelson: I have known quite a number who have worked *!iuite successfully in disposing of their homemade cheese but selling it for cash is hard to do now. Miss Rokahr: What would the battery man be willing to take in exchange for his labor in keeping up the battery? Mrs. Nelson: Butter and eggs instead of using cash. Mrs. Watson: That is what we call bartering. Mrs. Hill: It seems to me that too much emphasis is being placed on the lack of money rather than what they can do with what they have. They keep talking about what they did not have. Now why not sit down and figure up and take an inventory of all the good things they have left besides money. Miss Rokahr: Along with household accounts a little more care - ful analysis of what they have. Mrs. Watson: Now all she thinks of is the contrast of the way she has lived and the way she is living now. If someone would make her realize that she should do what she can with what she has, she would be much happier. Mr. Fouts: I think Mrs. Taylor will very shortly come to the mental attitude which Mr. Taylor has. I think Mr. Taylor is doing well. In his mental attitude he is seeing that he has not lost his most essential hope, that for the holding his family together. I am a little Impatient with Mrs. Taylor. I am sympathetic with her but her mental condition now is due to looking back and not ahead. Per - haps there has not been a partnership between Mr. and Mrs. Taylor. When I look over this modern home and find that half the farm was given to them and they bought another eighty acres there must have been something wrong with the partnership. If there were debts made in order to provide this fine home, it looks like it was mostly debt. Mr. Taylor saw that. He certainly hoped that prosperity </seg>
            <seg id="p355">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION would continue. He did not want to embarrass her with the story of the debt. I think he is typical of a lot of men. Now he knows if the place has come to that, it is similar to a tornado or some such ca - tastrophe. He knows it and is looking ahead. That is all there is left for him to do. Mrs. Taylor looks back at the things that have been her pride. Her boys are still living. Now when she comes to the point that she will look forward with him she is going to forget that attitude and look forward with hope. And if hope is not gone there is still a lot to live for because there is never dead hope in a family of two children of eleven and fifteen years. When they come to a situation like that they have met with a tough jolt. The husband is already in that attitude. It is just a condition of holding the family together and getting along. Now when the mother comes to this and if they can just keep the boys in school, in time things will work out. I think the first essential is the proper working arrangement between the landlord and the father. That is on the same basis as some of the points brought out in these meetings here. This man should not be expected to pay big rent. In other words, he cannot guarantee that man a fixed rent from the farm. Mrs. Hill: I would like to disagree with Mr. Pouts. I doubt if he has been a lone sufferer. He has a good barn and several other things. Why not blame some of these others for the debts? Mr. Fouts: But the water in the barn is not in the story. Miss Rokahr: We did not go into the details because we knew our audience would be the women but we did assume that if the home had all of these things the farm would have all of the modern con - veniences. Mrs. Hill: In doing all of these things for the home, you infer that he did them for his wife. Why should not the home be mutual property? Mr. Fouts: He has a different mental attitude which shows they have not reached a mutual understanding. Mrs. Nelson: I think it is a lack of understanding. Mr. Hoag: There is one thing that has not been mentioned and that is their health. That is something they should be thankful for, if they do not have anything else. I have realized that several times during the last few years and I am thankful to be here today. It seems that I tried to see just how hazardous an occupation I could make out of farming and on the 24th of last September, I came within one-fourth of an inch of bidding farewell. Miss Rokahr: If you do not have to pay doctor bills, there is a good deal to be thankful for. Her contribution of keeping them in </seg>
            <seg id="p356">KEPORT OF .NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AGRICULTURE good health Is a good one. We have to make the decision at this particular point as to whether or not we wish to discuss the other family or go on with the Taylor family. (Reads story about Fisher family.) Let us see how the community can help this Fisher family. What are some of the organizations that could help Mrs. Fisher? Mr. Gaines: Women's Project Clubs. Mr. Fouts: The husband needs a good chanre of exchanging work with the neighbor. He should work with the neighbor to learn how they do it. Miss Uokahr: However, will they be willing to take him in when they know that he is not capable? Mr. Hoag: They will have a lot of fun with him and welcome the chance. Mrs. Watson: The Fishers are Interested and willing to learn and that means a lot. Miss Norris: If Mrs. Fisher is so willing and interested to learn, why hasn't she gone to some of these project meetings? Mrs. Watson: She has a six months old baby and it might be hard for her to get away. Six months old babies are not always wel - come at club meetings. Mr. Gaines: She is young and does not know what this project club is. The women probably have not taken her into the community. She does not know their ways. Miss Rokahr: She needs more encouragement, other than from relatives, of women who belong to these clubs. Mrs. Hill: They should be given a chance to read more literature. Mrs. Watson: They probably will now because they are down and out and are willing and interested in learning. Miss Rokahr: How will they learn about literature that is avail - able? Mr. George: From more experienced people. I can imagine a tenant farmer just moving into a community with no contact outside of his relatives. It is up to the people in the community to find them. Mr. Gaines: There is a wonderful opportunity for the local people to take a special interest in them and present them to the Farm Bureau and the Farm Bureau office. For someone living a lonely </seg>
            <seg id="p357">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION. life on the farm which is all new to them gives a wonderful op - portunity for someone to get them in touch with organized efforts along help for the farmer. Mr. Fonts: I think she needs some of the same experiences that her husband would enjoy. I think they should each be put on a local committee with some well-informed person and she will come out all right. Miss Norris: They should take part in community recreation in - stead of driving around in the car. Mr. George: She is only twenty-three years old and coming back into her old community and having this hard luck it is hard for her to start anew. Mr. Gaines: He has never worked for himself but has always been bossed. Mr. George: The fact that she is acquainted and is known I think will get him to the point where he will understand the farm. Miss Rokahr: A good point. The fact that she has been brought up in this neighborhood and with her background, you might be able to reach him and gradually get her to take part in the activities with others besides her relatives. I thought if there was a night school in this community it would be a good thing for Mr. Fisher to attend this school. I am also interested in the house and surroundings. Do you think they might try to fix it up and make the surroundings a little better? Mrs. Watson: Yes, if they would just do it, in time they could fix up the house. Mr. Hoag: I am convinced that Mr. Fisher is not the type of man at this age that would go to night school or read many farm papers or farm bulletins. He is more of the moron type. I would rather be Mr. Taylor and the fellow behind him with his wife and two boyB and try to send the boys to school than Mr. Fisher. Mrs. Watson: I feel that if the right person got ahold of Mr. Fisher he would make a good man out of him. Miss Rokahr: It may have been at the time that he did not care to go beyond the eighth grade. There is nothing to lead us to be - lieve that his background would cause him to be the easy-going type. How about the rest of you not agreeing with Mr. Hoag? Mr. George: I think there is hope for the family in that they have new responsibilities. They have a six months old baby which gives them a different outlook on life. They are getting down on </seg>
            <seg id="p358">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the rocks and that may be the making of them. They are young and have no ways in which they are set, from which they cannot be changed. They are willing and have awakened to the fact that they have to get down to brass tacks and get to work. They will have to stop driving around the country so much. That is probably the last bad habit they have to break. Miss Rokahr: Yes, besides cleaning up around the place and re - pairing it. Miss Norris: It may help him in knowing that his father was sort of a leader. Miss Rokahr:' The organization you would have him join would be the Farm Bureau. Could he make use of the schools and other sources in the community? Mr. Gaines: They need community organizations where such questions will be discussed that will concern them and help them solve their problems, with which they are not familiar. They need to he allowed to think. It seems that if you can get people to think, they will get themselves out of that lackadaisical feeling that they have toward things. The community in ganeral should help this family. Miss Rokahr: I especially like that idea of exchanging work with neighbors. If the Fishers can see demonstrated what good farming and good homemaking is, they would carry some of those ideas to their own home. We would like to turn the discussion now over to you people. What would you' like to tell the Taylor family to do? We would like to have yourJ ideas added to those we have suggested. Discussion I would like to defend Mrs. Taylor. She has seen better times and now has given up more than her husband. She has given up the telephone, the radio, and other things that would make her house attractive; she would like to go to those project meetings but cannot go very well just now because of the lack of telephone and no car be - cause they are driving their car only once a week and the husband probably drove it to town. She cannot get in contact with her neigh - bors and I think she is gloomy because she does not have enough con - tact with the outside world. If she can just get out to these project meetings. She is willing to get out and do the chores in order to for - ward the boys and to make them worth while. Miss Rokahr: You think she should have the telephone and there - fore get more of the contacts? She should not miss the group meetings if she has two boys in </seg>
            <seg id="p359">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION school to carry the information for her. I think she is doing more in her way than he is. She is baking bread, canning, and keeping the family. She is keeping it up Just as well as she can. Her husband is not doing his share. They should have more chickens. The men should have more livestock. Get the boys to work in a partnership some way to make them feel that they are helping — they should take up some club work or something of that kind where they might be able to pay for that gymnasium ex - pense or other things like that which they might have to give up. I am not a promotor for the telephone but I believe that the morale of the woman has gone down because they have not had the conveni - ences they have had in the past few years. A friend of mine was without a telephone for a year. When one of her sons came home for Christmas he paid up their telephone for a year as her Christmas gift. She felt as if she were coming back to civilization again. My suggestion would be "Go West, Young Man." If these people would come into our barren country they will find that they can own land for what it costs to rent land and they will find that beautiful thing — equality — which will take the creases from the brow of the farm people. If they read The Nebraska Farmer, they will find that they can get B batteries for J1.75 and four of them will last a year. If some of them will become acquainted with these Nebraska papers they will find that they can get the views of others. You farmers know that getting the viewpoints of others sometimes helps a whole lot. I believe that the morale of a great many of the people has come down because they do not" have the conveniences they have had in the past few years. I think that this case of the Taylor family is a fine chance to get acquainted with each other in the home. Let the boys make popcorn balls or do anything that they feel they are able to afford. They will come out in fine shape. She may be better off than some of her neighbors of she were to know about their troubles. Miss,Rokahr: The point of a family recreation is a good one. I do not want you to forget that she has a husband and two sons. She is the only woman in the bunch, and I sympathize with Mrs. Taylor. I am in sympathy with Mr. Taylor. My husband is not here so I </seg>
            <seg id="p360">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE am sate in saying that. I teel that if he were here he would be in favor with Mrs. Taylor. It seems to me that Mr. Taylor has not had any cooperation from his family. She only has five cows to milk and sixty chickens to raise. He also had the house fixed up and we know when we pass a farm and see a nice big barn and a small house that the next improvement will be a nice big home. Mr. Taylor is to blame that there were no more cows. He did not let Mrs. Taylor know how things were going. They should have seen that things were not as prosperous during the last ten years and they should have lived ac - cording to their means. If there would be more cooperation in the wife and children working together, they would all come out on top. Even if there are no boys in the family, the girls can put on their overalls and get out and plow corn and milk the cows and still be well thought of in the neighborhood. I fell sorry for Mr. Taylor. I feel sorry for Mrs. Taylor. She has lost all her courage while she was ironing shirts. If they would send those shirts to the laundry ;i few times I think she would be cheerful and happy. Do you not think that the Taylor family have put too much em - phasis on the physical side? Nothing has been said about the inner resources. They were so conrerned with the material things that we have failed to realize that there is a development within ourselves which should be brought out. I think there is a splendid opportunity for these children to develop something that will take the place of material things. If the telephone is necessary, they should have it. If Mr. and Mrs. Taylor would have made up their mind to improve the farm, where would they get the money to Ret the seed? They will have to change their plans. If they are going to keep on Improving the farm, they will have to have seed and other things to do that; Mr. George: They could probably get it from the landlord, or otherwise increase their livestock and get income, and then buy their seed. If they do not have the money and cannot get the money, how can they get the seed? One cannot get the money from the banker. Some of the neighbors right around us want to do those things, but they have not the money to buy the seed. Get Federal seed loans. i . ... Could you tell us how to get them? </seg>
            <seg id="p361">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Take it up with some of the Extension people after the meeting. What is the attitude of the boy growing up in this depression time? There is a star in this family. The boy is going to school and he will drop his athletics and is willing to work; but he has an irritable mother and a discouraged father, and I think he is showing a line start. Neither one of them are to blame. It is a situation that has grown up: It is a family thing that has to be worked out, and it is not an easy thing to do. Now if ."Miss Brown will give us a summary of the dis - cussion, we will appreciate it. Miss Mary-Ellen Brpwn: This has been an interesting discussion and in the brief time we have, there will not be time to give an adequate review of it. So we will emphasize some of the important points which have been suggested. The Taylor Family. The discussion was opened by a question about whether the Taylor family kept accounts or not. The suggestion was made that they keep home and farm accounts and make an inventory of what they have left. Such an inventory might help them to realize that although they had lost their farm, they have shelter and an opportunity to produce crops and food. They probably have equipment, machinery and horses, also a cellar full of food to help them proceed. They might be surprised to find bow much they really have left. They still have some opportunity for recreation and they have health. They can be grateful that they do not have doctor bills to pay. To be able to appreciate health is a big asset. The suggestion was made for them also to keep special enterprise accounts, such as dairying or poultry raising, so that they could definitely kliow whether or not they were making money. Accurate accounts will help them find out where their leaks are. Probably too much energy had been spent on raising corn and wheat now that the prices for these are low. Cost accounts will help them to know which enterprises to drop and which to increase. They should give careful consideration to whether or not to keep the radio and the telephone. It would pay them to make a study of marketing. Another advantage in keeping farm accounts would be to help in making future plans with the landlord, and they would also be helpful in keeping a cooperative spirit in the family if each one is given a share in making the future plans. Mr. Taylor would lose one ol his biggest </seg>

Mrs. Taylor has a right to help with the planning and the boys need the training that can come out of it. They need to learn to carry responsibilities. Perhaps they could carry some project by which they could make money enough to keep up the radio. In some fam - ilies boys raise popcorn or sweet potatoes and market them. Possibly a battery man would be willing to take his pay in eggs, poultry, or butter. Mrs. Taylor is to be commended for the fine garden that is raised and for the canning and preserving she does, also for her bread baking and her soap making. Another helpful thing which she does is to attend the Extension Project Club meetings in her community. This keeps her in touch with the better ideas in homemaking. Although the linoleum is worn and the curtains are getting old she should con - tinue in the club work. Mrs. Taylor's mental attitude does not seem to be as cheerful as that of Mr. Taylor. He seems to be glad he is able to hold the family together. He has reached the place where he is looking ahead and not back into the past. ' In situations like this there is great need for mutual understandings between all members of the family. Their mental attitude is most Important and if each feels he or she is a partner on the job and all talk things over together, they will work themselves out of the situa - tion and the future may be a good one for all of them. They still can enjoy reading as a family group for they may secure books from the school library and from neighbors even though they cannot buy new ones. The help the Taylor family receives from the community may also mean much to them. If the community makes them feel they are still worth as much to the neighborhood as they were before the farm was lost, it will be a help to them. The Taylors can continue their activities in the church and in the recreations of the community even though they cannot help in a financial way as much as formerly. The Taylors need to keep up their outside contacts and a telephone would help to do this, even though they do learn to make the best of their present condition and do the best they can with what they have on hand. There is still much to look forward to as they are now situated. The Fisher Family. You will remember the Fishers were younger people. They seem to be interested and willing to learn. Living among relatives may be an asset or it may make conditions harder for them. We hope rel - atives will be helpful. They need encouragement from others as well as from the relatives. This is a "family where the community may be </seg>
            <seg id="p363">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION of help if they will find them and take special interest in this fam - ily. The women of the neighborhood could invite Mrs. Fisher to their project club meetings. They could even stop for her and take her to their meetings. Mrs. Fisher could be put on committees before long and in that way she would become better acquainted. Both Mr. and Mrs. Fisher need to take part in the recreations of the community. Mr. Fisher might become interested in a night school and it would help him to join the County Farm Bureau and to become acquainted with the County Agent. He could exchange work with neighbors and In that way learn some of the better practices followed in the county. The mental attitude in both families is especially important for with a good outlook on life one can overcome difficulties and have joy and satisfaction in living. As you go back to your communities, find the Taylor families and the Fisher families among your neighbors and be the good neighbor to them. LEGISLATION THAT AFFECTS US MRS. JAMES LEE SELLERS I am interested in the League of Women Voters. My interest in legislation was first aroused when as a young girl just out of college at the beginning of the "World War I was sent to New York City and entered Bellevue Hospital, thinking to go across soon. I was in the surgical ward for children one morning at seven o'clock when a child came up and held out his hands. The fingers were all drawn under and I could not straighten them out. When I looked up the history of the child I found that the mother was a widow and had to work ten hours a day. She left the child in the care of a day nursery. This child had no breakfast before being taken to the nursery and he would ask for bread. The woman in charge became so aggravated that she took him into the kitchen and laid his hands on the burners. The surgeon operated on his hands and was able to relieve the muscles. My reaction to this was that there must be some law to prevent such things from happening. Surely New York state should license day nurseries. This created my interest in legislation. This is a legislative year. During this month the legislatures of forty-three states will convene. And it is safe to say that at no period since the ratification of the nineteenth amendment, which gave the right of vote to women, has there been a keener interest in the leg - islation that is to be proposed, discussed, accepted or rejected by these law-making bodies. This fact is, of course, due to the "times" — the unprecedented condition in which the United States finds herself today. There is no doubt that along with the bad effects of the depression — and there are many — that one or two salutary results have developed. </seg>
            <seg id="p364">REPORT OF NEBRASKA S1ATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE One Is the aroused and intense interest of the voters at large in the affairs of government. Both the national congress and the state legislatures from nec - essity will spend the major portion of their time on financial problems. We, the voters of the country have asked that our taxes he reduced, and that the expenditures of the local, state, and national govern - ments be materially lowered. That presents a very difficult problem to the law-makers, since reduction of taxes means curtailment in ser - vices rendered by these agencies. I recommend to you as a source of information on this intricate and difficult problem, "The University of Nebraska Tax Primer" which is being published by the Agricultural Experiment Station here at the College of Agriculture. Dr. (!. O. Virtue of the Economics Department of the University is editor of the twelve chapters which constitute an excellent discussion of the whole problem of taxation. This Tax Primer will answer for you such questions as the- efficiency of different rev - enue measures, the sources of state and federal income, the reduction of taxes and the expenditures of various governmental agencies. Today, with the limited time at my disposal, I shall choose to discuss certain items of proposed legislation that will affect us most closely — all legislation affects us directly or indirectly — but there are a few items that are of particular interest to women. It is possible that the Child Labor amendment will again come up in the Nebraska legislature for ratification. This amendment was passed by the National Congress in 1924 to give the federal govern-' ment power to regulate and control child labor. It is now before the states for ratification. By July, 1932, the legislatures of six states had voted their accept - ance of the amendment, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Montana, and Wisconsin. Favorable action of three-fourth of the states is needed to secure adoption of the amendment so that Congress may extend ade - quate protection to working children. Unfortunately, due to the lobby - ing sponsored by manufacturers' associations, interested in maintaining the present inadequate laws that regulate child labor, many legislators as well as individuals have received false ideas about such an amend - ment. One example is that Congress would — if the amendment were adopted — pass a law prohibiting farm children from doing chores, milking cows, etc. This is absurd. No state, and several have con - siderable legislation about the employment of children, has ever passed such a measure. That was the argument of the capitalist who wished to exploit child labor in his factory or sweat shop. Today when there are thousands of unemployed adults willing to work, it seems in - excusable for an employer to secure the services of a young child who </seg>
            <seg id="p365">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION may bo exposed to the hazards of industry, who may be kept out 01 school, may be led into the paths of delinquency and crime or who may die a premature death from disease contracted while working under adverse conditions. There is .mother amendment which the state legislature will doubt - less ratify. The Lime Duck Amendment championed by Senator Norris for ten years or more — adopted in the last session of Congress and already r;itified by seventeen states legislatures. The Lame Duck amendment provides (1) that the term of office of the members of Congress shall begin in January, (2) Congress shall meet once each year and this meeting shall begin in January, (3) the term of office of the president shall begin in January, (4) provides for the rule of succession to office in case the president has not been chosen by the House of Representatives before January. There has been so much said on this item that I shall proceed to other legislation bills less familiar to you. Probably some of you will remember the ten-day marriape bill that was passed in Nebraska in 1923 and repealed in the next session of the legislature. Since that time several states have passed a wait - ing marriage law, until now some twenty states in all have adopted this legislation. Last year two of Nebraska's neighboring states- Iowa and Colorado — passed such laws, and a nearby state, Minnesota, did likewise. Nebraska is urged to consider such a law again so that legislation concerning the issuance of marriage license may be uniform in this section of the United States. This five-day marriage law calls for a wait of five days before couples can marry after they have applied for a marriage license. Quoting from a judge in Seattle, "Our present system of marriage licensing allows young people to get license to marry, and to enter into the most solemn and far-reaching compact known to law with greater ease and loss concern on the part of the authorities than an applicant for a barber's license or the operator of a pool hall can secure his right to do business.'' The publication of the Ohio League of Women Voters made a survey of this law and found that opposition to it came chiefly from county clerks, justices of the peace, some min - isters, florists, and jewelers. It is widely conceded in states which have such a law that a much smaller proportion of elopments, midnight marriage ceremonies, joy ride solemnizations and annulment petitions have been reported after the adoption of such a measure. It is a much needed safeguard against the too frequent marriage of minors. Since our neighboring states have passed or are considering such leg - islation, the objection formerly brought against the hill cannot exist — simply that couples went to adjoining states to secure their license. Also the new bill will probably shorten the waiting period from ten </seg>
            <seg id="p366">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE uttjo to five days which has been proved in most states to be satis - factory. Another piece of legislation in which we are interested is a bill proposing jury service for women. At present twenty-one states and the District of Columbia provide for the service of women on juries. All these states do not have similar laws. In nine status the. service is compulsory for women, just as it is for men (California, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin). In two states special exemptions relating only to women exist, i.e., in Iowa (registered nurses), in Maine nurses are exempt. In ten states the service is permissive for women (Arkansas, Dela - ware, Kansas, Louisiana, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, and Washington). Why should women serve on juries? During the last year of his life Chief Justice Taft spoke before the National Conference on the Reduction of Crime and proposed as a method of bettering the legal machinery for the prosecution of crime, "A further examination of the methods by which jurors are selected *o that jurors of weak intelli - gence, of little experience, and subject to emotions easily aroused may be eliminated." He said, "Exemptions from jury service ought to be cut down and society ought to be able to secure a jury that approaches the issues with a sense of its obligation to enforce the law." 1 1 ) You can readily see from the above remarks that laws providing for jury service for women will be an asset to judicial procedure in that they will supply both greater quantity of material from which to draw and In many instances better quality. (2) In the second plare. having women on the jury will make for surer justice to all parties concerned. This is true for the simple reason that a decision reached by the com - bined consideration of both men and women is sounder than is the decision of one sex alone. (3) Thirdly, there is the question of educa - tive women in public affairs. Women have had the franchise Lor a short period of time and need to become better informed. The only place the everyday women citizen fits into the judicial system is the jury. Prom the jury box she will learn much that will make her more conscious of her responsibility as a citizen. (4) Moreover, there is a social aspect to the question. The chief objection to women serving as jurors is to the effect that there are cases not "fit" for a woman to hear. People stating this objection seem always to have in mind cases of sex offenses. Undoubtedly the evidence is sometimes un - pleasant and revolting. But such a trial concerns other persons more vitally than it does the jurors and one of these persons principally in - volved is always a woman or a girl. Surely this fact in itself proves why there should be women on a jury — no matter what may be the evidence — to reach a verdict fair to the parties concerned and to the community. Personally, I believe jury service is a duty that everyone </seg>
            <seg id="p367">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION ■who has the francise should perform. Is there any logical reason why one sex should be compelled to serve as jurors and the other sex allowed to exercise a choice iu the matter? Some states add a few exemptions to the list — nurses, women nursing sick members of their own families, mothers with small children. With some such provisions as these — -there seems to be no practical justification for any kind of a woman juror law except a compulsory one. As I indicated a few minutes before, we are requesting that our legislature, make a marked reduction in taxes. We know that means that our governmental expenditures must be reduced in proportion to our income. What activities carried on by our state and local units o£ government are we willing to curtail? There are several functions of our governments that have an especial and direct influence on our families — one of these is education, another is public welfare. Arthur B. Moehlman, editor of "The Nation's Schools" says in regard to re - duced appropriations for educational purposes, "In prosperity every - one takes the schools for granted — in depression, public education from kindergarten through our state universities becomes a national target for every amateur and potential office holder who has a patent remedy for furnishing public service without expense. Whatever our individual opinions may be respecting the relative effectiveness of our great public school system we cannot overlook the fact that public education is one of the major functions of a demo - cratic social order and most essential to its maintenance. It is also peculiar in so far as it continues without our power to arrest it. Chil - dren are born and grow regardless of prosperity or depression. They can only have their chance now. We cannot arrest their development for a few years until we have again attained our economic balance. Roads may wait but not the children." . Children of today are the future citizens of tomorrow who will have the direction of public af - fairs in a few years. Let us not economize ill-advisedly so as to crip - ple their intellectual, physical and moral development. I have no way of knowing what legislation may be proposed in regard to education in Nebraska. I do feel that as mothers and interested voters we should examine carefully such proposed legislation and speak freely upon the subject to our legislative representatives. The last subject I wish to bring to your attention is that of child welfare. In the State Department of Public Welfare there is a Bu - reau of Child Welfare which should command the attention and inter - est of all of us. This Bureau of Child Welfare is attempting to act as a unifying agency through which the state may cooperate with in - dividuals and organizations among all classes of peoples on matters relative to child welfare. Its scope Is broad enough to include all phases of child welfare activity. The personnel of this bureau con- </seg>
            <seg id="p368">KEPOUT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE sists of a director, two field workers and one stenographer and its state appropriation is a very meager one. With these few workers the Bureau is supposed to cover our large state of ninety-three coun - ties in order to cooperate with juvenile judges, county attorneys, so - cial workers, public health nurses and all other individuals or agencies engaged in welfare work that concerns problems relating to de - pendent, delinquent and handicapped children. N'ot only does the bureau handle a large amount of case work, but it has specific duties that by law are required of it. It licenses and respects child-placing agencies operating In the state and receives from them monthly re - ports of placements. It is in charge of licensing and inspecting ma - ternity homes and hospitals — one hundred fifty-nine located in sixty - four counties. The bureau makes surveys, holds county welfare con - ferences, encourages communities in their great task of caring for the unemployed. In brief, it is the only state unit that considers purely social welfare matters. The appropriations of this bureau certainly should not be reduced — in fact, its appropriation should be increased so that trained social workers could be employed to do this very dif - ficult and highly specialized work, and so tliut the Increasing prob - lems developing constantly from the present economic condition of the state could be more wisely handled. Some welfare problems that have come to liuM during the past year in Nebraska can be more easily handled if our legislature will pass laws concerning them. For example a law should be passed defining what constitutes legal residence. Counties already overburdened with demands for aid are reluctant to give financial assistance to a new family that has settled within its boundaries. Another law very much needed should state that the right to solicit public funds should be controlled by slate license. It has been brought to the attention of welfare workers that individuals profess - ing to represent various charitable institutions have solicited and ob - tained considerable sums of money in Nebraska which they have kept for personal gain. With a law requiring a license for such solicita - tion, fraudulent practices could be controlled. As a closing thought I should like to quote an observation made by the National Chairman of Child Welfare in the League of Women Voters who said, "Child Welfare depends upon the wisdom of our laws and the efficiency of their administration. It depends also upon the character of public institutions and government departments concern - ed with the protection and care of children. The quality of service reflects the interest and intelligence of the voter and is an indication of the extent of his participation in public affairs." </seg>
            <seg id="p369">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION CERES CLUB TEA Ceres Club is the local branch of the national organization of wo - men connected with Agricultural Colleges. In order to meet and visit with more of the homemakers who come from various parts of the state to attend Organized Agriculture meetings, the Ceres Club meeting regularly held in January was planned as an informal tea at the Home Economics parlors invited as guests all women attending the Home Economics section. Members of the Ceres Club serving as hostesses for that meeting were: Mrs. Clayton Watkins, Chairman, Mrs. C. C. Mintoer, Mrs. M, A. Alexander, Mrs. C. E. Rosenquist, Mrs. \V. W. Yocum, Mrs. C. W. Smith, Miss Matilda Peters and Miss Bess Steele. The many Nebraska homemakers who could not be present for the meetings of Organized Agriculture were given an opportunity to hear Mrs. Clara Ingram Judson over the radio Wednesday morning. Her talk given at that time is as follows: ARE YOU TIRED OF YOURSELF? MRS. CLARA INGRAM JUDSON It is a great pleasure to me to be speaking to you homemakers of Nebraska. I well recall the happy time 1 enjoyed here five years ago and I have been looking forward for months to coming again. Your beautiful state, your line people, your excellent institutions, and most of all, your homes, make this one of the important places in the Union. In a few minutes I shall be meeting the homemakers assembled in conference here at the University. But before I meet them, I am so glad to have the opportunity to say good morning to you who are not present. We wish you were here: we are missing you. The week would be better with you here. But I realize that you are not staying home from choice but because home-staying is, in your case, the better part — you are needed every hour — or, for some good reason or other, you can - not be here and we must do without you. We're glad we can say "Good-morning!" over the air. Now, of course, home is a lovely place to stay. But there is some - thing about mid-winter that sometimes shows up a homemaker, to say nothing of her home, at its very worst. There are so many dark days when it doesn't seem worthwhile to burn lights to see to clean; then all of a sudden, a bright day will come along and heavens! the dirt! The curtains are grimy, the windows none too bright, the rugs are not what they used to be and the stair carpet is beyond words. Everything that on a dark day isn't noticeable shrieks at you till you can't forget it. Buttons are off, stockings need mending and there is a pile of </seg>
            <seg id="p370">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE suirts to patch that will furnish uninteresting labor for many an hour. No need to prolong the agony by telling you more about it — you all know the mood I 1 mean — ask any homemaker! Of course the real trouble is not with the stair carpet or the win - dows — it is with ourselves. That carpet was worn out last summer — and it didn't matter. The windows and curtains are only a bit more grimy than a month ago and you didn't worry about them then — the real trouble is with ourselves — we're tired to death of US! Now if we could only go away! Where would you like to go — to a sunny clime where you wouldn't have fires to keep; to a lovely hotel where meals just appeared; to a desert island, perhaps, where there wasn't a person to ask you to do anything! While we are imagining we might as well do a good job of it and pretend that we had new clothes — lovely impractical ones — and new luggage and went oil and stayed until we wanted to come back. Sounds wonderful, doesn't it? But there's a catch to it some where — I knew there was going to be! All those new clothes I imagine getting would have to be worn — by me. The only company I'd have to frolic with — would be me.' And the person I'm most tire of — is me. I don't know how you are, but I'm just sick of myself sometimes! Now of course it is fun to fancy a trip (and naturally it's fun to take one) but when you come right down to it, you realize suddenly that our trouble is not geographical, but very, very personal. Instead of changing the setting — at great trouble and expense — couldn't we change ourselves? Did you over try it? What sort of person are you, anyway? Most of us liomemakers rather fancy ourselves — if the truth must be told — as nice people. We are conscientious, painstaking, devoted and faithful and I must con - fess that it is probably a pretty good thing for everyone that we are. But the thing can be overdone. Truly it can. Suppose we stage a grand flop and see what happens — it is just possible that the world will not come to an end over night. Suppose you've been working day and night — so to speak — cooking for your family and cleaning and sewing. Well, stop it for two days; exactly two days. Feed them from a can (or let them feed themselves) and forget the dirt. And don't apologize — that completely spoils the fun. Just let it happen and say nothing. You say you couldn't do that? My goodness but you do need a change! And a little injection of moral courage, too. Now of course we might as well admit right here that you may find your kitchen in a mess at the end of two days and you may have to houseclean but if you have stuck to your resolu - tion, you'll feel like a new woman, and anyhow, I always did think </seg>
            <seg id="p371">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION that a real muss was more fun to clean than any little day-to-day affair. Take your two days and do somthing different. If you want to stay in bed — stay there and don't let anything short of the house burning down get you out. If you want to gad about, go. Do some - thing—I don't care what — that you want to do and think you can't. I sometimes go to the Aquarium in Chicago when I get too tired of myself. The fish seem so comfortable and happy; they don't even know of such a thing as a depression. They get their living just by being fish. There ought to be a moral to that somewhere. And I haven't the slightest desire to be a fish; I'd much rather be a human with all my troubles, and that's a great comfort to me. Do something out of your usual round and do it hard. Even though it wears you out, you'll be glad — afterwards. If you are one of the women who work hard at organizations and such, stay at home for your change. Clean closets and mend stock - ings and tidy drawers. Have a cup of tea at four o'clock and loaf a while. Even though you live all by yourself, stay at home all day and see what home is like. "Write letters — your friends may be surprised to hear from you but they will be pleased, too, and letters are lots of fun to write, only be sure you put something agreeable in them, not just troubles. You might even change children for a day. You keep house for your best friend and she for you; it's loads of fun and you'll be sur - prised to find how charming your own family is after you spent a whole day with another. Change your house about a bit. There seems nothing to be done about a worn stair carpet except paint the holes with dye (I do that and it works wonderfully) but you can change the arrangement of furniture, use different dishes and menus. Give your pet bird to a neighbor for a day, maybe she wishes she had one, who knows? And above all, stop thinking you have to do things and, for two whole days, think of what you'd like to do — and do that. It you've decided to vacation at home, see that the house is well-aired and that you take an hour's out-of-door exercise each day. Nothing makes Homemaker Blues so quickly as stale air and nothing blows away mental cobwebs more quickly than a bit of brisk out-of-door exercise — a run with a sled, a walk to the corner. Don't huddle where it is warm — get out and put your own heat-making machinery to work at top speed. Don't talk or even think about your troubles — you can drop them if you will. Nothing makes a person get to self-pity quicker than continual thinking over and over and over of problems. Drop them, and then, after you are refreshed, look at them with new eyes </seg>
            <seg id="p372">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ana maybe you'll think of some way to solve them. It works lots of times. Think of your dreams — look at the stars — they are up there all the time, only sometimes we get so busy we don't look. And above all, don't feel guilty or selfish. Be different with a zest, with a whole heart. Please yourself and see how you blossom out. You will be a much nicer person with whom to live. I cannot imagine anything more wearing on a family than living day in and day out with a person who is always unselfish, always helpful, always thoughtful, always right. It' we really were that (as we sometimes think we are) it would be a crime. It wouldn't give the family a chance to be unselfish and thoughtful themselves. Let's step out of the spotlight now and then and give the others a chance. They may be surprised; they may have forgotten how, if you have spoiled them. Well, whose fault is that? Don't comment; Don't back down! The change will be good for the family — and marvelous for you! Rest. Beautify yourself. Take a leisurely bath, use cold cream, fuss with your hair; make yourself as easy to look at. as possible. Have some fun and admit to yourself that it is fun and that, you haven't forgotten how to enjoy life. I Then, if you do, you'll suddenly discover that the world isn't so hopeless after all. That you have a few good points yourself, besides being a cook, that you had quite overlooked. You'll enjoy your own company; you'll catch yourself looking at the new hair-do in your mirror and humming a tune as you peel the potatoes for dinner the next day. It will suddenly occur to you that the stair carpets are not so important in the plan of life as people and that will mean that you have re-discovered your sense of humor and with it, your joy in the daily task. Would you change jobs for keeps? Not I; Not you! Homemaking's my favorite business! And yours! My best wishes to you all! WEDNESDAY MOItXIXG MRS. MARSHALL ROSS, Presiding Good morning, friends; the weather man has certainly been kind to us this year. I am sure we are all glad to be here this morning. As project leader of our local club, I took the copy of this program sent to me and passed it around for the members to see. A friend came to me at the meeting and said, "I can not go to the Organized Agriculture meeting this year, but I do want to have you bring back to us full notes on the talk, "The Place of Music in Every Day Life." So I am especially glad to introduce to you this morning the supervisor of music in the Lincoln schools who will bring us this message. Miss Ammon. </seg>
            <seg id="p373">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION THE PLACE OF MUSIC IN EVERY DAY LIFE MISS FERN AMMON A long time ago Confucius said, "When music and courtesy are better understood and appreciated there will be no war." When one first glances at that old quotation from the Chinese he wonders at the connection. Why should courtesy and music be linked together? Because each is something elemental and universal — yet, sometimes we do wonder just how universal the sense of courtesy is. We feel that we have come a long way since that statement was made by Con - fucius, yet we have seen such catastrophies in our own time as the World War and we have had to conclude that we do not know the meaning of rourtesy as nations, especially as Christion nations. Neither do we understand or appreciate it. But, I believe, we do understand and appreciate the fact that music has a universial appeal. Today it seems that the world does need, as it has never before, perhaps, the ministration of music and the healing of art. By art, I do not necessarily mean objects of art, but that search for beauty which compels one to make a corner in the home, a spot in the little garden, or a song sung in a choral group just as beautiful as it can be made. A few years ago we read so much about the dangers of the machine age and the right use of the leisure time which we had. Now we have too much leisure and our whole thought is directed toward mak - ing a living, rather unsuccessfully, too. In an article which I read the author suggested that the causes ot unrest o£ that day were not eco - nomic but spiritual. "What we are witnessing, said he, is the revolt of men who see life passing away without their ever having lived. Man under the present industrial system, an artist given no opportunity for expression, an inventor tied to a fool-proof machine is the vic - tim of a disappointed instinct, subject accordingly to all kinds of nervous and emotional disturbances. It is not personal indulgence but spiritual ideals he is called upon to sacrifice." Now, very suddenly .we do not have the same industrial conditions which we had three years ago, but we do have the same needs as in - dividuals. Now, add to this, a really serious economic condition and we do not wonder at the state of mind of many people today. We must have something which money can not buy. So we must insure a happy future for the grown-up through creative education for the child. And what could offer more in a creative way than participation in the different phases of music. Through an individual's own self - expression he can build up a storehouse which holds for all time for him. Because he has this his mind is steady, and he looks toward the future with assurance. It may be a book which inspires him, a poem </seg>
            <seg id="p374">REPORT OF NEBRASKA, STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I ■which exalts, a piece of music which enters his very soul. These must be his to keep. And so, music is a universal language because it is a potent, yet subtle something which appeals to our emotions and very clearly to our purely aesthetic sense. It goes beyond language. That is the reason why we have an immediate contact with the foreigner in our midst. Supposing a Czech or a Hungarian comes to our shores. He does not know a word of English, but let him hear one of his native songs played for him without even the words' appeal, or let him hear one of his native dances and there is an immediate bond between him and us.. We have just passed the Christmas season, whose music is ever new and beautiful to us. Let us consider the song "Silent Night". It is universal in its appeal, it has completely lost its identity in origin in country. It makes no difference whether it is sung in English or German, it belongs to the whole world. When I find that I am puzzled for a definite answer as to the suc - cess of our music teaching in the schools, I often find that very answer I am hoping to find in the reactions o£ groups o£ children to music. I wish I might take you with me to certain groups and have you experience with me that absolutely lifted-up feeling that conies through observing the reaction of those children to the beautiful in music. That is the interesting thing about it — music does its own teaching. Yet the teacher must feel very deeply herself or how can she ever lead others to feel that same compelling force? I should like to put a question to you which I often put to myself. "Is music merely singing, making up tunes, reading notes, playing the drum, violin, or piano, or is it what happens to us?" Because of that something which happens there is ever a challenge for us who feel the great importance of music as a real force in the life of an individual. Music Is a force, which through its appeal to our sense of the beautiful makes for greater happiness. And it seems to me that any force that contributes that, especially in these days when our minds are neces - sarily so directed toward purely materialistic things, is a great and important one and one with which we want to become more and more acquainted. Then we must seize every opportunity which presents itself for listening to and participating in good muisc. Pasteur, one of the greatest scientist of all times, said, "That man is happy who has within himself fine ideals and lives according to their dictates, ideals of knowledge, ideas of beauty, ideals of patriot - ism, ideals of virtue." Do you suppose it was just a mere accident of speech -which caused Pasteur to include the sense of beauty in his analysis of happiness? I think not. </seg>
            <seg id="p375">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION What is music? At one time perhaps I would have answered that very definitely but the more I think about it and the more experi - ence I have in it, the more mysterious music seems to me. Someone has said it is a voice from the unseen, it is a voice from the infinite, it is a voice from the deepest depths of the human soul. And when we have said that we have yet said nothing that really helps us to answer that simple question. Pope may help us a bit when he sug - gests that "Music the flerces grief can charm," but again that is just one side of music. It represents it as always expressing only joy. Shelley gives another side. "Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought." And so, that seems to take music into the very holy of holies because it stamps it as our helper in all of our struggles of thought. Yet with all this, you see we have not defined music. So we shall have to let it go. I wonder who could define it. Although we can't define music, there are certain basic elements in it which affect all of us. Some of these are more dominant than others and all vary with different individuals. The recognition of rhythm and its role in the enjoyment of music is a most important factor. Many adults who have never really known music will be stirred by a martial air of a street band and will respond by tapping the foot or swaying the body. (A part of "Stars and Stripes Forever" was played.) Rhythm is the regular recurring pulse which we feel in everything. We have it in our own bodies, in the heart beat; in nature, in the ebb and flow of the tide, in the rising and falling of the waves of grain in a ripe wheat field. Our whole life is just a rhythmic pilgrimage and someone has said that if we allow ourselves to be bored, we are in - terrupting the rhythm of life. We have rhythm in poetry and it is one of the most fundamental forces in music. We all respond un - consciously to the rhythmic pulsation' of certain pieces of music. ("Air de Ballet" — Jadassohn was played.) Going further, in more recently composed music, we feel the strong rhythmic urge. "Juba Dance" from Suite "In the Bottoms" by Nathaniel Dett was played.) Music to be beautiful must also have movement and flow, and out of this, melody has developed. The numbers which I have played for you also have this melodic urge, or they would be like the music of our early ancestors, that is, like some of the primitive Indian music which has very little melodic content. The world is full of many beautiful melodies! And how very much we enjoy following the melodic lines in a song or instrumental piece. The more familiar a melody becomes the more we like it. This ele - ment of familiarity is true of all good music. We like the things we know. We often say, "Popular music is familiar music," and in Italy, opera tunes are popular music. I want you to hear a beautiful melody. ("The Swan" from Carnival of Animals by Sant Saens was played.") </seg>
            <seg id="p376">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I ■.-.■,■ Harmony, the third element in music, which gives us the vertical feeling in music in contrast to the horizontal feeling in melody also has an inherent power to stimulate our thought and attention. With - out understanding its science one still may, ;et an intense enjoyment from the pure beauties of the harmonies prof need by a string quartet, ah orchestra, or a group of voices. So our appreciation of music does come i.o us through the senses, and we have a feeling for these three elements which I have men - tioned — rhythm, melody and harmony. To|a great extent this type of appreciation is native. A very young child is quieted or excited by music; primitive man responds to it; and no one is ever so highly educated as to depart entirely from its influence. "We find that the emotional ups and downs are responsible for the charm of most poetry and certainly of most beautiful tunes. You know "Annie Laurie," the charm of its lines, the ups and downs, the graceful tune waves. Yet there is also the Intellectual approach which loses much, I feel, if it becomes just that alone; 15y study I feel that this first type of appreciation can be increased and refined. Yet I cannot say that this deeper understanding of musical forms, etc.. necessarily means that you will love music and more, but I do feel that it will make for a richer experience. Another phase of appreciation is that enjoyment which we derive from the associations and images which certain music stimulates. We all know the picture "Mother" painted by Whistler. We consider this portrait of his mother a vastly superior work of art to his portrait of "Carlyle" not because it is painted with greater technical skill, but because it calls up to all ot us tender associations which do not oxist in our minds for Carlyle, even though he was a great Scottish sage. When we hear music each sensitive and imaginative listener will create for himself a similar mood to the mood which the composer had in mind no doubt, but it can never be the identical mood. From this we think of pure music and program music,. Program music is that ■which paints a picture and many musicians disparage all program music. Of course it is a long way from the crude "Hunt in the Black Forest" with its dog cries, hoof-beats, etc., to the beautiful symphonies of Beethoven. Yet some of Beethoven's works are program mvisic. And what about our own MacDowell? (Some MacDowell numbers were played.) Your conception and picture of this music is different from mine because of our different experiences. While it is not so important that we all become profound musicians yet I would not leave you without trying to impress upon you this truth that power in music comes in proportion as we get inside music. So I wish for everyone that he shall have the opportunity to study some </seg>
            <seg id="p377">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION beautiful songs and shall know them thoroughly, that he shall study - some worthy music and shall know it thoroughly. And remember that there is a deep appreciation that comes through participation in an art. So let us sing and learn to play an instrument. I have not mentioned the radio. It is not all good, it is not all bad; therefore it is up to us to develop a power of discrimination and choose what is best. Neither can we pass by the popularity of jazz music. Jazz is a materialistic view of music and I prefer to stand for the idealistic because it does so much more for me. I have heard so much discussion about the necessity of providing a definite program for leisure. I have felt that that is not so im - portant. Everything comes from within ourselves. I wish that people could only appreciate that in these trying days. If I have something worth while in my own self, I shall pass my hours of leisure in a worth while way and I also think it is possible for us to build a very worth while experience which will be more important to our happi - ness than any other thing. It makes no difference where we live or what our circumstances are. If it is true that the way we meet life comes from within our - selves, then we must give music an important place in our everyday lives, because it is a fine leaven which no one should miss. I have always noticed that we have an opportunity to listen to Mr. Brokaw we are all satisfied to listen because he always has something worth while. At this time Mr. Brokaw has charge of the next period which is the recognition of County Chairmen and I am glad to in - troduce Mr. Brokaw. RECOGNITION OP COUNTY CHAIRMEN Director W. H. Brokaw Friends. I rather hesitate to talk to you folks; as your chairman has already said, I am becoming a perennial on your program. Of course the word perennial does not mean annual so I am inclined to use it on this occasion. I like perennials as well as annuals as far as that is concerned and might even talk flowers to you folks. That is one of the subjects I would like to talk to you about some time. In speaking to you of leadership it seems to me that in the last few years I have said all that is possible for anyone to say. In spite of that fact, not all of the things related to leadership and its value to our community, state, or nation have been said. The job will never be finished. There is still much to be done, far more than we shall ever accomplish. This old world of ours would lose ist zest and punch for us if we knew we would complete the job this year in any one given </seg>
            <seg id="p378">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE line. That is our big salvation. I think as leaders, and practically all of you have been leaders in your own particular line of work, realize the value of striving to attain a goal that is never reached. Improve - ment and satisfaction come from the desire for success. A goal never attained will always lure us on in an attempt to attain our ideals. I have been rather at a loss to know what to talk to you about. After going home from the Master Farmer banquet last night I picked up a little magazine and I saw there an article, old in a sense and yet it is ever new. It was "New Year and New Year's Resolutions". Since it appealed to me, I want to bring it to you. There were three illus - trations given and you will gather their significance. The first, in the frozen regions in the north in one of the snow huts, a man was interviewing an Eskimo. He asked the Eskimo this ques - tion, "What would you think if you left your huts behind and went out across the ice and finally reached the place where the ice floes were broken and there seemed to be only openwater behind you?" He said, "I don't know. I will just let you do the thinking." In a club car on a Pullman train two men were talking. One said business was just going fine. The other asked the banker, "Don't you believe that I should sell those stocks?" The banker said, "All things are going well so I don't see any reason why you should." Another man appearing to be an Easterner was asked an important national question. His answer was, "I don't know about that, but Senator Borah thinks so and so." You get this significance of it. I think as a New Year's resolution it is rather fitting to resolve that we are going to get the facts about things and do our own thinking. It is one of the biggest things that one can possibly do. The leadership you have been exemplifying is worth while and isn't it better to do this job of leading rather than to look to someone else to do it for you? I am just leaving that with you as one of the things that we should think about. Another thing is tolerance for what the other fellow is thinking. We need not follow him and think just what he thinks. You have reached the stage where we are expecting you to get the worthwhile things and carry them home to your local community. You may feel if you have carried your work through that you have accomplished much; still there is a great deal more for us to do. You have been getting ready for the emergencies that confront us now. I am not going to talk depression because we want to keep that out of our talk this morning. It is the greatest opportunity that has ever come to anyone to be a leader and shoulder the responsibilities of carrying on the work in the community. There is never going to be a </seg>
            <seg id="p379">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION greater need for your leadership than there is now. We are getting ready for two great emergencies. The load may have been heavy in the past, but it is nothing to what it will be in the next few weeks. A smile from you and a cheerful word will do more for the young peo - ple in your local community than it has ever meant before. "We may be weary with the load, but this is certainly the time to look ahead with the idea that we have a definite job — and that is to build up the courage and faith to go on. That is the greatest need of the age to - day and this leadership that we have found has its greatest oppor - tunity . I wish to bring a personal illustration to you. I do not wish to do so to call attention to myself. I am going to ask you to think of the same time in your life that probably far exceeds the thing I am going to bring to you in the illustration of my own life as to how we can go on. There are times when we feel we have given every ounce of energy that we could give. On this occasion I had had a very trying week in the office. I was trying to do a number of things. One was supervising a system of county schools and in addition, to assist my wife in running the farm and the feeding of some lambs on that farm, which is a very trying thing to do. At the end of a very heavy week I felt I should be glad when Saturday night came because they would come for me and I could now go home. It was in the days before we had our Ford. When Saturday came I think it was one of the heaviest days I had had in the office. It seemed to me that I stood on my feet all day answering questions. I just thought I would drop. Along in the afternoon the storm came on and the snow piled higher and higher. I began to realize that no one could come for me. I deter - mined to walk home. I intended to be there because the next day was New Years, so when the time came to close the office I felt sure that I could walk home. Of course walking through the deep snow was difficult. The distance was some eight miles. It seemed impossible to reach there. The snow piled higher and higher. When I arrived home it was to learn among other things that the hired man was ill. I went down to the sheep pens and kept watch over them, only going to the house for a cup of coffee. The vigil did not end until morning. If I were to think over life and tell you of the most pleasing day, it would be that day. The greatest satisfaction that has ever come to me was bringing the lambs safely through that stormy night, and yet two or three times during that night I felt I had come to the end of the road. Why am I telling this to you? I am sure that in your innermost thoughts if you were to think of the thing that means the most to you, it would be when you had overcome some of your greatest ob - stacles whether mental or physical. We are facing just such a sltua- </seg>
            <seg id="p380">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE IiO.YUU OF AGRICULTURE tion. You may be tired of leadership that has been given you, but never has there been such a gigantic task for each and everyone of us as before. What is it? It is simply this. With things strained to the utmost we have kept a stiff upper lip as Americans. We have done nothing tragic because nothing tragic would help us. We have de - termined to carry on. I was surprised last year when some of the trying ordeals came up in which men were cited to do things that were not vital to their own best interests but essential in a nation lixe ours, who were willing to sacrifice selfish interests and exemplify the true American spirit. I think we have the greatest blessing: and a great deal of it has come from the leadership that has been built during the last few years. We have learned to think for ourselves when an opportunity has come for us to follow mob spirit. We have just stopped and calmly thought of our responsibilities and then have carried on, and measured up to the high ideals of American citizenship. That i* the thing for which I am particularly thankful. The group that meets here- on this particular morning each year is an inspiration for me and that is why I come. I have said all of the things possible for anyone to say but I wish to read a little poem by Edgar Guest that is a tribute to your achievements. Achievement. I think no trouble ever cam? my way But what it left a joy for every ache. When I against despair resistance make And strive to hold the dreaded foe at bay, Whatever be the outcome of the clay. Always a sense of pride I seem to take. Prom holding fast against the winds that shake, And braving the conclusion, come what may. Men find small pride in pleasure. Out of care Danger and doubt and hazard heroes rise; Men, after all, life's tasks are glad to share. The brightest smiles are those which follow sighs. Man's greatest glory, and I think 'tis God's Is having gained a victory 'gainst the odds. — Edgar A. Guest If I were to dedicate a poem to you as leaders in Home Economics work this year it would be the one just read. I want you to remember that in speaking of man's greatest glory, that I am thinking of it in the broader sense and that is woman's greatest glory in having won </seg>
            <seg id="p381">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION against the odds. May I ask the 1933 County Chairmen to come forward and stand at the left of the platform as I read the names. A pin is presented to eacli of you just as a little appreciation of your leadership. It exempli - fies some of • your responsibilities and achievements. The leaders who are to receive the pins are Mrs. Charles Crosier of Adams County; Mrs. Maude Staples of Antelope County; Mrs. Marshall Ross of Buffalo County; Mrs. Roy Hoyt of Clay County; Mrs. Clay Wallace of Dawson County; Mrs. Frank Hogg of Hamilton County; Mrs. William Schacht of Johnson County; Mrs. Henry George of Lin - coln County; Mrs. Floyd Copple of Nance County; Mrs. Charles Dor - man of Otoe County; Mrs. Ellis Price of Perkins County; Mrs. L. C. Longnecker of Red Willow County; Mrs. Etta West of Saunders County; Mrs. Dean Randall of Scotts Bluff County; and Mrs. C. O. Bishop of Seward County. The Charge to Leaders. Your friends and neighbors have chosen you county chairmen of homo demonstration project work. They believe you to possess that ability to serve and that spirit of self-sacrifice, so necessary for suc - cessful leadership. ', By this choice there devolves upon you that duty of inspiring your fellow workers with a loyalty to service and a desire for achievement of those things in homemaking and home life that are necessary for better agriculture and more complete living on Nebraska farms. Your selection was an honor and privilege, but it also implied duties to perform and obligations to fill. Your regular duties have not prevented your meeting these tasks and we recognize that only busy people are successful leaders. By a faithful performance of your duties, you have inspired a confidence in you^and a friendship for you that can only be secured by having been a friend to others and by a faithful performance of ob - ligations assumed. One is not worthily a leader who is not doing all in her power to enlighten her community in becoming, in so far as humanly possibile, an example of right living and service to others. While the work you have done and the goals achieved are highly commendable, you have but entered into this field of leadership so essential to Agricultures welfare and to national progress. Others may assume in the coming years your tasks of the present, but leader - ship accomplishments imply growth of the individual and point the way to broader fields. Do not misunderstand; no field, appearing to many a higher field or greater accomplishment, is more essential than the one you are filling now. </seg>
            <seg id="p382">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Your community, your county, your state, the nation, are observing the character of your service. They will expect much of you in this we are sure they will not be disapppointed for into the hearts of all humans there has been implanted, and it depends only upon proper cultivation of growth, that desire for leadership so essential to an occupation such as ours and to the welfare of a Christian nation. It may seem to you that the welfare of those in the community, state, and nation devolves upon you as leaders. I do not believe that you recognize as clearly as you should, how true this is, and that the welfare of the people of your day, your folks, and these others who have cooperated with you in your community and the nation are de - pending upon your leadership. You will be called upon, no doubt, throughout the coming months to give further of your efforts in pro - moting things that are essential to your community. It is only by these accomplishments and by the records that go to our national capitol which continue and improve the work that you are doing. The whole work depends upon. your leadership which has meant far more than you can possibly realize. It is a pleasure to pre - sent to you this pin in recognition of your services. I was ;isked last night if there was a diamond in the pin which you are to receive. Yes, there is, but it can be discerned by the ones who can see the lead - ership behind it. There are a, lot of people who can't see it, but there are others who do. So when you wear that pin, it will mean more, because this morning I can see a diamond much larger than the pin. It comes from the heart of those who have unselfishly given to others the thing that means far more than any diamond . Mrs. Ross: I certainly do wish to thank you. Director Brokaw, for your part in this program. A Get-Together luncheon for present and past County Project. Chairmen was held in the Home Economics Building.

            <seg id="p386">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE THE HOME JIANAGER MRS. CLARA INGRAM JUDSON Homemaking is a business of major importance. This is no senti - mental assertion but a plain business fact. Homemaking uses about 90% of the ultimate products, it administers the greater portion of the nation's wealth and it produces the country's most important product — people, citizens. Of this great business, you and I, as homemakers, are the man - agers. If that does not seem such an important business, perhaps it is because you have forgotten to add us all together. My little pocketbook and market basket is not very important, to be sure. But your little pocketbook and basket added to mine— that is another matter. And all our purses and baskets together make a tremendous business. And you and I are each of us managers of our particular branch office of the whole big business. That is a job to need serious thought! &gt; Now we often tell each other that homemaking is a "job" but when we do, we are not usually using the word in the sense that it means a position. Perhaps this confusion arises from the fact that we seldom (if ever) hire out to be homemakers. We do not acquire the post as we would school teaching or selling ribbons. We fall in love and marry and — presto — we are homemakers without giving niurh, if any, thought to taking on a new line of work. Or maybe someone dies or moves away and a sister, aunt or daughter becomes a home - maker — quite different from studying a position, applying for it and then being hired. How does our position rate as a job? I certainly wish Uncle Sam would count us as workers when he makes his census report. It al - ways galled me to have to put down "no occupation" after my name on the census list and it was a proud moment when I could mark down "author" in the blank space. Well, I know that writing books is not of any importance compared with homemaking yet I did like to have something to set down for my busy days. I know it would be diffi - cult to set a limit between the woman who makes a home with her own hands and the woman who has a houseful of servants to direct but all the same I hope that some day we can get a public name and place for our business. Meanwhile, what are the advantages and disadvantages of the job? This lack of economic recognition (a very high-sounding way of saying that our job does not rate as a job) is undoubtedly a big dis - advantage; but it Is also one that is diminishing, so we need not sit up nights worrying about it. It is much more important to remark </seg>
            <seg id="p387">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION that we do not get a pay envelope for our work — at least I never nave, do you? i Oh, of course, board and keep, and some money if there is any left over. That really is a disadvantage and we might as well admft it. ; I do not pretend that I have a remedy; I merely face facts. Then we do not have competition — certainly I hope we don't. It Is much happier without, although we must admit that competition does make a Job more glamorous. Then, and perhaps this is most im - portant, our increased skill does not bring us a raise in pay. Oh, but doesn't it? Does not our increased efficiency enable us to manage our family better — to actually raise our standard of living — on the same money? True enough. And that is the only way most families have got any increases these last years, but the homemaker cannot help but realize that such an increase, fortunate as it is, does not thrill her as would an i increase in pay that her business sister might have. She cannot boast about it to the neighbors, nor take to the store for a new dress. But she can profit by it none the less, don't forget that! How about advantages? The flexibility of hours is one joy. Of course there is the work to be done, confining and all that, but the homemaker is her own boss as to how and when it is to be accom - plished and that means a lot — ask any woman who has worked for someone else if it is not advantageous. Then there is a fine variety of tasks, i Everlasting routine, did I hear someone say. Oh, of course. Think of the poor old sun who has to rise every morning through the ages! Everything in life is routine, even the heavenly spheres move in a rhythm. But the homemaker can vary her tasks — she can cook,, and sew, .she can bake and clean, she can garden and put up fruit; if she is wide in her planning she will see to it that stand-up jobs are followed by sit-down jobs; that an out-of-door chore breaks a morning indoors so that she takes advantage to the full of this variety. But the most important advantage of all is the deep spiritual interest and satisfaction that goes along with our work. No other business woman can, all day, work for and with people she loves the most; she can make her every task contribute directly to their comfort and happiness. That is a joy that overbalances a dozen times all the disadvantages I could possibly think up. It is what makes our work so worth while. I have: said that we are homemakers — what is a home? Have you tried to define it? One audience when questioned decided that a home was a place where lived a father and mother and three young children. So? What is it, then, when the children grow up, marry and move away? No, a home is a place where a person lives. It may be that a father and mother and three young children live there — to my mind that is the happiest home in the world. But it may be, on the other hand, that only a lone woman lives there, or an aged man and woman. Is it not aihome? To be sure. It is the home of any person who lives there. And the homemaker must not forget that "home" is her home as well as; the home of other members of her family and if she does a </seg>
            <seg id="p388">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE good Job, her comfort, her health, her recreation and happiness must be considered along with the others. Too often this is completely overlooked. Good homemaking includes homemaking for each person. Did you ever look at your job from the outside? Pretend, when you go home, that you are considering hiring out to be a homemaker at your house and you have come to look at the place. Is the house as pleasant, comfortable and orderly as the family standard of living permits? Are the rooms tidy? Or, on the other hand, are they too orderly so that you would not dare put down a book and muss up the bare straightness? Is there a bare hardness that chills, or a cheerful air of well-being that tempts you to linger as you go from room to room? This comfort that I mean has more to do with the homemaker's attitude and skill than with the material things she has to work with. Are things "setting around"? Unmended clothing, dishes and furniture gives an uneasy feeling to a home, while having everything in good shape shows interest and a wise use of time. The cleanliness and order of a home furnish the background for human joy and happiness. Then look at the people who live at your house. Do they enjoy a nice spirit of cooperation in homemaking? Is there laughter and fun as the daily tasks move on? Does the homemaker use her wits in varying tasks, considering tastes and dividing joys and responsi - bilities as well as chores? Or is she one of those impossible people who announce with a tired whine that "nobody ever does anything for me!" "What do you think of your home as you look it over? Would you like to live there? If not, why not? And what are you going to do about it? Sometimes just a new point of view will do wonders! Think of yourself as taking on this new job and remember that a new broom is supposed to sweep clean — and toss out all the old habits that do not make for happiness; start over. If, on the other hand, you like your house and you think that you will hang on to your job, thank your good luck and good management and improve every hour as to try to make it even better. One of our newer sidelines in our work is the management of family recreation. In the farm home, especially, most of that is not only planned for at home but is also enjoyed at home — we cannot go gadding so much these days. And fortunate is the homemaker who has done so well that her family can have fun, rolicking fun, at home. Do you ever get the notion that work is more important than fun; it is not. To be sure we have to eat and be clean and have a comfortable house. But fun — why it is the oil that makes the wheel go around without creaking. It is essential. </seg>
            <seg id="p389">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION This job of ours is important — true enough. It is satisfying. It is hard — hard enough to challenge every bit of our wit and intelli - gence. It is fun — you cannot find a job anywhere that is half as in - teresting. And it can be well done, IF the homemanager remembers all the while that she is not successful if she is a worn out slave but only whenl she keeps her role of skillful manager, working, directing, planning for the good of all. WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON Two sections were held for each of the Round Table discussions. The combined reports of these round tables are as follows. MEETING NUTRITIONAL NEEDS WITH NEBRASKA FOODS Round Table, By MISS MATILDA PETERS The foods needed for meeting the nutritional needs of the body include milk (a (mart a day for each child and at least a pint for each adult), vegetables, fruits, cereals and breadstuffs, meat, eggs, fats, including butter and cream, and sweets. There should be at least two servings of vegetables daily in addition to potatoes and beans. It is desirable that one of these be raw, if not each day, at least three times a week. Citrous fruits and canned tomatoes may be regarded as a substitute for raw vegetables because of their high vitamin C content. The lesls money people have to spend for food, the greater is the proportion spent for cereals. The dark breads and cereals contain iron, phosphorus, and vitamin B which is largely lost in the manufac - ture of white flour. The dark cereals are of greater importance when the expenditure for fruits and vegetables is limited. Where people can have plenty of fruits and vegetables in the diet, it does not make so much difference whether they have the dark cereals or the more refined ones as they may obtain the values of dark cereals in other foods. The discussion brought out the fact that citrous fruits and green foods were difficult to obtain. The stores in a number of small towns did not carry these products. It was further brought out that nutri - tionally raw cabbage and canned tomatoes could be substituted for citrous fruits as sources of Vitamin C. Tomato cocktail, tomato juice, and soup were suggested as methods of introducing variety. It is no more necessary to boil canned tomatoes before using them than it is to boil canned fruits. Cabbage cooked only a short time may still retain significant amounts of Vitamin C. Cabbage made into sauer - kraut contains some Vitamin C, but very appreciably less than raw cabbage. Raw carrots are also a good source of Vitamin C, therefore if citrus fruits cannot be purchased it is possible to meet the vitamin C requirement of the diet with Nebraska foods. The importance of boiling canned non-acid vegetables such as peas. </seg>
            <seg id="p390">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE , corn, and beans as well as meats to insure safety against botulinus poisoning was stressed. Several women said they were not buying packaged breakfast cereals, but were grinding their own corn and wheat and finding them very satisfactory. There families liked them. Some sweets may well be in the form of sorghum, molasses, and honey. Sorghum and molasses are good sources of calcium and iron. I think first it might be well for us just to summarize what we need for meeting the nutritional needs and then see how the Nebraska farm is able to meet these needs. What are the things we need in the diet to meet the nutritional needs of the body? 1 ■' ■ i * ■ Answer : Milk. Miss Peters: We need milk and how much milk? Answer: One quart a day for each child and a pint a day for each adult. Miss Peters: That is right, one quart a day for each child and a pint a day for each adult. What else do we need? Answer: Vegetables and fruits. Miss Peters: What standard should we set for the vegetables we need? Answer: Two vegetables a day besides potatoes and beans. Miss Peters: Is there any qualification for the vegetables? Answer: One should be raw and if not raw. each day, at least three times a week. Miss Peters: Is there any substitute for the raw vegetable? Answer: Fruit, canned tomatoes. Miss Peters: What is the particular thing about tomatoes which we need? Answer: Tomatoes have vitamins. Miss Peters: Yes, tomatoes have vitamin C which is not destroyed by cooking, since tomatoes have acid. The acid protects the vitamin from destruction. We have mentioned milk and vegetables. Now, what else? Answer: Cereals. Miss Peters: What about the cereals? What qualifications do we make on those? </seg>
            <seg id="p391">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Answer: One cereal a day. Miss Peters: Cereals are the bulky part of the diet. Of course, the less money that people have to spend on food, the more dependence they have to put on cereals. What about the type of cereal we want? Answer: Whole grain cereals. Miss Peters: Of course, where the amount of money Is limited, that is of extreme importance. The dark cereals do contain minerals and Vitamin B which is removed in the preparation of white flour and more refined cereals. In a more expensive diet we can get the iron and phosphorus from more expensive foods such as meat and eggs. Most vegetables do meet the citamin B requirement. Where people can have plenty of fruits and vegetables and eggs in the diet, it does not make much difference whether they have the whole grain cereals or the more refined cereals. They can get them from other foods. The whole grain cereals do not have the monoply of Vitamin B. They are all good- sources of that, however. What else do we have? Answer: Fruits. Miss Peters: What about fruits? What standard are we going to take for the fruit in the diet? How often are we going to have fruit? Answer: One or two or three times a day. Miss Peters: There are lots of people who are in the habit of using fruits for the dessert so that it makes a very palatable food as well as one that adds certain food values to the diet. We have milk, vegetables, fruit and cereals taken care of. What else should we have? Answer: Meat, fats. Miss Peters: We might put meat, eggs, and cheese together. We call these building foods. We will put fats in our next list and we might include under fats butter and bacon. We consider bacon as a fat rather than a meat. Cream could be added to the list of fats. It is unique in that it has vitamins which the other fats do not have. Then we have sweets, such as sugar, honey, sorghum, molasses, etc. To what extent have you been able to meet the nutritional needs from the standpoint of Nebraska foods and to what extent have you fallen short and have had to resort to shipped in food? </seg>
            <seg id="p392">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ■ Answer: We cannot get citrous fruits, and green foods are hard to get. Miss Peters: How many of you feel that the citrous fruits have been prohibitive? They are much cheaper than they were two years ago. Answer: We cannot get them in our town. We have to go to Omaha, Lincoln, or Nebraska City. Miss Peters: Why is that? Is there no demand? Answer: That is mostly the reason. Miss Peters: Is there anything you can substitute for the citrous fruits? Answer: Cabbage, tomato juice. Miss Peters: How many of you have the trouble of finding that your family does not like tomatoes? Answer: My son does not like raw tomatoes, but will eat cooked tomatoes. Miss Peters: If he will eat cooked tomatoes, he will get practically the same effect. Have you found interesting ways of using your tomatoes to avoid monotony? Answer: Straining it, and putting it in an attractive dish. Call it a cocktail and they will eat it. Answer: Tomato soup goes well in cold weather. Answer: Tomato juice is good. Answer: I always feel that I have to boil the tomatoes after tak - ing them from the can. Miss Peters: Is it necessary for you to boil your tomatoes after you open the can? I think there would not be any more reason for you to boil your tomatoes than you would your fruit. I think if there is anything wrong with tomatoes it is usually so evident when you open the can that you will not attempt to use them. They are about the easiest thing there is to keep. Cabbage is a vegetable that is available and one that can be kept for a long time. It can be cooked for a short time also and not lose its vitamin C content. </seg>
            <seg id="p393">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Question: If you cook cabbage a long time what vitamin would you have left? Miss Peters: You would have vitamin B left. Question: What about saner kraut? That is a good way to keep our cabbage. Miss Peters: There is some vitamin C but a large portion of it is lost. Question: Is it lost when it is cooked or when it Is processed? Miss Peters: You have enough acid there to protect it during the cooking process. In the curing process there is some vitamin C lost, probably by oxidation. While it does have a small source of vitamin C, it does not have any appreciable food value. Are there any vegetables stored which would be good sources of vitamin C? Answer: Carrots. Miss Peters: If we cannot afford to buy our citrous fruits it means that we can still get vitamin C from Nebraska foods to insure an ade - quate amount in our diets. What are some of the other ways you have found to meet the nutritional needs of your family so you do not have to depend upon the shipping in of foods? Answer: By canning. Miss Peters: Canning, I think, is really a boon to us in taking care of the surplus fruits. Question: I canned a large amount of corn and beans this sum - mer. They seem to be perfect in texture and color. If I cook them ten to fifteen minutes, will they be safe to use? I feel like a mur - deress every time I open a can. Miss Peters: Cooking the vegetables that length of time should make them safe. In using your home canned non-acid vegetables you should take every precaution in using them. Question: Has not botulinus poisoning always occurred where the vegetables were used cold, as in salads? Miss Peters: Yes. Several years ago we had a case of food poison - • ing in Morrill county and after investigation it was found that those people had used the steamer for their processing on a coal range. It is very hard to maintain a uniform heat in a steamer on a coal range </seg>
            <seg id="p394">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE and so when canning the non-acid vegetables it is safer to use the pressure cpoker or the water bath. Question: Would you find the same poisoning in canned meats? Miss Peters: Yes. Question: A lady was telling me that you had to cook the meat before using, covering it with water. Is than true? Miss Peters: It would not be necessary to cover it with water. Botulinus is a word that comes from the Latin word which means sausage. Question: Is it not true that the botulinus baccilus is not found in all soils or in all sections of the country? Miss Peters: We felt rather pleased over a piece of research work that was done in Iowa several years ago. They carried on quite an extensive study by means of the pressure cooker. They felt it was impossible to recommend that everyone should have a pressure cooker in doing their canning. In the course of their study they found that there were very few sections in Iowa which had soil Infected with the botulinus baccilus. The National Canners Association became quite concerned several years ago when it was found that commercial can - ned products contained botulinus poisoning. They did some research ■work so that they might perfect their methods, so they would not run those risks again. If you are using reliable brands of commercial canned vegetables, you are safe in using those without any preliminary cooking. ■.....■ . ....::. Comment: I understand also that the spore growth occurs very often in the cooling process. In commercial canning, the cans are plunged in cold water and cooled suddenly. ■ ■- Miss Peters: The main reason for that cooling after canning is for the prevention of flat sour. Flat sour gives a very disagreeable flavor to the food. It is caused by the organisms that develop at high temperatures. For instance, if you gather a large amount of beans and let them stand over night, the next morning they have heated in the center. These beans will develop flat sour and nothing can be done to prevent it appearing in the canned product. Mr. Lau, one of our distributors here, was telling us something about a carload of sweet potatoes which they had received from some canning company. When the car got to Lincoln they had to take the hinges off to get the cases out. They got in touch with the can - ning company and found the cans had not been cooled after being processed. Something had gone wrong with their cooling system and they had tried to get by without going through this part of the process; </seg>
            <seg id="p395">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION consequently, it cost them several thousand dollars. Question: Coming back to cereals, we ground all of our own cereals last year. Miss Peters: How satisfactory has that been? Answer: It has been much cheaper. With the corn there is a little difference in the taste and does not keep as well in warm weather and does not keep as long. It has been very satisfactory and I do not think my family would know any difference between it and that which is bought in the store. Answer: We also grind our own corn and wheat. We have used everything on the market in the way of breakfast food and my family all vote for the wheat mush. Question: Is there any difference in the length of cooking which is necessary? Answer: If it is not ground real fine, it would need to be cooked longer. Miss Peters: If you compare what you pay for some of the cereals in package form, you will realize there is quite a difference between the price you get for wheat and what you get for corn. Comment: The corn flakes and wheat flakes are about the same price on the market now as they have always been. Comment: Oatmeal is a little cheaper. Question: What about sorghum as a food? Miss Peters: In addition to its carbohydrates, sorghum is a very Kood source of both calcium and iron. It also contains an appreciable amount of vitamin B. Question: Is there a sorghum mill in Nebraska? Answer: One south of Plattsmouth, one south of Lincoln, and a number in other places. Question: What is the difference between molasses and sorghum? Miss Peters: Molasses is the by-product in the manufacture of cane sugar. Molasses is the product secured when granulated sugar has been taken out. Question: What is done with lard at the packing house to make it stand up better than the lard rendered at home? Miss Peters: The lower melting point lard is removed for oleo. </seg>
            <seg id="p396">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Question: They also add paraffin to it, do they not, to make it stand up better? Miss Peters: If they do that, they would have to make a state - ment to that effect on the package, because it is an adulteration. Comment: If it is the pure leaf lard which is used, I do not be - lieve you will find that anything has been added. Miss Peters: Are any of you using some fat other than lard? And if so, why do you prefer it to lard? Answer: It is clean and will not become rancid as easily as the lard. Miss Peters: Is not lard as clean as any vegetable fat? Answer: Some lard becomes rancid more easily than others. Answer: It is probably due to the way it has been rendered. Question: Would vegetable fat be any better than animal fat in any way? Miss Peters: Not in any way. •■••'; : ■•■..'•'."■ • '■• ■ Second Round Table. The first part was similar to that of the first round table. Question: Is there danger of over doing eggs? Answer: Yes, I think there may be. For example, I have in mind a man who lived near my home who always ate four cbks for breakfast and four in the evening and had meat at noon. He had an excess amount of protein. He had an unbalanced diet. Question: If one had plenty of fruits or vegetables, would it be harmful to have meat three times a day? Miss Peters: No, I would not necessarily say it would be. In the past people had the idea that meat was a harmful food. The only objection to using it so liberally is that they will leave other things out which would make a balanced diet. Question: Which is the more easily digested part of the egg for a growing child, the yolk or the white? Miss Peters: The yolk, because it contains minerals and vitamins A, B, and D. The white contains protein and water. Question: How many of you farm women are using cod liver oil for your children? </seg>
            <seg id="p397">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION (A number held up their hands.) Question: How many of you farm women are using cod liver oil In the laying mash for your chickens? (A number held up their hands.) Comment: We have a commercial poultry farm and we have test - ed many of the commercial feeds and we find that for three weeks after we have stopped feeding the mash containing cod liver oil, we can taste it in the eggs. Miss Peters: An experiment was carried on with a lot of pigs kept in a dark place and were not given any cod liver oil. They de - veloped rickets, as might be expected. Another lot of pigs were put in a dark place and were given cod liver oil. They did not develop rickets. Another lot of pigs had sunshine and cod liver oil. They did not develop rickets. The carcasses of these pigs tasted of the cod liver oil for three weeks. We had a diet list brought in from Tulsa, Oklahoma. We found that it was decidedly low in vitamin A and we suggested that as there would not be enough vitamin A in it, that cod liver oil be added. The number of vegetables used was not enough to provide vitamin A. Even though with that recommendation they would have a problem of having all the cod liver oil used that was recommended. Question: Can oleo take the place of butter? Miss Peters: With the standard which we set up for milk, a quart a day for a growing child, it would be possible to get along with a butter substitute. It is, of course, not as good as butter in that it does not have as much vitamin A. The amount of vitamin A which is adequate for meeting the nutritional needs is not always adequate for optimal health. A larger amount of vitamin A is required for a nursing mother than during the period of growth, in proportion. Question: Is it all right to use all white bread? Answer: We should eat more whole wheat bread. I think some people should not eat anything but whole wheat bread. Of course, there are many people who do not eat anything but white bread. Question: Can anyone eat too much coarse food? Miss Peters: If too much coarse food is taken, the effect is irritat - ing rather than beneficial. Question: What effects do we get from whole wheat bread that we do not get from the white bread? </seg>
            <seg id="p398">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Miss Peters: Minerals, especially phosphorus and iron, and vita - mins. Are there any other class of foods from j which we can get these same values? Question: How about sauer kraut for children? Miss Peters: I do not know. I think I cannot really see any point to giving it to them because it is a little harsh as compared to some of the other vegetables you give at that age. Sauer kraut juice is good in promoting intestinal action. Question: What is there about sauer kraut which makes it good for adults? Miss Peters: The lactic acid which it contains is good for in - testinal hygiene. Some of you women have been using Rome thrift suggestions in the way of meeting nutritional needs of your family with Nebraska prod - ucts. What are some of the practices you have used? Answer: What about honey for part of the sugar? Miss Peters: That is a very good thing because honey does con - tain a small amount of minerals and vitamin B. It is a pleasant way to get your sugar content. As for sorghum, it has a larger amount of calcium and iron than honey does. There is a higher per cent of minerals in sorghum than in honey. Comment: We have not mentioned dried fruit. Miss Peters: Dried fruit adds a lot to the palatability of the fruits. Question: Where do the dried beans come in? Miss Peters: I am glad you mentioned that. Dried beans are grouped with potatoes and we want two vegetables a day besides potatoes and beans. Question: I would like to ask how widely honey is produced over the state. Miss Peters: Probably not as widely as the dairy or beef industry, but we have a State Honey Producers Association, and they always have an extensive booth at the State Fair and at county fairs. </seg>
            <seg id="p399">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION LOW COST BEAUTY IX THE HOME Round Table, By Miss Bess Steele Too many people have the opinion that beauty has something to do with the cost of things, and that unless you can spend a lot of money you cannot secure anything which ha3 any claim to beauty. For the past few years I have been challenging that statement. I have been trying to acquire things which have nothing to do with cost. One o£ the places I frequent is the ilve-an-ten cent store. When is it worth while to reflnish old furniture? How may it be done? When the furniture is in good condition or made well. When it has good lines, good proportion and if you need the piece. You should have nothing in your home which you do not know to be use - ful and believe to be beautiful. If it was good and worth keeping what would you do with it? Store it away until you have a need for it. How can you reflnish furniture? With slip covers. They are difficult to make and have look right. Go to an upholsterer and get instructions. Good Housekeeping Institute, New York City, puts out a pamphlet on making slip covers. They should be as carefully tailored as a man's suit. To ri;move old varnish secure some commercial paint and varnish remover, use it, then wash with turpentine. It is then ready to put on stain and paint. What about homemade varnish remover? It does not injure Ilio wood but darkens it. The darkness can be removed with acetic acid or vinegar. Vinegar closes the pores of the wood. Commercial remover opens the pores. Freezone or other anti-freeze solutions remove varnish and will not stain tin; wood. This can be used when you are through using it in the car in the spring. What tests should he applied to pictures in selecting appropriate ones to hang on the walls of the home? Does it have the right color note. The size of the picture in relation to the wall space should govern it. The furniture over which it hangs should govern it. The subject of the picture should be something helpful and inspiring. If the pictures do not fit in with the home, would you take them down and have no pictures? Yes. Decorators say fewer and fewer pictures satisfy. The pattern in tapestries and wall hangings, upholstering of the furniture, the decoration in the rugs give us notes that pictures used to bring. One famous decorator says that one picture sufficient - ly inspiring in theme is enough for one room. What would be appropriate subjects for living room pictures? Interiors and scenery. Would family portraits be appropriate? No. Why not? Only one out of a hundred has claim to being artistic enough. Religious pictures are all right provided the family is Inter - ested in that type of thing. Portraits of famous people done by </seg>
            <seg id="p400">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE artists are appropriate for the living room. Etchings are good if used correctly. Pictures should not be used on wall paperithat has a very definite figure. Pictures, if they are of value, should be used with no back - ground. Should the picture of the Last Supper be used in the dining room? Hang it where it would be the most inspiration to the family. It can be appropriately used in either the living room or the dining room, if the family is interested in that sort of picture. What if one has figured wall paper and ?till wants a picture on it? You can hang the picture on a plain wall hanging. The picture must stand out as more important than the background. Is it correct to use tapestries as pictures? These woven pieces that try to imitate oil paintings are not correct. A lot of the tapestries being sold now are not good. A tapestry to be good should be in - conspicuous! They must be appropriate to the place where they are used. Would the artistic effect justify taking things from walls that the family have loved for years? Try it a while and if lost without it. re - place it. Shift things around and find a place in the room that is more appropriate. It is of great value to have the surroundings of the home in harmony. Unless something is of great value to every member, it should be discarded if out of harmony. This is a problem for each individual to work out. If the young people are ashamed of certain things in the home to the point that they will not bring their friends into the home, what should the mother do about it? The mother should carry it to her own room rather than embarrass the children. (Some difference of opinion on this, but no definite decision.) What can be done to bring more beauty into the home without any expense? Rearrangement of furniture. Is there some special way to arrange it to create more beauty than otherwise? Harmony should dominate the arrangement of the furniture. Do not put pianos, tables, and davenports across the corners of the room. All scarfs and table runners should lay straight on the furniture. ;The interest in a room comes from the arrangement of small pieces. If i the furniture must come either across a door or a window or a corner, which is prefer - able? Across the corner, by all means. A window or a door may be covered with a hanging, if the house has enough windows or doors to justify. One person had covered a window to have a place for the dresser, because she had plenty of windows left. To bring more beauty into the home, one can go in with a bushel basket and unload </seg>
            <seg id="p401">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION a lot of unnecessary and ugly things. Are there not other ways of bringing beauty without rearranging and elimination? Wild flowers and jars and bottles that have beauty for these flowers. What material would you use to cover a window or a door? Imita - tion silks, and denim of inconspicuous figure that tones in with the whole scheme. Should there be anything on an upright piano? No. If there must he, it should be something very low that harmonizes with the lines of the piano. An upright piano is not beautiful and should be made inconspicuous. Scarfs, never. AVhat about the ambitious old lady who wishes to display her needle work? Let her make quilts and rugs. What would you do with the picture gallery? Store in attic. Should candle sticks be used on an upright piano? No. They carry the idea up and the piano is already too high. Someone suggested that family photographs be put in a book and left on a table. What may be done to windows to add beauty to the room? Short windows should have curtains giving an idea of length and too long windows, curtains that give an idea of shortness. Why make short windows look long and long windows look short? To make a better proportion. How do you hang a curtain over two windows that are together? On a pole that goes clear across both. A decorative pole is not good. Swinging brackets are not good. The rod should be solid and extend clear across the window. Why put windows into houses, then drape them to shut out the light? The windows should not be draped heavily so that the light is shut out. We should do more to make our homes beautiful on the outside, then drape our windows so that we can see through them. Could not the draperies come out over the wood so not so much would cover the window? No. The wood should show on all four sides of the drapperies. How should one curtain French windows? Use glass curtains fastened at top and bottom, but no drapery, generally speaking. Second Round Table. Half of the secret of a beautiful home is in arrangement. How do you go about securing colors that go together beautifully? In every arrangement there should be something that unifies it. The main thing in putting colors together is to have a unifying note, some one note carried through all the arrangement. The whole scheme must be mainly warm or mainly cool. If your living room is warm in char - acter,, the colors must be decidedly warm, and the opposite. What would you suggest for a north living room? Introduce warm colors, tans and blues. Can lavender be both a warm and a cool color? </seg>
            <seg id="p402">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Blue lavender Is cool. Red lavender Is warm. Which is better lor the kitchen, paint or paper? Enamel is the best as It can always be washed. Grease settles in wall paper and enamel can be cleaned. What about the shiny appearance of enamel walls? You can get egg shell finish that is not shiny. Will grease settle in dull finish? No. What tests should be applied to pictures in selecting appropriate ones to hang on the walls of the home? It depends upon what people like. Something that his balance, good color,, and an interesting subject. Are not some subjects suitable for some room and not for others? Yes. What do you feel is an interesting subject? "Gleaners" was suggested. Some objections to this. The individual test applies in this. What about the appropriateness of animal pictures, such as sheep, etc? Again it is a matter of personal taste. Is it good taste to mix all in one room annuals, family portraits, etc? No. There should be very few pictures on the wall. Family portraits are almost taboo, except in the bedroom or a place that is one's own. Should a picture hanginK on the wall always have something beneath it? Yes. The theme should be a subject that is sincere and simple. We used to see pictures from calendars and they were frivolous, but calendars have improved so that we have some very good reproductions of masterpieces. One picture on the wall from the Literary Digest is very fine because it stimulates the imagination. Simplicity in a picture is very beautiful. Sentimental pictures very often are liked by some members nf the family, but grow tiresome very soon. Maps have been used lately as decoration very successfully. What is an etching? Etchings may be in color or black and while or brown and white. Their character is that of delicacy. They are done with a very fine needle. The first stop is to take a metal plate of copper or zinc. The surface of the plato is then covered with a •waxy substance, then with the the needle, the picture is drawn through the wax. The plate is then lowered into an acid bath and left until the exposed places are bitten sufficiently deep. It is then taken out of the acid, cleaned off, and the lines inked. The plate is then put on paper and run through a roller press. When the paper is pulled off you have the results. Etchings are very high type pictures. It takes much skill to prepare and to know when everything is just right. A real etching always has a depression showing where the plate has been on the paper. You can tell a real etclung by that always. Also a good etching always has numbers on the lower lefthand corner. If the number 250 is on it, it means that the etcher has made 250 from that plate. An authentic etching always has these figures. Rembrandt always drew a line through the numbers when he was through 'using that particular plate. Colored etching are made with two plates. </seg>
            <seg id="p403">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION What may be done to windows to add beauty to the room? Windows are for the purpose of letting in light and air and nothing should be done to interefere with their proper function. The out-of - doors should be enjoyed through the windows. The beauty outside of the house should be developed instead of so many pictures on the walls. When scrim curtains with crewel embroidery on them are used, are drapes necessary? It might be possible not to use drapes. What is the rule for when we should and should not use drapes? When the windows seem too thinly treated without drapes. A living room should have a cozy appearance. If the windows in this room do not have drapes, they are apt to fall out of importance because of heavy up - holstering, thick rugs, etc. What about not using glass curtains In the living room? Drapes only could be used very nicely. It is coming to be good taste to eliminate both shades and glass curtains. What kind of material should be used for drapes that would be inexpensive? Monk's cloth, if other furnishings permit. A wall paper that is figured could have drapes as figured as the walls. Are there some suggestions to guide in the hanging of pictures? Pictures should never be hung as a spot on the wall, but should be hung close to furniture so that they become part of it. The center of interest in the picture should be slightly above eye level of the average person. Either the power or upper line of all pictures in one room should be even. Wires should not show at all, but if they do, they should be.vertical. How may lamps bring beauty into the room? They should be well placed and well-shaded. Old oil lamps can be shaded and become something really quite nice. Three lamps are about right for a room 13x16. They should be placed in different activity centers. The re - sult of artificial lighting should be as near the soft glow of the day - light as possible. Artificial lights add to the scheme of the" room be - cause of shadows that are cast as well as the light they give. Lamps may contribute beauty to a room by having beautiful form and shades. The silhouette of the lamp should be nicely proportioned and beauti - ful in line. Cheerful, sunny colors should always be used in lamps. They should be the color of sunlight, not brilliant, and never reds. SOME FITTING PROBLEMS IN CLOTHING Round Table, By Miss Carolyn Ruby I am assuming that all of you do a great deal of your own sewing'. I am also assuming that you are all interested in any suggestion which will help you save time and money, so that is what I am going to do. </seg>
            <seg id="p404">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Some of you are going to say, "I would like to sew, but I cannot fit myself, so I do not sew.' This difficulty will be partially eliminated If you make a foundation pattern, or if you have a pattern which you find fits you well and meets your individual figure irregularities, a pattern which fits well up to the neck, has a regulation armscye and a regulation sleeve fitting into that armscye. In order to get this pat - tern, buy any good commercial pattern as Butterick, McCall or Vogue. You have all had enough experience to know that commercial patterns do not ordinarily fit perfectly without some alteration. All good commercial patterns are made according to standard measure - ments, but how many have figures that conform to these standard measurements? Most of us have larger hips, more sloping shoulders, are larger through the bust, or have any one of a half dozen differences. For this reason you should take a good foundation pattern and if you have a neighbor who can help you with your fitting, I would suggest that you take a piece of muslin or some old material (an old skirt would do very well) and make a pattern in cloth which will mold to the figure as a dress would mold and then after you have fitted it to your figure you should have a garment having similar characteristics to the one I shall show you. "We must have definite standards by which we may measure the various points in this garment. (Passes out a sheet showing standards for judging.) Characteristics of a Well Fitted Garment. Body: 1. The garment should he comfortable without excess fullness. 2. The filling yarns should run straight around the figure at chest, bust, and hips and parallel to the floor, (except in bias cut garments.) 3. The warp yarns should run parallel to the center front and center back and perpendicular to the floor. 4. The underarm seam should fall directly from the center of the arm pit and perpendicular to the floor. 5. All structural lines of the garment should be definitely related to the lines of the figure. Sleeves : 1. Neither the body of the blouse nor the sleeve should feel tight or draw at any point when the arm is bent forward or the hand lifted to the head. 2. The filling yams should run parallel to the floor at the largest part of the upper arm. 3. The warp yarns should drop perpendicularly to the floor, fiom the highest point of shoulder to elbow. 4. The center of fullness at the elbow should come at the point of elbow when bent. </seg>
            <seg id="p405">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION 5. The dart or opening from wrist to elbow (if any) shouia De in line with the little finger when the palm of the hand is turned toward the floor. G. The inner seam should be in line with the base of the thumb when the palm of the hand is turned toward the floor. 7. There should be no fullness in the lower half of the sleeve at armscye except for the very fleshy upper arm. I Let us examine this blouse (has a girl model a foundation pattern) which is made of muslin but might have been made of any old material available such as striped shirting, gingham, etc. A good foundation pattern should fit closely at the neck line, .Making it adaptable to more uses. You will observe the filling yarns are marked with black thread at the chest, bust, shoulder &gt; and upper arm. The warp yarns are also marked in a similar manner at center front, center back and sleeve cap. Greater comfort is realized on the average figure if a few tucks are made at the back of the neck. Let us analyze the fit of this gar - ment using the standards given. (See Characteristics of a Well-Pitted Garment.) In considering the first point, the body of the garment should be comfortable without excess fullness. Some people like to have their dresses fit very snugly while others like them to fit loosely. By all means they must be comfortable for all normal activities. If you drive a car, your garments should be tested for such strain — test by bringing arms forward as if driving. The filling yarns should run straight around the figure at chest, bust, hips, and parallel to the floor. The warp yarns should run paral - lel to the renter front, center back, and perpendicular to the floor. ' If these lines do not fall parallel, you will have unsightly wrinkles formed. The underarm seam falls directly from the center of the arm pit and perpendicularly to the floor. Structural lines should be definitely related to the lines of the figure. The line which is the most difficult to define is the armscye. I would like to have everyone who is trying to fit a foundation garment examine her own figure before a mirror. Notice the line where your arm joins the body. For more definite help let us see "Rules for Placing Structural Lines.' 1 (Armscye) You will now observe the characteristics of a well-fitted sleeve (points out essential points to observe). Rules for Placing Structural Lines. 1. Shoulder seam: Start at the highest point of the shoulder at the base of the neck and extend from 1 / 4" to %" back of the highest point of. shoulder at armscye. (Determine by pencil.) </seg>
            <seg id="p406">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Test — The seam should not be visible from the back or front when the eye is on a level with the shoulder. 2. Neck line: a. Define position by placing tape measure or string over the prominent vertebrae at the back of the neck. Follow base of neck above collar bone in front. (Just above hollow in front of neck) b. Outline this line by placing a continuous row of pins at the lower edge of tape or string. 3. Underarm seam: To determine its position, begin at the center of the arm pit (directly below the end of shoulder seam) and drop a perpendicular line to the floor. 4. Armscye: To determine this line, a. Locate prominent joint at upper part of shoulder at front. b. Drop a line from this point (2" to 2%") parallel to the center front, to the large muscle at lower front of arm. c. Make a gradual curve from this point under the arm. d. Continue curve to back of arm making the line parallel to center back for 2" to 2% (same as front). e. Connect back with front, with a gradual curve over the top of shoulder following the natural line of the body. It is well to fit a sleeve from the elbow up and from elbow down, making sure" that the fullness provided for the elbow joint is in line with its most prominent point. It is needless to attempt to fit a sleeve until after the armscye is well denned. The 3leeve should be approxi - mately one inch larger than the armhole. The extra fullness as you see is eased in over the upper half of the sleeve. The large fleshy arm is the only exception to this rule. For this type of arm a little fullness may be eased in or a few small darts may be introduced to provide necessary fullness for the large upper arm. How much larger should our sleeve be than actual upper arm measurement? That depends upon the muscularity of the arm. The general rule, however, is I 1 /-" to 2" larger, the same as is allowed on each side at the bust line. I have another blouse which fits somewhat differently. (Girl models blouse presenting fitting difficulties.) In this blouse we have some wrinkles from the top of the sleeve </seg>
            <seg id="p407">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION to the underarm, one of the most common fitting problems, which is caused by having too short a sleeve cap. You will also notice that the crosswise grain of material runs in an upward curve rather than parallel to the floor as it should. A bit of prevention in measuring and altering your pattern should have prevented this difficulty. How? Take an accurate measurement of your upper arm as near the armscye as the tape may be placed underarm, making such that the tape is parallel to the floor (demon - stration). From this line, measure to the highest point of armscye line at shoulder. Compare this measurement with that of sleeve pat - tern and alter accordingly. (See Vogue's Practical Dressmaking or Baldt'.s Dressmaking Made Easy and note method for alteration.) (Demonstrates.) In case you did not take this precaution and find yourself confronted with such a problem, what can be done? 1. Decrease seam at top of sleeve cap if wide enough to permit or 2. Cut curve of sleeve lower under the arm, (Demonstrates de - creasing seam at top of sleeve cap and wrinkles disappear as cross - wise grain of material falls parallel to floor.) At the shoulder, we have diagonal wrinkles from neck to armscye — indicating that the shoulder of the figure is more sloping than the shoulder line of the garment. (Note curve in crosswise grain of material in bust and shoulder.) In this case you will find it may be remedied either by: a. Decreasing shoulder seam at neckline if seam is wide enough and neck high enough. 1). If shoulder seam is not wide enough at neck to permit the above remedy, widen the seam at the armscye until wrinkle dis - appears. This may, however, make your armscye too large and is not advisable if the first method is possible. (Demonstrates.) You see I have let it out almost one-half inch, and our line now falls straight across the shoulders. Perhaps some - one may have a question. Question: When you alter at the neckline, are you in danger of making the neck too large, that is, too wide across the back? Answer: There is a possibility, but that depends upon the in - dividual pattern. There is a possibility of making it too wide and if so, on the average figure it is possible to take some pin tucks or darts and thus take care of that difficulty. Question: That isn't apt to drop it too low? Answer: If it does, then alter from the armscye. </seg>
            <seg id="p408">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE After you have tested your pattern and feel you have a pattern which conforms to these problems you should mark all seam allow - ances so that you can put it together in exactly the same way. I would make lines across sleeves and armscye at quarter, eighth, and sixteenth points so that it may be easily refitted in the same way. These serve the same purpose as notches in the commercial patterns. (Shows finished pattern.) I . ■ After completing your pattern, as this one has been, of what prac - tical use is it? 1. It may be used as a guide in verifying and altering other patterns, thus helping you to make other garments which may fit your irregularities. 2. It may be used as a basis for designing other patterns through simple adaptations. In order to make these adaptations you will find your pattern in a more convenient form to handle if cut from tag board, having seam allowances removed. What are some of the simple adaptations which may be made easily? Suppose you wish to make a dress where it seems more desirable to have the fullness introduced at the front of the shoulder in the form of a dart, shirring, etc. If so &gt; I shall show you how it may be done very easily with the same pattern, which has darts under the arm at seam line. Place the pattern on a lengthwise fold. Trace from the center of shouRler around pattern to center front of neck. Trace from center front at bottom to lower side of dart under arm so: (demonstrates). Hold finger on point of dart and pivot pattern so that the upper line of dart falls on the original position of the lower line, thus removing the fullness under the arm and transferring it to the shoulder. Note the additional width in shoulder. In order to prove the accuracy of this method, let us take a pattern, pin the dart out from under the arm, then slash the pattern from the center of the shoulder until the pattern will lie flat. You will note the same result. Another com - mon place for introducing fullness is at the lower front of the armscye. This is particularly good for the larger busted figure. This may be done in a similar manner: Place center front of pattern on lengthwise fold. Trace from point in armscye where fullness is desired to center front of neck line. Trace from center front at bottom of waist to lower line of dart under arm. Hold finger on point of dart and pivot pattern so that upper line around armscye to where fullness is desired. (Demonstrates.) </seg>
            <seg id="p409">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Another common point for introducing fullness for the bust is from the waist line as seen in the bodice •waist for the youthful figure. Place center front of pattern on lengthwise fold as before. Trace from upper part of dart under arm to center front of neck line and from center front at waist line to point where fullness is to be intro - duced. Hold finger on point at bust line and pivot pattern so that lower line of dart falls on original position of upper line, trace from lower line of dart to point in front where fullness f is to be introduced. These patterns may be tested as we did in transferring fullness for the shoulder. You may also be interested in methods for producing the cowl effect since it is used in so many designs. It is advisable to cut this pattern in paper before cutting the material. Proceed as follows: 1. Draw a broken line marking center front. 2. Measure from highest point of shoulder to point where the center front of drape will fall. (Demonstrates. 6 to 8 or 9 inches.) 3. Hold finger on center front at waist line and slip pattern to th i right, the same amount as desired depth for drape. 4. Draw a straight line from center front of neck to highest point of shoulder. Trace around the pattern to upper line of dart, fold dart out of pattern and continue tracing to center front. In using the pattern the center front may be placed on a lengthwise fold of material or if a softer effect is desired, it may be cut on the bias. (Demonstrates.) There are many other adaptations which may be made for the \vaist_ but these are probably the most commonly used. Sleeve Adaptations. At the present time we have many novelty sleeves, more than we have had for years. If we should have to buy a new pattern for each type it would soon add much to our clothing costs. In one of my clothing classes I have had ten different kind of sleeves developed from our foundation or master pattern. I shall demonstrate only a few of the more popular types. I see many of you are wearing sleeves that are fitted at the top and full at the elbow. This may be made easily by placing your pattern straight with the grain of the material and tracing the upper curve with a broken line. Determine the desired length for sleeve. At this point measure to the right 3" to 4", or one-half the additional </seg>
            <seg id="p410">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE width desired; measure to the left the same amount. Place finger at the' highest point of sleeve and pivot pattern to the right the esti - mated amount and trace around pattern accordingly. Pivot pattern to left and trace in the same manner. i As you widen the sleeve the length must be increased In propor - tion. That is to each inch added in width %" to %" should be added in length at the center back, and curved gradually to sleeve seam. ( Demonstrates. ) You will observe that the upper curve has been altered by being lifted at the sides. You will question then as to whether it will fit the armscye, and I am sure it will if you have cut it accurately. You may also ask why the fullness was not added at the seam line, and I will show you. (Demonstrates.) You will note that the fullness falls just where it was added, at the center front of sleeve at seam line which is most undesirable while by pivoting your pattern and straight - ening the upper curve you see the fullness is thrown to the back where it was needed. This pattern may also be tested by taking the original pattern, slice it from the bottom, extending the slashes to the sleeve cap, until the pattern will lie flat. You note the same result as when picoted, with less work by pivoting. You may be interested to see this adaptation as it was worked out in a remodeled problem. (Student demonstrates dress which was made from old coat.) Miss James has had a very interesting problem in renovating and dyeing her old coat to harmonize with her dress, which was made as a home project, this completing her ensemble, with the addition of not only one yard of printed silk which was pur - chased tor $1.00 per yard. Question: In that sleeve is there a foundation to keep the puff? Answer: Her cuff is tight enough to hold it up. Sometimes we put in a sham sleeve. Sometimes we use elastic at the seam line to hold it in place if we do not have the regulation armscye line. It is impossible to put in a sham lining if we do not have a regulation armscye. Question: May a raglan sleeve be cut from this pattern? Answer: Yes, but it must be developed in paper first. 1. Match front and back of pattern at shoulder line (Seams re - moved or turned back.) 2. Match center top of sleeve to highest point of armscye over - lapping at sides, the same amount at both back and front. 3. Trace these patterns with dotted lines at armscye, shoulder, at top. of sleeve. </seg>
            <seg id="p411">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION 4. Lower armscye one inch on both back and front. 5. Lower sleeve curve under arm one inch. 6. Mark on foundation pattern the desired lines for raglan sleeve. (Demonstrate.) This line may be varied, making it similar to the saddle shoulder if desired. (See Pattern Making by Helen Hall.) 7. Cut by the lines drawn and make seam allowance. (Shows a blouse cut in this way, modeled by student.) It is possible to add interest and fullness which would be more flattering to the thin figure by placing a few tucks or a little shirring at the front of the shoulder. Since we are using capes a great deal this season, you may be in - terested to see this dress which has a cape designed from our master pattern. (Student comes to front and shows detachable cape which is worn with her dress.) The method for cutting is very simple. 1. Place front and back together matching at shoulders (seams removed). 2. Place highest point of sleeve cap to highest point of armscye. 3. Spread pattern at neck line until both the back and front meet the sleeve cap, three inches below the shoulder seam. 4. Trace shoulder lines indicating the spread at the neck. 5. Remove this material in the form of a dart extending from highest point of shoulder at neckline to from Vx" to W back of highest point of shoulder. See rule for placing shoulder seam.) In this way the necessary fullness for the shoulder and arm is de - termined. We have only a few minutes left. I wonder if there are any more questions. Question: How would you make the adjustment for very sloping shoulders? Answer: I would adjust it at the neckline, if possible, or the pat - tern might have been altered by lowering the seam at armscye. (Demonstrates.) (See Vogue's Practical Dressmaking.) Question: Can you use elastic at the top of the sleeve if it is irregular? Answer: You cannot. It is used only with the more or less irreg - ular armscye line at bottom only. </seg>
            <seg id="p412">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE v&lt; nest ion: How can you change a pattern that has a drop shoulder and you want to put a set-In sleeve in? Answer: If I understand your question, I think you mean some - thing like a kimona which drops over the shoulder. Suppose we have that. With that type of sleeve we usually find it cut a little higher and also a little lower under the arm than the regulation armscye. If it is wide enough we could drop our pattern a little lower and cut according to our master pattern. This will probably necessitate piec - ing at the bottom f which may be done in some decorative way. SOMETHING BESIDES WORK MRS. CLARA INGRAM JUDSON What is WORK? Generally we define it, if we must, as some - thing we have to do: toil, labor. That which provides or prepares our daily bread. Any definition would likely include the idea of toil and of necessity. Yet much that is laborious is not work; and fun is as necessary to the spirit as bread is to the body. Several years ago when it happened to be my privilege to spend a few days in the beautiful country of Switzerland, I got a new slant on this thing we call work. From the minute we entered the country I began to notice their lovely handicraft. The dainty laces, the rich embroideries of the women; the exquisite wood carving and ivory work of the men and boys. Never have I seen such lovely things! One day as we took a jaunt from Interlaken we saw at the wayside a young girl embroidering while she was tending a small herd of goats. I exclaimed at her lovely work and she held it up for me to see. Such tiny, perfect stitches! It almost made my poor eyes ache to see it and I thought of all the tiny ivories I had seen only that morning and was almost overcome. The girl's mother came up to us Just then and I said to her, "Just think of all the hours of work spent in lacemaking and carving in this country!" And my tone, I know, expressed dis - tress. "But madam," she replied, in surprised tones and excellent Eng - lish, "why should you be sorry? It is their work! It is their joy!" Work! Joy! Strange words to link together! Last year I happened to be using Switzerland as the setting for a book I was writing so I made a careful study of the people and I found what the woman had told me was exactly true. The work of the Swiss people, that is, their means of livlihood, comes through their summer labors with goats and cheesemaking and such. Their lace - making and carving is done mostly in the winter when cold and snow shut them in the little valleys for many a long week. It is only a matter of the last few years and quite incidental that tourists and </seg>
            <seg id="p413">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION importing have happened to make profitable this type of labor. The lacemaking, and the carving has been done for decades before the tourists ever thought of Switzerland; it is recreation; it is a hobby, we would term it; the joy of the Swiss people. Here in our own country we have been so busy carving out a living that we have had little time and less thought for work that is joy. Pleasure has come through accomplishment. We glow with pride when we think of our labor as toil — hard toil which has accomplished something material; not joy; not fun. Work has been work. Now we are grown up. All of us in varying degrees must not think beyond work. We homemakers need not at this time go into the causes and ramifications of our situation — just enough to know that it is upon us. We realize, some of us for the first time, that something besides work is important; that man does not thrive by bread alone. And that it is the homemaker's business to provide and direct the something besides work which her family and herself are to enjoy. Generally our thought will follow two lines; we want something besides work; that shall be recreation — social contacts, parties, walks, games, all sorts of light, gay, and relaxing fun. And, second, some - thins besides work that shall satisfy our desire to create beauty — usually we call this second need our hobby. What do you like best to do — knit woolens or rugs, paint pictures, embroider linens, crochet, bake, paint furniture? One could spend an hour listing favored oc - cupations. Instead let us hear what you have to say, what do you like best to do besides work? Among the amusements suggested for recreation by the leader or group were: Afternoon tea with simple food (or nothing but tea) and a rest or chat. Company for meals with easy menus so that one can afford com - pany often without too much of either trouble or expense. One-dish menus suggested were: Chicken goulash (chicken or other meat), riced potatoes, peas, carrots, celery, cooked first and then baked Celery, rolls, apple pie, cheese, coffee Rice or noodle ring with creamed meat in the center Biscuits Jam Relish such as cold slaw Chocolate ice box cake Coffee </seg>

A hard times party where guests wore old clothes. Guests drew slips on which were written directions for getting the supper or rolls, toasted weiniers and coffee. A Scotch Party Even a simple party is work for the hostess, but it is a delightful form of work — giving variation from the routine of everyday and leaving behind the warm comforting thrill of having made a good time. What is a better end of labor than that? And the woman who can make a good time at a cost consistent with her pocketbook is doing a fine social service — over and above the mere fun of the occasion. ■ This afternoon we are planning a party for young people that can be adapted to any age almost, and any season. We call it a SCOTCH PARTY and thus take advantage of the prevailing desire for thrift in- every amusing way possible. You will, of course, think of many changes and additions, we aim merely to set the ball rolling. The invitations are on note paper with a gay little picture at the top. They say — Mr. and Mrs. — (Yourself) — invite Mr. and Mrs. Blank . to a Scotch Dinner on the evening of — at seven o'clock Old clothes requested Please reply (Or, please wear old clothes) Some of the replies when we gave the party were very amusing, our guests having gone to the trouble to hunt up postal cards from Scotland and sent acceptances on those. Others wrote on brown wrapping paper (very thrifty those), while a couple of others made the usual formal replies. The guests appeared in equally different array. Some wore everyday sport clothes; two; of the men wore hunt - ing and riding clothes, some girls wore gingham work dresses and others went to considerable effort to put great patches on their frocks, making them look very ancient and well preserved. This small amount of dressing up is no more trouble than one wants to take and it does help a party get started when there is something amusing to </seg>
            <seg id="p415">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION talk about from the minute of arrival. When everyone had arrived we asked the men to go to a table In the hall and get their instructions. There they found place cards of Scotch Highlanders, clipped to bags of potato chips. The cards were for the men and each card had on it also the name of the man's dinner partner. The card said, for instance, "Will Mac Jones take Miss Mac Smith to dinner in Glasgow?" That was a bit puzzling but, of course, Mr. Jones could at least hunt up Miss Smith and puzzle about it with her. While he was doing that, we quickly set up folding card tables in the living room, covered them with plaid crepe paper covers, put on paper cups, forks, spoons, etc. In the center of each table, we stood, tent fashion, pictures of cities in Scotland. These pictures were cut from travel advertisements and mounted on cardboard. There was an Edinburg table, a Glasgow table, and an Aberdeen table. Had we had more than twelve guests we could easily have found pictures of more cities. Watching us as they hunted partners, the guests soon found where they were to sit. Then we asked the men to go to the pantry and get their dinner. This was a box lunch put up separately for each person, so every man got two boxes. We might have put the dinner up for couples, one box for each couple, but we chose to do each person's alone. While they opened boxes and began dinner, I went around with a great enamelled coffee pot we have and filled cups with hot coffee. Then I set the pot back on the stove to keep the coffee warm for "seconds" later. Each box contained a piece of fried chicken, carefully wrapped in paraffin paper and topped with a frilled paper for safe handling, four sandwiches, an olive, a pickle, a radish, and some salted nuts. The sandwiches were egg salad, nut bread and butter, whole wheat bread with cottage cheese filling and white bread with jam. Each sandwich was half of two whole slices. If you liked, you could use two sandwiches of a kind instead of one each of four sorts. All this, you see, could be prepared and packed during the afternoon so that the hostess would have nothing to do at the last minute but to make the coffee and bring in the boxes from a cool place where they had been kept. If your party is an afternoon or evening party instead of a dinner, do not have as much as a piece of chicken and sandwiches. I would make the sandwiches small and dainty, use smaller boxes (which, by the way, can be bought in several sizes at the dime store). For instance, have one sandwich with a ham filling or peanut butter, a cheese and egg salad, a jam with cottage cheese and a brown bread with lettuce. Then have a small paper cup of fruit salad (well-drained so that it is not goo— ey) and use paper forks for service. </seg>
            <seg id="p416">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ■ I When the first course was finished we -went around -with a great basket and gathered up plates and debris and then invited the men to the pantry again where they were given plates containing a slice of ice cream and a generous piece of chocolate cake with cocoanut marsh - mallow icing, also tiny little paper hags of small candies. I passed "seconds" of coffee and my son-in-law refilled the cups of water. : . When they finished we quickly gathered up all debris, table covers, and everything, folded up tables and gave each guest a small bag. We had hidden three hundred pennies on the first floor (excepting the kitchen) and they were given fifteen minutes in which to see who could find the most. The prize was one cent and the rest of the pennies were returned (in real Scotch fashion). Then we had a treasure hunt which took them all over the house, yard, garage, and basement before they found the prize, a can of salted nuts, hidden in a golf bag behind the front door. Do you know how to plan a treasure hunt? Select about eight good places for hiding clues; such as under the bird bath in the garden, in a fork of a tree in the front yard; in the cover of the spare tire in the garage, under the corner of the dining room rug and such. Deckle on the order you will use, choosing what will take your guests over the most ground — from front yard to garage, to dining room, to garden, to basement and so on. Then write the clues on cards, one for each person playing. If you are clever at jingles, make the clues in rhyme, though plain English is quite all right. Silly phrases might be such as this: "To the garage run as fast as you dare and you'll find there's a clue to spare." Don't be afraid to make them fairly hard; someone is sure to guess and start the bunch going. After the treasure hunt we played "Sailing". That is the old fashioned game of sitting around in a circle, being numbered one, two, three, etc. The person who is IT is blind-folded and stands in. the middle. When all is ready, we sing, "Sailing, sailing over the briny deep," and while we sing, IT shouts two numbers and those two try to change seats without being caught. Then we play "Sardines", a modified hide-and-seek. In the game the house is darkened, only a single light in some hallway being allowed. "IT" has a count of thirty for hiding, then all start the hunt.' As soon as IT is discovered, the lucky person, instead of shout - ing victory as in other hunts, noiselessly slips into the hiding place along with IT. Gradually the crowd roaming through the house dim - inishes until finally, almost all are packed like sardines in some small place and the game is up. The person who found IT first is now IT and has the fun of trying a new place. It is a jolly game and loads of fun, but be sure to set the limits of the space, as for instance, first and second floor, or first floor and atic; otherwise it will be too hard to be fun. </seg>
            <seg id="p417">XEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION' This whole Scotch party is fun to do in a barn if you have one or in a church or club parlor for a larger group, because everything can be planned and made ready ahead of time. We had ours last summer when we could eat on the porch. Do not do much decorating as that is not truly 'Scotch'. It also is a good kind for a Hallowe'en Party and needs only a few minor changes in details to work it out for that night. Use Hallowe'en napkins, small candy corn, and goblins for place cards instead of Scotchmen. I hope you will have the fun in giving it that we did. If you do, you will want to have another very soon. Nut Brend (Used in making the sandwiches) To 1 % c. whole wheat flour add 1 '4 c. white flour sifted with Vj c. sugar, 4 teaspoons baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt. Add two eggs, 1 cup milk and 1 cup broken nut meats. Blend to a soft dough and pour into two small buttered bread pans. Let stand fifteen minutes, then bake 4 5 minutes in a moderate oven (350°). Bake the day before if the bread is to be used for sandwiches. Made with sour milk add '/i teaspoonful soda when sifting the dry ingredients. Other recreation suggested included a daily nap whenever possible; walks out-of-doors when one forgets home duties, a trip away alone if only for a half day, exchanging duties with a relative or neighbor. As a means of using leisure to create something beautiful it was suggested to make rugs — hooked, crochet, or knitted; knitted gar - ments; screens; table linen such as embroidered luncheon sets; well - marked linen; handmade underwear; Christmas cards; Easter cards made with wild flowers and to which a bit of seed for the particular flower used is attached; garden; beautify the house. Several spoke of the^joy of collecting something as a special hobby and among such were mentioned — stones picked up by the roadside and made into a rock garden; poems; plants for house or garden; recipes; baskets; vases; old glasswear; utensils; embroideries; toys; dolls; samplers; furniture; pictures of Powers; maps, and many other inter - esting things. And so it goes, all of us realizing that not idleness but change of occupation is the source of fun. What we need is not to be free from work; that would be deadly, but rather, freedom to do work that is our particular pleasure and joy. Freedom to play some every day, freedom to read, freedom for friendships. Tomorrow we shall talk more about the importance of a hobby and the value of putting free time into our plan for living. For today let us go home, enjoying all these fine ideas and re - membering that work alone does not make a complete day; something </seg>

THE NEBRASKA ECONOMIC SITUATION PROFESSOR H. C. FILLEY The Nebraska economic situation is far from satisfactory. The prices of farm products are low and the outlook for materially better prices is not encouraging. Because retail prices have not fallen as </seg>
            <seg id="p419">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION rapidly as the price of farm products, the purchasing power of farm products is very low. According to the Bureau of Agricultural Economics of the United States Department of Agriculture, farm product prices in November were only fifty-four per cent of the five pre-war years, August, 1909 — July, 1914. Prices paid by farmers during November were 106 per cent of pre-war. The purchasing power of farmers for the month was fifty-one (fifty-four divided by one hundred six). The highest .purchasing power of farm products during 1932 was fifty-five in Sep - tember. The average purchasing power of farm products was sixty - three in 1931, eighty in 1930, and eighty-nine in 1929. These figures are averages for the United States as a whole. Be - cause of the distance which Nebraska products must be shipped to market, our average prices are lower than for the nation. The charges for transporting and handling farm products have decreased but little during the past three years. When prices are low, Nebraska farmers receive a much smaller part of the terminal market price than when prices are high. The purchasing power of Nebraska farmers is, there - fore, materially lower than the average for the United States. Probably every farm woman who is present is familiar with cur - rent prices for corn, wheat, hogs, cattle, and other farm products. You know all too well what these prices mean when translated into the purchase of supplies for the farm business and farm home. The general business outlook is not bright. Business activity in recent months has been only about fifty-four per cent of normal. Prob - ably a larger number of men and women are without employment than at any time since the beginning of the depression. Relief agencies are being drawn upon to the limit to provide food, clothing, and shelter for the needy millions. Public funds will undoubtedly be used this winter for poor relief to a greater extent than during any preceding period. In spite of low prices, decreased purchasing power and high taxes, Nebraska farm folks are in a more favorable situation than are large groups of people in many other states. Crops were abundant in the major portion of the state, and as a result there is no food shortage. While the majority of farm families have become accustomed to buy - ing a much larger part of their food supplies than the early pioneers, it is possible to return quite largely to a "live at home" program. The farm family that is not burdened with debts and which is living on home-produced foods is in an enviable position compared with the city family who have no income or even compared with the farmer in a one-crop region. </seg>
            <seg id="p420">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Most of us are as interested in the economic outlook as we are in the present economic situation. In order to predict what is apt to happen in the future it is necessary to study what has happened in the past. What are the causes of our present unhappy condition? To what extent, if any, could the depression have been avoided or lightened? What remedies are available to bring back a return of our ordinary prosperity? There were, in the United States, between 1800 and 1931 three periods of very high prices, each of which was followed by a period of lower prices. The first of these periods came during the Napoleonic Wars. The high point in prices was reached in 1814 while we were engaged in the second war with Great Britain and just before the de - feat of Napoleon at the Battle of the Nations. The second period of high prices came during the Civil War. The high point came in the spring of 1S65. The third period came during and following the World war. The high point in prices was reached in May, 1920. The fall in prices following each one of these periods of inflation was very rapid for a few years. The rapid decline which followed the Napoleonic Wars and the Civil War was followed in turn by a long continued irregular and rather slow decline. If history repents itself, the price level following the World War will continue to decline for at least ten years longer and very likely for twenty years longer. We certainly have no reason to believe that the price level will rise at any time in the near future to the levels prevailing during the post - war inflation, or even to the level that was maintained from 1923 to 1929 unless some governmental stimulant is applied. Prices have declined not only in the United States but in foreign countries. The truth is that the world price level is declining. There is at present no reason to expect that the decline will be stopped be - fore prices reach the pre-war level. Statisticians who are interested in business cycles and price levels have assembled considerable evi - dence which indicates that prices will not be stabilized permanently until they are considerably below the 1914 level. Kvils of Unstable Prices. One of the unfortunate things about changes in the price level is that commodities do not rise and fall at the same rate. For example, between 1915 and 1919 the price of farm products rose more rapidly than did the price of goods purchased at retail. Wages, salaries, trasportation, and various other costs of doing business rose more slow - ly during most of this period than did either retail prices or farm prices. This period was therefore a satisfactory period for the pro- </seg>
            <seg id="p421">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION ducer of agricultural products and also satisfactory from the stand - point of merchants and manufacturers. When prices fell during the last half of 1920 and 19 21, farm prices fell much more rapidly and fell farther than did retail prices. The cost of distributing goods has remained high during all this pe - riod. This has, therefore, been a very unsatisfactory period for farm - ers, since they have received a lower price relatively for their products than they have had to pay for goods which they purchase. In other words, farm products have been low in purchasing power. The wages and salaries of men engaged in distribution, rent, telephone charges, fuel, transportation charges, and other costs of distributing goods have remained high. Those of us who live in the Middle "West and whose welfare depends very largely upon the purchasing power of farm products are in a position to understand the seriousness of this situa - tion for Middle Western farmers and incidentally the seriousness of the situation for the region as a whole. Most of us are dependent either directly or indirectly for our prosperity upon the purchasing power of farm products. It is the farm products that we ship out of the state, the wheat, butter, livestock, meat, eggs, and other products of our farms that must pay for the coal, lumber, gasoline, groceries, furniture, clothing, and other articles that are shipped into the state from the outside. An overwhelming majority of the residents of Nebraska cannot be prosperous unless farm products have a relatively satisfactory purchasing power. Very fortunately the price level does not determine the prosperity of the United States as a whole. Very unfortunately, changes in the price level do affect the relative prosperity of individuals within the United States. When ever the price level rises rapidly as it did from 1915 to 1920, everyone who works for wages or a fixed salary is los - ing because wages always lag behind prices. People who had their savings invested in notes or bonds or life insurance or in savings accounts also lost heavily during this period because these savings in 19 20 would not buy nearly as large an amount of the necessities of life as they would have bought back in 1914. On the other hand, men who were engaged in trade or manufacture, or men who had In - vestments in livestock, or land, or business buildings prospered during these years because of the rapid rise in the value of their property. During a period of falling prices, the effects of rising prices are reversed. Manufacturers and merchants suffer because of the de - cline in the value of raw materials and manufactured goods. Farm - ing is more depressed than other industries because of the long period of production and also because farmers cannot control production. Borrowers lose and lenders gain. Since wages and salaries lag behind prices, the workers who are fortunate enough to have employment </seg>
            <seg id="p422">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE are ,prosperous because of the Increase in their purchasing power. i Money and Prices. One of the most important forces which affect the price level is the volume of money in circulation. It is commonly stated that if other factors remain the same, prices tend to vary directly with the quantity of money and money substitutes In circulation. In other words, if our circulation per capita should be doubled, prices would double. If the circulation should be cut in two, then prices would be lowered one-half. In 1014, at the beginning of the World War, our per capita circulation was $34.92. In November, 1920, it was $52. .1(5 — an increase of about fifty per cent. The extension of credit and the use of credit instruments as money has the same effect upon prices as an increase in the volume of money. During the war Federal government borrowed about twenty-five bil - lion dollars and during the post-war inflation almost everyone seemed to believe that about all that was necessary in order to become wealthy was to borrow money and invest it. The policy of the Federal gov - ernment to make credit easy in order to keep interest rates low was a very potent cause of the high level of prices in 1918 and 1919. In fact, as you all know, the financing of the Victory Loan in the spring of 1919 was followed almost immediately by a rapid rise in the price level. Government bonds and other credit instruments were utilized as money to a limited extent and doubtless helped to increase the price level. Another factor affecting prices is the rapidity with which money circulates. Doubling the rapidity of circulation has the same effect as doubling the amount of money in circulation. During the World War and the post-war inflation, we not only had an actual increase of about fifty per cent in the volume of money in circulation, hut we had also a very great increase in the rapidity of circulation. Almost everyone seemed anxious to spend money as rapidly as it was earned, and thousands of men who were in business at that time are willing to bear evidence that it was not difficult to find men who were perfectly willing to spend money before it was earned. This speeding up of the circulation of money was a very potent factor in causing the high prices of the post-war inflation period. A great war also increases the demand for certain kinds of goods. This is another reason for the very high prices of these three periods. Only a small amount of money is needed to carry on a small volume of business. The greater volume, of business, the larger the amount of money needed to take care of the exchanges. It is, threfore, obvious that the value of money tends to vary directly with the amount of trade. </seg>
            <seg id="p423">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Gold Production and Prices. The United States and nearly all other nations use gold as a stand - ard of value. The paper money of a nation is accepted at its face value as long as the government of that country is able to exchange gold money for paper currency upon demand. Whenever a nation cannot redeem its paper currency on demand, the paper money is accepted only at a discount. The United States suspended the pay - ment of gold for United States notes from 1861 until January 1, 1879. Germany, Austria, France, Italy, Great Britain, and several other nations were unable to pay their notes on presentation during the World War and therefore the paper money went below par. Only recently Great Britain has again suspended gold mayments, and as a result the paper pound is worth only about two-thirds as much as a gold pound. In order to maintain paper money in circulation on a parity with Kold a nation must have a considerable gold reserve. The United States treasury maintains a minimum gold reserve of 150,000,000 with which to redeem the greenbacks now outstanding which amount to $346,681,016. The Federal Reserve Banks are required to maintain a gold reserve of at least forty per cent against the notes outstanding and a gold reserve of 'at least thirty-five per cent against deposits. Their present reserve of over $2,000,000,000 is considerably in excess of the legal requirements. Since a gold reserve is necessary in order that paper currency may be kept at par, it is obvious that the amount of paper currency which may be kept in circulation at par is limited by the amount of gold available as a reserve. In the final analysis the amount of money which circulates freely at its face value is limited by the amount of gold coin and gold bullion which the various nations possess. The money supply of the world is based primarily upon gold. Attention has already been called to the fact that the amount of money in circulation is one of the three factors upon which the gen - eral price level depends. It is, therefore, obvious that the world stock of monetary gold is one of the factors which determine the general level of prices. If gold is abundant and cheap, the prices of other commodities are high. If gold is scarce and dear the prices of other commodities are low. Two other important factors which help to de - termine prices are, as has been previously stated, the velocity of the circulation, of money and the volume of business to be transacted. Whenever the stock of monetary gold in the world increases more rapidly than the volume of business the price level rises. Whenever the increase in the world supply of monetary gold proceeds more slowly than the increase in business, the price level falls. The preced- </seg>
            <seg id="p424">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARb OF AGRICULTURE Ing statements are based not alone upon theory but upon the relation- . ship that has existed between the world's stocks of monetary gold and the wholesale price level for the past ninety years. The population of the world is increasing and business is increasing more rapidly than population. It is, therefore, evident that the world's stock of money must increase if the price level is to be maintained. But the amount of gold mined in a year is not increasing. The amount added to the money stocks of the world is not* proportionate to the increase in business. The world has, in fact, about ten per cent less gold in proportion to business transacted than it had in 1913. Predictions are made that supplies of new gold will soon decrease due to an exhaustion of ore bodies in some of our important mines. The use of gold for jewelry and other purposes besides coinage has increased. It seems quite evident that we must transact an increasing amount of business with a smaller per capita supply of gold coin. It, therefore, seems inevitable that prices will continue to fall unless new gold deposits are discovered. Return of Nations to Gold Standard Increased the Demand for Gold The failure of the world supply of monetary gold to keep pace with increasing needs is not the only reason, and probably not the prin - cipal reason for the decline in the price of other commodities in terms of gold, or to put it another way, for^the rise in the value of gold. There was an unusual demand for gold for several years due to the desire of several European nations to get back on a gold basis. In order to do this it was necessary for each nation to accumulate a gold reserve. India decided to change to a gold base at this most inop - portune time and increased even further the demand for sold. Now all of these nations are striving to maintain their accuniulated re - serve. England has been unable to maintain a sufficient reserve to remain on the gold standard. Our High Protective Tariff. In international trade, goods are paid for primarily with goods. Almost the entire stock of monetary gold outside the United States would have been required to pay for our 1929 exports. Restrictions on Imports almost automatically restrict exports because no nation can continue to buy goods from other nations for any length of time for which it must pay in gold. The results of extensive international gold payments may have a decided effect on the general level of com - modity prices. The British in a note written December 1 made the following statement: "The creditors, in so far as they have refused acceptance of pay- </seg>
            <seg id="p425">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION ment in goods, have compelled their creditors to pay in gold. This has led to a drain on the gold reserves of many countries, and this in turn has forced up the price of gold in terms of commodities, or In other words, has forced down the price of commodities in terms of gold currencies. "This fall in prices has caused widespread ruin to producers In debtor and creditor countries alike and threatens disastrous social and political repercussions." Our high protective policy is one of the reasons why farm product prices have dropped farther than the prices of the commodities that farmers buy. Agricultural exports have been of importance to Ameri - can agriculture since early colonial times. Although agricultural products have comprised a smaller part of our total exports in recent years then when our manufacturing industries were in their infancy, they are, nevertheless, of vital importance to agricultural producers. During the ten-year period ending June 30, 1931, the United States produced more than fifty-five per cent of the total world production of cotton and exported approximately flfty-four per cent of these ten crops. The value of these cotton exports aveiaged more than three - fourths of a billion dollars a year. The United States is also the world's largest exporter of tobacco and pork. Our wheat exports ordinarily average about 200,000,000 bushels a year. In the five-year period, 19 26-193 0, inclusive, our exports of fruits amounted on the average to more than $120,000,000 a year. Our exports have been unusually small in 1931 and this has left an increasing quantity for home consumption with a resultant decline in price. The increase in the tariff in 1930 made the importation of goods into this country more difficult and as a result it is now im - possible to sell any considerable amount of farm products abroad. Our Cheap Money Policy. Mention has already been made of the injurious effects of our cheap money policy from our entry into the "World War until the early summer of 1920. Prices rose and debts increased. Some persons suffered because of the inflation and others suffered during the sub - sequent deflation. The continuation of this cheap money policy from 1922 to 1929 was a prime cause of part of our present troubles. The cheap money policy enabled us to sell abroad in spite of our high tariff. Some of the foreign nations which had no gold to send us and whose goods we would not take were perfectly willing to take our goods as long as we would sell on credit. Foreign in - vestments abroad aside from the Federal War Loans increased from about $2,500,000,000 in 1914 to about $17,500,000,000 at the begin- </seg>
            <seg id="p426">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ning of 1931. This foreign investment, the major part of which was made as loans, represented an excess of exports over imports. Even the payments made to the Federal government on the allied loan were possible only because we loaned capital abroad. This "cheap" money policy was also responsible for an appalling growth of public and private debts. States, counties, cities and school districts have voted bonds freely, doubtless hoping that debt payment would be easy when the bonds came due. There has also been a large increase in mortgage indebtedness and as one of the results many banks have heavy investments in real estate mortgages. The over issue of securities and our fantastic stock market speculations were also among the results of the "easy money" policy. Last but not least the rapid growth of installment finance would hardly have been possible under a system where loans were more difficult to secure and purchasers were not educated to believe in the credit policy aptly expressed in the phrase "pay as you ride". Inter-Allied Debt Payments. As a matter of course, the only way in which final payment of the inter-allied debts can be made i.s with goods. For individual Ameri - cans to loan money to Europeans in order that European governments can make a payment to the American government does not alter the fundamental fact that ultimately we must accept goods, if the debt is paid. Probably the United States would be better off to cancel, the debts, as they are a handicap to international trade, and the possibility of collecting any considerable part of them is decidedly remote. Wo Have Been Prosperous. Before proceeding further in our analysis of the present situation it would doubtless be advisable to anaylze the causes of national pros - perity. If we can determine why the United Spates or any other nation has been prosperous in past years, it will aid us in solving the present economic dilemma. The truth is that for more than one hundred years the United States has been one of the most prosperous nations. Perhaps no other nation has ever made as great an advance in material prosperity in one hundred forty-three years as the United States has made since the inauguration of Washington as president on April 30, 17S3. It is true that there have been periods of depression when times have been hard, but these periods have usually lasted but a few years and then the country has gone ahead with work for all who wished to work and has furnished an abundance of food, clothing, shelter, and the other good things of life for all of the willing workers. The primary reasons for our remarkable increase in wealth has </seg>
            <seg id="p427">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION been the rapid exploitation of our great national resources. Yve naa originally great forest resources, and we have used them as rapidly as our needs required. We have great mineral resources — iron, cop - per, lead, zinc, aluminum, gold, silver, coal, and petroleum. We have water power, only a part of which has so far been utilized. We have large areas of fertile soil. The great Mississippi-Missouri valley con - tains more acres of fertile soil now in cultivation than is to be found at the present time under cultivation in any area of equal extent any - where in tlie world. In spite of the fact that some parts of the United States have too much rainfall, and other parts too little; in spite of the long winters in the northern states and the long summers in the South; in spite of hot winds and early frosts, rainy days and winter blizzards, the United States has, on the whole, a climate that is not only favorable for crop production but among the more favored regions for the habitation ol man. We have neither the extreme heat of the tropics nor the cold of the artic regions. The rnpid exploitation of our resources rests primarily upon two factors — the application of science and the utilization of labor-saving machinery. Because of the intelligent application of science we have decreased the cost of producing crops and livestock. We know how to control such fungus diseases as potato scab, cedar rust, and ergot. We are also controlling such livestock diseases as black leg and hog cholera. We have learned how to decrease losses caused by such in - sects and animal parasites as the coddling moth, round worm, and Colorado potato beetle. We have learned many things about the feed - ing and care of livestock. Animal breeders have given us hogs and cattle that mature more rapidly than their ancestors of one hundred years ago, and have increased the productivity of our dairy cows. Because of the scientific knowledge and painstaking care of our plant breeders, we have new and improved varieties of apples, wheat, corn, and many other plants. No other country uses as much labor saving machinery in propor - tion to population as does the United States. For example, if we take China as a base, and say that her power used in production for each person is one, then the power used for each person in British India is one and one-half, in Holland, nine, in Great Britain, twenty, and in the United States, thirty. Without the multiplication of our man power through the use of machinery, the United States would not be able to produce anywhere nearly so much per person. It has been previously stated that because of the rapid exploita - tion of our natural resources, aided by science and labor-saving ma - chinery, the United States has become a wealthy nation. It must be remembered that wealth is not merely money, although we ordinarily </seg>
            <seg id="p428">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE use the dollar as a measure of wealth. In years past, it has some - times been proposed to increase the amount of paper money in cir - culation upon the theory that it might be possible in that way to add to the -wealth of the people of the United States. The Federal Gov - ernment might print and place in circulation five billion dollars In paper money during the next year but that would not increase our wealth. Wealth is not paper money. "Wealth is a stock or fund of accumulated goods," — land, buildings, cattle, machinery, household furniture, merchandise, and the like. The farms and farm buildings of Nebraska are wealth; the business blocks and residences of our cities are wealth; the railways and paved streets are wealth; the auto - mobiles and power plants are wealth; the stocks of merchandise in our stores, the grain in our bins, the livestock in the feed yards, the furniture in our homes, and the innumerable things that we buy and sell and use and find necessary to our daily welfare are all wealth. Aside from natural resources the wealth of a nation consists of things that man has produced. The greater the quantity of useful things that are produced in a country, the greater the wealth' of that country. The United States has less than seven per cent of the world's population, but we produce a surprisingly large per cent of some of the more important commodities. The per cent for 19 29 was as follows: Per Cent of the 1920 World Production Produced in the United States Commodity Per Cent Copper . 4 S.7 Pig Iron r&gt;2. G Lead ... 3 5.5 Coal .'. 35.9 Petroleum (J7.G Wheat 19.0 Corn 5 S . 0 Cotton 56.0 We own more than seventy-five per cent of the automobiles in the world, more than sixty-one per cent of the telephones, and thirty-three per cent of the railroad mileage. These material possessions are in themselves a proof that someone has produced abundantly and effici - ently. The way that any nation becomes wealthy is by producing. In the nations that produce but a small amount of useful goods for each worker we are apt to find poverty, famine, pestilence, and a low and unsatisfactory standard of living. If you have any doubts upon this </seg>
            <seg id="p429">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION point, compare conditions in China or India with conditions in the United States. Because we have such wonderful natural resources and can utilize our laborers so efficiently, it is very evident that by working thirty hours per week, or even twenty hours, we could maintain a higher living standard than is maintained in China or India where the laborers work twice that many hours per week. The important question is not would it be possible to live, but would it be possible for each of us to have anywhere near all of the useful things that we wish? Think for just a minute. Do you have everything that you wish, or would you like a new auto, or a larger house, or a greater variety of clothing? Could you find space in your cupboard for some more fine china, and accept the work of some great artist to adorn the walls of your home? How about the young folks in your home of high school or college age? Do they not have unsatisfied wants; books, clothing, automobiles, and innumerable other things? Think again of the num - ber of people in Nebraska who are less fortunately situated than those of us who are gathered in this pleasant room. Their needs are legion and the only reason that they do not satisfy these needs is because they cannot. No General Ovcr-Production. We have been hearing many comments lately about over-produc - tion. How can there be such a thing as general over-production when there are so many miles of Nebraska highways that need surfacing, so many houses that need painting, so many persons who need nourish - ing food, and so many little children who need warm clothing? There is doubtless an over-production of a few perishable products such as grapes and of things that people no longer desire, but it is impossible to believe that we have produced too much of all kinds of useful goods. In Nebraska alone there are more than 100,000 farms that do not have running water or electric lights and an even greater number without bathtubs or sanitary sewerage. Here Is a great potential market for plumbing equipment, electric plants, electric washing ma - chines, vacuum cleaners, feed grinders, and a long list of other labor - saving devices for which farm families have long felt a need. Over-production is certainly not the major cause of our present unhappy economic situation. Maladjustment of production and of our economic organization is a very potent cause. There Is a real need for all the books, bathtubs, cement, lumber, furniture, and shoes that are on the shelves or in the warehouse of Nebraska merchants awaiting purchasers. It is quite commonly believed that there has been an enormous </seg>
            <seg id="p430">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE increase in agricultural production in recent years. The facts are that our per capita production of food and feed crops has been decreasing since 1915. There is, to be sure, a decreased need for certain feed crops because of the rapid change from horse power to gasoline power. The fact remains that even when allowance is made for any possible decrease in the need of food and feed crops because of the decreased number of horses, the per capita production is materially smaller than in 1915. . The Causes of Our Troubles. No one can fail to notice that there has been some overlapping in this discussion of the causes of our present troubles. The causes may be listed as follows: 1. The low purchasing power of farm products. 2. The fiscal policy of the Federal government from 1917 to early 1920 which resulted in a very severe inflation. 3. The failure of the world's supply of monetary gold to keep pace with the needs of business. 4. The inter-allied war debts. 5. Restrictions placed upon international trade. 6. Easy money policy of the Federal government from lit 2 2 to 1929, with resultant speculation, unwise borrowing, and installment buying. 7. Maladjustment. To this list may be added the present system of state and local taxation which puts practically all the burden upon real estate. Sonic Possible Remedies. Nearly all sick persons are more interested in possible remedies for their ills than in learning the cause of the disease. The sumo reason- 1 - ing doubtless applies to the economic ills of the present day. There are only two avenues by which the purchasing power of farm products can be increased: 1. By an increase in the price of products. 2. By a decrease in the price of goods that farmers buy. As a matter of course, the first method is to be preferred since it will make debt payment easier, but if the first cannot be achieved, then let us by all means have the other alternative. </seg>
            <seg id="p431">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Among the reasons for the relative slow decline in the pnuu ui manufactured goods are the high costs of transportation, and the slowness with which city rents, industrial wages, and capital accounts have been reduced. It is probably impossible for the railways to reduce their rates as long as hourly wage scales remain at more than double pre-war. Since living costs have fallen materially, money wages can be reduced without reducing real wages. The tendency in many industries has been to reduce hours of labor without reducing wages per hour. This distributes labor but does not lower the cost of production and thereiore does not alleviate the existing maladjustments. ■ , Farm rents have fallen, and city rents must fall in order to reduce the overhead costs of merchants and permit overhead costs to be reduced. City property owners are trying to maintain rents at a high level when the prices of raw materials have fallen to a low level o£ prices. Industrial profits were very large from 1922 to 1929, and as a result industrial stocks rose to a high level, and the capitalization of many corporations was greatly expanded. The Annalist has for many years published a record of stock prices. The average end-of-month prices of twenty-five representative industrial stocks for 1913 was $5S.71. The average closing price of these same stocks in August, 1929, was $449.44, and the average closing price December 14, 1932, was §93.22. These prices take into consideration stock dividends that have been made since 1913. Present day prices of stocks are much lower than in 1929, but the present price of these twenty-five representative stocks averaged, on December 14, more than fifty-eight per cent higher than the average end of the month price during the last pre-war year. A comparison of the price of these stocks with the price of farm land is particularly striking. It would seem that income from stocks must be relatively high as compared with income from farm land. Changing the Price Level. National prosperity does not depend upon the price level but upon the amount of real wealth owned within a country and its distribution among all the people. The citizens of the United States could be pros - perous on a high price level or a low price level. Prosperity Is affected by fluctuations in the price level. Wages always lag behind prices, with the result that labor, particularly skilled labor, loses during in - flation and gains during deflation — providing that the laborer is for - tunate enough to have a full time job. The borrower gains during In - flation and those with fixed incomes suffer. During deflation thrift is unduly rewarded, fixed incomes gain, and borrowers lose. Any im- </seg>
            <seg id="p432">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE poriant change in the price level, whether up or down, always results in a redistribution of purchasing power. Some persons gain and other persons lose. It is too late to remedy the losses and suffering that resulted from the period of inflation that ended in 1920. That period of in - flation is too far past. The question that merits present consideration is whether or not it is possible to end the present deflation and stabilize prices it a level somewhat above pre-war. Men who incurred debts when prices were one hundred fifty per cent or even fifty per cent above pre-war find it difficult to meet their obligations now that prices have fallen to a much lower level. Men who are in (debt for farm land are particularly hard hit. One suggestion that has been made is that the Federal govern - ment instead of securing further short time loans to meet current ex - penditures should issue greenbacks. We have sufficient gold reserves that it would doubtless be possible to increase the amount of green - backs in circulation by one billion dollars, or possibly by even two billion dollars without any danger of the paper money being dis - counted. The fact is that probably not less than a billion dollars that should be in circulation is in hiding &gt; so that the issuing of paper money in the amounts suggested would serve primarily to stop further deflation and would produce only a slight inflationary effect. Any legislation authorizing an increase in the amount of United States notes outstanding should contain provisions for withdrawing the notes from circulation at the close of the present emergency. It was stated near the beginning of this paper that one reason for the decline in world prices is the failure of the supply of monetary gold to increase as rapidly as volume of business. In years past some nations have used silver as a standard of value and other nations have attempted to use gold and silver as a double standard. The double standard has been unsatisfactory because of the impossibility of any single nation maintaining a fixed ratio between gold and silver. It would undoubtedly be possible for a group of strong nations to use both gold and silver, providing the ratio were made high enough. Under such conditions the demand for silver would increase its value in terms of gold. It is. probably that the ratio could be stabilized at forty to one or possibly even lower. It should, of course, be placed high enough that there would be no danger of silver driving gold out of circulation. If gold should drive silver out of circulation we would be in no worse condition than we are at present. A third method by which the price level can be increased is to decrease the amount of gold in a dollar. This method was used by France and Italy following the World War and was endorsed by the </seg>
            <seg id="p433">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION American Farm Bureau Federation at its annual meeting in Decem - ber, 1932. There is no question but that it would work. Changing the amount of gold hi a dollar from 23.22 grains, the present weight, to 16 grains as proposed by the Farm Bureau Federation would re - sult in an increase of approximately fifty per cent in the price level and would make easier the payment of all debts that do not stipulate a given weight of gold. The plan has the disadvantage of changing a monetary standard which is more than a century old and of causing lenders to fear that possibly future changes may be made. A Proposed Remedy That Would Hurt Agriculture Perhaps no one of the remedies for the depression which has been mentioned so far in this discussion has received such wide publicity as the proposal to legalize beer and then proceed to repeal the Eighteenth Amendment and all supporting state and national statutes. A proposal that has been made so widely advocated as a "sure cure" is certainly deserving of the attention of all thoughful men and women. It is unnecessary to spend any considerable amount of time in proving to the satisfaction of a group of homemakers that it is mani - festly impossible for a person to spend a single dollar of his income twice. We are necessarily limited to a choice among possible ex - penditures. If we spend a dollar of our income for one thing, then we cannot spend that same dollar for something else. It is, therefore, very evident that if the Eighteenth Amendment and supporting legislation is repealed and large sums are expended for beer and other alcoholic beverages, that there will be that much less money to spend for other commodities. The repealists are responsible for the oft-repeated statement that agriculture will be benefited by the repeal of the Eighteenth Amend - ment because of the large amount of grain which will be used in the manufacture of liquor. The increase in demand will remove all sur - plus grain from the market and result in a material increase in price. Very fortunately fairly definite statistics concerning the amount of grain formerly used for brewing and distilling are available. The brewers themselves testified before a congressional committee in 1917 that never in any one year had as much as three-fourths of one per cent of the grain produced in the United States in any one year been used in brewing. About the same amount was used in the manufacture of distilled liquor. The total consumption of grain would therefore in all' probability not exceed one and one-half per cent ol our grain production. This might be a worth while reduction to present sup - plies &gt; but there are other facts to consider. ■ </seg>
            <seg id="p434">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE xne consumption 1 of milk, as a beverage has Increased from ap - proximately forty-two gallons per capita in pre-Volstead days to ap - proximately sixty gallons per capita in recent years. Probably this increase is due to some extent to a better knowledge of the food value of milk, but it is unquestionably due in major part to the substitution of milk for beer as a part of the noon lunch for hundreds of thousands of men and to several millions of mothers being able to buy milk more freely than was possible when a part of the family income was ex - pended for alcoholic liquor. There has also been an increase in butter consumption and cheese consumption during the past twelve years. Anyone who is interested in the sale of milk or butterfat has a very definite financial interest in the liquor legislation now pending before Congress. In producing this increased amount of milk and other dairy pro - ducts more grain is consumed by the cows than the amount that could possibly be used in manufacturing alcoholic liquor. The cows also utilize forage crops — hay and pasture that are grown on a consid - erable acreage. The grain farmer, as well as the dairyman, has there - fore a definite financial interest in maintaining and enforcing present anti-liquor legislation. There has also been a very material increase in the consumption of eggs since the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment. The major. reason for this is that a larger share of the income of many families is available for the purchase of wholesome and nutritious foods. As a matter of course, increased egg production is necessarily accompa - nied by an increased consumption of grains used for poultry feeds. The statement has been made repeatedly that the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment would solve the unemployment problem. The fact is that less than half a million men were engaged in brewing, distilling, and distributing alcoholic liquors and in various allied in - dustries according to the 1900 census. It is veil known that a smaller part of the retail price of liquor is paid to labor than of the retail price of clothing, house furniture, and most foods. Liquor manu - facture and distribution employs more capitil and less labor in pro - portion to volume of business than most otlier industries. All avail - able economic evidence indicates that a return to the free use of alcoholic liquor would intensify rather than alleviate the depression. A Closing Statement. The present maladjustment existing between the price of farm products on the one hand and the price of transportation and many kinds of manufactured goods on the other hand must be remedied before we can hope for permanent prosperity in the Middle West. Measures which will aid in bringing this to pass include a decrease in </seg>
            <seg id="p435">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION tariff rates and a lowering of freight rates. The most practical method for raising the world level of prices is by the international re - monitization of silver at a ratio of perhaps thirty to one. Prices in the United States can be increased by decreasing the amount of gold in a dollar. A third method that can be used is for the Federal govern - ment to issue a large amount of paper money. If too large an amount were issued, gold would be driven from circulation. This would have several unfavorable results. When prices of manufactured goods and farm products are read - justed so that farm products have a reasonable purchasing power, trade will revive and there will be work for all producing the many goods and services which all of us need and for which we are willing to exchange our labor. Prosperity depends upon production. The world will be prosperous if sufficient goods are produced and ex - changed; it will be poor, if production is restricted. As a matter of .simple justice, the price level should be high enough so that no un - necessary burden is placed upon debtors. THIS GRANDMOTHERING BUSINESS MRS. CLARA INGRAM JUDSON What do you remember about your grandmothers? I remember mine as charming women, useful, helpful, kind and loving — oh, if only my grandchildren can have memories of me as delightful as I have of my two grandmothers, I shall feel that I have lived a successful life indeed! But it is only recently, since becoming a grandmother myself that 1 have given the slightest thought about preparing myself for this most important job. Not even in the first few days after my first grandson was born did I realize my new estate for my thought centered around my daughter so completely that, although I was happy about the baby, he did not suggest to my mind. an entirely new relationship. I have heard people say, "1 enjoy my grandchildren more than I did my own, because I have not any responsibility for them." I certainly do not feel that way. I like responsibility. I thrive on it. I like to plan and execute. One of the most significant hours of my life was on the day that my daughter, her devoted husband, and her young son came home after her hospital stay and settled down in their own home. Their plans were beautifully made, everything went well, and there just was not a thing I needed to do. It was a black hour for me. Suddenly the dismaying thought occurred — I could help them more by going home and leaving them than by staying. They were an entity without me! And I so willing — there literally was not a thing I would not have </seg>
            <seg id="p436">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE done for those three — and what they needed most after the upsetting days of the couple of weeks before she was to be alone. I recall that I sat out in the car for half an hour (and of course It would rain pitch - forks, wouldn't you just know?); well, I sat there and grew up. It did me good. But it was not easy. Then and there I learned the first lesson of being a good grandmother — to remember all the time that she is not a parent, but a grandparent^ one step removed from the joys and responsibilities, cares, fun, and work. If you are lucky enough to get this well in mind at the start, it makes everything easier from then on; but it is something that some women never do learn, so beware! i ■ That day I began wondering about this grandmother business and trying to decide what made a good one. It is as simple as A, 6, C. And A is remembering her place as grandparent, not parent. B is to remember her place and find what contribution she can make to the life of her grandchildren — what she can do without stepping out of her role as grandparent. And C to remember her place as grand - mother and to learn that most difficult lesson that absence and silence often do a finer service than anything else of which she could possibly think. Now all this I have said, and most of what I shall say later, fits to the normal circumstance when the grandchild's parents are living and are taking the care and responsibility for their own child. It is not supposed to fit the not uncommon but none the less abnormal situation wherein the parents by death or some other reason have left the child in the grandparents' care. In such a case the grandmother must try her level best to fill the place of the parents and she will have none of the problems we are talking about this morning. She will have plenty of others — but not these. In the normal run of living there are two ways of contact with grandmother — some live in the same house with the grandchildren and some do not. The grandmother who lives in the house with her grandchildren must be busy every minute, re - membering that the children's mother comes first until the attitude of mind gets so well learned that she can forget it. Before we talk more perhaps it will be fun to send our minds back over the years and discover what the changes in ideas about child raising have been in this last generation. There have been a good many. I lived in eastern Indiana, in a very small town when my babies were little and I went visiting to my mother in Chicago where I got "new ideas" every six months. We mothers of a generation ago scorned cod liver oil — it had no value at all and was only used be - cause of a hold-over reputation that science did not sponsor. Of course I did not use it. Fortunately my babies had lots of fresh air and sunshine, far more than most of the babies of my friends, and </seg>
            <seg id="p437">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION somehow we escaped rickets. But as my fine grandsons are given their cod liver oil now, three times a day, my daughters both wonder how it happens they themselves ever grew up! I took my babies out daily, rain, wind, or shine, but that was not the approved method of the day and I was considered very venturesome and queer. We were very concerned about individualism and self-expression. My husband and I thought that theory should be mixed with considerable common sense so we did not go to the lengths our friends did. But I well re - member some households where one never said "No" to a young child lest his character be warped by being thwarted; does not that notion, seem ridiculous now? Children were cared for tenderly but in a way that kept them dependent much too long. The Montesorri method came along more than twenty years ago and I recall that some of my friends were horrified at the thought of making a three-year old child undress herself, pick up toys, and eat without help. How different and how much better is the thought of today. We have learned by our mistakes that while we need to develop individuals ( these individuals must take their place in a busy world, must stand on their own feet and must respect the rights of others. I should not care to meet on the road a man who insisted on driving a car at any speed he fancied and with a complete disregard of the rule's of the road. We are happier and more successful when we respect the rights of others as well as our own. We have learned that man's first duty is to look after himself. The sooner a little child learns to feed, dress, amuse and look after himself, the sooner he will get into the habit of mind of being independent. Perhaps we were coming this way a generation ago, only the independence we talked of then too often went against law and order and the comfort of others. Now we know we must all tit together comfortably if we are to be happy. A child must learn (and the sooner the better) to control his emotions and to de - pend on himself for comfort and for inspiration; he must develop in himself a self-starter. This is not to say that he will never get sym - pathy or help; but that he must not depend upon others for what he should learn to provide for himself. The world needs men and women of strength, self-reliance and courage. We cannot begin too young to teach those qualities. Now all this is not so simple for grandmother who perhaps had quite a different notion as her goal when her children were little. Of course we wanted the fine men and women just the same and we ex - pected to get them (and lots of us have, I am glad to say) but we thought, perhaps, that we should go about it in a different way. There our grandchildren catch us at a time of life when we are groping for a job. Our immediate work of raising our family is done; we do not get any particular thrill out of amusing ourselves, we would rather work; we always have, we like work and while we may talk about </seg>
            <seg id="p438">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE wanting to quit, just try to make us! And along come the grand - children! Our own young people have their own notions and indepen - dences and want neither advice or help — but the babies are just as sweet, just as helpless, just as lovable as babies always are and our love for them comes near being our undoing! Memories come flood - ing back — we put diapers on this way (our hands could do it without our eyes looking on and the new mother fumbles at first), we fed this, we gave water so; we let them sleep when they wanted to sleep and we fed them when they were hungry. Never would we have thought of putting them to bed to "cry it out" and if we had, the neighbors would not have let us! If anyone thinks it is easy to sit back and let untried, inexperienced young parents tackle the job of caring for a baby just let them try it! It is not easy one minute. But stop and ask yourself — how did you get so experienced? What have you been doing all these years but to try to raise up a son and daughter who should be better educated, better equipped, better con - trolled than we were? Cannot you trust them now? Did not you learn by the trial and error method, and was it not better than a thousand theories? In the answers to such questions you will find your strength and your line of action. Give the parents a chance. And I will tell you a secret. If you can go about your business and keep still (not with that thin-lipped, strained stillness that is so deadly to have around but with the happy silence that admits the matter at hand is in good care) then you will get asked for help — not alw.ays, not as often as you would like, perhaps, but you will get asked. And your advice, when it is sought, will be considered; your restraint will place you in a post of dignity and honor — something YOU CANNOT GET IN ANY OTHER WAY! Now I have spoken at some length about what a grandmother's place ISN'T. What, then is it? Oh, she has a wonderful place all her own. She can back up the parents, never going behind them, never doing or allowing done what they do not approve, but reen - forcing law and order and being jolly about it so that law and order seems fun. She can win the respect of her grandchildren by being a person of distinction. By that I mean a person who thinks well of herself and who lives a happy life — in herself. Contrary to popular opinion, respect cannot bp taught; it can only be earned. A pretend respect, a surface respect can be taught, but who wants it? Real respect is earned and to get It, you must first of all respect yourself. Respect your body, keep it as beautiful as possible. Respect your clothing, keep it fresh and becoming. I remember my grandmother Ingram always dressed the same — she did not attempt to follow the mode. But she always had a lovely bit of white lace at her neck held by a pin </seg>
            <seg id="p439">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION that grandfather had given her. Her hands were scarred with work, but they were clean and soft — never grimy and hard as were the hands of some other girls' grandmothers I knew. She had no money lor fine creams but she was faithful with her mutton tallow which she skillfully rendered herself. Her hair was soft and white — not yellowed — and her scalp was healthy and pink. I recall being so proud of her distinction and good looks and, as I grew older, of her pep in keeping herself so nice looking. Grandmother must respect her own personality. She must stand on her own feet emotionally and not depend on her children. Many a woman who prides herself on money independence is an emotional bankrupt needing her children's gaiety, her children's friends to fill her life. Grandmother should plan her own recreation, have her own friends, be a person in her own right; only so can she make her place. Do not be hangers-on; let us he people of strength. If we so order our lives we can bring a real contribution to our family life, culturally, emotionally, intellectually f and in the work-a - day world. No one pretends it is easy to keep in the background when background is needed and then in a pinch, step front and pitch in to work and responsibility. No one pretends it is simple to keep still when things might go better (or so we fondly think) if we took the helm. But who wants the easy task? I do not, do you? And who can be expected to do the hard one but we who have lived? If life has not taught us something — oh, but it has! And one of the first lessons is that we can do the job that is ours at the moment. If we were to be mothers, we would be the best mothers we knew. Now that we are grandmothers, we are going to that job well, too. Just watch us! - . ■ -- ■ ■ . . . THURSDAY AFTERXOON DR.

Does a thread of achieve - ment run through the picture? Pretend that you look back over the last five years; pretend that you look ahead. Do you catch the plan of your living? If not, why? That brings us directly to our topic! Are you getting what you want out of your twenty-four hours? Do your days follow a pattern, blurred, no doubt, as you look at them closely and see your failures and bothers, but plain enough as you look back over a period of time? Do you know what you want out of your twenty-four hours Is your goal clearly in mind as you plan your days or do you just drift along, doing what seems most import - ant at the moment and having no special plan in your mind? Search - ing questions, these, and in the answers we will find ample reasons for happiness or unhappiness, for the thrill of success or the pang of failure. Generally speaking, if you 'know what you want, you can get it. This does not at all mean that if I know I want a million dollavs it will fall through the ceiling at my feet — not at all. But it does mean that If I know the kind of person I want to be, I can be that person — not in a day, not in a month, but some time. It means that if I want to accomplish certain things — be a good homemaker, or mother, or writer, or a person of culture, I can attain that goal — perhaps all of it, provided — and right here is the catch — provided that I keep my goal, my aim, clearly in my mind all the time and work toward it, shaping all my days toward it. The reason so few of us do not get what we want is twofold; first, we do not know what we want — actually know It, we have no defined purpose in living; and, second, we do not shape our days to accomplish our ends. I think more of us fall for the first reason than the second; if we know what we want In a clearly defined way, we will work until we attain it. What do you want to get out of your hours? That is too per - sonal a question for a lecturer to decide; study it out for yourself. But remember, you cannot be two conflicting persons; you cannot be a great traveller and stay at home; you cannot be a wonderfully successful home body and have all of your interest outside the home. You cannot be two people. Sometime while you are waiting for the family at mealtime, or better, sometime after the family has gone to bed, take a pencil and paper and write down what you would like to be. Then mark off conflicts and decide what of all your favorite aims you like best and then set out to attain it. Your twenty-four hours are for accomplishing what you want. Do not say that you haven't time — you have all there is! No one has more than twenty-four hours — no one has less. Time is the world's </seg>
            <seg id="p443">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION greatest democracy — we are all treated exactly alike. Yet how uiuer - ent are our our results! Does not a part ol this difference come from our lack of understanding about time? We do not even speak cor - rectly about it! We say, "I must find time!" You cannot find time! Time is. We say, "We must save time!' You cannot save time. There is just one thing you can do with time— you can use it. Time is given you every day, a brand new twenty-four hours. It is yours to use. You cannot save an hour from today and use it tomorrow; you can - not borrow from tomorrow to use today. We can only use today's time today, and tomorrow's time tomorrow. And therein lies our difficulty. Many a person could make a plan for study or work or recreation and then, given a year, could accomplish it. But to take an hour out of each day, two hours, twenty minutes, each day, that is different! To stick to a plan for minutes once it is made — that is like saving pennies, each seems so little, hardly worth saving, yet counted up, all together, they can reach dollars and dollars. I think one reason why homemakers are often fretted and worried is that they feel time slipping away, day by day and do not have the thrill of accomplish - ment. They feel that they are ever working with nothing done — a false feeling, of course, and one that could be overcome if a plan for living were kept in mind and followed. I have said that I cannot tell you what you want from your twenty - four hours. But in general we can all be sure of certain things we want to get out of our days. We want healthy bodies. Great deeds have been accomplished in the world by invalids, but even those gifted souls could have done more in health; and for most of us, health is needed for the day's task. That means time used to eat, time to rest, time to play. It is my observation that more homemakers neglect themselves than their families. And let us not be proud of this and think it is unselfish. Sometimes it is merely the line of least resist - ance. It is much easier to plan a meal for the family, serve it, and then hastily swallow something ourselves. It takes real brains to plan so that mother will have time to sit down with the others and take her ease while eating — yet it can be done, if you will; it must be done if you are to be healthy as you can be. It is easy to put the children to bed on time and then stay up to do work in the quiet; a little of that is fun. Too much ruins eyes', muscles, nerves; watch out and do not do too much. Better less work and a jollier homemaker. It is easy enough to plan recreation for the family and forget ourselves, but are not we members of the family, too? And what is good for one is good for all. Let us put play for ourselves into our twenty-four hours, and keep healthy, happy, and comfortable. We want time for healthy mental life. That means books, radio, conversation. It does not take long to read a few lines that will lift </seg>
            <seg id="p444">REPORT Ol" NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE you out of a humdrum trend of thought. But the book does not just happen to be there along with the ten minutes for reading it — you have to plan. It does not take any time, so to speak, to turn on the radio, but you have to know which program you would rather have at the moment and that means planning. By the way, have you ever tried the idea of having each person in the family be radio secretary for a week and be responsible for planning the family program? It is loads of fun; try it! The secretary looks up programs, selects the best ones, and tells various members of the family of special features they might enjoy. Next week the job is passed on to another person and so on around the family. We want time for things of the spirit, friends, service for others (a happy and stimulating outside duty that should go into every per - son's time plan if it possibly can), time for worship, time for thought, time to develop our own personality— it almost seems as though this is the most important and the most neglected soal of all. After these three, we can put into our plan whatever we most want to do. I have not a doubt but that every women here would put as her first goal the desire to be a good homemaker and to serve her family — you simply would not be here today if you did not have a high aim in your homemaking. But remember, families do not live by bread and cleaning alone and although most of your hours, no doubt, may be spent for such needs, you can, if you will, so organize your day that you will have time, plenty of time, for other needs, too. Along about now you will be saying to yourself, "That is well enough to say in a speech but I would like to see it worked out in a big family" — take my own — "I will tell you how I made a start with a small use of time and planning." I began with weeks, they are much easier to manage than months or years. On Sunday evening I sat down with pencil and paper and listed all the things I wanted to do that week. I did not bother to write twenty-one meals, potatoes, puddings, and dishes. I knew I would get those done. I did not write, clean, or mend, or make beds. I just took all those for granted and began later. But I did write "Remake my blue silk, write to Aunt Jane, visit Sally Bowen, ask Ellen to bring her mending over for tea," and such as that. On the list I put everything, besides routine tasks, that I thought I had to do or I wanted to do that week. Then I sat back and looked at it. Of course it was much too long; no human could possibly have done it all in a week even if she had not had meals and cleaning. So, instead of being discouraged, I began to cut. Why bother with the blue silk this week? It had done this long; and really it was becoming as it was. Instead of remaking, I would clean and press it and put on a new pique collar. I must write Aunt Jane — no putting that off. How </seg>
            <seg id="p445">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION about Ellen? No, I would not put that off; it was fun and I haa noi seen Ellen for ages. Through that whole list I went and by the time I had culled it out, there was a busy but a well balanced and happy week ahead. And so with every week, by listing duties and pleas - ures ahead, I have learned to drop from my mind and my days much that I might otherwise have been tempted to do but which, on exam - ination, proved not to fit with my plan of living. Do not understand me that it is easy; it isn't and sometimes I am so puzzled that I do not know how to decide which to leave undone. But by planning ahead, by writing it down where I can look at it, deciding is simplified. At first I planned every minute. But I have found that is not wise; something unexpected always turns up — that is the fun of homemaking. Now I plan for five working days, not six, and carry that sixth as a comfortable spare. Try the idea yourself when you go home and after you have it working smoothly by the week, plan ahead in a more general way for a season, listing spring, summer, fall, and winter work and pleasures. You will have a de - lightful thrill of accomplishment as you mark off duties done; you will know the time you spend in recreation and fun is enjoyed without the sense of pushing that ill-planned pleasure often carries with it. With thought, your days take on a pattern — doubtless the pattern was there all the time but you were not conscious of it in the same way you now are. And you will enjoy the inspiration that comes with knowing you are the master of your hours. You can get what you want out of your twenty-four hours if you know what you want and have the will to carry through. </seg>
            <seg id="p446">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE - '':■■■■■ ■ "" '.'■■' .. part n MOTHERS' VACATION CAMPS In 1932 there was a Mothers' Vacation Camp at Curtis. Condi - tions in the state were such that it did not seem wise to try to hold the usual number of camps. This camp was a successful one, for there were forty-two women present from eight counties. The camp was held in the girls' dormitory at the School of Agri - culture so the women had comfortable beds and the rooms where the indoor meetings were held were attractive. The women enjoyed being out on the terraces and the grass for some of their discussions. The camp began on Sunday afternoon, July 31. Requests had been made 10 have the camp begin late Sunday afternoon so the men would have an opportunity to bring their wives to the camp without having to take time from the fields. The plan worked well for most of the campers had arrived and had been assigned to their rooms and were unpacked in time for the Sunday evening supper. After supper they visited awhile, then went out by the lily pool where Miss Mildred Nel - son led in the vesper services. It was a beautiful evening out on the terrace near the lily pool for the moon was coming up as the sun was setting in the west. The view over the country and over on the hills was especially fine that particular evening. This vesper service was one of the most impressive memories the campers carried away with them for not only the evening and the scenery were so perfect but the music furnished by .Mrs. N. W. Gaines and the other musicians from Curtis, and the talk which Miss Nelson gave on Trees all seemed to fit appropriately into the spirit of the occasion. Following the vesper service the campers went inside and Mrs. C. O. Bruce of Lincoln began her book review on "The Magnificent Obsession". This was completed the next forenoon. Everyone, even those who had previously read the book, enjoyed Mrs. Brace's review. After breakfast on Monday morning each camper told where she attended school when she was a girl. Childhood memories were re - vived and interesting anecdotes were told. Mrs. Bruce then completed her book review and following that the handicraft work was begun. Each woman made a shopping bag from a mesh dish cloth and bright colored yarns. It was a surprise to all to see how the bags varied and how attractive they were even though they had cost so little. </seg>
            <seg id="p447">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION After dinner there was a quiet hour, then Mrs. Bruce gave a tain on Enjoying Nature. She had illustrative material to demonstrate some of the suggestions which she made. Among her illustrative ma- . terial were some books she had made using "spatter work". She suggested that spatter work could he used for Christmas cards. The spatter work which was done on the 1932 Christmas cards by over fourteen thousand project club members was the outcome of Mrs. Bruce's suggestions at the camp. So many people are indebted to Mrs. Bruce and her talk on Enjoying Nature at the Mothers' Camp for economical but attractive Christmas cards. The spatter work idea has wince been used for decorating various other gifts. A picnic supper had been planned for Monday evening at Aggie Land. The people of Curtis kindly furnished cars enough to take the campers down to the picnic grounds. There were some clouds and it looked as though it might rain later, although it did not look as though it would rain soon at the time the group left the dormitory, but before the lunch was eaten it began to look more and more threatening, so it was finally decided to return to the dormitory. Be - fore the building was reached, it was raining hard. The picnic supper was eaten inside. The plan had been made for the campers to attend the moving picture, "The Man Who Played God". The rain kept coming down in torrents. However, the Curtis people came with their cars and the campers were taken down town through an especially heavy rain. The streets had such big streams of water rushing down them that the cars had to drive up over the curb and up to the door of the movie to let the women get out of the cars. The women entered into the spirit of the situation and had a good time out of it. Probably all of those who had never seen the picture wondered what it would be from the title. Many were skeptical about it but soon all were enjoying it. It is a picture which makes one appreciate being able to see and to hear. It was a timely picture for a group of mothers who were camping. After breakfast on Tuesday morning the campers told of early rec - ollections or experiences on their wedding days. One hardly realizes that so many funny things could happen on wedding days. i Following this Mrs. Orville Legg of Dakota City, the home and com - munity chairman of the State Farm Bureau Federation, gave a talk on the activities of the State and National Farm Bureau Federation. After this more time was given to completing the hand bags. A part of Tuesday afternoon was spent in preparing the stunts for Stunt Night. The rest of the afternoon was spent enjoying a ride </seg>
            <seg id="p448">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE furnished by the Curtis Chamber of Commerce to Gulch Canyon. This ride helped the women to realize what pretty places there are around Curtis. In the evening before the stunts began, Mr. L. L. Blessing, a busi - ness man of Curtis, entertained the women with sleight-of-hand tricks. Then came the stunts. One always wonders where the costumes came from, for they are full of variety and interest. Following the stunts Mrs. Bruce told bedtime stories. On Wednesday morning Mrs. Gaines gave a talk on music appre - ciation and Mr. McCorkle took those who were interested in seeing the stock out to the barns. There was a true, doubtful, false round table discussion on a set of statements. This type of discussion has been especially worked out in Nebraska. The papers are handed out and all are asked to keep them wrong side up until the checking liegins. Then each statement is read without any discussion, and each one is asked to check whether she thinks the statement is true, doubtful, or false. As soon as all of the statements have been read then a count is made as to how the campers voted. Below is the tabulation. After the tabulation is made then there is a general discussion and frequently people change their minds in regard to a statement when they have had time to think it over and to hear what others say. Mrs. Gaines then gave a talk on little tilings in the home which leave lasting impressions on the different members of the family. Visitors came during the forenoon and in the early afternoon to take the campers back home. People have said there were three picnics in connection with a Mothers' camp. One group who have a picnic are the women who come to the camp. Then the men and children left at home have a picnic while mother is away, but the bent picnic of all is when mother returns home and has so much to tell of happiness and pleasure. </seg>

            <seg id="p450">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Return this enrollment blank early to your county extension agent so there will be a place reserved for you. Plan to arrive at camp about 5:00 P. M. Sunday, so you will be ready for supper at 6:00 P. M. Special vesper services will be held in the evening. Each camper is to bring her own blankets, sheets, and a pillow, if one is desired. There are good mattresses in the dormitory so the beds will be comfortable. The cost of the camp is two dollars and seventy-five cents. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes and comfortable clothing. Bring your own soap and towels and other personal toilet articles. Those who wish to go swimming in the lake, bring bathing suits and caps. There will be interesting, attractive handcraft work, the supplies for which may be secured at the camp. The cost o£ these supplies will not be over twenty cents. Each camper will need a thimble, scissors and a tape measure for the handcraft work, so she should bring her own with her. Meals will be prepared by the cook at the dormitory so the camp - ers will have no meal preparation to think about while at the ramp. There will be no dishes to wash. The camp program this year is to be a good one and to receive the most benefit from it, you will need to bring a quantity of determin - ation to have a good time, and to help everyone else to do the same. One of the most important assets for a successful camp is to have each bring a good spirit of sportsmanship and fellowship. HAPPY MEMORIES One of the happy incidents connected with the camp was provided by Mrs. Orville Legg. She asked each camper to write in one sen - tence what she had enjoyed most at the camp. These replies Mrs. Legg made into a memory book which was sent to each camper. The following is quoted from Mrs. Legg's book: DO YOU REMEMBER The Crew: Miss Mary-Ellen Brown State Extension Agent, "Women's Work Mrs. C. O. Bruce Recreation Specialist Mr3. N. W.

It was considered a worthy use of one hundred dollars to further this kind of work. This amount of money was applied on the expenses of the trips for the eight high scoring individuals who won championships in Home Economics Judging at the State Fair. These eight girls represent four judging teams as follows: Clothing Judging Team — Ardelle Griswold and Roberta Myers of Lan - caster County Baked Foods Judging Team — Lois Reimers and Bess Thomas of Douglas County Canned Foods Judging Team — Edna Nunns and Frances Roberts of Fillmore County Girls' Room Judging Team — Martha Fisher and Birdie Doolittle of Holt County At the National Club Congress in Chicago these girls entered judg - ing contests which aim to help girls recognize standards in quality, weigh values of importance i and give reasons for their choices.

I am very happy and proud to be among those fortunate 4-H club members who won these lovely, enjoyable, and educational trips to the Club Congress in Chicago. I am sure no one who was on the trip could deny that it was very instructive and thrilling. We saw Chicago life and its characteristics to a great extent, visited the wonderful Field and Art Museums, the much talked of Planetarium and saw the World's Fair Grounds and many of its marvelous build - ings either under construction or already finished. We walked on the very edge of the clear, green waters of Lake Michigan and viewed the skyline of Chicago. We visited one of the largest department stores in this part of the country, Marshall Field and Company, whose store covers one and one-hjalf city blocks and is thirteen or fourteen stories high. We were entertained at Wilson's Packing Company, also at the In - ternational Harvester Company, and the Chicago Mail Order House, whose plants we went through. We saw Montgomery Ward and Com - pany's wholesale and retail stores and were their guests at a compli - mentary breakfast Thursday morning. Those of us who judged did so at the International Livestock Show and all of us inspected the many interesting exhibits from all parts of the United States and some of Canada at the Union Stock Yards. We all received many lovely souvenirs while on our trip which will help us remember the Eleventh National Boys and Girls Club Congress, although I think its memory alone will live on in all our minds forever.

            <seg id="p457">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION My Trip to Chicago This will be a trip which I shall marvel at as long as I live. It seems to have given me a greater understanding and faith towards the 4-H club. We started on Saturday, November 2G f and the Nebraska delega - tion ate supper at the Rome Hotel in Omaha. Here we practiced our own club songs and started the trip out right. I arrived in Chicago Sunday morning at 8:30 o'clock and immedi - ately went to the Auditorium hotel to meet the rest, as we had gone on different trains. Sunday, November 27, was just as interesting as every other day. In the morning we were taken to the Central Church in Orchestra Hall and heard an interesting sermon. We ate lunch and then walked to the Field Museum in Grant Park. This is a very educational as well as interesting place. In the back of the Museum, Soldiers' Field could be seen as well as the 1933 World's Pair grounds. Later we were taken to the Planetarium on Lake Michigan. This is a new building and is a very beautiful one. Later we walked back to the Auditorium and discovered that our delegation was transferred to the Harrison Hotel. It was a very nice hotel and the rooms as comfortable and clean as you could want. Monday morning, November 28, the Nebraska delegation met the other delegations bright and early. We all boarded elevated trains and then marched to the International Exposition grounds. The morning was spent in judging and various contests which proved in - teresting, even though it was work. As this was Thomas E. Wilson Day, Mr. Wilson provided the en - tertainemnt for the rest of the evening. No one could have spent a better evening than we did. A perfectly delicious supper was served in a beautifully decorated room and interesting favors were given. A program was given which lasted all evening. Among the interesting things on the program was a talk by the host, Mr. Wilson, and also one by Amelia Earhart. This was certainly a pleasure and I believe I enjoyed this program of artists more than any other during the trip. I call it a perfect evening. After the program the fifteen hun - dred 4-H champions marched in the Coliseum and this certainly was grand. Tuesday, November 29, the girls went alone, that is, without the boys. At 10:00 o'clock all the girls assembled and were driven in taxis for a sight seeing tour of the 1933 World's Fair grounds. We then were taken to the Planetarium where we heard a most Interest- </seg>
            <seg id="p458">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ing lecture and demonstration on the stars. It was educational as well as beautiful and I enjoyed it very much. Luncheon was served to us by the Mail Order Company of Chicago. The lunch was delicious, and perfectly gorgeous souvenirs were given to us. The hostess was very gracious and gave you a feeling that you were welcome. We had an interesting program and then went to our hotels for a rest. In the evening the 4-H banquet was held in the Sherman Hotel. A nice banquet was served and an interesting program given. Edgar | A. Guest was the main speaker and several trophies were awarded. I enjoyed the banquet very much. "Wednesday, November 30, the entire delegation from each state all assembled once more. We were taken to the McCormiek building and shown the story of twine. They very generously took a picture of the group and then led us by a-round-about way to the great room where a complimentary luncheon was served which proved very delicious. Music was played while we ate and each state, of course, sang their state song. The souvenirs from here were also very nice. Prom McCormick's we were taken to the Livestock Show again and had the pleasure of attending the Horse Show. This was very interesting and exciting as among the features was a polo game. For supper that evening we were allowed to go where we pleased and I'm sure I found a good place as well as the rest of the delegation. After supper we were entertained by a theater party at the Audi - torium Hotel. We were shown into a beautiful auditorium and the show was worth two picture shows. This show had real actors who turned out to be 4-H club champions and this made it all the more interesting. That evening the Nebraska delegation had a dance at the hotel, which served as enjoyable recreation. Thursday morning, December 1, I realized this was the last day in Chicago. The girls were complimented by a breakfast at Mont - gomery Ward's. The souvenirs were very appropriate and useful. In the afternoon we were favored by a lecture at the Art Institute which proved very interesting. The rest of the afternoon was spent in shopping for souvenirs. In the evening everyone was packing and getting ready to leave. However, we found time to attend a gorgeous banquet and program as the last minutes of the time slipped away. Among the speakers on the program was the head of the 1933 World's Fair. He showed what a worth while event this is to be. The weather during the trip was perfect and every minute while I was in Chicago was enjoyed to the utmost. </seg>
            <seg id="p459">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION I am sure the pleasant memory will linger on in the many years to come and I am wishiiiK good luck to all 4-H members that they may some day enjoy the hospitality and good time in Chicago that I was given. Here's hoping that the Nebraska delegation next year will sing and cheer Cor good old Nebraska even better than the 1932 delegation did. However, I think we did exceptionally well. Millard, Nebraska December 9, 1932 Dear Miss Smith: To the donor of my trip to the National 4-H Congress in Chicago, I want to express my sincerest thanks. I certainly enjoyed myself every minute of the time. I am very sorry I could not have done better in the judging contest. But it was a good contest anyway. I wish all 4-H members could go on this trip because it surely is marvelous. Thanking you again, I remain, Sincerely yours, LOIS REIMERS My Trip to Chicago. "Hello, Lois, how are you?" I looked around to see who was speaking to me as I did not think I knew anyone. It was a 4-H friend from Nuckolls county whom I had met at the State Fair. Of course I was very glad to see her and it was not long until I found more 4-H friends that I knew. Now the opening scene of my story is in the Union Depot where the 4-H folks who were going to Chicago were supposed to assemble. The time was November 2G, a Saturday afternoon about 4:30. As I stood around conversing with different boys and girls I heard someone say, "Come on, we're off." I looked around for my suitcase and then happened to think that we were not off for Chicago but for the Rome Hotel in Omaha where we were to have dinner. At dinner everyone introduced themselves and we sang a lot of Nebraska songs. I did not realize at the time how much we were going to use those songs the following week. After dinner we went back to the Union Station, got our suitcases, and went to the train. Some of my Douglas county friends were at the depot so I had to bid them a hasty farewell. This was not my first ride on a train, but it was my first on </seg>
            <seg id="p460">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE a pullman. While the porter was making our berths, we were taken through the train. I was not particularly anxious to go to bed but the next morning how I wished I had gone to bed earlier. Anyway about three hours was the limit of my sleep. As soon as it was light I was up and found that we were in Chicago. It took us over an hour after that to get to the station. We had breakfast there and then went to the Auditorium hotel in taxis. After standing around for quite a while we adjourned to a large room — I imagine it was used for meetings or the like. There we got our in - structions for the day. So far we had no hotel room assigned. I forgot to say before that Mr. Frisbie gave us a nice talk on the train about our coming trip and also gave us to understand that we were to have a "papa," "mama," and "step-mama." Mr. Scheldt, our own county agent, was "papa," Miss Woodward of Lancaster county was our "mama" and Miss Holmes of Scotts Bluff was "stepmama." Mr. Frisbie did not tell us what he was — but some of us took it for granted that he was "grandpa." Now to go on with my story. We went to church Sunday morn - ing in Orchestra Hall on Michigan Avenue. We heard an inspiring sermon and some very lovely music. The Nebraska delegation, of which there were over forty, had lunch that day in a restaurant not far from the Auditorium. After lunch we went to the hotel where all the states were getting assembled to go to the Field Museum. The states were divided into two bat - talions. Nebraska was in battalion one. We walked to the Field Museum, and there saw some very interesting sights: old Indian relics, birds, animals, skeletons, Egyptian relics, relics from Greenland and Iceland, and many, many other things. We were only given an hour to look through this marvelous place, so I did not see half as much as I wanted to. We then went to the Planetarium to hear a lecture &gt; but the lecture room was full so we were taken there later in the week. The Nebraska group went back to the Auditorium where it was decided that we would stay at the Harrison during the week. Every - body got his baggage and walked over to the Harrison hotel which was only a couple of blocks away. Then after supper we were assigned rooms and instead of going to church my teammate, Bess Thomas, and myself went to bed as we had to judge the next day. Bess and I were thrilled over our room at the hotel. It was an awfully cute room with a radio, private bath, overstuffed set, and a lot of things. We only regretted one thing, and that was that we did not get to be in the room very much. The next morning they called us on the phone at six o'clock. I just about had to get in bed and jump all over Bess to wake her up. </seg>
            <seg id="p461">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION After eating breakfast we went to the Auditorium where our battalion assembled at 8:20. "We took the elevated to the International Live - stock Exposition. Mr. B. H. Heide gave a short welcome speech, after which Bess and I went to the Gerat Hall of Saddle and Sirloin Club for judging. We were in the cooking judging contest with four classes to judge: whole wheat bread, white bread, nut bread, and cookies. In our contest there were thirty-one girls competing. As a team we placed fourth while Bess placed fourth individual and I placed sixteenth. If my score had been higher we probably should have placed better. The contest lasted until one o'clock. We looked through all the buildings at the Exposition and at 3:45 left in busses with the rest of our group for the Wilson &amp; Company plant. Just before leaving for the Plant the Nebraska delegation waa In - formed that there were some national champions in their midst. The crops judging team placed first with one of the boys as high individual. There was quite a bit of cheering for a little while. At the Wilson Auditorium we were entertained highly and at six were entertained at dinner by Mr. Wilson. Following dinner another special enter - tainment was given at the Auditorium with vaudeville sketches, etc. Then the most important part of the evening's program was a talk by Amelia Earhart. This waSj indeed, quite an honor, and enjoyed by everyone. At 9:15 that evening we were again taken to the exposition grounds for a parade in the arena. The national champions were in - troduced. It was about 11 o'clock before we got to bed that night. We were planning to sleep late the next morning as the program was open until 10:15, but our "mamas" said we were going shopping so the phone rang at the usual six o'clock. We did most of our shopping at Marshall Field's. At 10:15 we went to the Planetarium for the lecture. The ceiling or dome is rounded, and with a moving picture machine we were shown the exact replica of our night. The lecturer showed us many other interesting things about the moon, sun, stars, etc. Luncheon that day was at the Chicago Mail Order Company. We were also presented with leather hand-tooled book covers. For a couple of hours we were entertained by a style show, vaudeville sketches, etc., at the Chicago Mail Order Company. The Harrison Hotel was our next stop, where we dressed for the club members' own banquet that evening. This banquet was held at six o'clock at the Sherman Hotel. After dinner we were entertained first by seeing the trophies presented, and next by Mr. Edgar A. Guest, and then a moving picture show. Again it was rather late before we got to bed. </seg>
            <seg id="p462">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The next day was called Drama and Manufacturers' Day. After joining our battalion at 8:30 at the Auditorium we visited the Mc- Cormick works and twine mill. There we saw twine and rope made and also machinery being made. Our pictures were also taken here. Following this we had luncheon as guests of the International Harvester Company. Mr. McAllister was the toastmaster. In the afternoon we went to the Livestock Exposition grounds for the matinee horse show. Our dinner hour was left for groups to dine by states. We went to a restaurant not far from the Harrison. The evening's entertainment was a 4-H theater party given by the 4-H members themselves. This program was called a kaleidoscope and represented the different aims &gt; etc., of 4-H club work. It was a wonderful program full of interesting and educational things. The next morning when I awoke I found I did not want to get out of bed, or rather I could not. I stayed at the hotel all day sleeping, taking pills, and sleeping some more. I can briefly outline what the rest of the girls did. First they went to Montgomery Ward's tor breakfast and a sightseeing tour of the place, then came to the Harrison for dinner and in the afternoon visited the Art Institute. By evening I was feeling better so I wanted to go to dinner at the Auditorium. This dinner for all 4-H club members was held on the ninth floor ballroom. I could not eat and it was warm and close in the room, so I did not feel so well. We heard some speeches, the prizes were awarded, and then the Nebraska delegation had to leave. Our train left at 10:30 that evening so we went to the Harrison for our baggage. By that time I was feeling a little worse. Then we got in taxis and went to the station. We boarded our train immediately. My knees were weak and I did not think I would even be able to make it to the train but did. That night I slept the best of any night on the trip. I felt quite a bit better and rested the next morning and had a wide smile when we crossed the bridge into Nebraska at 0:30. The trip was certainly wonderful and is an event I will remember all my life. The people of the Rock Island Company and the Nebraska Home Economic Section will never know how much I appreciated the trip and I wish I could thank them in person. I do not think that there is anything more inspiring in club work than a trip of this sort and I certainly hope it will help me to bring about Bigger and Better Club Work. December 6, 1932 Dear Miss Smith: I have enjoyed my trip to the Club Congress very much, and I am </seg>
            <seg id="p463">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION sure that I shall remember it all of my lite. I had never before visited that city, Chicago, and I cannot express my appreciation for all that it has been to me. 1 am more enthusiastic about club work than ever before and hope that others may gain as much by it as I have done. Yours truly t BESS THOMAS My Trip to Chicago. It was my lirst trip to Chicago, and it made a decided impression upon me. On Sunday morning we attended church and that after - noon, we visited the Field Museum, a place that I had always wanted to see. In the evening I went to bed early, as I was to judge Monday morning. Monday morning there was a marvelous program presented to us by the Wilson Company — a program which we enjoyed very much. On Tuesday we attended a luncheon given by the Chicago Mail Order Company, and drove around in the "World's Pair grounds, and that evening we went to the banquet in the Sherman. We were guests of the International Harvester Company on Wed - nesday, and in the evening the 4-H clubs presented their own theater party. Thursday we had breakfast at the Montgomery Ward and Company, and visited the Art Institute that afternoon. We had dinner at the Auditorium Hotel that evening, and left for home shortly after. It was a wonderful trip, and I really believe that it was as educa - tional as it was enjoyable. Washburn, Illinois December 13, 1932 Dear Miss Smith: I am pleased to have this opportunity to thank you for making it possible for me to attend the eleventh National 4-H Club Congress at Chicago this fall. This trip was new, interesting, and educational; In fact, it has proved to be a wonderful climax awarded to us for our efforts. I am sure that if others knew of the pleasure and knowledge derived from this trip that it would be one of their goals set up high on a pedestal to work a little harder each day to achieve it. I have been in Peoria and Washburn since December first, visiting relatives. This could not have been possible had I not won the trip to Chicago. </seg>
            <seg id="p464">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Again I wish to thank you and sincerely hope someone next year can have the opportunity to step up and win a similar trip to the 1 -II Club Congress held in Chicago in 1933. Sincerely, EDNA NUNNS My Trip to Chicago. When I was told that my teammate and I had won a trip to Chicago by placing first at the Nebraska State Pair through Canned Foods Judging, it was like a dream that had come true. And so it was. I left Fairmont at 11:59, Saturday noon, November 26, 1932. We met Mr. Frisbie i Nebraska State Leader, at Lincoln and arrived in On.aha around 3:30 p. m., which was the last meeting place of every trip winner going to Chicago. We attended a banquet that evening at the Rome Hotel in Omaha, where we became familiar with our Nebraska songs and yells under the direction of Mrs. Gaines. Later we boarded the train for Chicago. We found that a night on the pullman was lots of fun. Seven-thirty, Sunday morning, found us in Chicago. We enjoyed a hearty breakfast in the depot, after which we marched to the Audi - torium Hotel. We checked our baggage and then attended the Central Church, Orchestra Hall, on Michigan Avenue. At one o'clock we assembled in the lobby of the Auditorium Hotel for a trip to the Field Museum and Planetarium. We could spend a week in the Museum and still not see everything but as time was limited we tried to see everything in an hour. We marched to the Planetarium, enjoying this walk as the air was crisp and cool; the lake was clear, blue, and like a picture. We could see Chicago's sky - scrapers in the dim smoke in the distance. All of these left an im - pression on us never to be forgotten. After our tours we registered at the Harrison Hotel for the week. This was a very nice place and we enjoyed staying here. Evening found us quite tired so we were permitted to roam around, clean up, go to bed, or do as we pleased. Monday was the International Livestock Day. Our Nebraska delegation was battalion one so we assembled early and left by special train for the Exposition Grounds. At 9:30 I participated in the Home Economics Judging Contest. This lasted until one-thirty. We then had a luncheon given by the Saddle and Sirloin Club for the con - testants. After the judging I visited the buildings on the grounds, seeing beautiful horses, the 4-H buildings, and the canning exhibits in which I was interested. </seg>
            <seg id="p465">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Our special entertainment in the evening was at the Wilson Audi - torium on the occasion of Thomas E. Wilson night. Dinner tasted fine after a long day. The entertainment was enjoyed by all, and wo were thrilled beyond words to have Mrs. Earhart Putnam talk to us in person about her solo flight across the Atlantic. After the banquet, the entire delegation marched in the arena of International Livestock Exposition, while the introduction of champions took place. Mr. R. A. Turner, U. S. Department of Agriculture, led the audience in the song "My Country, 'Tis of Thee." Tuesday morning the girls of the Nebraska delegation went shop - ping. At 10:15 we were driven through the Century of Progress grounds which was most interesting, and I am looking forward to visiting the World's Fair in 1933. Miss Maude Bennot gave us a demonstration in the Adler Planetarium at 11:00 showing how the moon, stars, and sun change in the four seasons of the year. Luncheon and entertainment were furnished us at noon by the courtesy of The Chicago Mail Order Company. In the evening the club members' own banquet and the national rally provided the best of the week's events. 1 felt very fortunate, indeed, to have my favorite poet, Edgar A. Guest, speak to us in person. Mr. R. A. Turner again led us in the closing song. Wednesday was Drama and Manufacturers' Day. We boarded special surface cars to the International Harvester Company where we took an educational tour through cars to the International Harvester Company where we took an educational tour through the McCormick works and twine mill. We were guests of the International Harvester Company officials. This program was broadcast, winners were an - nounced, and many states were called upon to represent their state by songs or yells. Nebraska always did its share and I am sure we were heard as our state had one of the largest groups present. A picture was taken of the entire delegation in front of the International Har - vester building. About 2:00 p. m. we were given an interesting Matinee Horse Show at the International Livestock Exposition. The dinner hour was left open for groups to dine as they pleased. In the evening we attended the national 4-H theater party in the Auditorium Theater. 4-H members all over the United States participated in this. We Nebraskans were pleased to have three from our group on the stage and our song leader led the entire delegation in the songs. Thus ended another perfect day. Thursday was termed Educational Day. We girls left the hotel around 7:10 a. m. for breakfast and a sightseeing tour of Montgomery- Ward &amp; Company. Before eating I was asked to talk over the radio from station WAAF in Chicago. And so during breakfast I made up my speech and ate at tHe same time. During the program I left the </seg>
            <seg id="p466">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE group with Katherine Mies of Illinois, her State Leader, and Mr. "Verne V. Varney of Madison, Wisconsin, who took me to the broad - casting station. To me this was my first experience in radioing. And was it a thrill? Here I met singers, broadcasters, and the director of the 4-H Club theater party orchestra. Later I went back to the Harri - son Hotel and cleaned up for lunch. At 1:30 we visited the Art In - stitute where we saw the treasures and masterpieces housed within its walls. The rest of the afternoon was spent in shopping and rest- Ing. The evening was supposed to be enjoyed by a program and dinner for the entire delegation but as I had planned to visit relatives in Peoria, my train was scheduled to leave at 5:00. So I said goodbye to the delegation, the Nebraska girls and boys, the Eleventh National Boys and Girls Club Congress, and Chicago on Thursday evening, December 1. I am looking forward to continuing my 4-H work and leadership, trying to live up to our 4-H motto — "To Make the Best Better" — as this trip to the 4-H Club Congress in Chicago has proved to be a wonderful climax awarded to us girls and boys for our efforts. Geneva, Nebraska December 9, 1932 Dear Miss Smith: I returned from my trip to Chicago after having a wonderful time. It impressed me more than ever that 4-H clubs are worth while and the more you put into them the more you get out of them. I expect to keep in club work and work hard to inspire others to do likewise. I am very grateful to you for your part in making this trip possible for me. Sincerely, FRANCES ROBERTS. My Trip to Chicago. On Saturday noon, November 26, I got on the train at Exeter. There were four other club members on the train who lived farther west in the state. On our trip to Lincoln we became acquainted with those who were on the train. In Lincoln, the state club leader, Mr. Frisbie, and other 4-H club delegates came on our special car to go to Omaha. As we crossed the Platte river at Ashland, Mr. Frisbie pointed out the National Guards Camp and the state fishery grounds. When going out of the Platte river valley, we went up a steep railroad grade that is second largest in the state, the largest being at Crawford. As we went into Omaha, we saw the Omar flour mills, ore smelting works, and the Omaha post office. About four o'clock we arrived at the new Omaha depot which was completed not long ago. Some of the 4-H club members had not arrived yet t so we waited in the depot </seg>
            <seg id="p467">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION until 5:15 P. M. when we began our walk to the Rome Hotel. At the hotel we had a banquet and Mrs. Gaines taught us how to sing "My Nebraska" and other songs which we would sing in Chicago. We elected our official "mamma" and "step-mamma" for the week. They were the ladies who were to act as guardians. After the banquet we walked back to the depot to get on our train for Chicago. Mr. Frisbie and Mr. McGinnis gave us caution lectures and we had a business meeting, checking our money to him, and having our berths assigned to us. We were taken through ten or twelve pullman, dining,, obser - vation, and chair cars before retiring in our berths. Our train was the "Corn King", one of the nicest in America. Edna Nunns and I bunked together. We awoke at 3:30 and stayed awake, looking out of the window until 4:10, when we crossed the Mississippi river. Our porter awoke us at 6:00 A. M. the next morning. We rode for forty-live minutes in Chicago before we arrived in the Chicago depot, which was very large with many people coming and going. When we finished eating breakfast, we rode in taxis to the Audi - torium Hotel on Michigan Avenue. We met other state delegations and assembled to go to the Central Church on Michigan Avenue. There were perhaps one hundred who sang in the choir. The robes that they wore were old rose velvet. Church lasted two hours, and then we walked back to the Auditorium hotel. After eating lunch the Ne - braska group assembled to visit the Field Museum and the Adler Planetarium. We could look at anything we wanted to but were to meet at the door at 3:00 to go to the Planetarium. Two hours were spent in looking at things in the Museum. It resembled Morrill Hall at the University in Lincoln and the Joselyn Memorial in Omaha, only on a much larger scale. From the Field Museum we walked past some of the World's Fair buildings and over to the Planetarium which is an island in the lake. The Planetarium is round and dome-shaped. We looked at the pictures of past eclipses, sun, moon, Mars, and other planets which were on the wall. A miniature planetarium was shown with the top of the dome opened up so that the large instrument can be focused toward the direct sky. On our way back to the hotel we saw real traffic. On one street, cars were going six abreast, one right after another as far as we could see, all driving about thirty-five miles an hour. As the policeman let us 4-H club folks through this traffic, it made a traffic jam for at least three blocks. When we reached the Auditorium Hotel Mr. Frisbie told us we were going to the Harrison Hotel. The rooms in this hotel were very nice with a private tele - phone radio. The boys and girls who were to take part in contests on Monday were not to attend church or the poultry show, but were to go to bed early. Edna and I stayed at the hotel Sunday night and wrote letters home. </seg>
            <seg id="p468">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Monday morning we took our first elevated train ride out to the International Livestock Exposition. It took one hour and ten minutes to arrive before the Boys and Girls Club Building to be welcomed there. The judging contests took place in the Founders Room, which is a historical one. In the afternoon Edna and I finished Judging and then went to look at the exhibits. These looked very good and were interesting. Special busses were provided for us to go to the Wilson Packing Company auditorium at 4:00 o'clock. All of the delegates who were attending the Club Congress were guests at this program. At this entertainment were news reels and pictures, and comedians. The states took turns in going to dinner t as a continuous program was pro - vided for all of the time. After everyone had eaten we went back to the auditorium for the. program. Mr. Wilson presented the $300 scholarships which he offers to 4-H club boys each year. He wel - comed the 4-H club delegates and introduced Amelia Earhart Putnam who told of her experiences on her trans-Atlantic flight. She was dressed in the same clothes that she wore on this flight. She said her plane was a bright red with a gold band on the wings. It Is the only one she has even seen like it. She said she hoped that when we went home we should find out if our town had its name painted on the roof of some building. It makes it much easier for fliers to find their way or the location of the place they wish to go. She told us some of the things she took with her on her flight. She took a hard cooked egg, chicken soup, and tomato juice. The tomato juice tasted best she thought. After Miss Earhart's talk, stage girls performed acrobatic stunts f danced, and sang songs. Their costumes were beautiful. After this entertainment we got in special busses and went to the International Livestock Show to march in the arena there. Some of the winners were announced. The amphitheater holds ten thousand people and was crowded, with many people slanding up. Souvenirs were given to us as we went out the door going to our elevated train to go to the hotel. Tuesday the girls and boys traveled in separate groups and took a different trip. The girls had time until 10:00 o'clock for shopping. We went shopping in the loop, spending most of our time at- Marshall Field's store. This store employs more people than those who are employed in all of Lincoln. The floor space covers one square block. It is twelve stories high, only nine of which have departments. The other three are store rooms. There are three floors below the street level. Looking out of the twelfth story, you can see directly across to the seventeenth story of the Masonic Temple. The Temple rooms do not have as high ceilings as Marshall Field's, which accounts for </seg>
            <seg id="p469">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION the difference in number of stories, although they are the same height. Four of us girls went through almost all of the floors which had ladies' dresses and coats. We Nebraska girls met the other delegations at the Auditorium Hotel and then we went in taxis furnished by the Chicago Mail Order Company to take the lake shore drive. I would estimate that there were about one hundred fifty taxis. The lake shore drive took us through the World's Fair grounds to see the buildings. They were very pretty, having green lawns as in summer. We were taken across the bridge out to the island where the Planetarium is. A lady gave a one-hour lecture on the sky. The room was round and dome-shaped with a large instrument resembling a cannon as tall as the door, In the center. Along one side of the room was a silhouette of the Chi - cago skyline. This instrument reflects the night sky, showing all ot the planets and stars upon the dome-shaped ceiling. When everyone was seated ) the room began to get dark, which resembled dusk. Then the stars began to come out and the planets, Mars, Jupiter, Venus and all of the rest. All followed the same path across the sky. The lady showed us the path the sun would make the day we were there. She showed us how it would be December 21st in the southern hemisphere and other places at other times. The taxis were ready to take us to the special train which took us to luncheon at the Chicago Mail Order Company. We went through the mail-opening rooms at the company and also the package wrap - ping rooms. The tables for our luncheon were very prettily decor - ated. There was a hostess for every two tables. A beautiful leather stationery holder was given to us as a souvenir as well as a green and white carnation and fern. When we finished eating, we went into a room with a platform down the center with chairs on three sides of it. A comedian, known as Happy Joe Paul, came out and made a few wise cracks. An opera singer entertained us next. Then the style show began. The girls modeled in the latest styles of dresses, coats, hats, pajamas, and shoes. This was very interesting and the girls who modeled were very attractive. In the middle of the afternoon, we took a special elevated train back to the hotel where we could rest and prepare for the best banquet of the week at the Grand Ballroom of the Sherman Hotel that evening. The furnishings, fix - tures, and scheme of architecture of the banquet room were very impressive. There were about twelve large beautiful chandeliers in the room. Several of the Nebraska delegation had front seats; I was one who did. The national health champions were announced and were presented with trophies. The national style show review was on the stage and the winners announced. The four winners in the style show got a free trip next June to the shrines of American history. A reel, showing the last four winners while they were on their trip, was </seg>
            <seg id="p470">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE next on the program. Edgar A. Guest talked and gave a few of his poems. The Moses' and president's trophies -were given to two national outstanding club boys and girls. On Wednesday morning we took special busses for the tour through the McCormick Works and Twine Mill. We saw the first reaper ever made and used, which is now one hundred years old. We went through rooms with large bales of sisal fiber. The fibers were drawn through pins where the slivers were lengthened several times. This fiber was drawn through many machines and finally the finished twine came out of a fiber twisting machine. Women operated the machines which wound the balls and tested the strength of the twine in each ball. All of the twine was put through a vat containing oil which keeps the fiber from becoming too dry and brittle and also serves to keep insects from eating through the twine when it is on the grain bundles in the harvest field. A man sews burlap together to make the sacks in which twine is kept. The sacks are taken on conveyor belts to a machine that stamps the name of the twine, number of pounds, etc., on each sack. They are filled and the sack tops sewed, and are then taken to the large storeroom that must cover a half block. The mill makes twine the whole year around. A picture was taken of all the state delegations and one picture will be sent to everyone who was in it. The girls and boys were divided into separate groups after the picture and then we went to the International Har - vester Company where we were guests at luncheon. After dinner we went through the machine shops where men were making parts. In these rooms were artificial lights which had the same value as daylight to the men who were working. These lights made every - thing look purple to us, especially anything red. Each state delega - tion sang its songs, but Iowa, Oklahoma, Ontario, Canada, and Ne - braska had the prettiest songs and yells. The souvenir which we received here was a very nice pocket flashlight. In the afternoon we took special busses for the International Live - stock Exposition tOisee the horse show and other exhibits. The horse show took place in! the arena. The ten thousand seats were full and many people stood; up to see it. There were gaited saddle horses, draft teams, two six-horse hitches, ponies, and a polo game. The polo teams were not evenly matched. The men would miss the ball often and Btrike the horses in the mouth. The two six-horse hitches that performed were from the Chicago Stock Yards and the Wilson Pack - ing Company. I looked at Nebraska exhibits in the 4-H Club Building there. I saw my jars that were In the Hazel Atlas exhibit. I saw my peas for the last time, as the Atlas Company will keep it. The cattle, horses, and hogs were all looking their best. The horses were especially pretty. Some of them could not stand still when they heard band music. The delegations took the train back to the Auditorium </seg>
            <seg id="p471">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Hotel to practice our songs for the theater party. The stage was one of the largest in Chicago. The front seats are much lower than the* back ones. It seemed as if we were walking up a steep grade when we went out. The show was made up of 4-H club delegates. Those who took part learned their parts in one day and practiced only twice before that evening. Two demonstration teams demonstrated as a part o£ the program. The boy's team from Indiana showed how to pack apple baskets in a freight car. The girl's team demonstrated dressing the baby of long ago and the one of today. We sang 4-H club songs. A girl from Iowa led the singing of the girl's 4-H song, "Dreaming". A Nebraska boy led the Club Congress delegation in singing the boy's song called "The Plowing Song". We thought that was quite an honor for Nebraska to have out of all the states and Canada. On Thursday morning the girls were guests at Montgomery Ward's for breakfast. Here we had hostesses. We did not have breakfast until S o'clock because it took fifty minutes to reach the plant from our hotel. A nice program was furnished and we were given a pair of scissors us a souvenir. Each state sang its songs. Nebraska's song was one of the outstanding ones sung that morning. We were taken through the laboratory and mail order rooms. At 11:30 we left the establishment for the elevated train to go back to the loop. We ate dinner and prepared for our trip to the Art Institute. On our way to the Institute we took the subway under Michigan Avenue. A lady gave us a lecture on some of the pictures which are in the Institute. All of the pictures there were originals. There were statues made by famous sculptors. There were things preserved from the Middle Ages also. The picture I liked best was "Song of the Lark". A person had to study these pictures before he could begin to see the beauty in them, and we did not have much time to do it. In the middle of the afternoon we went back to the hotel to rest and go shopping. When the group started to go shopping another girl and I were saying good-bye to Kdna and taking pictures. Wo and several others got left behind and so had to shop alone. We did not shop long because we had some packing to do before 6:00. We went to our hotel and had a good time there and cleaned up for the last banquet in Chicago. This banquet was in the Auditorium Hotel. Here there were more trophies awarded. At 10:00 we went to the depot to get on our train f "The Portland Rose", another nice train. Our berths were made when we got on tne train so we did not have long to spend playing cards, talking, or writing autographs in the observation car. As Edna did not come back with us, I had a different "sidekick" coming home, who was the health girl, Evelyn Dittman. We invited two girls in upper berths to come into our lower one until we crossed the Mississippi river. We </seg>

"We arrived in Omaha about 10:00 o'clock. Some of the boys and girls got off in Omaha so we had to say goodbye to them there. There were about ten who went on the bus to Lincoln, where more of the party broke up. We all hated to separate, but I think almost every - one will be at the State Fair next year. I left Lincoln at 6:15 and arrived in Exeter where my folks met me at 7:30. Amelia_ Nebraska December 10, 1932 Dear Miss Smith: I wish to extend to you my sincere thanks and appreciation for my trip to the Eleventh Boys and Girls National Club Congress which you and your association helped to make possible. I enjoyed the trip and consider it a very educational trip in many ways. I sincerely hope that many other boys and girls may have the same privilege that I have had. I hope that as a result of my trip I may be able to inspire other 4-H club members to greater interest and activity in their club projects and ever be a booster for 4-H club work. Yours very truly, MARTHA FISHER ■,.■■■■■■■"■■■■■■ ■ My Trip to Chicago. As I was a member of the Nebraska delegation to the Ninth Nation - al Boys and Girls Club Congress, the trip was not a new experience for me. Many of the things that we did and saw were the same as on the former trip. Yet there were new experiences which I feel made this trip very worthwhile. The whole delegation seemed to be honorary visitors of Chicago the week of November 27 to December 3. Our transporation from one place to another was provided. We were entertained at luncheons and dinners by outstanding business firms such as the Chicago Mail Order Company, Sears Roebuck and Company, Montgomery Ward &amp; Company, Wilson &amp; Company, Armour's and Swift's Packing Com - panies and the International Harvester Company. Most of these busi - ness firms entertained us with a program and presented us with souvenirs. They also took iis through the most interesting depart - ments of their respective business houses. ! Wilson &amp; Company especially favored the group by presenting to us one of the outstanding citizens of United States. Amelia Earhart, </seg>
            <seg id="p473">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION the first woman to cross the Atlantic by airplane as a passenger uuu later to make a solo flight across the Atlantic to Ireland. She ex - plained many of the interesting features connected with aeronautics. At the annual club members' banquet another outstanding citizen of the United States, Edgar Guest, gave us a very interesting address. His theme was "Set your ideals high and work to attain those Ideals. There is nothing worth while attained without work." He used sev - eral of his well-known poetical compositions to emphasize the thoughts presented. A drive by taxi through the grounds where the World's Fair is to be held next year was a part of the girls' program for the week. On the shores of Lake Michigan is being erected a large group of buildings in which to exhibit "The Century of Progress", that is, through the use of objects the progress of the last century will be represented. For example,, the Hall of Science, a huge structure shaped like a U con - taining enough room to accommodate eighty thousand persons will portray all the magics of modern science. At the Art Institute and Adler Planetarium we listened to interest - ing and educational lectures on "The Mysteries of the Planets" and "The Appreciation of Art". There are two facts that I learned while in Chicago which I be - lieve are outstanding remembrances educationally. The Chicago river which flows through that city, runs out of Lake Michigan instead of into the lake and second, in all of the International Harvester Com - pany's twine factories there is enough twine made every four hours to go around the world at the equator. I enjoyed my trip to the Club Congress very much and deemed it a privilege to be one of those who represented Nebraska and Holt county in the National Home Economics Judging Contests. I wish to thank those who helped to make the trip possible and I hope that as a result of my trip I may be able to inspire other 4-H club members to greater interest and activity in their club projects and ever be a booster for 4-H club work.

Thanking you again, I am, Your truly, BIRDIE DOOLITTE. My Trip to Chicago. I left O'Neill about 3:30 Saturday on the Northwestern train. At 6:15 I ate breakfast at Norfolk and then got in Omaha quite early. At Omaha Mr. Frisbie and the rest of the club folks all met and that afternoon left for Chicago. After lots of fun that night, besides my flrst ride on a Pullman, we got in Chicago on Sunday morning about 7 o'clock. We intended to stay at the Auditorium Hotel but we were in - structed to stay at the Harrison. I went to church at ten; after dinner we went out to the Field Museum and the Planetarium. We went all through the Museum and then back to the Auditorium. We took our baggage to the Harrison Hotel. I went to bed early Sunday night because I was going to judge the next morning. We got up quite early the next morning and all went to our judg - ing places. Being a Girls' Home Economics Judge, I went to the Saddle and Sirloin Club. After judging we ate lunch at the building and then met the rest of the club folks at 3:45. From there we were taken in busses furnished by Wilson &amp; Com - pany. We were given a dinner and an interetsing program was pro - vided. The next day we could sleep as long as we wanted, for we were going shopping. At 10:15 A. M. Tuesday we left the Auditorium Hotel in taxicabs to go through the Century of Progress grounds and arrived at the Adler Planetarium at 10:45. At twelve o'clock we left in taxicabs furnished by The Chicago Mail Order Company. We had a good lunch and then were entertained by a program. On Wednesday we met at the Auditorium and left for a tour through the McCormick works and twine mill. At 11:30 we were given an address by George A. Ranny, and were entertained by music. At 1:00 we left for the Livestock Exposition. Next we watched a horse show. At 4:00 we left for the loop. That evening the dinner hour </seg>
            <seg id="p475">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION was left open for groups to dine by themselves. At 8:00 «e weui to the Auditorium theater for a party. Thursday was educational day. We'assembled in the lobby of the Auditorium and then went to Montgomery Ward &amp; Company for break - fast. The noon hour was left open to dine at different places. At 1:00 we assembled In the lobby of the Auditorium Hotel and from there went to the Art Institute. We did some shopping and then returned home for rest and getting ready for the party. We met at the Auditorium at 6:00 where we had a play and some music. We went to the station at 10:15 and boarded the train for home. I got home about 12:00 P. M. Saturday evening, feeling fine. PART IV WESTERN ORGANIZED AGRICULTURE A plan for a series of meetings similar to that followed in 1931 was again used. Two-day meetings were held in the following towns; each forenoon separate home economics meetings were held for the women and a local woman presided for the session each day: Date Place Women who presided Dec. 5 and 6 Oshkosh . x ..Mrs. Bernice Burdorf Mrs. M. F. Dailey Dec. 6 and 7 Sidney .Mrs. Henry Yowell Mrs. H. Bruce Dec. 7 and 8 .Bridgeport .Mrs. L. A. Moomaw Mrs. H. H. Huet Dec. 8 and 9 Harrison Mrs. Howard Brown Mrs. Oscar Skavdahl Dec. 9 and 10 Chadron .Mrs. H. V. Bass Mrs. Major Hale On the first morning the program opened with music at 9:45. Following this Mrs. Blanche Hill of Lincoln gave a talk on "The Challenge of Today". Mrs. R. O. Williams of Kearney then talked on "Our Future in Homemaking". There was a round table discussion on recreation which closed the morning program. The Home Economics program for the second morning was as follows: The music was followed by a talk given by Mr. N. W. Gaines on "Our Greatest Need". </seg>
            <seg id="p476">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Mrs. Julia Kiene of Capper's Farmer talked on Some Pood Prob - lems in the Home. She had for distribution useful circulars which had menus and recipes. Dr. Ruth Staples, director of the Nursery School of the Home Eco - nomics Department of the University oC Nebraska, gave a talk on "Building the Child's Personality". On the program of the second day in the afternoon Mrs. Kiene gave a talk on "Keeping the Boys and Girls Interested in the Com - munity". THE CHALLENGE OP TODAY MRS. BLANCHE HILL There is a challenge which comes to every homemaker in times like the present. We have big problems to meet and still we need to keep cheerful and happy although the times are trying. By keeping cheerful we contribute to the happiness of the whole family and re - assure them of the stability of the "American home". The psychological effect of a cozy, attractive room as compared to a cheerless, dingy room has proved to us the importance of making our homes attractive as a means of creating cheerfulness and contentment in them. It does not necessitate the spending of a great deal of money to accomplish this end. Some of the most attractive homes have been those which have been furnished with simple and inexpensive things. Today I have a number of accessories for homes which we will look over and discuss. These have been made with very little ex - pense and only a small amount of time. These are articles which were made and are being used to brighten up a home. (Show) — homemade picture frames made of wall board and screen moulding; placques made by pasting magazine prints on boards which have been stained and shellacked. (Discuss) — types of pictures to select for different rooms and how to hang them, scones for candles made from tin cans which have been enamelled, table scarfs made from unbleached muslin, sugar or flour sacks. Sometimes it is not a matter of adding more to the home but a question of sorting out and rearranging what we already have. The following points are important in the arrangement of furniture: 1. Large pieces of furniture should be placed parallel with the wall. 2. Chairs and desks should be arranged with respect to conven- </seg>
            <seg id="p477">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION ient light and for comfort. 3. Smaller pieces of furniture can be placed across the corner in order to take away from the stiffness of the room. 4. All large pieces of furniture should not be placed on one side of the room — distribution should be such as to give balance . 5. One large center of interest with smaller ones, adds to the attractiveness of the room and makes for harmony. OUR FUTURE IN HOMEMAKING . MRS. R. O. WILLIAMS Perhaps it is needless for me to tell you that I am not a public speaker, nor am I used to appearing before groups of people. I never had the advantage of being a member of a 4-H club, for now so early in life, our boys and girls get the excellent training that helps them to appear at ease before an audience. Since I am not a trained speaker, perhaps you wonder, "Why has this woman been sent to speak to us?" It is because I am a farm wo - man and I know the plight we farm people are in at the present time, because I am living the life. Once after I had given a little talk at a Mothers' Vacation camp, a woman came to me and asked, "Do you really live on a farm?" To this I replied, "Yes, so much so, that were I home today, I would be driving the stacker team." I would have awakened early, taken care of the chickens, did as much house work as I would have had time to do by the time husband and nephew were ready to go to the hay field. At noon I would have prepared the dinner and perhaps washed the separator while dinner was cooking and so on. When I was married my friends insisted on pitying me because I had married a farmer, and they were sure if I did not die of hard work, I would of loneliness. I cannot understand how anyone living on a farm can be lonely for the country life is ever changing. One of the worst things of mill or factory life of all kinds is its monotony, the same process repeated hour after hour, and day after day; but no task continues long, either for the farmer or his wife, and there is little danger of them "suffer - ing from a one track mind" because there are so many things in which we are interested. And on the farm the husband's and the wife's in - terests are the same, no matter whether it is Better Dairy laws or Better Babies; Pigs or Produce; Tariff or Taxes. And speaking of taxes, there is no topic that is getting more at- </seg>
            <seg id="p478">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tention than taxes. Our sole aim seems to be in cutting them. We seem to give little or no thought as to where is the best place to cut them. Naturally the public strikes at the weakest point first, and that seems to be everything pertaining to agriculture. It is like con - tract work, the last man to be put on the job is the first to be laid off. Agriculture was the last of all industries to be helped, and it is the first place the public attacks in its desire to reduce taxes. Whose fault is it? I think It is ours. If we remain indifferent and let them do it, it is going to be done. Let us become better organized so that we can better resist these attacks on agriculture. I believe, if you study the records, that you will find in every country that the larger share of taxes is paid by the farmers. We are bearing our share of state and federal taxes, too. Are we not entitled then, to the benefit of certain institutions that are supported by tax - ation? I want to tell you briefly the story of one Farm Bureau. I never see a deserted farm home that a feeling of sadness does not come over me and I wonder why it has been abandoned. Has the own - er become so well-to-do that he has moved to town and has rented the land to a nearby neighbor to farm; or has some old couple had to leave it, because they were no longer able to do the farm work and none of their children would stay on the farm because of the long hours and little recreation; or perhaps the people had been tenants, and their income was not adequate for the needs of the children, and there were no conveniences for the wife. I hope the time is not far distant when all these deserted farm homes will be "repossessed" and the house painted, the fence mended, the orchard restored, and the barn fixed up. The average city home is a resort for the smaller children and a hotel for the other members of the family, but the farm home is not only the house, but it is all the buildings, the trees, the garden, and even the fields. In this repossessed home we find a happy family, and all of them are members of farm organizations. The boys and girls are 4-H club members, and as such are con - stantly employed at something useful and beneficial and so are happier children. The parents consider it a privilege for their children to have 4-H clubs in their community, for they feel that idle moments are dangerous moments. "Idleness restricts development; activity gives life; hard work gives strength of body; hard study gives strength of mind." The September issue of the Ladies' Home Journal tells us there are </seg>
            <seg id="p479">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION 200,000 unwanted, homeless boys with a scattering of girls, wanaer - ing about the United States, meagerly fed, scantily clothed. No use to go home for home offers less than the open road. I venture to say very few of those boys or girls are directly from the farm. I am sure these parents can see the value of club work in keeping their children from becoming a part of this large army of children. Club work is helping them to raise their children to be home-loving, land-loving men and women. I am told that of the four hundred inmates of the reformatory at Lincoln very, very few are from the farm, and not one inmate has ever been a 4-H club member. The mother of their home is naturally a very busy woman, but she finds time to belong to several good organizations that have to do principally with problems concerning rural affairs. Her home has some conveniences and some labor-saving devices which make it possible for her to do her work in less time; therefore she is not too tired to at - tend the meetings where she learns newer and more efficient methods and comes back home to her family a happier women for having had the contact with friends and neighbors. How about this father? Why, of course, he belongs to a farm or - ganization. It may be the Grange, the Farmers Union, or the Farm Bureau. I rather think it is the latter. The purpose of the Farm Bureau is to assist in making the farm business more profitable, the farm home more comfortable and attrac - tive, and the community a better place than when he was a boy. Progressive farmers are eager to gain more knowledge about how to farm and they can get much of this knowledge from the Farm Bureau. When I said this father was a member of the Farm Bureau, I should have said he is a participating member. There is a difference. This man is a friend of the County Agent because of the things he stands for and does for the county. The County Agent shows the way to efficient production; the way to cooperative enterprises, both marketing and purchasing; develops leadership among the farmers, which is so badly needed just now, and above all the value of organization. I wonder if you are aware of the attacks on the Farm Bureau work and the Extension Work. A great deal of money is being spent and some very clever prop - aganda is being used by the opponents of organized agriculture to de- </seg>
            <seg id="p480">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE stroy this constructive work. These enemies tell us that the Farm Bureau and Extension Work cause our taxes to be so high. The av - erage cost of this work to the owner of a quarter section is about sixty cents. Have the benefits derived from this work been worth sixty cents to you? Can you afford to be without it for that sum? To be able to resist the attacks of these powerful interests we must become better organized. This can be done by every County Farm Bureau affiliating with the Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation, which has for its purpose the improvement, in every possible way, the agriculture of Nebraska. Forty-five states are united to form a still stronger organization. The American Farm Federation, which is one of the most important farm organizations, does take a leading part in promoting the interest of the agriculture of America. I am not here to predict what the future in homemaking is to be. It is to be what we farm people make it. If we are going to enjoy satisfactory living standards, it is up to us as farm women and farm men to assume the control and play our part in placing agriculture on an equality with other industries. Let us not leave it to "the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker" to do. It is our job. OUR GREATEST NEED MR. N. W. GAINES At first thought we naturally choose as our greatest need that of money and primarily it always comes first. This calls up the question "money and how to get it" and the answer is "a job for everybody, a good crop next year, and a good price for that crop." And again, all the way down the line, follows the same query, "how to get it?" But you folks, the agricultural extension women of Nebraska, while working along the line of your answer to these questions, are really doing a greater work in teaching yourselves how to be happy even without a great deal of money. A long time ago a philosopher gave utterance to a statement which we are finding out is equally true today, when he said "The desires of man are many but the things that make for contentment and happiness are few and are easily found." You folks are finding them in your Living-at-Home project. It is a study of your economic problem of how to help in making a living but it is also dealing with the more social and spiritual side of how to really live. In your work you are developing what is one of our greatest needs in agriculture, that of Leadership. It takes a number of qualities to </seg>
            <seg id="p481">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION become a real leader, among them being "enthusiasm for the cause, organization of your forces, and determination to stay on the job and never give up." Some folks associate being a good leader -with the Idea of being a good mixer. This might make it easier, but many good mixers are not good leaders at all, while many of our best leaders are of the quiet, unassuming, modest type, the type which possesses the personality that makes it easy for otheTs to mix with them. By this I mean the approachable type, the type who can work with and lead other women without their even feeling that she is leading them. You folks are educating yourselves as well as the other folks in your community. And here, education does not mean getting facts from books. Some of the most ignorant people I know have a store of book knowledge, but know so little about how to apply it to the human side of life. What is education? (Example of the definition given by the little negro boy in the seventh grade of the Detroit schools.) To be a leader, one must have developed that personality that knows other people's problems and senses the situations they are fac - ing. I mean the possessing of sympathy, encouragement, and inspira - tion in working with them. A good leader comes to know without being told whether a certain women, slow in taking hold and often absent from meeting, is held back by the wrong kind of a husband, poor clothing for herself, or because of an atmosphere made by others in the club who resented her awkward grammar or not-up-to-date dress, or conveyance to the meeting, and many little things which enter into her enjoying herself at the meeting. In other words a real leader gets the viewpoint of others and knows how to extend sympathy without humiliating them with cheap pity. You women have the rural problem of your young folks. It may be a more difficult problem than your city sisters face with their young folks or it may be an easier one, all depending on whether or not you live in an agriculturally organized or an unorganized county. If you are in an organized county your answer to the problem is boys' and girls' club work. In the city a parallel type of work costs about $40.00 per year per boy or girl. And $40.00 per year spent </seg>
            <seg id="p482">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE now to build citizenship is better than $400.00 per year which he will cost the state if lack of citizenship lands him in the penitentiary. Through Extension work in boys' and girls' clubs, it cost less than fifteen cents per year per boy or girl in the country. And a record of 200,000 boys and girls having taken the work with only one ever brought to the bar of justice for trial is a real citizenship record. How much do you mean to your community? How much would you be missed should death take you from among the people in that community? Who would miss you and why? Have you a work to do that means a lot to you and an uplift to your neighbors? Have you a real agricultural vision? Inasmuch as my time is up, I am clos - ing my talk with the following poem: If we could but draw back the curtain That surrounds each other's lives, See the naked heart and spirit, Know what spur the action gives, Often we would find it better, Purer than we think we should. Oh, we'd love each other better If we only understood. ■ / If we knew the cares and trials, Knew the efforts all in vain. Knew the bitter disappointment, Understood the loss and gain, Would the grim external roughness Seem, I wonder, just the same? Would we help where now we hinder, Would we pity where we blame? Oh, we judge each other harshly. Knowing not life's hidden force, Knowing not the fount of action. Is less turbid at its source, Seeing not amid the evil All the grains of golden good, Ah, we'd judge each other better If we only understood. , </seg>
            <seg id="p483">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION SOME FOOD PROBLEMS In the talk which Mrs. Julia Kiene, Editor of the Home Department of Capper's Farmer, gave to the women, she emphasized the import - ance of the right foods in the daily diet. In her talk, Mrs. Kiene said: "Our diet in winter has much to do with our health in spring. The 'tired' feeling that comes with the first warm days may have nothing to do with the weather but instead may be caused by a lack of the right variety of foods during the winter months. "Lack of the necessary variety in the diet is more likely in winter than at any other time of the year because some of the important 'protective' foods are then out of season in many parts of the country and, therefore, are more expensive to buy. But some way must be found of supplying, if not these foods, then their equivalent in food value. This is not a simple task for the housewife, but fortunately the average housewife is able to meet the situation. "It is the protective foods, particularly vegetables and fruits, that are likely to appear on the table too seldom in winter. Green, leafy vegetables with their vitamins, their calcium, iron, and other min - erals are just as necessary when out of season as in summer when the gardens are growing. However, these out-of-season foods are costly and difficult to secure. One of the cheapest of all vegetables, however, is cabbage, which may be stored for winter use and which comes at the top of the list for protective foods. It can easily be made into sauerkraut which is an excellent food to include in the diet." Root vegetables are considered protective foods also because of their vitamin and mineral content, but their protective value depends largely upon the method of preparation. Raw Irish potatoes for in - stance are rich in vitamin C and mineral content but cooked mashed potatoes lose much of these protective factors. Carrots and onions may be used raw and contain more vitamin C than when cooked. Mrs. Kiene impressed upon the women the merits of tomatoes either canned or fresh. She said ."Tomatoes either canned or fresh are so high in vitamin content that they rank with cabbage and other green leaves as protective foods, and nothing, by the way, Is easier to serve than tomato juice, hot or cold, either as a drink or as a vegetable. Although classed as a vegetable, tomatoes are really a fruit and may be used for the same purpose when fruits are lacking. "Dried fruits, although they have lost much of their vitamin con - tent, are splendid sources of minerals. The more limited the family purse, the more uneconomical it is to feed the family on a one-sided diet, that is, one too heavy in breads, cereals, fats and sweets, and lacking in vegetables and fruits." </seg>
            <seg id="p484">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE It Is essential for the welfare of her family for the homemaker to recognize the importance and the sources of the various protective vitamins. Every homemaker in planning each of the day's meals ■will need to check her planning carefully to, make sure that there are adequate sources for both minerals and vitamins in the food supply. There are a number of minerals which are essential for the main - tenance of good health, any of which if omitted from the diet would cause the body resources to suffer accordingly. However, the three which are most commonly mentioned are calcium, phosphorus, and iron. In general, if these three are provided in sufficient quantities, other minerals are automatically supplied. In reply to the question often asked, "Why is calcium necessary?" Mrs. Kiene replied: "First of all it is needed for bone-making. Ninety - nine per cent of the calcium of the body is in the bones. Without it children have rickets and poorly developed body structure. A child with rickets in most instances has had too little calcium in his diet. Poor teeth are frequently a result of too little calcium. "During pregnancy a woman should eat food especially rich in calcium for she not only needs it for her own body but for the bones of the little body that is growing. It used to be said that a woman lost a tooth for every baby. If more attention had been paid to the daily calcium intake during the period of pregnancy the tooth would not have needed to be lost. Calcium is also necessary for the proper coagulation of the blood and for normal heart action. Without the proper development of bones, normal heart action, and quick coagula - tion of blood, an individual cannot be healthy. If an insufficient supply of calcium is fed the family, nature steps in and draws her supply from the bony structures. During the period of lactation, that is, during the time a mother is nursing her baby, she should also pay strict attention to the calcium content of her food." Milk ranks very high as a source of calcium. The calcium found in milk is more usable than the calcium found in other foods. In order to insure an adequate supply of calcium, the quart of milk dally is recommended for the growing child and at least one pint for the adult. Other common sources of calcium are egg yolk, cheese, and leafy vegetables. Phrosphorus is another important mineral to consider. It is found In every living cell and is essential for the maintenance of each cell. Phosphorus is necessary for cell development and is associated with the movement of liquids in the body, maintenance of the proper liquid content of the body tissues and with proper absorption and secretion. Phosphorus is also necessary for the prevention of rickets. Good sources of phosphorus include dry beans, whole grain cereals, cheese </seg>
            <seg id="p485">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION egg yolk, lentils, milk, and meat. ■ .- The third important mineral to -which special attention needs to be given is iron. Iron is the mineral necessary for good red blood cor - puscles. Iron is needed by the body in order to avoid anemia. Women need iron in greater quantities than men because of certain reproduc - tive functions. Menstraution, pregnancy, and lactation all tend to in - crease a woman's iron requirement. An infant is born with a re - serve iron supply which lasts through £he early months of life. Milk contains no iron, so very soon it is necessary to supplement the baby's diet with foods containing iron. For this reason egg yolk, vegetables, and whole grain cereal gruels are added to the baby's food supply while he is still quite young. Common foods which are rich in iron are egg yolk, liver, lean meat, whole grain cereals, spinach, lettuce, molasses, prunes, raisins, dried beans, peas, cabbage, and greens. Some winter menus for farm families have been planned which not only make provision for the protective foods mentioned above but which also make use of many of Nebraska's own products.

BUILDING THE CHILD'S PERSONALITY DR. RUTH STAPLES Among our acquaintances we find many different people. There are the "worriers" and the calm ones, the self-controlled and the quick - tempered, the deceitful and the truthful. The question presenting it - self to parents is: What makes these differences in individuals? While |we cannot make any sweeping statement, it is the general opnion at the present time that these personality traits are, to a large extent, habits and attitudes originating in childhood. By constantly practicing ! honesty, sincerity, or unselfishness, such characteristics tend to stay with us all of our lives. There are many fundamental traits which must be established in childhood if we wish our children to become well adjusted to society, that is, to get along satisfactorily with other people and to make a definite contribution to the happiness and well being of those with whom they come in contact. We will consider but two of them — conforming to authority and honesty. Comforniing to Authority. In teaching children habits of obedience we must first consider our goal. Is merely to obey always in itself a wholly desirable thing? To obey means to do as someone tells you. While we all may agree that the two-year-old should heed the commands of his wise mother, we would fail to admire the grown man who was so susceptible to the suggestions of others that he failed to use his own judgment. What we want to do for our children in teaching conformance to authority is to guide them in such a manner that they will ultimately set up the , right kind of ideals and standards which will adequately guide them when they must assume the responsibility for their own behavior. We should lead them to do the right because they really believe it is the best thing to do and not because of fear of consequences if the act is left undone. </seg>
            <seg id="p492">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The practical person Immediately asks how we can accomplish this training. There are a number of ways which have proved effec - tive and which we can apply to nearly every situation. First, we must consider our own attitude in giving commands to our children. We should always be reasonable in the requests we make. By being rea - sonable we mean appreciating the child's point of view and being will - ing to explain the reasons for our commands. To insist on obedience merely because "I told you to do it", or "Mother knows best" doesn't help the child much in setting up standards or ideals for regulating his own conduct. Left to himself, out of his parents' influence, he has nothing to serve as a guide. Again, we must be consistent in what we request from the youngsters. We should not one day admonish the child who fails to drink his milk, the next day forbid dessert until it is consumed, and the third day let him leave it untouched and eat what he pleases. The child must learn to relate cause and effect, and this can be done only when circumstances remain consistent. We should also avoid giving too many orders. It is wiser to select a few things of importance and work on those rather than to continually nag at this and that. A second important rule is old-fashioned, but excellent; it is to see that our commands are carried out. To be quietly firm and expect obedience, to teach that we mean what we say is of utmost importance. The mother who told her boy he could have no pie until he ate his vegetable soup and then gave him the pie when he refused to eat the soup, because she felt sorry for him, cannot expect obedience the next time. It is best to give only the commands that we are willing to see executed and then see them through. Third, it we must punish, let us do it constructively, that is, give the kind of punishment that will change the child's attitude toward what he has done. Punishment should not be administered in anger, in the spirit of revenge, or because we have been annoyed. Our first thought should be, "Why did he do it?" rather than "How can I punish?" The three-year-old who kicks and screams may need to be isolated or learn that no one wants him around when he behaves in this way. The five-year-old who refuses to put away his blocks may need to sit on a chair until he is ready to do so. But the girl who fell out of a swing while holding baby chick;, and killed two did not need the whipping her mother gave her. In all three cases we must con - sider the motive, or the cause, and work from that to alter future behavior. Teaching Hontesy. The little child needs early to learn to respect the property and in - terests of others. If he learns that some things are his and that others are not to be touched, while still others may be shared by </seg>
            <seg id="p493">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION each In turn, he has learned his first lesson in honesty. He needs to have his own possessions, a small amount ot money for his very own, and the experience in sharing that comes through companionship with other children. The "lies" of the tiny child are usually merely imagination. If the four-year-old comes in with an impossible tale, we should not condemn him, or make too much over it. We should help him distinguish be - tween truth and fiction, and to understand that real accomplishment is worth more than an imaginary experience. Most of children's real ■ lies, their efforts to deceive, are caused by fear of the consequences of the truth. When confronted with a child who is untruthful, the parent should ask himself, "Am I punishing him too severely?" or "Am I holding up too high a standard ot accomplishment?" It may also be wise to help the child find satisfaction in something he can do ■well rather than to over-emphasize his short-comings. In all cases we must remember that example is better than precept. We must keep our promises, avoid making threats that are never carried out, and at all times be honest and truthful ourselves. Honesty, sincerity and self-control are habits. They are learned in the same way that other habits are acquired, by practice, especially satisfying practice. The small child learns that it pays to refrain from a temper outburst, that it is worth while to obey his mother or to tell the truth. It is satisfying to win the approval of his friends or family, and nothing is to be gained by losing his temper. As he grows older he gets his satisfaction by living up to his ideals or stand - ards for behavior. It gives him pleasure to be truthful, because truth to him means self respect. All of these personality traits take time to learn and take time to teach, and require careful thought and attention, but they cost no money and can be afforded by even the poorest home. No matter how small the income, every family can give their children the right start in life by teaching those habits and attitudes which are essential to good citizenship. KEEPING THE BOYS AND GIRLS INTERESTED IN THE COMMUNITY MRS. JULIA KIENE I have chosen to talk about the home and community. Certainly there never could be found a more representative group of people with whom to discuss this subject than you folks who are doing such a tremendous job with community activities here in western Nebraska. Before discussing the community let us start at home. I am </seg>
            <seg id="p494">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE thankful that my married life up to the time of my husband's death was spent on a farm, and that my two daughters who are now almost young ladles have the heritage of the farm. Selecting a Location Selecting a country home is not as simple a task as that of select - ing a home in town. Should you wish to settle in a town, you and your husband would first of all decide upon the amount you could afford to spend for shelter, for after all that is what the town evolves itself into. You then would begin hunting for the house that would furnish all your requirements at the price you had decided to pay. You might find that home in a neighborhood not so desirable as you had planned, but that weighed against the home would be negligible, for you would feel you could develop your friends elsewhere. And so the town woman having found the house she wanted, regardless of location, would then fall to in her job of home-making in a new locality. But not so the country homemaker. She, too, has her ideals for her home; she, too, with her husband has settled on the amount they can well afford to spend on the new home — but on a different basis. For this home is not a mere shelter. It is the office for their busi - ness, and like all offices, it has to be located in the most logical spot for good business. First of all the potential possibilities of the busi - ness must be considered. How fertile is the soil, what are the drain - age problems, in what condition are the buildings, how great is the distance from shipping centers, and how adequate is the water supply, all come in for their share of serious consideration. After the general layout of the farm has been analyzed, another matter of serious thought must be considered. What is the general attitude of the neighborhood? What social life does the community afford? For no matter how fertile the soil might be, how comfortable the home, how accessible to shipping centers, unless the community is a healthy one you would not select it. Why? Because next in Importance to money for supplying the material needs of the family, the community must offer an opportunity for satisfying the family's social needs. The isolation of the farm family makes them dependent not only upon one another but upon the entire community. Without genial community activities the home and farm interests could not function as they should. Its members could not be happy. Without happiness, family life would be shipwrecked on the rocks of dis - satisfaction. Unquestionably the origin of the social life depends on the community. It drains the best efforts of the home to make the best community. </seg>
            <seg id="p495">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION The Change in the Size of a Community How large is a community? Twenty-five years ago the com - munity was not so large. Poor roads and horse-drawn vehicles made it impossible for any community to expand more than ten miles at the most. In those days get-togethers were infrequent. And I will venture to guess that there is not a soul here who used to attend those apple-coring parties, those barn-raising dances, that does not think back on them with tenderness and affection. Why? Because when you went to them you put every ounce of energy you had in having a good time and seeing that others did. You, yourself personally contributed to the evening's fun. There were no paid entertainers, no radio to be tuned in, no canned music to be turned on. From your community, or one very close by, came the fiddlers, and what fun you had all piled into the large horse-drawn vehicle, planning just the various stunts you would do when you got to the party. You helped make the evening a success. And the success of the gather - ing made the community a better place. You helped make the even - ing a success. And the success of the gathering made the community a better place. You did not have many entertainments, but the ones you did have were glorious adventures in happiness. The modern generation is a little inclined to pity you who farmed so long ago. But it seems to me that you are not entitled to that. You were happy. You were constantly contributing the best you had to the task of living. You worked hard, yes, but it is not the back-breaking drudgery of the farm that kills its people — it is the soul-breaking drudgery. The quickest relief from such drudgery, in my opinion, is an adequate social life. I speak of an adequate social life lightly, as though a wave of the wand and you have it. But not so. Building a community demands as much consistent effort, as many successes, and as manj r failures as building up worn out soil. It demands the best of every individual member of the family. Again, it depends on the size of the community. Certainly more than the old-time five-mile radius is involved in the modern day community. Suppose your trading center is fifteen miles from your home. Is it not necessary for you to be very familiar with the social life of that town? Must you not know what type of movies, what type of games, what type of young folks, your young people are going to encounter? If this should happen to be where the young folks will enter high school, must you not know about the school, its teachers, its ideals? And so your community automatically stretches itself beyond its immediate friends into the nearest town or towns as the case may be. </seg>
            <seg id="p496">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Activities of One Community. In my work as Editor of the Home Department of Capper's Farmer I am constantly meeting with unusual community activities. Not so long ago I found an example of what good roads and automobiles will do towards stretching the community. It was in western Kansas. I was the guest of one of the rural clubs near Goodland, Kansas. Wish - ing to make several calls on the way out, I drove my car. I arriyed in Goodland the nfght before the meeting, and called the hostess to get directions for coming out the next day. I am amazingly stupid when it comes to following road directions, and since this farm home was off the main highway I experienced difficulty in getting there. I do not know how familiar you folks are with western Kansas roads, but when you get off the main highways, they are not well marked. This road led me through open prairies, over dry streams, and the further I went the fewer homes I saw. After I had traveled about twenty miles, I began to got disgusted. How could there be a club meeting worth while when there were so few homes, and no people living around there. To have spent so much of my time for seven or eight women was making me feel a little provoked. Suddenly I came to a little hilltop and down in the valley I saw a white farm house, and in the yard I could detect many cars. My opinion of myself rose instantly. Because I was to be a guest, the entire countryside for miles around had come. Never do I have such wild bursts of conceit but what they are immediately enjected from me. It so happened in this case. However, I was correct about one thing. Everyone, from the entire countryside had come, but not to see or hear me. They were interested in somthing else of far greater importance to them than my visit. I love to tell the story of how I entered this home a little late, for, frankly, I had lost my way several times. The women were glad to see me, but my being there did not begin to hold the interest for them that the discussion about the little red chairs did. As I sat and listened I learned this very lovely story of community development and expansion. Years ago, way back in the apple-cor - ing days, there had been a community center for the families. They had built a little church and used this building for the center of their activities. But as these older folks passed away, and drifted else - where, the community died. For ten years or such a matter there had been nothing to interest the young folks. They were getting to be a problem, for young folks must play, and it is the wise parent who always remembers that. Some of the women got together and de - cided they would establish church again, and use that as the nucleus for community life. Since they had to have some medium through "which to work, they decided to organize a club, the object being to promote a better community and social life. It did not dismay a single woman there that at every meeting someone of those present </seg>
            <seg id="p497">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION would have to travel a distance of twenty-five miles in order to come. A year previous the women had decided to finance church, services twice a month, and Sunday School every Sunday. Finding teachers and pupils was rather a task until someone hit upon the bright idea of the little red chairs. The same little red chairs they were dis - cussing when I came into the room. This had been the scheme. There were about twenty-five or thirty smaller children among the families, children in the first seven years of their life. These young - sters were too young to come to Sunday School alone. And so they were approached in this manner. If eighteen little boys and girls would come to Sunday School for six weeks in succession, then eigh - teen little red chairs would be bought for these little children to sit in during Sunday School. These women knew if they could sell the children on the idea of Sunday School, the older folks would have to come to bring the youngsters. The plan worked. The required number of children had come for the required number of Sundays, and the little red chairs were about to be purchased. This has taken me only a few moments to tell. It took those twenty-five or thirty women many weeks to accomplish it. They had all sorts of entertainments in the church to raise money; they gave plays, box suppers, and various social events. It required hours of labor and much extra work of women who already were over - crowded with home activities. But what happened? They gave to their young people a fuller life, for young folks should never be raised without a religious influence. They gave to their young folks a social life that is the heritage of every young person. Could they have done this within the confines of their home without their community; NO. Yet the influence had just as direct bearing on the life of the young people as the influence of the home. It happened to be a Thursday that I was attending this meeting and on the following night the junior class of the high school at, Goodland was putting on a play. I was asked to remain over and! go with this group of women who were going en masse to the play. "Why? Because one woman had a son and another a daughter who were going to take part in this play and they felt that out of respect to the young people they should show their interest by attending. What was the thing this group of women was unconsciously doing? Nothing more or less than reaching out beyond their community con - fines and encompassing the town. The Country Interests The Town Ten years or so ago when I was a Home Demonstration Agent in Shawnee county, Kansas, I helped organize a club. This group of women lived near a little town called Tecumseh which happened to be some nine or ten miles from Topeka. Unfortunately there was </seg>
            <seg id="p498">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE a pool hall and dance hall located just on the outskirts of Topeka, and the young folks of this community, in going to town, were apt to stop there. The results were that far too many young folks stopped to dance at this rather objectionable place. But the women, being farm women, did not throw up their hands in despair. They got busy instead. A fine old gentleman who lived in Tecumseh and who sensed the difficulty said to these women, "If you will put up a build - ing that can be used as a community center, I will deed you a plot of ground that has the most beautiful view of any location I know in the state of Kansas." But he went on to say, "This building must be used for community activities. If the Grange wants to meet there, if the Farm Bureau wants to use it, if the church, or any organiza - tion in any way connected with the activities of the farm folks want to use the building, they must be allowed to have it rent free." That was a pretty big order, especially since it was in the spring of the year. But these women went to their husbands and said, "Of course, we know you are busy, the spring work is just starting, but we need your help, oh, so much. If you will give us a week of time, your horses, and scrapers, we will feed you well, and the young folks of the community will repay you later. They sold the idea to their husbands, and before it seemed possible, the basement was ex - cavated. The women thought if they could only get the basement started and covered, in time they could do the rest. The women went to the merchants in Topeka and said, "We want to keep our young folks home, and we would like help from you. If you will give us money to buy the brick for the foundation of our community center, we will turn it over to the people of Topeka once a month, but the rest of the time it is ours for our young folks." The merchants liked the idea and the money was generously given. The following June the corner stone was laid, and Senator Capper and I helped to lay it. The next fall the building was complete with a debt of several hundred dollars hanging over it. By this time the older folks of the community were pretty well tired out, for it had been an enormous undertaking. Then the younger members of the community spoke and said, "We will take over the note on this community building and finish paying it off." They did. A theater movement was organized and the first thing these young folks knew they were giving plays, creditable plays, too. And were they busy! It took so much time getting properties ready, re - hearsing, learning parts, and building scenery, that they did not have time to visit the dance hall on the edge of Topeka. They had found something constructive to do. The note was paid off. The building stands without debt. What are these young folks going to remember when they are older? They are going to remember the fun they had dancing with their parents, the boys teaching their mothers new </seg>
            <seg id="p499">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION steps, and the fathers being waltzed around by the daughters. For they have a community dance there every two weeks. They are also going to remember the hours they spe^c in dramatics. Like our fathers and mothers they have given of themselves to make this com - munity a better place in which to live. It is interesting to know that farms are not for sale around Tecumseh. The families are prosperous and happy, and above all, content. Has not the time these mothers and fathers spent doing things outside of the home for the community been of as great importance as the duties they performed within the home? And this community stretched out and encompassed a city of 70,000. It is frequently said that the eyes of youth android age never can look out the same window, because the eyes of old age are looking through the window of yesterday. But it seems to me that these folks at Tecumseh have pretty much focused their looks out the same window. Bringing Out The Best Last spring when I was in New York I took a half day off to wander about Allen street, which is in the slum district of New York. I love to drift into unusual-looking shops, and I chanced upon an interesting-looking shop and I thought it would be fun to go inside. No one was about, but in a show case, and scattered about the room, were many pieces of unusual-colored glass. Presently a young chap came out from the back part of the shop, and in a charming foreign accent asked if he might serve me. I asked him what he did with so many pieces of colored glass, and to my delight he asked me if I should enjoy seeing his work shop. I discovered that he made colored glass windows, and since I had never seen any constructed before, I asked him if he would work for me, so I might have an idea how such windows were made. I was intrigued by the way in which he would put an unusually lovely piece of glass beside one not so beautiful. Always the beauty of the one piece brought out the best in the plainer piece of glass, and the result was an exquisite piece of art. In the outer room the various pieces of glass meant nothing, but combined, they were an exquisite piece of work. So it is with a community. Individually, the people living in it, mean but little, but when al Hhe individuals are gathered together, it makes of itself a piece of beauty and an influence on the lives of everyone living within the community. </seg>

H. Hoppert, Lincoln The sixty-fourth annual convention of the Nebraska Horticultural Society met in the Auditorium, Agricultural Hall, of the Agricultural College, Lincoln, Nebraska. It was called to order at 9:30 A. M. by the President, Mr. Joe Green of Fremont, Nebraska, who acted as chairman. ■'.. • ''■ - MR. GREEN: Well, we haven't much of a crowd here yet. How - ever, we have a few here and those who are here will get the benefit. We have what I consider one of the best programs I have seen in a long time. The first on our program this morning will be "Roadside Planting" by Ernst Herminghaus. Paved highways mean permanent highways. There isn't much use improving any other kind. The time, money and trouble may be wasted if spent on temporary high - ways. I'm sure you'll be interested in hearing what Mr. Herminghaus has to say on this subject. He is a graduate landscape architect and has had enough engineering to appreciate what Mr. Cochran's Depart - ment is up against.. </seg>
            <seg id="p504">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ROADSIDE PLANTING By E. H. HERMINGHAXJS The Nebraska landscape is on the whole rather uninteresting to the casual traveller who uses our highways. The roads are straight and for the most part the ground is fairly level. Naturally the traveller thinks the plains of Nebraska are rather monotonous though of course he appreciates the advantage if he knows anything at all about agriculture. Of course not all of Nebraska is flat prairie. If he travels across the state from south to north at the eastern border he will be disillu - sioned if he has imagined all of Nebraska to be flat. There are some marvellous scenes along the Missouri River and along the Platte and the Blue. The S. Y. A. highway between Lincoln and Seward is an excellent example of the natural beauty of our rolling prairie sec - tion. Unfortunately most of the travellers cross the state east and west and they find the landscape uninteresting for the most part. The beauty of a highway depends primarily upon the beauty of the country side and the beauty o£ the country side is in turn dependent largely upon its trees. To make our highways more beautiful and restful requires trees and lots of them. Nebraska lacks trees we will all agree. Trees provide shade, protect against hot winds and fierce winter winds and drifting snow, in addition to adding interest to the country side. The planting of trees along the highways offers several difficulties that must not be overlooked. Modern paved highways require prac - tically all of the space legally set aside for roadways. The pavement and shoulders usually occupy 20 to 22 feet at the center. At each side there is a shoulder of 6 to 8 feet upon which to park cars temporarily. Then there are drainage ditches at each side. These occupy 10 to 12 feet in width including the two banks. When all these features are provided there is very little room left for trees and if they were planted on the remaining space the trees would interfere with tele - phone wires and transmission lines. You may say that these should be put underground but under present conditions there is little likeli - hood of this being done. Since it is not feasible to do much planting on the 6 6 foot road - way, there is only one other alternative, namely that private prop - erty adjoining the highway be used for this purpose. If an additional 60 foot strip could be secured on each side of the road something really worth while could be accomplished. Windbreaks could be planted to protect the highway from drifting snows. Mixed plantings of pines and broadleafed trees would be much more effective than corn stalks or snow fences and certainly much more attractive. In </seg>
            <seg id="p505">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY those places where windbreak plantings are not needed, groups of trees and shrubs could be used to blend into the landscape in a more natural way. The difficulty here lies in the acquiring of these 50 foot strips. The state could acquire the land by outright purchase; but there is little likelihood of highway funds being devoted to land - scape development while there are 2000 miles of unimproved main highways. Farmers and others who are not on the main highways would raise quite a howl if road funds were used on anything besides actual roadways. The next best thing would be to get farm owners in a mood to set aside these strips for improvement purposes in return for which these areas would not be taxed. Perhaps with the new allottment idea the federal government would consent to payment of rentals for taking these areas out of profitable production. Civic clubs and Garden Clubs might well use their influence in helping to foster this movement near the cities and towns. In fact some of the more active clubs in this state have succeeded in beautifying the entrance ways into their respective towns with trees. At Nebraska City, Lexington and Kearney this work has gotten well under way and we hope it continues to expand there and we also hope that other clubs will do likewise. Even more important would be a general movement to encourage more tree planting among the farmers. During the last few years a great many trees have been cut down for fuel making the Nebraska countryside even less attractive than before. I am aware of the fact that the Extension Forester, Mr. Clayton Watkins, is doing a splendid piece of work in the encouraging of windbreak and woodlot plantings, but this movement has not become widespread enough. It needs fostering by the civic clubs and other public spirited citizens. Per - haps a contest of some sort could be staged to encourage civic clubs to improve the highway leading into their towns. These ideas develop slowly and the results are bound to be gradual but nothing is accom - plished unless a start is made. Now as to the design of plantings for roadsides near the cities, the plantings should probably be formal. There is not so much need for windbreaks and snow guards. A straight row of stately elms or oaks or hackberry would certainly add to the beauty of these entrance ways. Of course the billboards and dumps should be done away with. Trees that are adapted for such planting are Moline elm, vase elm, hackberry, Austrian pine, red oak, Bull pine, linden, honey locust, and red cedar, where there is no danger of infecting orchards with cedar rust. Where it is possible to get a 50 foot strip along the highway the informal type of development should be used wherever possible. This type of design is more interesting — less monetonous. It blends Into the landscape more effectively than does the formal development. </seg>
            <seg id="p506">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Informal hedges of honeysuckle, lilacs, mock orange, and Van Houtens spirea, and buckthorn, may be used effectively as a snowbreak. These same shrubs might be used in large informal groups, together with trees of various kinds. "Where trees are desired that are small enough not to Interfere with telephone wires and transmission lines, low species such as Russian Olive, mulberry, red bud, hawthorn, Mugho pine and Pfltzer's juniper could be chosen. Where the spaces are un - obstructed the taller evergreens and broadleafed trees would be pre - ferable. Informal groups of 3 to 5 trees or even greater numbers are used with good effect and now and then a single specimen tree should be planted. Here are some of the general rules to follow: 1. Enframe good views with plantings. 2. Use screens to hide unsightly views. Towns probably must have places to dump rubbish but if possible these should be in an inconspicuous place in some sideroad or otherwise they should be enclosed by screen plantings. 3. It would be a mistake to have every mile of roadway planted. Travellers are interested in the farming practices and actual farm scenes are interesting. There should be open places where the roadway is higher than the surrounding farm land so that a good general view of the farms can be secured. 4. Flower color and autumnal color should be kept in mind when plantings are made choosing interesting trees and shrubs. 6. Reliable hardy plant materials should be used. The highway department needs a trained landscape man who has had a lot of experience with practical horticulture in Nebraska. This individual could help civic clubs, garden clubs, and farmers with their problems in roadside development. But he should also have some engineering experience to correllate his plant - ing with the engineering of road construction and maintenance. In conclusion let me sum up some of the advantages of roadside planting. 1. Beauty along the advertises the state by winning the tourists. 2. Our own people will enjoy their state more. Most of us enjoy living in beautiful surroundings. 3. The plantings will serve as a game preserve. They will at - tract useful birds also. ' 4. The windbreaks and snowguards will make winter travelling more enjoyable by keeping snow drifts off the roads and by affording protection against severe winter winds. </seg>

Question: I would like very much to ask you a question. It may not be in the line of your talk. Can you suggest a plant for the shoulder of a grade of a gravel road that will prevent washing the soil and make a good ground cover? I live on a gravel road. Answer: You mean the shoulder at the edge of a gravel road. (Sketching on the blackboard). There is the gravel road. Here is the ditch. Now you mean at this point? Question: Perhaps I can make it clear to you. Our road was graded for gravel. The ditch is 18 feet wide and at the deepest point it must be 30 or more inches deep. I have a driveway on each side of my yard. Of course where my two drives cross this ditch, it had to be filled. That makes a ditch 18 feet wide, 9 feet long. I planted two rows of zinnias and petunias along the banks that made a beauty spot, but from the house we don't see the flowers. I want to plant something that will hold the soil because it washes. Answer: This is a private drive? Question: It is a public road. I am planting only in front of my yard. Answer: The highway would cut into any planting here (sketch - ing) because they must go in there with their scrapers. Those of you who live along a gravel road know very well that the shoulders cave in after heavy rains. Every year or two the road gangs use their blade scrapers to pull the dirt from in the ditch back up onto the shoulder. This is a cross section. There is no chance of shoulder planting either here or there. Question: I just planted annuals. Answer: But the time will come when this shoulder commences to wash off and the grading crew will have to go down and pull that dirt up. Question: Yet our township engineer considers it a problem and ■wants to find something to plant there to prevent that washing. Statement: About the only thing I think could be planted would be grass. Answer: Another thing they are doing closer to town. They are hauling in dirt from places farther out to fill up these places. In such cases it would be possible to plant on the slope, and I think the </seg>
            <seg id="p508">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE best thing to grow would be Matrimony Vine and the next best would probably be Snowberry. Question: I don't want a shrub. I want a ground cover. Statement: Hall's Honeysuckle might fill the bill. Question: I thought of Hall's Honeysuckle. Answer: Hall's Honeysuckle would lie flat at first, but as soon as you get it up this high, say 2 feet, you will have a drift across your road. What you want is something lowgrowing that will stay low with the minimum in labor. Question: I thought of Hall's Honeysuckle and I did think I'd try Myrtle Vinca Minor. Answer: I don't know about Myrtle. It is rather delicate. I really have some fear about the Hall's Honeysuckle. You have a lot of dust. There would be times in the summer when there would be no rains for four or live weeks. It isn't as hardy a thing as Matrimony Vine. Statement: You might mow it once in a while to keep it down. Answer: Mow what? Statement: Matrimony Vine. Answer: Possibly you could. I don't think mowing would kill it. But after you mowed it you would have a mass of small branches. Question: Would the English Ivy grow? Answer: Not in this country. Question: You mentioned cedar as a roadside plant. I thought they were trying to eliminate cedars. Answer: Not in all parts of the state. They are eliminating cedars within two miles of large commercial apple orchards. Question: Well, they are down in Cass County. They are having battles over it. Answer: They are down in the river counties. I; don't think cedars compare with pines. Question: What about white cedars? Do they have the rust the same as the red. Answer: You mean Arbor Vita. No, they don't. Chinese Arbor Vita would be fine. The trouble with cedars and Arbor Vita is that </seg>
            <seg id="p509">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY they turn a brownish color in winter and are not fast growing. An Arbor Vita needs some trimming to maintain its shape. That is also true for red cedars. If you don't trim them occasionally they just throw out branches like a pine and they are never as attractive. The pine is the tree to plant. Question: Do you know the species of pine planted down around Nahawka? Answer: Yes, they use white pine but we couldn't use that species here. Question: I wondered if it would be possible in the roadside planting, for the planters to work together so far as possible to make good food for birds. What we are doing in clearing our weeds etc. is depriving our birds of food. Answer: By raising Crabs, Hawthorns, Honeysuckle etc. you would solve that problem. Question: It might be well to keep that in mind, might it not? Answer: Yes, indeed. Question. How far west in this state will the Hawthorn grow? Answer: I don't know. Statement: It will grow at North Platte. Answer: The Hawthorn isn't an easy tree to handle. It is very difficult to transplant. Statement: I suggest the June Berry as good for birds. It is very good in the western section. Answer: It comes back to this: You can say what to use and how but how are we going to do it? That is our big problem. The first move must come from the community club. The garden clubs, the Kiwanis, American Legion, etc. should organize to do some road - side planting and get the consent of the farmers to plant on his ground. Convincing the farmer that he should do this roadside plant - ing is a task that takes a long time, and if we must wait for the state highway department to do it, it is almost hopeless. Statement: Mr. Herminghaus, at our Union fruit farm last spring we planted along the top of the bank, which is from 12 to 15 feet high, about a hundred climbing roses. Our idea is to let them hang down over this bank into the road side. It is on the east side of the road. They will never bother as far as snow is concerned. We figure on letting these hang over the edge, not putting them on trellises. Our banks are straight up and down. </seg>
            <seg id="p510">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Answer: That wouldn't be bad. You could do that provided you had your windbreak planting. Statement: We have an orchard for half a mile back of that. Answer: Then you have solved your problem. On this 50 foot strip it is not necessary to have shrubs; if it is solidly planted, then trees will become the windbreak. Question: If the roadway is at all higher than the ground back there, there will be none needed? Answer: You don't need to worry about snow breaks on the east or south side of the road. MR. GREEN: "We thank you, Jlr. Herminghaus. He has given us some very good ideas. One thing we can start on, and if we ever get it to working, it would do a lot of good — educate the farmer. That is a hard proposition but if it could be done so the farmer would see where it is to his advantage, I know it would go a lot farther, and with our help it will go a long ways. ' ■ ■ ■■ ■ ' ' ■. ' I "■ Planting trees. There is one thing I would like to say something about right now. There should be a state wide program to plant trees this coming spring. I know around Fremont three-fourths of the houses are heated by wood this winter, and as soon as possible those trees used for wood should be replaced. Question: Is it too late to make request for trees from Mr. Wat - kins' department for this year's delivery? MR. HOPPERT: No, it is not. This can be done any time within the next three months. MR. GREEN: Next on our program will be "The Garden's Answer to Our Quest for Happiness" by Alfred C. Hottes, Better Homes and Gardens. Mr. Hottes. The Garden's Answer to Our Quest for Happiness; Men make gardens because there rises within them a desire to live among trees t flowers, and nature. Each spring creation takes place anew. The hidden bulbs send up their soft, green shoots, and soon burst into bloom. A bulb is truly one of the most mysterious of all natural objects. It is really an entire blooming plant telescoped into a convenient package where it may tolerate cold and drouth. When spring arrives, the bulb needs only water and warmth, for it has already produced its roots, and is now ready to burst as if by magic into glorious blooms. A seed, of course, also is marvelous to the most seasoned scientist and gardener. It is the tiniest of embryo plants, closely twisted and </seg>
            <seg id="p511">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY ■ ■ tucked into a resistant shell. Moisture causes the little plant to swell and burst its seed coat. Each spring the gardener takes new Joy In ■watching the germination of his seeds. Carrying the tiny plantlets from babyhood thru frosts and drouth gives him a feeling of triumph when at last the flower appears upon the plant. Consider for a moment a rose bush, without doubt the most dis - reputable appearing of all our shrubs — thorny, ill shaped, and with quite a poor root system. We plant it t prune it, spray it, and finally a bud appears upon it. There is no more glorious adventure than having a thorny bush of this sort which bears lovely, long - stemmed roses. Whose fruit tastes better than our own? How proud is the hostess who can say, "This jam is made from strawberries from our own garden. Our apple tree furnishes all of the apples that Tom and Mary can eat." The home gardener who can gather fresh vegetables from his garden never questions their cost nor the labor necessary to produce them. Roasting ears are never so good as when plucked from the stalk and rushed to the kettle. Tomatoes ripened In our own garden are solid, juicy, and delicious. Everyone appreciates a few trees. Some persons even venerate them. Do you realize that trees become the oldest living things? In this day we are sometimes forgetful of our duty to plant for posterity. We have accepted the existing trees without thought ot gratitude. If you should ask a gardener where to search for happiness, he would say, "Search for happiness In my border, for here grows the perennial flower of happiness. Search in my apple tree — there grows the fruit of joy. Hunt among my shrubs — there you will find the home life of two birds." A. A. Milne, eminent playwright and children's poet, some years ago wrote to Dorothy Perkins, after whom the popular climbing rose was named, and said ( "Miss Perkins, Dorothy, the world has become a different place. There is nothing in the world worth doing except growing flowers. By 'growing,' I mean watching them come up out of the ground and saying, " 'We must have some more of those next year!' I wish you could see my garden. I looked at it for nine weeks this summer, when I might have been wasting my time writing verses." In an article, Dorothy Perkins recently told how her interest in flowers has increased from year to year and continues. She says, "I wish that everyone would have a garden. Somewhere I have read, 'It is the poets of the world who cannot write poetry, who go to smash.' To this I add serenely, 'But not if they will make gardens.' Not that I am a poet in any sense, nor sentimental about 'the warm, dark </seg>
            <seg id="p512">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE earth, and the dew on the grass,' but if you are nervous or -worrying, or out of sorts, go out and dig. You will find out what I mean." So the garden brings happiness, health, and satisfies the perfectly natural longing of human beings to be a part of this earth. Is it not strange that some persons can live with a tree in their yard whose shade they enjoy, whose branches frame their view of the celestial heavens, whose big roots form houses for their children, and yet they do not know this tree's name. How odd we would be if we did not know our best friend's name. There is great joy in knowing the names of our plants, facts about them, their cultural needs, and then to give them everything they want to produce healthy plants and glorious flowers and luscious fruits. What is culture? When we speak of culture, applying the word to persons, we mean the added refinements of mind and body. So is plant culture that which we add to our flowers over and above that which is supplied by Nature. We can plant in ordinary soil, unpre - pared and unfertilized. Nature's seeds are carried to such spots, but often the flowers refuse to grow. We have all noted how thickly some wildflowers grow in certain favorable places, whereas several feet away only moss and grasses are found. In the woods, plants grow where the conditions are adapted to them. Our problem in gardening is to make even the tiniest spot proper for the growth of flowers. Gardeners soon learn that in one garden a plant grows compactly and is an ob - ject of admiration, whereas in the neighboring plot it becomes less profuse in flowers. Gradually, he realizes that environment and culture contribute much to plants. Gardening is an adventure for all ages. It is not a transitory pas - time of childhood nor one to be dropped with mature years. Garden - ing is not confined to region, riches, nor season. It is always im - pressive to see the fire-escape gardens in New York City. Sometimes their maker has more genuine love in flowers than the owner of a thousand-acre estate. Are you a member of a garden club? Many persons who are not interested in other clubs find in the garden club an ideal place for the exchange of garden ideas. There is great satisfaction in being able to discuss the practical garden problems with kindred spirits. In a garden club you could discuss such things as experience with Del - phiniums and how to insure continual bloom in the perennial border. Everything you read or hear needs your own interpretation. Every garden is a miniature experiment station. The true gardener thrills over the accomplishments he has made in growing some rare rock plant, some new variety of gladiolus. Half the fun of doing anything is the opportunity to tell about it. </seg>
            <seg id="p513">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY All persons truly imbued with interest in gardens will tell you that true happiness results not in the search for it but in realizing that the simple happenings of a garden — even a few flowers in a small back yard — transcend the joys of the business mart and the eternal search for adventure. Few have had as great opportunity for tasting the joys of life as have Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, and yet in a recent article they write, "The most unhappy people we have met are those who are constantly seeking new and more extraordinary ways of gratification, who feverishly follow every new cue to pleasure, and careen madly after happiness. The pleasure-seeker is nearly al - ways a discontented person, finally deserted even by the illusion of happiness, and the man who makes a business of pleasure is the last person to find it." It would seem that at present too many of us are ever on the go. If all persons would spend their money and efforts and their spare time upon the home, and make a garden, their homes would be so precious that no money nor persuasion would get them to leave. The highways of life are crowded with matters beyond our control, but the home is our fortress against intrusion. Conquering our own home, winning our family, singing round the hearth, planning for a better home and a lovelier garden, delving into catalogs, reading aloud t walking in the woods, enjoying the near at hand — these are the truest sources of happiness. It should be the inheritance of every child to live in a happy country. Thruout his early life he should be surrounded by beauty in highway, woodland, street, and home. In order that boys and girls may learn the first garden lessons at an early age, the Junior Garden Clubs of America has been organized with definite accomplishments, such as Knowledge of Flowers, Sharing Garden Pleasures, simple lessons in landscaping, and good taste in the back-yard garden. These lessons are adapted to all ages of youth. There is the Kinder Garden Club for the tiny children, 4-5-6; the Sprouters' Garden Club, for those 7-8-9; Climbers' Garden Club, for those 10-11-12; and the Masters' Garden Club t for those 13-14-15. It is interesting to note that any group can start at any time of the year. Many years ago the pioneers pushed the frontier westward, in the progress, then necessarily, much natural beauty was sacrificed. Cities had to be built, roads made, and fields cultivated. Now, however, wo have a new frontier. It is the frontier of civilized ugliness. I think you will already know what I mean by conquering the new frontier of civilized ugliness. In the neighborhood of each ol our cities and even around our own homes, it is very easy to let the cast-off objects of our civilization accumulate. Every city and every </seg>
            <seg id="p514">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE individual in the United States should do his part to clean up the waste places, to preserve the natural beauty of the landscape, and to supplement it with planting. Garden clubs and other civic organizations thruout the United States are having a tremendous influence upon the appearance of our country. Some are beautifying great stretches of highway. Others are making tiny parks out of vacant lots. A tremendous amount of effort is being put into flower shows, which always elevate the com - munity. For instance t in San Antonio, Texas, a garbage disposal spot known as the City of Eternal Fire has been transformed into beau - tiful Breckenridge Park due to the efforts of a park superintendent, with vision. Many commercial concerns thruout the United States have fostered contests for small home gardens. At the present time there is a National Yard and Garden Contest Association, being conducted with headquarters in Davenport, Iowa. The American Civic Association is doing a tremendous amount of good encouraging city planning. Pencil Point Magazine is fostering a contest Tor better gas stations and barbecues. There is some part which you can take in making America More Beautiful. As you will note, many cities have awakened to the value of various civic contests — contests for the improvement of home grounds, entrances to towns, and roadside planting. Let us realize two foremost duties of our lives: our duty toward the landscape and our duty toward the children of our country. The children of today are the makers of a More Beautiful America to - morrow. There is a sacred trust in our hands to make America more beautiful — to interest the youth of our country in taking some par - ticular interest in the appreciation of the great outdoors and the fundamental conceptions of home life — to realize that beauty in any neighborhood always pays. In a future day, with vision, might we not have all America a garden spot, and all citizens imbued with a vision to preserve and add to the natural beauty of the country in which we live. What is the garden's answer to our quest for happiness? Louise Driscoll tells us: "You can't forget a garden Where you have planted seed, Where you have watched the weather And known the rose's need. When you go away from it, However long or far f You leave your heart behind you Where roots and tendrils are. </seg>
            <seg id="p515">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY This is the answer the garden gives when we ask where happiness is found. MR. GREEN: I hope you all enjoyed that talk as much as I did. jWe certainly thank Mr. Hottes. The next number on the program Will be by our friend, Mr. Wiggans. "Garden Club Activities in Nebraska." GARDEN CLUB ACTIVITIES IN NEBRASKA C. C. WIGGANS The first garden club in America was organized at Athens, Georgia, in 1892. During the intervening 40 years hundreds of clubs have been formed with profit to the thousands of members and also to the com - munities in which the clubs are located. There are two primary motives for forming or joining a garden club. One of these is a strictly selfish one by which the member - ship expects to receive social preferment or enjoyment and to secure a better knowledge of plants and plant life for their own use or en - joyment. A club based solely on sociability usually will not long survive. A second motive may be a desire to foster some civic im - i provement project or to offer support to an already existing one. Such a club brings together those of similar interests and thus through sheer members is often able to mold public opinion with respect to civic or community betterment. A successful garden club owes a responsibility both to its members and to the community. It should therefore aid the individual in solving particular problems as well as make a contribution for the public good. Thus garden clubs vary according to the needs and aims of its membership. A noonday or luncheon club is partially social but does not necessarily bar discussions Of technical or practical problems or prevent interest or participation in civic problems. A club may be simply a department of a City Women's Club. Or again an evening club may be thrown open for membership of both men and women and thus become of necessity more general so far as programs are concerned, and broader with respect to civic interests. An individual club may become so large that individual interests are more or less lost to sight. When such a time arrives, it may be desirable to break up into smaller groups with less divergent interests but in such cases, a city wide federation or union should be maintained so that proper consideration can be secured for civic projects. A few general meetings of outstanding value will serve to maintain individual interest in the general organization. Not only may City Clubs organize and coordinate their activities but State Garden Clubs may be formed with club memberships from various cities and towns. State groups have organized the Garden </seg>
            <seg id="p516">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ■ Club of America. Through such groups, the aims and ideals of garden clubs are unified and efforts synchronized so that state and national problems receive better attention. The civic channels into which club activities may be directed are legion. These may be primarily for the enjoyment of the public such as the staging of a flower show or arranging for a tour to out - standing gardens. Among the improvement projects which might be mentioned are: Yard and Garden Contests, the parking of neglected or unsightly areas, the establishment of trial gardens, the conserva - tion of native plant and animal life, city entrance beautificatiori, the eradication of unsightly bill boards, the encouragement of the use of living Christmas Trees, or the organization of Junior Garden Clubs. Any one of these, along with many others, may well serve as the main activity of a club for one or several years. The main object of this brief paper has been to gather and put on record a brief resume of some of the major activities of garden clubs which have been organized in Nebraska. No claim is made that the list is complete — in fact it is probably far from that — but it does at least show that the interest and activities of garden groups in this state are widespread and that in some instances real ac - complishment has attended efforts toward civic improvements. , In - formation about the following clubs has become available. Informa - tion concerning other clubs and additional news concerning those listed will be welcomed. Omaha — Several clubs in Omaha have cooperated in staging one or more flower shows annually. These clubs also assisted the Ex - tension Forester in local arrangements for the Wheeler lecture on Forests and Wild Life. A State Pair exhibit was arranged by some of these clubs in 1931. Lincoln — The Lincoln Club stages an extensive Spring Flower Show. In 1932 it sponsored the planting of "Washington Memorial Trees" on the several College Campuses and on various civic proper - ties. Creditable State Fair exhibits have been arranged during the past two years and cooperation was given for the Wheeler Lecture. There are also some Junior Clubs. Grand Island — The Civic Improvement Association has sponsored several very successful Yard and Garden Contests and conducts each year a Fall Flower Show. Some plantings in the parks and play - ground areas are also directly traceable to the interest of this active group. Fremont — In cooperation with the Rotary Club, this group put on a Yard and Garden Contest in 1932. It also sponsored Christmas Tree lighting and did some roadside planting at the City entrances. Junior Club activities also has received some attention. </seg>
            <seg id="p517">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Hastings — This club cooperated effectively with the County Agri - cultural Agent in conducting the County Beautification Program in 19 32. In staging a flower show active cooperation of many business firms was secured. Plantings were made around the City Museum and help given at the time of the Wheeler Lecture. Holdrcge — In connection with the Yard and Garden Contest conducted by this club a School for Judging was also arranged. The Extension Horticulturist spent one day with this Club and with representatives of Clubs from adjoining cities in explaining the points upon which placings in garden contests were based. There was also some planting done in the park and in a newly constructed rock garden. Geneva — The Geneva Club in cooperation with the Women's Club and the local newspaper put on a successful Yard and Garden Con - test which included an alley improvement division; school gardens were also fostered. Alma — Here a Yard and Garden Contest was carried to a suc - cessful conclusion. Valley — Giving full cooperation to the local newspaper, an en - thusiastic garden group at Valley helped stage a Yard and Garden Contest which included not only a section for city entries but also one for rural properties. Superior — The Superior Club has been responsible for the planting of additional areas in the park. Other projects which might just as appropriately have been spon - sored by a Garden Club are the city entrance plantings which were done last spring (1932) at Lexington and Nebraska City. In the former case the Women's Club had planted a row of trees on either side of the pavement leading east from Lexington. Moline and Chin - ese elm and spirea were used. Near town also Zinnia beds were in - cluded. At Nebraska City the Chamber of Commerce has planted along the new pavement north of the City, a row of Moline elm. In both cases the planting was done just inside the properly line and suf - ficient spacing given to prevent any possible drifting of snow. Many other worthy projects undoubtedly have been aided by the various Garden Clubs in Nebraska. The influence of an enthusiastic group is an effective and a continuing one. During the years to come more clubs will be organized and each of them will make its presence felt locally and possibly even throughout the state or nationally. DISCUSSION Qucs. I would like to make one correction. The rock garden in the park at Holdrege was sponsored and financed by the Women's </seg>
            <seg id="p518">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Auxiliary of the American Legion. The members of the Garden Club did contribute flowers. Ans. I did not have all the details of that project. I am glad to get that information. MR. GREEN: There are two garden clubs in the city of Fremont. I don't know what they have done but I do know they have done quite a bit of work in beautifying the state parks. We went out there one year and planted some 2000 trees. That was all that was done. We have about 6 of those trees left I believe. About two years ago they planted about 200 trees and watered them. We have most of these left. The next lecture will be an illustrated one, "Ornamental Plants Used in Hawaii." ORNAMENTAL, PLANTS USED IN HAWAII By MISS ELIA WALKER, Lincoln MR. GREEN: Thank you, Miss Walker. I think our next meet- Ing will be in this room at 1:45 P. M. MR. HOPPERT: There is a general session in the Student Acti - vities Building at 1:00 o'clock. All of you who are interested in farm problems ought to hear that talk. Mr. O'Neal, President of the American Farm Bureau, is to talk. TUESDAY AFTERNOON SESSION CHAIRMAN: Is Mrs. Long here? Our Secretary is over at that farm bureau meeting I imagine and Mrs. Long of Holdrege was to be our first speaker. He may have her paper if she is not here. I was just handed a little poem here by L. O. Williams. I think I will read it in order to use up a little time. This was written by L. O. Williams. He is with us. There is a lot of good horse sense in that little poem. Too many of us drive by the beauties of life's highway in a hurry and flurry. While I think most of us here appreciate those beauties still if we will drive a little slower we will see a lot more of them. Anybody, if he will stop and think a minute, will see beauty in the little dandelion along the line. Of course, it's pretty hard to see its beauty if you've been bending your back digging them all day long. Mrs. Long is not with us yet. I wonder if Miss White is here. I think we will just change our program, as Miss White is here. We will ask her to give her talk on "Hardy Garden Lilies for Nebraska." </seg>
            <seg id="p519">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY HARDY LILIES IN NEBRASKA By MISS BERTHA WHITE, Lincoln. Lilies are found only north of the Equator, but they encircle the globe. Of the eighty-two species of Lilium, two at least are well known; the Easter Lily (Longiflorum) and the sturdy Tiger Lily. Both of these came from Asia and both have been long in cultivation. The Asiatic Lily is the most successful for us. The American lily is more difficult to raise. You may perhaps know of the story of the English sailor who in his travels touched on the shore of China. He was given a lily bulb for food, but his love of flowers out balanced his hunger, so he took the bulb home to England and planted it in his garden where it bloomed and flourished. And, as all good things come to America, the Tiger Lily was brought over, and with pioneer adaptability made the new country its own, until now it is often considered a native. Today we may find it growing and prospering in old deserted home - steads of the East and it may even be found by the roadside where it has traveled by means of the shiny dark bulbils which are pro - duced in the leaf axils. One lily lover has sung: (T. B. Aldrich) "I like not Lady slippers, Nor yet the Sweet Pea blossoms, Nor yet the flaky roses Red or white as snow; I like the chaliced Lilies, The gorgeous Tiger Lilies, That in our garden grow." Without Asia's contribution we would be poor indeed, since it is the lilies of Korea, Northern China, and the Tibetan borderland which furnish our most successful specimens for the mid-west gar - dens. Numbered among them are the dainty coral Tenuifolium, lilac hued Cernuum, rosy tinted Speciosum which Japan also claims (hav - ing commercialized it) , Henryi t which has made a place for itself since its debut in 1889, Hanson! with its yellow waxen flowers, Davidi I which loves the sun as does the beautiful court lady — Regale. To say nothing of Davurlcum which is the distant parent of our 'con - j glomerate mess' of Elegans and TJmbellatum. I think we might appreciate some of our favorites more it we realized the courage and persistent efforts of the men who brought them out of their natural habitat. The Regale was brought from the borderland of Tibet in 1903 by Ernest H. Wilson, who after collecting his precious bulbs for which </seg>
            <seg id="p520">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE be had made this special expedition, was injured by a land slide as he was making his way out of the mountain fastness. This injury caused him to be lame for the rest of bis life. More precious than life to him were the fragrant white lilies; for rather than let his men help him to safety and run the risk of being caught in another land slide due to the delay, he had them lead the entire pack train over his body and first save the treasure. In speaking of this after - ward he remarked: "If anyone thinks that mules have small feet let him lie on a narrow mountain trail and have a train of them step over him. Since that day I have blessed the mule for his sure - footedness." Japan gave us the beautiful capricious Auratum which we would all like to raise; Jnponirum, and Rubellum the two pink lilies which are not successful here. Also Ixnigiflorum our Easter Lily. India has given us a number of tender lilies, mostly white and yel - low as to color; few of which are cultivated in this country. Europe has nine to its credit. The best known of which is the pure white, waxen petaled, yellow hearted, fragrant aristrocrat Caiuli - dum so often called Madonna. This lily was known lonp; before the time of Christ as is evidenced by its presence in the designs on acient pottery. As a contrast to Candidum is Clialcedonicum f the red lily of Con - stantinople, which crossed with Candidum gave us Tcstaceum, the beautiful Nankeen lily, the most successful hybrid which we have. I It has been grown since 1830 and is still scarce and high priced. Then there is Martigan which grows from Spain to Sweden, all through central and southern Europe and into Siberia with its funny purple Turk's cap flowers, and its objectionable odor; Monadelphum the Caucasian lily with its shining yellow blooms; and Croceum the orange lily of easy culture especially in the British Isles where mois - ture is abundant. Our own continent has given us twenty-six moisture loving, shade requiring lilies. The best known and easiest grown of this group are: dainty, shy, freckled faced Canndenso (red or yellow); airy, graceful Snpcrbnm and its more colorful western cousin Pardelinum; all of which may be grown in the sun. Other well known are Philadelphicum which in appearance is much like the Davuricum hybrids; Columbinnum often called the Oregon tiger; Humboldtii; Parryi (a beautiful yellow); and Washing - tonianum the beautiful Mt. Hood lily. David Griffith says: "The ideal climate for the culture of the largest number of species of lilies is one having a uniformly low </seg>
            <seg id="p521">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY temperature and relatively high humidity." An ideal condition amcij, yet there are a number of lilies which can be grown where conditions are not so ideal and it is these which we will discuss today. It may be well to give a brief description of some of the lilies which we have proved can be grown In Nebraska: — Auratuin conies from Japan. Because of its enthusiastic re - ception into the western world in 1861 it has become commercialized by the Japanese. In their zeal to produce large bulbs which in turn bring higher prices, they have weakened them by over-stimulation so that they are particularly susceptible to disease. This condition causes much of the trouble which we have today in trying to raise Auratuin. If "healthy bulbs could be procured and planted in not too rich soil, at a depth of ten to twelve inches where drainage is good, and in a sunny situation with a ground cover, they should be permanent in our gardens. Hat en i an iiiac is an apricot colored, open faced off -spring of Davuri - c-uin which is of Japanese origin. It grows two to three feet high, blooms in July or the first of August. The stems may wander about a bit before coming through the ground so it is wise to put a stake by the bulb when you plant it, to prevent your digging in the wrong place. Caiuliduin often called "Madonna," "St. John's Lily", "Ascension Lily", "Annunciation Lily", "St. Joseph's Lily" or "Bourbon Lily" Is I the best beloved and longest cultivated of them all. It has been in cultivation since 1596. It's pure glistening white no doubt is the cause of the saying; "as white as a lily". It has been long in this country, being taken to California in early days by the priests and planted in the Mission gardens. Today it may be found throughout United States and even in Canada and Mexico. Many find It a very easy lily to grow. I have had success with Candidum since I have given it plenty of moisture in the growing season. It is sometimes subject to disease which is easily controlled by spraying with Bordeaux mixture. This lily makes a fall growth so must be planted before growth starts, which is the last of August or the first of September. Cover the bulbs only one and a half to two inches. It blooms In June. Concolor is a small star shaped scarlet lily which was introduced from China in 1806. It is a hardy lily ( of easy culture, particularly adapted for the rock garden or front of the border. It is a sun loving lily, growing from six to eighteen inches high. It blooms in late June. Crocoum — A European lily of radiant orange color, grows about three to four feet high. It thrives luxuriantly In the British Isles and because of its color has become a political emblem in northern Ire- </seg>
            <seg id="p522">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE land. I would suggest plenty of moisture tor this lily. Davidl came in 1880 from the borderland of China and Tibet. It is a disease resistant, hardy lily which has proved a good lily with us. Mrs. Fox describes it as; "a refined and redder Tigrinum". It blooms in July and likes a well drained sunny position. It grows from three to four feet high carrying up to twenty-five Turk's cap shaped blooms. A very good lily. Klegans, a Japanese hybrid of Davuricum is a low growing cup shaped lily of many shades of red and yellow, it is often confused with Umbellatum, but Elegans never grows more than two feet tall and often not more than ten inches high. It has one or two large blooms to the stalk. I have not found Elegans so hardy as the Umbellatum which is a European hybrid of Davuricum which grows as high as four feet and carries ten to forty blooms and is of easy culture. Regale our popular fragrant white trumpet lily which Mr. E. H. Wilson brought out of Ihe borderland of Tibet less than thirty years ago has had much to do with the revival of interest in the whole lily family. It is more widely grown than any other lily today. It seems to grow as well in the south as in the north. Its greatest weakness being its susceptibility to spring frosts which may be a limiting factor here. Sorgcntiae also from Tibet is much like Regale in description but blooms a couple of weeks later, there-by prolonging the white flower season. It is a hardy lily but needs perfect drainage in its dormant state. A favorite with my own family is Tenuifolinm... The coral lily of Siberia. It grows about two feet high, has numerous scarlet Turk's cap blooms. It is especially adapted to rock garden use. Our only natural hybrid is Testoceam or Nankeen Lily which has been in cultivation for a hundred years, but is not commonly found in our gardens although it is very hardy and of easy culture. Treat it like Candidum only plant it about five inches deep. It grows from four to six feet high; produces four to ten beautiful nodding glisten - ing blooms of creamy peach color. Another favorite in our family Is Canadense of the American species which does well here. A dainty little yellow lily who insists on looking at the ground as if it would hide its freckles. It is so airy and graceful that it attracts much attention in the garden. It grows two to five feet high and blooms in June. According to W. N. Craig; of all the Korean or Japanese lilies </seg>
            <seg id="p523">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY in cultivation today, none is more absolutely dependable than Han - sonii. It grows two to lour feet high, carrying six to fifteen flowers to a stalk. The blossoms are heavy substanced and fragrant. It blooms the last of June. Its two main faults being its tendency to bleach in the sun and its susceptibility to spring frosts. Henryi is also easily damaged by spring frosts, but is otherwise so hardy and dependable that it has found a permanent place in our I gardens. It is often called the yellow Speciosium which seems to describe it well. Some have told of growing them ten or more feet tall with seventy-five or more blooms to the stalk. They need stak - ing, or plant them among shrubbery. Water well In the growing season. The latest to bloom are the Speciosium lilies which are white with pink spots. Some varieties are suffused with pink. Rubrum the deepest colored Dutch form is, I suppose, the best known; but even darker is the Melpomene, originated by C. M. Harvey of Boston. These beautiful lilies which seem to be easy to grow should be planted In good soil ten to twelve inches deep. Left undisturbed they will form large clumps. They seem to grow best in partial shade. Pardalinum, often called the Leopard Lily is another American Illy, which may be grown here although like all American lilies are somewhat difficult to establish, which is a characteristic of all of the western lilies. It is a Turk's cap; reddish orange in color, profusely spotted. It grows three to seven feet high, with three to thirty blooms. (Mine are in the three blooms class as yet, having had them only four years.) Lighter in color, taller and more profuse in blooms than Par - dalinum is Superbnm the eastern cousin of Pardalinum. Superbum is found in the wild from Georgia and Alabama to New Brunswick and as far west as Wisconsin. While often spoken of as the Swamp lily, it grows well in our gardens. There are several ways that lilies may be used in painting the garden picture. For night effects and for accent we have the white lilies: Candi - dum i Regale, Sargentiae, and Auratum which looks white at night. Candidum and Testaceum may be used for dignity and stateliness When we desire a mass of bright color we have; TJmbellatum, Croceum, Pardalinum, Davidi, Willmattiae, and if we will use enough of them there are the bright red Concolor and Tenuifolium both of which are especially good for rock gardens as are some varieties ot Elegans. </seg>
            <seg id="p524">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ivor a hedge or back ground nothing equals the Tigers. Their rich green foliage is attractive from the first and their blooms are gorgeous. I wish you might have seen ours this summer as they were accented by lavender phlox. Color Groupings White Of white lilies we have few, but those few are so glorious that we do not feel the need of many. First to bloom in early June is Candidum whose glistening white has made it an em - blem of purity throughout the ages. — Regale follows immediately, though of recent introduction may be found in almost any garden where lilies grow. — Browni a yellow throated trumpet blossoms late in June. — Sargentine flowering in early July, is the fourth trumpet in this procession of white lilies. — Then there is Speciocium Album for August which makes a happy sequence for the summer. — In July we may have Longiflorum which is not considered hardy north of Washington D. C. There are several vari - eties, but Longiflorum Gigantium is the one to try if one is so inclined. Red For red we have first the numerous Umbellutum with their turned up faces, some of which are decidedly red and others having more of the yellow. — Then Tenuifolium, the dainty lily of Siberia. — Concoloi^ often called the 'red star lily' because of its open faced uplifted gaze. — Chalcedonicum the scarlet turk's cap and Ponponium similar to it, which blooms a bit later, can both stand our cold but need ample moisture in the growing season. — As the season advances and red is too warm a color, we have the lighter colors as found in Davidi, Callosum, Bat - manniae, Superbum, and Tiger. Yellow. Yellow gives us the interesting Hanson! with its thick waxen petals, Cansdense, Tenulfoliuni, Tenuifolium Golden Gleam, Croceum f Monadclphum, several of the Kit-guns group such as Alice Wilson, Peter Barr, Orange, Prince of Orange, Aluticeum etc. And if ones enthusiasm tempts one to ven - ture there are Parryi, Columbanum, and Humboldti. The last to bloom in the list of yellows is Henryi which comes even after the Tigers. Our list- of colors would be incomplete without the speckled Auratums and Speciociums, Martagan of purple cast, and Cer - nuum which is a rosy lilac. </seg>
            <seg id="p525">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Many flowers called lilies are not true lilies or Iiilinm. Among these are Calla or Richardia; liily of the Valley; Conval - luria: Day Lilies which may be Hosta or Hemerocallis; 'Mystery Lily' the Lacoris (also called the Spider Lily) ; Wood Lily the Trillium; and the Water Lily — Nymphiea. None of -which have scaled bulbs. While lilies are herbaceous perennials they can be distinguished from other plants by the scaly bulb, erect stem, narrow leaves, flowers with six perianth segments, and stamens with anthers balanced on them. Culture Select a place for your lily bed which is not too much exposed to the wind. Cold winds in the spring often chill them, resulting in stunted growth of the young plants if not the blighting of their buds. The hot winds of summer may shorten the blooming period. Winds may also break the heavy laden stalks when in bloom. Many lilies enjoy partial shade, but should not be planted in too dense shade if we would have healthy plants with enough strength to hold up their heads. But do not go to the other extreme; even the sun loving lilies like relief from the intense heat of midday or the long afternoon sun, yet this is not absolutely necessary. All of my lilies are growing in the open where they get no shade at all, but are slightly sheltered from the hot south winds. Drainage may be accomplished in several ways. The one most commonly mentioned is drainage by placing under the bed a sufficient amount of broken rock, coarse cinders, or other debris to form drain - age. A very good procedure where they have a heavy rainfall which comes slowly enough to soak in, but with us who have only a medium amount of rainfall, and that often comes in a few minutes, it is hardly necessary unless the lily bed is in a low soggy position. I like best a gentle sloping position. If that is not possible elevate the bed from four to eight inches, after it has settled, which should be enough for good drainage with us. Be sure that the center of the bed is as high or higher than the edges. In preparation of the soil the aim should be to provide a deep cool root run that will store and hold an ample amount of moisture during the growing and flowering period, yet provide ample drainage while the bulbs are dormant. I have found coal ashes a more successful lightening agent than, sand. It seems to make the soil more friable and holds the moisture better. It has been my experience that more lilies are dried to death than were ever drowned. Too often we plant them too close to trees, </seg>
            <seg id="p526">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE shrubs, or rank growing perennials so that they are half smothered and three-fourths starred. It is advisable however to provide a ground cover for lilies. I would suggest first the use of the hoe. A good dust mulch is not to be discredited. Some use peat moss successfully, but K. H. Wilson said: "It may do for the American lilies i but I know the Asiatic -lilies are better without it." I have not tried peat moss for ground cover. Plants which may be used for ground cover are Petunia, Phlox Drummondi, California poppies if the color will do, Mignonette, Sweet AlysBum, Ageratum, Asters, Nasturtium, and Larkspur. All authorities say that leaf mold is the ideal fertilizer for lilies. I often think of this when I see great piles of leaves being burned in the Fall. If we could only save them for our gardens what a wealth of results we could have. Maybe some day one will collect them and sell us leaf mold when we need it. Well rotted manures may be used in moderation, but when grow - ing lilies, avoid commercial fertilizers. Old sod is good. I place sod under all newly planted bulbs as it affords drainage for the first winter and nourishment for the growing plants. Propogation The careful gardener may easily propogate many lilies by means of seed and the plants will bloom in two or three years. The easiest of these are Regale and Tenuifolium. Care should be taken to see that the wee plants never dry, even for one hour t yet n5t wet enough to cause them to damp off. Avoid watering at night if possible. Another method of increasing the stock is by scales. Thus far I have not been successful in this. The more practical way to increase our plantings if we wish to do it ourselves is by the natural division of the bulbs, or by trans - planting the bulblets formed on the stalks near the surface of the ground. These will bloom in from one to two years, from most vari - eties, If planted by themselves and given good care. For those who wish immediate results or do not have time to give a lot of special care, it is more satisfactory to buy the large bulbs. The American grown bulbs are much the best because they can be planted sooner and seem to have more vitality. Be sure to buy from reliable dealers. Enemies While lilies in general are healthy plants they have a few enemies which may attack them. As yet I have been troubled with nothing </seg>
            <seg id="p527">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY that Bordeaux mixture would not control. Bulbs Immersed for twenty minutes in a solution of Semesan used at the rate of one tablespoon full to a gallon of water will be of great benefit and give the bulb a better chance of success. The most common disease of lilies is grey mold, or Botrytis fungus. It is easily recognized by the browning of the leaves and molding ol the buds and stems. As soon as noticed, all plants should be sprayed with Bordeaux mixture and repeated at intervals of two weeks through - out the growing season. Badly affected stems should be removed and burned at once. Lilium Candidum is often affected with this disease. It is worse in wet seasons. Frequent, light overhead water - ing is bad. Lack of aeration is another cause. Green Aphids are sometimes troublesome, but can be easily con - trolled by a nicotine sulphate (Black Leaf 40) spray. There is less danger of trouble from mice in the winter if the winter protection is not put on until the ground is frozen hard. . Another enemy is the cut worm which some times troubles lilies, but can be easily controlled by use of poison mash made of fresh shorts well mixed with molasses and sufficient Paris Green to color the whole. MISS BERTHA G. WHITE, 7615 Leighton, Lincoln, Nebraska Discussion. Question: I would like to ask about the method of planting. I have heard some growers recommend that the bulbs of lillles should be planted on their side. Answer: Fine for the first winter. They straighten themselves up during the growing season. That is more especially true for Can - didum and all loose scaled bulbs. Those sorts that have a hard bulb, as tiger lily, etc. are not bothered much by excessive moisture. Some people put a piece of paper over them for the first year. Question: We use lime sulphur solution for all our Easter lilies. Question: We dip them with the scales up. That lets the water get down into the bottom. We dip all of ours as a preventative of disease. Answer: That ought to serve the purpose. Question: How often should Candidum lilies be moved, or should they ever be moved? </seg>
            <seg id="p528">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Answer: Never move a lily as long as It Is growing and thriving. When it begins to get spindly, it needs moving. Take it up and trans - plant it. Do it early in the season. Don't let them stay out of the ground long. Lilies can't stand it. Question: What is a good fertilizer? Answer: Any authority I have ever gotten hold of says leaf mould is the best. Well rotted cow-manure is good. Commercial fertilizers should be used very rarely. Commercial fertilizer is generally dyna - mite. A florist in Lincoln several years ago tried some commercial fertilizer and killed every rose plant on his place. If I were experi - menting, I would experiment on a little place. That same fertilizer, if used rightly, would have done a lot of good. Question: What lilies can you grow in Nebraska? Answer: Of course, in different parts of (he state conditions are different but I can't think of any place in this state where you can grow anything at all but what you can grow Tenuifolium, Candidum, and Tiger lilies. Regale ought to do also; that will give you a while lily. Question: Why is it we don't hear more about the Crown Imperial? Answer: That is not really a lily. Question: What are the best conditions to grow the Tigers? Do they want perennials around them or not? Answer: You can grow them most anywhere. They must be in the sun. Question: The leaves on mine turn brown and yellow just about blooming time. They are not with a lot of things. Answer: Are you sure they get enough moisture? Lots of times if we would dig down and see what the condition of the soil really is, we would be really surprised. Question: How did you plant your bulbs to protect your lilies from the wind when you planted them out in the open? Answer: I had a rose hedge on the south of them and a row of peach trees on the west. Question: If you raise your own lily seed, when do you plant it? Answer: I generally plant mine in a pan in a bedroom window along the last of March. Question: Will they come through from seed? Answer: I have raised lots of them from seed. </seg>
            <seg id="p529">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Question: How soon would Tenuifolium bloom? The second year? Answer: You may have one bloom the second year. The third year they will come along fine. In trying to raise lilies, I would try to get what I think might possibly grow here. I don't have as much time and money to spend on them as I would like to have. Question: What book on lily culture do you recommend for this region? Answer: All the lily books I have ever gotten hold of tell you how to raise them on the Coast, either east or west. You just simply have to sum of what the different authors have to say and then try the recommendations yourself. Most of these authors say you can't raise lilies in Nebraska. I was rather disappointed on my trip west last summer. I expected to see gorgeous gardens in the Pacific Coast. I was certainly disappointed with them there. I left better gardens in Lincoln. Question: I would like to give you a bit of good news. Before the time of the automobile the Superbum used to grow in Nebraska. Down at Nehawka and up at "West Point along the right of way there is a gorgeous display of Superbum. Question: Did I understand that Candense can be grown in Ne - braska? Answer: Yes. Question: I tried some once but I made the mistake of setting them in the spring. Answer: They are better started in the fall. Question: Will you mention a few which can be successfully grown with spring planting? Answer: Henryi, Auratum, Speciosum. Question: Regales bloom from spring planted bulbs? Answer: Yes. One fall I planted about a dozen and didn't have time to finish. I decided to plant some in the spring. Those I planted in the spring did far better than those planted in the fall. But you have to do it early and I wouldn't advise planting any lily anywhere after the first of April. CHAIRMAN: I am sorry but we will have to call a halt in this discussion. We certainly thank Miss White. I think she is a lily fan — a specialist, we might even say. A specialist you know is a person </seg>
            <seg id="p530">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE who knows more and more about less and less. Mrs. Long of Holdrege is here now and we will call on her to tell us something of her experiences with perennials. She has tried several hundreds in the last ten years on her farm near Holdrege, but we have asked her to limit her choice to the forty best ones. It gives me pleasure to introduce Mrs. Long. FORTY DEPENDABLE PERENNIALS FOR CENTRAL NEBRASKA MRS. NELLIE S. LONG, Holdrege, Nebr. When I came to Lincoln yesterday over the Burlington road my mind turned back forty years to the first time I traveled over that road. Then, with my small daughter, I was going to Holdrege to join my husband who had preceded us with the car of stock, farm imple - ments and household goods. Can you imagine how closely I scanned the landscape, how eager I was to see what Nebraska farm homes looked like? I had reason to be interested for our home was to be 011 a Nebraska farm. The few trees, the small houses, the unfenced door yards, an al - most complete absence of shrub planting near the houses made a bleak and bare picture to eyes accustomed to farm home in central Illinois. When we moved on the farm the same conditions met us every - where. I began to ask people, "Don't you have any flowers here?" "No you can't grow flowers in this part of Nebraska." Then would follow a story of drouth, hot winds, hail and late frosts, enough to discourage the bravest soul. We seldom think of the difficulties of those early days and only as they led up to the successes of gardening today for we can grow flowers in this section of Nebraska. My task in finding perennials to fit the subject today was not to find forty perennials but to select forty from a list of over eighty de - pendable perennials for central Nebraska that I grow. I have omitted many of the plants that should be found in every garden because you are all familiar with them. The improved Achilleas are a good white for the border and a good cut flower. Alyssum Saxatile gives a good golden yellow for the early garden but should be pruned after blooming to prevent too free seeding. The symmetrical clumps of grey green foliage are attractive all season. Of the Anchusas Myosotidifiora is a real gem with its clusters of flowers resembling forget me nots. Aquilegia or Columbine is an uni - versal favorite, beautiful both in foliage and flower. I grow the Scott Elliott and Dobbie's Imperial Hybrid strains. Both </seg>
            <seg id="p531">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY are good. Dobbie's has a wider range of color. After blooming I cut the plants back two inches above the top of crown. Plants so treated look better, do better and give some scatter - ing bloom thru the summer. Artemisia Silver King with its white leaves makes a striking con - trast in the garden and as a cut flower. White Aster Alpinus and Goliath, light blue, are planted in full sun in the front of the border or in the rock garden and bloom thru May and June. I wonder if you all know the roots of the Bleeding Heart Spectabilis may be broken in pieces and almost every piece will produce a plant. Eximea or plumy bleeding heart is very easily grown from seed planted in the fall. It begins blooming when plants are very small and continues all season. Campanula Persicifolia both blue and white blooms thru July and August. Campanula Carpatica is dainty and compact. Porduces its blue and white bells from June to freezing weather. The shrubby Clematis that die to the ground in the fall are new to me but I consider them effective in the garden. Recta produces fragrant white flowers in clusters. I grew Integri - folia from seed. Most of the plants produced porcelain blue flowers but one had lavender pink flowers. Camassia has a bulb like a lily. It grows wild in Illinois and on the Pacific coast. It grows two feet high with spikes of star like flow - ers in blue and white. It is hardy in my garden. Chrysanthemum Maximum or Shasta daisy help to provide the white we must have in our gardens. I have Hartje and Elder, Con - vent Garden Market, Alaska, The Speaker, Mrs. J. Tersteeg and Mrs. C. Lothian Bell and had daisies in bloom from May to heavy frost. The Artie Daisy is a real treasure for the fall garden with its attractive dark green foliage and pure white flowers that appear in September! and last into November. Daphne 'Cneorum grows in my garden but as yet has not bloomed. Desmodium is another shrubby perennial that dies to the ground in the fall to reappear in the spring making a strong bush by fall that is gorgeous with purple pea like flowers on every branch. Now we come to the Delphinums, our pride in their glorious beauty, our despair when a high wind breaks the marvelous spikes of bloom? </seg>
            <seg id="p532">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE l nave grown delphinums from seed for several years trying dif - ferent strains. Now I grow only Pudors and Hood acres and prefer Hood acres. Last year I had many plants from Hood acres seed bloom that were very fine specimens and much admired by visitors. Last spring I planted seed of Pudor's Ranunculus type. Many of them bloomed but only a few were true to type. However, we can - not judge any plant by its first years performance and sometimes must wait until the third year for it to come into full beauty. Among those seedlings I got one semi-double magnificient in form, color and size. A silver dollar would not cover the individual florets. Blue Butterfly, Azure Fairy and the white form of Chinese Delphin - iums add charm to our gardens and bloom the first year from seeds. What would our gardens be without Dianthus, from the pinks of grandmothers garden to the latest originations of today. I want to especially recommend Dettoides, Alwoodi, Sweet Wivils field and the velvety red everblooming sweet William, Latifolius Atrococcineus. Dodacatheon Media sometimes called American Cyclamen is one of the wild flowers of my child hood. It blooms freely each June in my sunny border and then disappears for a year. Digitalis Isabelina is one of my very promising new plants that bloomed last year for the first time. It is a true perennial. The hardy ferns combined with Mertensia and Funkia or day lily make a beauty spot from spring to fall in a shady corner. Bristol Fairy is the best of the gypsophilas as it gives some bloom all summer. Helianthemum, Rock or Sun Rose, its white, pink and rose blos - soms are lovely in the garden and exquisite combined with the foli - age of Thalictrum for a table decorationT The flowers close in the garden about noon but remain open in the house. Hesperis or Sweet Rocket is much used in its white form. We now have a new one in Hesperis Nivea. This makes a more sym - metrical plant than the old form. It has pale green leaves from which rise the flowers stalk bearing large white flowers. Heuchera or Coral Bells given a moist location in partial shade are beautiful in foliage and flower. </seg>
            <seg id="p533">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Hollyhocks I mention only to recommend Newport pink and Colo - rado Sunset. Ibris Sempervivens and Tenoreana are stringy plants at first but develop into symmetrical plants the second year. Foliage is ever - green. I have had old plants of Sempervivens twenty inches in di - ameter that looked like a drift of snow when in bloom. L Tenoreana is listed by some as a biennial but is a perennial with e. Bloom comes out white and changes to delicate lavender. It is at its best in June but blooms all summer. Linaria Macedonica with its silvery green foliage and large (yellow flowers like snap dragons is one of the best) yellow perennials. It blooms all summer. It is the best one of the Toad Flax family. ■ Interest in the Iris increases each year and even the amateur asks for names varieties with a high rating. Common varieties are being discarded. The same thing can be said of Peonies. People are be - coming educated and demand the really fine varieties to the great benefit of their gardens. Phlox both the dwarf type for our spring gardens and the hardy perennial phlox we must have for summer bloom add much to the beauty of the garden. It is rather interesting to grow phlox from seed. I grew seven plants from Von Lassburg seed. Four of the plants bore flowers exactly alike, pale pink with a deep rose eye. The individual florets as well as the heads were very large. Helianthus Mutliflora with its large golden yellow double flowers is very showy in the back ground. It grows four feet high and blooms in August. Ranunculus Aeris is another lovely yellow flower. It is the tall buttercup and blooms in May and June. Saponaria Ocymoides we can : recommend without any reservations. It belongs to the Bouncing Bet family but has none of her faults. It is a trailer and covered in late May and June with rosy pink flowers. The foliage is always good and in the autumn is most attractive in shades of deep green, dark red and purple. The Isaac House Hybrid Scabiosas are lovely. Easily grown from seed and fairly dependable. Statice Latifolia blooms the second year from seed. Once established it is permanent. It is attractive when in bloom and even after the delicate lavender bloom was faded. Thalictrum Dipterocarpum given a location in partial shade grows from four to six feet high and when in bloom is very lovely. Trollius Ledebouri is not difficult to grow and does not winter - kill. I have grown it from seed and brought it to perfect bloom only </seg>
            <seg id="p534">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE to have the white grubs take it. I have tried powdered tobacco in the soil but without results. i, Veronicas we must have for blue in both the tall and low grow - ing types. I Valerian Coccinnea or Centranthus is a plant not generally grown. It has showy heads of old rose flowers beginning to bloom in June and continuing until heavy frost. It is an excellent cut flower lasting a week. Violas are last on the list and one of the best plants I have added to my garden in recent years. My first Jersey Gem violas were up when the March 1930 num - ber of Better Homes and Gardens containing T. A. Westons article on "Violas came. That gave me all the information I needed to succeed with violas. I I Those plants were put out in the border and remained there, bloom - ing well, until the fall of 1931 when they were taken up, divided, the : scraggly top growth and old roots discarded, only the new growth i at the base of the plants with tiny white rootlets showing were used. I I put four of these tiny slips together to make one strong plant. I had 144 in the cold frame and every one lived. These plants were j put in the border last spring and will remain there until this fall j when they will be divided and carried over in the cold frame. I plant - ed seed of Jersey Jewel early in the spring of 1931 put the plants in i edge border south of the house in May, for violas must be in full sun. ; In the extreme heat of midsummer I mulched the plants with peat moss. They bloomed all summer and whenever the snow melted enough the blossoms were peeping out. From early spring until the i intense heat in August those plants were one mass of! purple bloom. These plants with a white and a pale blue that came up in the Jersey ; Jewel seed were divided and put In the cold frames where they will j remain over winter and be ready for spring planting. Of the two I I prefer Jersey Jewel, as the flowers are larger and they bloom more freely. Jersey Gem is blue or nearly so, Jersey Jewel deep violet. I have . never had a plant of either seed. That may account for their prolific bloom. Propagating them in this way you can keep your color true and by selection produce a strain noted for large flowers and prolific bloom. I grow Apricot Queen that lovely apricot and orange but not with I complete success. It seeds so prolifically that the plants become ex - hausted and die. The majority of my plants are grown from seeds planted in cold I ■ . ■ ' . </seg>
            <seg id="p535">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY frames in the first part of May. These frames are merely four ooarob nailed together with a muslin covered top and are out in the open garden without any protection. In September I begin to transplant in other frames spacing the plants three or four inches apart. That method gives me husky plants for the masses of flowers I want. Our soil is the kind that grows good farm crops. I grow only such plants as thrive in that soil. My garden is sunny so most of the plants in the list grow in full sun. I want to tell you of an adventure in growing plants in the house hoping it will help some of you to do likewise. Like Ripley I will say "Believe it or not its true." By March 1, 1931 my seeds were all in and I thot if I only had bottom heat I would raise some early plants. All at once I thot of the closet right in the middle of the house, di - rectly over the furnace and always warm. I could scarcely wait to get to the basement and make flats. I used lath for the sides nailing the bottom to the lath. That gave me the width of the lath for depth of soil. The smallest flat was 4x5 inches. The largest 10x20 inches. It is always best to plant only one kind of seed in a flat unless you know time of germination. The soil I used was just good garden soil, not too rich and a small amount of sand. I did not sterilize the soil and had practically no trouble with damping off. The soil was placed in the flats, watered and when just right seed was planted, lightly covered or merely pressed down with a thin board, a piece of damp muslin laid over the top, then set in the floor in the closet. They were kept moist but not wet and in from five days to two weeks were coming up. As soon as a small percentage of the seeds were up I took them to the sunny south windows but not too close to the glass and shaded them at first with thin muslin. In those flats I grew Centranthus, Pansies, "Violas, Shasta daisies, Hoodacres delphinium, Huechera, Scabiosa, Carnations, Dianthus, Veronica, Cam - panula, Clematis Integrifolia and Lilium Phillipenence Formosanum. The plants were soon ready to transplant and I used the same shal - low flats with one exception. That one had soil 2 % inches deep. The plants in that flat did not do as well as in the others with less soil. As soon as weather permitted the flats were put in the cold frames and when danger of frost was over the plants set in the soil of the frames. Another experiment on which I ask your comments is with lilies from seed and scales. </seg>
            <seg id="p536">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I grew my first tenuifoliums from seed in 1925. Those bulbs are still going strong. Among those seedlings I got a dark red sport and am now growing seeds from that and hope to have some proof this year if they will come true. One bulb of the coral red the third year from seed, grew a stalk 36 inches high with 37 perfect lilies. I dug that bulb last fall with others of the same age. It measured 7% inches in circumference and the others were almost as large. On March 30, 1931 I planted 22 seeds of lilium Phillipinence Formosanum in a flat. April 10 the first grasslike spears were up. 14 came up. These I set in the cold frame where they made good top growth but very small bulbs. • ..■••■ I could find no information about them so in late October I took them up, put the three largest in one pot, the eleven tiny ones in an - other and set the pots in a south window. When danger of frost was over in the spring I set in the border. Found a mass of strong roots but bulbs had not increased at all. I did not disturb the roots of the three bulbs but made three divisions of the others by tearing roots apart. They bloomed in September a total of 14 blooms lasting a week. The largest lily measured 7 inches long just before the six recurved petals opened. Mine were pure white of heavy texture and fragrant. Again I had no information how to handle. Bulbs were coming above ground so on November 11 I took them up found the three bulbs had increased to twelve, the largest IVi inches in diameter. They did not look mature enough to remove from the stem so I reset them seven inches deep. Growing Madonna Ijily Bulbs from Scales. In August 1930 I transplanted my Madonna lilies. In doing so three scales fell off. I laid them on a plate in the basement where they grew four bulbs. The last of November that year I put them in dirt in a flat pound coffee can, set next to the glass in a south window where they grew all winter. April 2S, 1931, I set in the border in soil dug up in sod and carefully pulverized that spring. The four bulbs sent up strong rosettes of leaves that fall and were protected with a box with lath top. This spring (1932) each bulb sent up a strong bloom stalk, the four producing a total of thirty - flve perfect lilies. Discussion. Question: How did you treat those scales? </seg>
            <seg id="p537">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Answer: I didn't do anything with them. I just laid them on a plate and set them on a table in the basement. Question: Can you divide Delphinium successfully? Answer: I never have. I thought I would this summer but I read there was so much danger of rotting that I lost my courage. Question: Will they bloom the first year? Answer: Yes. Question: Don't you think Delphinium like loam soil better than heavy clay soil? Answer: Yes, I think our main trouble is that in a clay soil they are wet all winter. Question: It may be in the drainage. I think the main trouble is that it is cold and damp during the early months. Of course, too, we have trouble in Nebraska with freezing and thawing in the spring if we don't have them protected enough. Answer: I have Delphiniums that last for years and my only pro - tection is the flat fruit crates that peaches come in. I turn those over a plant. If I run out of those, I make shallow boxes. Question: What do you do with Pox Glove? Answer: Nothing. Question: They don't die out? Answer: They haven't. Question: I would like to ask where you put these little lily scales. Do you put them in the cold frame or in the house? Answer: I planted them in a coffee can and then the last of April I put them in the border. CHAIRMAN: You notice that Mrs. Long doesn't say that I do this and I do that. She blames it on Phelps County soil. Answer: We have a wonderful soil and I will tell you one thing: I love flowers and I love doing the work. MR. HOPPERT: Some of the folks came in late and didn't get this little paper on the care of lilies and the varieties. There are more of them. </seg>
            <seg id="p538">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE WEDNESDAY MORNING SESSION January 4 — 9:30 A. M. Room 106, Plant Industry Building Meeting was called to order by Mr. Vernon Marshall who acted as Chairman in the absence of Mr. Loy Franklin of Falls City. CHAIRMAN: It seems Mr. Franklin isn't here yet. He is sup - posed to be the leader on the program this morning. Mr. Hoppert asked me if I would take his place until he gets here. The first topic on the program this morning is "Black Raspberries Are A Paying Crop" by W. B. Yowl, Nebraska City. RAISING BLACK RASPBERRIES ON THE GREGGSPORT FRUIT FARM This farm lies on the bank of the Missouri River, the bulk of it lies from % to 1% blocks from the water. The elevation is from 50 to 75 feet above the water. It has an east slope, just enough to give it good drainage. It is protected on the north and west by timber and bluff from the cold dry winds of winter and is also protected from the dry hot winds of summer by trees and bluff on the south and west. Has good air drainage. The land was in timber up to the time it was planted in berries. The mist from the river at night adds much mois - ture to the berry during picking season, ( it is also beneficial by pro - tecting the plants from both the early and late frosts. The ground is thoroughly cleaned of all timber, brush, stumps, roots, etc. plowed in the fall, then harrowed good in the spring. A line is stretched crossways of the slope, a three foot spacer is used to mark the holes, then the holes are dug using a tile spade and while the dirt Is moist, the plant, which is kept in a bucket of water, is taken out and planted, spreading out the roots in all directions, covering them with moist earth, with the crown two inches below the surface of the ground. The rows are spaced from six to eight feet apart, I prefer the eight foot spacing. I Intercrop with Japanese hulless popcorn. This grows big enough to shade the ground, preventing it from drying out and protecting the plants from the sun and dry hot winds in the summer. The tillage is taken care of mostly with a five shovel cultivator and a hoe. They are cultivated from five to eight times, depending on sea - son and weed growth, going between the rows twice the first two or three times and once after that up until picking starts and again after picking until the new growth becomes so long that cultivating would be injurious to it. They are hoed from three to five times, depend - ing on weed growth. I have a shaped adjustable harrow that does </seg>
            <seg id="p539">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY good work. You can get closer to the plant and it is not so injm iuub w the root growth. I use a stirring plow some but in shallow planting it cuts too many roots, making it very injurious to the berry crop. Plants are hoed during picking season but not cultivated because my plant - ings are all shallow planted and plants do not stand up well when the berry crop is on. One dorment spray is used of 4x4x50 Bordeaux mixture. A barrel and hand power pump is used with fifty feet of hose. The barrel is put on a sled and drawn by a horse. All plants are well covered with this mixture just as the leaf starts to open. The new canes are topped about 30" high. From 1" to 2" is taken off of the top using a pocket knife to cut it with. The planting is gone over about three times. The late growing plants are not topped as the laterals would not develop sufficiently to form a good plant. Trimming is done in the winter, beginning about Dec. 1. Plants are trimmed long. Old wood is not taken out until winter when the new wood is trimmed. Not over six canes are left in a hill, the number of laterals and the length depends on the sisse of the cane and the health- of the plant. The brush is removed with a five shovel culti - vator. All diseased plants are dug up, carefully removed from the plant - ing and burned. There are no new plants put out in their place. There is no fertilizer used on this farm. Picking started June 10. Pickers begin at 5 A. M. Plantings are picked every other day. Hand carriers containing six quart boxes are used by the pickers. Two pickers are put on a row one on each side. The picking is done under the supervision of the head picker, who sees that all plants are picked and picked clean. The pickers are not given individual crates but as they empty their carriers the berries are checked by the checker who keeps the picking records and sees that the boxes are full. As soon as a crate is filled it is taken to the pack - ing house where it is graded and packed under the supervision of the head packer. Enough pickers are used to complete the picking for the day by 11 o'clock. Pickers are paid the next day after picking by the head picker in coin. Women and girls over sixteen are employed as pickers. This year some men were used and proved to be very satis - factory. Pickers received 2 c per quart box for picking. The Cumberland, Black Pearl and Black Diamond are grown on this farm. The Cumberland seem to do the best and I believe it has the largest berry. The plants nearest the river seem to have the largest berries. </seg>

Question: I use a five-shovel cultivator and I have a fourteen - tooth that is about the same shape and I find it very good. </seg>
            <seg id="p542">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE' BOARD OF AGRICULTURE answer: Yes, I imagine your cultivator would work better than my adjustable harrow. Question: This fourteen-tooth cultivator opens up to 3% feet. I plant most of my stuff around 2 % to 3 feet. When I get through, I cultivate once or twice a week. I find that the fourteen-tooth culti - vator puts a dust mulch about 2 to 3 inches deep that is perfect. Answer:' I have used to some extent a stirring plow and it does very satisfactory work. I plow both ways and throw the dirt to - wards the plant. My plants are planted shallow and the stirring plow cuts too many roots and too many berries turn black and do not ripen up. Question: As an intercrop why not use field corn instead of pop corn? Answer: I thought field corn would grow too high and would not give enough ventilation. But field corn planted 8 feet apart might be all right. Sweet corn might be very satisfactory. Question: How many rows of corn do you put in between the berries? Answer: Just one row that gives you a 4-foot space on each side for cultivation. Question: How long would you leave your patch stand? Answer: Well, this last summer I took the seventh picking off the oldest patch that I have. There is about an acre and a half in it, and I took 115 twenty-four quart crates oft it. I left it because I figured it would pay. I got a very good growth. Leave your patch as long as it pays you. Seven pickings is really considered the life of the patch. Question: Don't you consider the berries get pretty small by that time? Answer: I will tell you what I do with mine. I prune mine a medium length. This patch next year will be the eighth picking. I will prune those mighty close. That will produce a larger berry. After your patch gets older, you are going to have to cut your wood shorter in order to keep the size of the berry up. The younger the patch is, the longer you can leave your wood. Question: Do you ever use a mulch like straw? Answer: No, I don't. I use what they call clean cultivation. Question: Don't the berries get dirty? </seg>
            <seg id="p543">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Answer: I have figured out the expense of mulching with straw. I can't quote the figures; but to buy straw and haul it In would be too expensive, and then you are liable to meet up with ground mice and grub worms working under that straw. Question: Do you think enough more of the Cumberland to plant it all together? ,. Answer: I have three different kinds of berries in the point of ripening. I have the early, medium and the late ripening berries, and I believe it would be advisable to divide it up in that way because the early berries will put you on the market first and the late berries will hold you on the market last. If you are raising berries for can - ning, you can extend your time of picking; use less pickers and extend that time. I believe it would be better to use some early, medium and late berries. I prefer Cumberland berries, but I don't believe I would plant it altogether. Question: What late ones would you recommend? Answer: The late ones I got I bought for Cumberlands. I don't know what the berry is. It is a mighty fine berry. This late berry was my second best acreage this year. It is the largest berry I have. Question: Did you ever try the raspberry? Answer: I tried red raspberries, yes. But I found in my reading somewhere that the red raspberry is very susceptible to mosaic and is likely to spread this dreaded disease to the black raspberries, so when I read that, I cut them out. Question: When you make your plantings, do you always get new nursery stock or do you raise your own plants? Answer: If my stock looks good, I use my own, but if it doesn't I buy new stock from a reliable nursery. CHAIRMAN (Mr. Franklin): I think we had better stop here or all of us apple men will be raising black raspberries. It might be a good idea to get on with the program at this time as we are behind our schedule. "Keeping TJp the Fertility and Water Holding Capacity of Orchard Soils' by M. F. Miller, University of Missouri. KEEPING TJP THE FERTILITY AND WATER HOLDING CAPACITY OP ORCHARD SOILS By M. F. MILLER, University of Missouri The methods of maintaining the fertility of orchard soils differ con - siderably from those of general farming lands. In the first place, the </seg>
            <seg id="p544">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE principal thing to be considered in orchard lands is the supply of organic matter and nitrogen. The phosphorus and potassium sup - plies have thus far been given little attention except when fertilizers carrying these elements are used for stimulating the growth of inter - crops or cover crops. In the second place, unless the soil is rich it is important that the supply of organic matter and nitrogen be built up during the early years of the orchard in order that the young trees may make a rapid and thrifty growth. It is difficult to handle soil building crops, other than sod crops, in mature orchards because of the interference of the trees. The fertility problem in orchard management is much simplified if the proper soil is selected for orchard planting. One of the most important essentials for good orchard soils is a well drained pervious subsoil into which roots may pentrate to great depths. Mr. A. T. Sweet, whose home is in the Ozark region in Missouri, but who has for many years been associated with the federal soil survey, has pub - lished a statement on the relation of subsoil to the growth of fruit trees which is of much interest to orchardists. He has shown by deep excavations that in soils with tight clay subsoils or those with a gravelly hardpan within three or four feet of the surface, apple tree roots do not penerate much over forty inches, while in soils with well drained porous subsoils the roots reach to much greater depths. For instance, in the Knox silt loam on which the greater part of the com - mercial orchards in Nebraska are found, the roots reach a depth of around twelve feet. It is interesting to know that many of the early plantings in the Ozark region of Missouri and Arkansas were made on the smooth ridge lands, most of which have a gravelly hardpan at three to three and a half feet. These plantings did quite well in the earlier years, and with an absence of serious insect infestation in those days, little or no spraying was necessary so that the orchards were fairly profit - able until they reached an age of twenty or twenty-five years. As the trees became older, however, the shallow root systems began to tell and the trees deteriorated until now practically all orchards on such soils have been abandoned. The successful orchards in the Ozark region at this time are on soils with deep permeable subsoils. The second very important characteristic of good orchard land is that it have a reasonably large supply of organic matter and nitrogen. It is, of course, not necessary and probably not wise to select soils hav - ing the deep black surface of our good corn belt lands, since even if these had sufficiently permeable subsoils the large amount of soluble nitrates, which such soils develop, would probably cause excessive vegetative growth. However, if the land selected has a reasonable supply of organic matter and nitrogen this is very advantageous. On </seg>
            <seg id="p545">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY the other hand, in the Knox silt loam territory where the steep slopes are sometimes so eroded as to bring the raw subsoil practically to the surface it is very doubtful If it is economical to plant such slopes at all. This is particularly true of this type of land in regions farther east along the Missouri River where the soil is less fertile and the subsoil more compact. It is probably well to consider some of the essentials to good or - chard production from the standpoint of soil management in the Missouri valley orchard area. First, there is the matter just mention - ed that the soil should be well supplied with organic matter and nitrogen. If this condition does not exist every effort should be made ; to build up the soil in this respect during the early years of the orchard. Second, thought should be given to the matter of moisture conservation and an attempt should be made to develop systems of inter-cropping and tillage which do not rob the trees of moisture at those times of the year, and particularly during those years, when moisture is deficient. Third, there is the very important matter of providing an abundant supply of soluble nitrogen in the form of nitrates, particularly in the spring and early summer which will make possible an eight to fourteen inch growth of terminal branches with well developed healthy leaves and which will stimulate the setting of fruit on thrifty lengthened fruit buds. It is evident that the soil management practices which must be adopted to provide the requisites laid down for young orchards re - volve about the production of certain legumes as inter-crops or cover crops on lands having a low content of organic matter, and possibly clean culture with erosion prevention on lands having a fair supply of organic matter. Naturally, as the orchard increases in age the practices must change somewhat since in the older orchards it is im - possible to do those things which can be done in a younger orchard. Considering first the case of the younger growing orchards on lands that are not particularly high in organic matter the crops suited for building up and maintaining a supply of organic matter will vary with the soil and the rainfall. If a man is sufllciently foresighted and is expecting to plant trees on land with a rather low supply of organic matter, alfalfa is a good crop to precede the planting for two or three years. However, alfalfa requires a large amount of moisture and it is somewhat doubtful for Nebraska conditions, especially in the light of the findings of the Department of Agronomy of the University, which have shown that the continued growing of alfalfa on land uses up the deep subsoil moisture in a way that would be detrimental to an orchard following. However, if it were grown for only two or three years this would not be an important factor. It would certainly limit it, however, as an inter-crop in a young orchard. </seg>
            <seg id="p546">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Sweet clover Is the most powerful soil building legume we have. Experiments at the Missouri and Ohio Experiment Stations show that If sweet clover Is sown In the oats or wheat in the spring, allowed to go over that year as a stubble crop and then turned under as a green manure the following spring, around 150 pounds of nitrogen will thus be turned under, the greater part of which is air nitrogen. Natural - ly, sweet clover utilizes considerable soil moisture and it can be used as an inter-crop only when trees are cultivated along the row. Never - theless, when it is handled in this way it can be used to supply large quantities of organic matter and nitrogen. As the orchard becomes older sweet clover loses its effectiveness for Nebraska conditions be - cause of the amount of moisture it utilizes, but there is no reason why it could not be used very effectively in the younger orchards. "Vetch is a crop which Missouri people, and I think Nebraska peo - ple, have not quite appreciated as an orchard crop. The Kansas Ex - periment Station reports that as a nine year average at Manhattan vetch sown in the fall and turned under the next summer has accum - ulated in its tops an average of two and a half tons of air dry matter ■with a nitrogen content of about sixty-three pounds per ton, or a total per acre of around 150 pounds of nitrogen. If everyone could secure as good result as this it would be practically equivalent to sweet clover in its effectiveness. However, there has been some trouble in getting stands and the seed has been more expensive than sweet clover, so that it has not grown rapidly in popularity. Vetch can be sown around the middle of August, thirty pounds per acre, and either turned under the next summer or it may be allowed to lie on the ground and disked in, thus reseeding. The Missouri experience under this last named plan, however, is that sometimes fall grasses come up and make it practically impossible to get a volunteer stand in this way. Vetch and rye have been used some in orchards also, but where vetch is a fairly sure crop and where one has learned how to handle it there is a ques - tion if rye should be included. Experiments at the Missouri Station in - dicate that there is not much to be gained from the standpoint of nitrogren by using rye as a green manure. As a matter of fact, in one experiment where we have turned under rye every year for twelve years the land has steadily lost nitrogren. Rye is a very satisfactory crop for lessening soil erosion, but as a green manure crop it has its limitations. The soybean crop has made very rapid strides in popularity as a field crop in the corn belt during recent years and it has possibilities as an orchard inter-crop, if the land is not too rolling. The average ton of soybean hay carries around fifty pounds of nitrogren and one and a quarter to one and a half tons of hay can readily be produced, giv - ing a very substantial nitrogren addition when turned under. We have found at Missouri that soybeans bring in grasshoppers rather </seg>
            <seg id="p547">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY badly in grasshopper years, and where the land Is rolling they cause excessive erosion. On steep lands the injury from erosion may be such as to remove more nitrogen and organic matter than the soybeans bring to the soil. If they are removed from the land, as is sometimes done, the loss of nitrogen and organic matter through erosion may greatly exceed that which is added in the roots and leaves which re - main. To use soybeans successfully as a soil building crop they must either be allowed to lie on the ground over winter to keep down erosion, or if they are plowed under they should be followed by a winter cover such as vetch or rye. The Iowa Station has been carrying on an orchard experiment in southwestern Iowa for a number of years, using various treatments and they have found that red clover and oats sown every other year has been the most effective means of bringing in a good supply of nitrogen and organic matter and in stimulating production. We have not experimented with this in Missouri. However, in the orchard with which I am personally connected, on the brown loess soil along the Missouri River in central Missouri, we have used a mixture of red clover, alsike clover and some timothy for a number of years with very good satisfaction. This, of course, keeps down erosion and if there is a good growth of the clovers it makes a very satisfactory or - chard cover. The farther west one goes, however, the less desirable this would probably be from the standpoint of moisture relations. In mature orchards the crops one can use are more limited in number than those suited to the growing orchard. In most of Miss - ouri, western Iowa and eastern Nebraska, bluegrass with possibly some clover is by far the most common crop. This has the advantage of forming a firm surface for the spraying machinery in the spring, and of requiring little care. It has the disadvantage of utilizing a good deal of moisture from the surface foot and of reducing the quantity of available nitrates to rather a low level, unless the soil is exceptionally good. For most orchards nitrogren fertilization is required where such a cover is used. A crop that is now receiving considerable attention for the more mature orchards in Missouri is Korean lespedeza. This is an annual, low growing clover which reseeds abundantly and once seeded down in an orchard will give a permanent sod. It is a hardy plant that will grow on even the most infertile orchard lands without treatment. For Missouri conditions it does not even need inoculation since the wild Partridge pea, which is well disseminated throughout the state, car - ries the same organism. Some growers have had as much as three years experience with it and are quite well satisfied. It seems to cause a good absorption of the rainfall and the soil beneath appears more moist than that on the bluegrass sod, although we have made </seg>
            <seg id="p548">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE no specific study of this. It will produce a ton to a ton and a quar - ter of dry organic matter per acre on lands of medium fertility, and the analyses show each ton to contain about fifty pounds of nitrogen. It is not necessary to turn it under but simply allow it to fall down each year. It has one serious drawback, however, and that is the fire hazard. Once established it makes a thick growth on the ground which burns freely and it is practically necessary to run regular fire lines through the orchard by double disking the land so as to chop it into the soil, thus stopping the spread of the fire. i Just how well Korean lespedeza would be adapted to eastern Ne - braska conditions is somewhat of a question, but it can be grown readily to the northern line of Missouri, and I think considerably farther north. I understand that it has been grown rather success - fully in southeastern Nebraska as a pasture crop and it has matured seed at Lincoln. The chances are that it will grow throughout all of eastern Nebraska and produce seed. The matter of moisture conservation in orchards in the eastern part of the Missouri valley district is an important one. Unfortunately, outside of the practice of avoiding crops which remove excessive amounts of water from the soil there is not much that can be done in controlling it. Of course, crops which insure a large water absorption and not too great a use of water, such as Korean lespedeza, are to be considered. Naturally too, clean tillage in young orchards conserves moisture by keeping down weeds and grass. Maintaining the supply of organic matter is helpful, although just how much more water a soil will retain because of an increased supply of organic matter it is difficult to say. There is very little quantitative data available. Probably the most important effect of the organic mutter, from the standpoint of moisture, is that of keeping the soil in a mellow open condition favoring the absorption of rainfall. Of course, one can do something in clipping inter-crops and using them as a mulch around the trees, but this practice has its limitations in mature or - chards where the trees are large. It seems advantageous to double disk a heavy bluegrass sod occasionally in order to prevent it from becoming too hard and also to increase moisture absorption. This also has its limitations. Practices looking to erosion control in orchards tend to conserve moisture but here again such practices are not very effective in actually supplying the trees with water. We still have a lot to learn with reference to practical means of moisture control in orchards located in the western part of the Missouri valley. Probably something should be said with reference to fertilizing orchards with nitrogen fertilizers in order to provide an abundance of nitrates, which are so necessary in early spring. I have nothing par - ticularly new to contribute to this subject, but with the decreasing </seg>
            <seg id="p549">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY prices of nitrogen fertilizers this should become more and more im - portant. There is little doubt that in most of the eastern Nebraska orchards where bluegrass or other grasses forms a sod cover, the use of sodium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, or possibly one of the newer nitrogen fertilizers, applied two or three weeks before the trees bloom, will be very effective in increasing growth and the setting of fruit. This is particularly true of off years due to seasonal conditions, or of the off years of alternately bearing trees. Our growers in Missouri make wide use of such applications and they are proving very effective. I ■ , Thus far we have used phosphate and potash only to stimulate inter-crops or green manure crops. There is some question, however, if we have learned the proper way to use such fertilizers. It is now known that when either phosphate or potash fertilizers are applied broadcast on the surface most of this is fixed in the surface three or four inches and never penetrates deeply into the soil, as does nitrogen. Dr. Murneek now has some experiments under way at the Missouri Station, in which mixed fertilizers are being applied at depths of a foot to a foot and a half, to see if orchard trees might not respond to such applications somewhat as shade trees have done. M. F. MILLER. - Discussion. Question: With reference to getting fertilizer down deep, the feeding roots of a tree are always near the surface are they not? Answer: That is a question. The top foot has the greatest amount of feeding roots. In sod where grass is at the surface eating up every - thing, if this fertilizer, is kept near the surface, the roots don't get It. Question: Do you plow the sweet clover under? Answer: Yes. The second spring when it gets about sir to eight inches high. You must not wait too long as it will dry the soil too much. Question: I would like to know what the speaker's idea is of the Korean Lespedeza as a honey-producing plant. Answer: It is not a honey-producing plant. The Vetch is. Question: How about tree hoppers? Answer: Red clover with us gives much more difficulty with tree hoppers. We have used in our own orchard a mixture of red ■ clover. </seg>
            <seg id="p550">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Question: The fact that Korean Lesedeza reseeds itself hasn't been stressed enough, in my opinion. Answer: It reseeds itself and lots of hard seeds will carry over two or three years. This plant grows rather slowly to begin with in early summer. It doesn't amount to much until long in June perhaps. If we should happen to have a dry spell, we could go in and cut that all up with a disc, and not let it rob the trees of soil moisture that year. I think that has a lot of significance. Sweet clover grows too high, takes lots of moisture out of the soil. This plant is a low-grow - ing plant, doesn't require so much moisture, and there is no reseeding necessary. It certainly doesn't require inoculation from our experi - ence in Johnson County where I saw it develop last fall under a lot of different conditions. Perhaps it is a little too easy to get a stand but I think it has lots of possibilities for the orchardist. Question: About how many pounds do you use? Answer: Ten pounds. That does pretty well. Question: How about its growth in the shade? Answer: It seems to do pretty well in the shade. Question: It would grow then in an old orchard? Answer: I think so; pretty well. Question: Has it a tendency to smother out any weeds? Answer: Yes, after the first year. Question: Can you sow it early in the spring? Answer: Yes. Any time up to the first of May in Missouri. Perhaps not quite so late in Nebraska. Question: How about this matter of inoculation? Answer: We haven't found that inoculation is necessary general - ly, but we have found some cases where it is beneficial once in a while. We do not recommend inoculating. Some people and some county agents have found that by inoculation it has been somewhat better. Question: Is it as efficient in adding nitrogen as other clovers? Answer: Not nearly as efficient as red clover and sweet clover. It contains about 15 pounds of nitrogen to a ton of hay. On good land we have done as high as 2% tons. You can figure on about 1*4 to 1% tons and that means a fair amount of nitrogen. Question: Some of the people might be interested also in know- Ing as to the palatability of this hay used in orchards. </seg>
            <seg id="p551">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Answer: I don't think it is a common practice to pasture orchards but it makes a very good feed. Question: Can the seed be obtained readily here? MR. HOPPERT: I don't know if there Is very much available in Missouri at the present time. I think quite a lot of it is available through Indiana, Southern Illinois and northern Kentucky. I am having five hundred pounds sent in for trial in eastern Nebraska. We ■will start experiments with it at the Union fruit farm. I would like to have co-operators try it under various situations. I am quite sure it will grow under ordinary orchard conditions. But I don't know whether it will grow in the shade. PROF. MILLER: I don't know how well it will grow under shade. Our man in Jackson County, our agent, says it grows pretty well under orchard trees. We have a different climate, you understand. The farther south you go, the better the conditions for lespedeza. CHAIRMAN: Well, I wonder — anyone can readily see that we are going to have to make a change in our program. Should we have Mr. Bierbaum now or our business meeting? MR. HOPPERT: We might combine Mr. Blerbaum's two talks and have them this afternoon and proceed with our business meeting at this time. PRESIDENT GREEN: Let us have order in the meeting, folks. We want to proceed with dispatch. Before I go any further, I want to thank this organization for the honor of being President. I consider it a great honor, more especially when I look back and can find no record of any other florist, outside of one man, that was President of this organization. I also find that I have been a member of thiB organization, a life member, for twenty years now. I wasn't very old when I joined it. I was the youngest life member in the organiza - tion at the time I joined. At this session we want to elect a President, First Vice-President, Second Vice-President, Treasurer and one Director. We will start with the President. Are you ready for nominations? Motion was made, and seconded, that J. F. Shubert be nominated for President. Motion carried. MR. GREEN: Who will you have for your Vice-President for next year? Mr. Banning is the present Second Vice-President and I guess we have generally advanced them. However, that is up to the members present. Motion was made that Mr. Banning be nominated for First Vice- President. Seconded. Carried. </seg>
            <seg id="p552">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. GREEN: Now our Second Vice-President. Motion was made to nominate Richard Kimmel of Nebraska City. Seconded. Carried. MR. GREEN: Now there is one Director for Grove Porter's place. Who will you have for your Director? Question: Mr. Chairman, hasn't it been customary that the re - tiring President be elected to that position? Answer: It has been made a custom. Motion was made that the precedent establshed be followed and that Mr. Green be made a member of the Board of Directors. Seconded. Carried. MR. GREEN: I think we will have the Secretary's report. I would like to have somebody make a motion that the Secretary's re - port be spread upon the book as written. It is quite long. We know about what has happened and we haven't a lot of time now. Motion to this effect was made, seconded and carried. Question: I would like to ask in this connection are the reports here? Do we have to wait a full year before we get this year's? MR. HOPPERT: Mr. Jackson's office handles the printing of the report and usually the organizations that have their meetings first have their reports first. Some people on our program are always slow about handing in their papers. It just isn't possible to get the report out any sooner than we have been getting it out. Question: How long have we been a subsidiary organization of the State Board of Agriculture? MR. HOPPERT: Ever since the legislature took away our paid secretary about ten years ago. You see we have no paid secretary. I am the secretary without salary. MR. CHRISTY: There is liable to be a change of procedure in the next legislature and if the code bill should be repealed, where will we be? That thing needs to be looked after. MR. GREEN: There is one thing I think should be worked on more and that is membership in this organization. I know from what experience I have had going down to the legislature on Izaac Walton League work; when we had eight thousand members and said "Jump", they jumped. Now our membership is light and we have to talk hard and then we don't always get what we want. I believe I would work more on the annual memberships. It would mean more money in the treasury. If we could increase our membership, two or three thousand </seg>
            <seg id="p553">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY people in the state, it would carry more weight if anything ; would come up with reference to our appropriation. Every one of those garden dub members that was here yesterday should be a member of this organization. Annual members, if possible. That is one dollar a year. My father paid five dollars for me in 1912 and I have a long time to go yet if I stay in here as long as he did. I think it would be a very good idea it we would have a good membership committee, and I would suggest to the incoming President that he appoint somebody on that committee and not leave it up to one man Get a few members here and there, scatter them over the state. One thousand members in Lincoln alone wouldn't do any good in the legislature. They must know that it is not for the interests of a few people. If it is for the interest of the state at large, you don t need to worry about the code bill or anything else. MR HOPPERTi We might talk about that legislative committee work ' A group of people from down around Mr. Banning's neighbor - hood'brought an injunction against the enforcement of the Cedar law The case was taken to the Federal District Court at Omaha, the latter part of October, Mr. Banning, Mr. Porter, Dr. Peltier and I appeared as witnesses. The judges rendered their decision Just recently uphold - ing the constitutionality of the law, so we won't have any further trouble, we believe. Question: This morning's paper carries a story about the cedar owners in Richardson County getting up a petition to abolish the law. In fact a bill has been prepared to repeal the present cedar law. I think the representative from Salem is introducing the bill. Question: .Who is he? Answer: M. L. Dowell. Question: We have got to watch that new bill and appear against it when it comes up in the committee. It is a lot easier to keep the present law than it is to get another one. Answer- I think Mr. Gates of the Department of Agriculture is perfectly ready and willing to do anything that can be done to help us keep it there. MR HOPPERT: I think there was another committee that I was supposed to be chairman of, namely the committee on railway rates. You might report what success we have had with it, Mr. Baker. MR BAKER: Last year we had a committee appointed to go be - fore the State Railway Commission and try to get the rate through on this 196-D. That was the rate that was in effect for the growers of Missouri and Kansas and a few points in Arkansas. We, the com - mittee, met with the State Railway Commission, and also the man in </seg>
            <seg id="p554">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE charge of that department for the Burlington, and were able to get that rate In effect for this year. The new rate was published and went into effect August 25 of this last year. I might say that since that tariff has gone into effect, our association down here — I was going to bring that out this afternoon — has been able to get a few more changes. The committee that was appointed, functioned, and got what we went after. The tariff is now In effect. MR. GREEN: The Treasurer has a report he would like to make. We have one to elect. Well, what will we do about a treasurer? Answer: Let's hear his report first. January 2nd, 1933 To Mr. E. Hoppert, Sec'y State Horticulture Society Lincoln, Nebr.

Yours very truly, DEARLE BAKER Treasurer State Horticulture Society. Motion was made to accept the report and that Mr. Baker be re - elected Treasurer. Seconded. Carried. Question: How about the Secretary? Answer: The Secretary is elected by the Board of Directors. Answer: I might make this additional report. Our annual ap - propriation from the legislature has been $1500.00 a year. We haven't used all of that money in our society activities. We had a balance from the last two years of about $900.00 and we used that this past year to pay premiums on exhibits out at the State Fair. MR. BAKER: The annual memberships and the life memberships are the only money added to this fund. We were members of the national society for a few years and we paid our dues out of this fund. The last year we haven't been a member because we didn't see any benefits, so we have saved that $25.00. Question: Do we have a report from Mr. Jackson? </seg>
            <seg id="p555">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Answer- That will be incorporated in the next report. This *«•» that surplus that we would have to turn back was used in paying the premiums. The fair management was unable to pay premiums last year and we had this money available and decided to pay the premiums. In previous years we have helped out with our funds, paying the horticultural premiums in excess of $1250, but this year we paid all of them We cut down the premium list to begin with and had to pay out about $920.00, so there won't be any money left over in that fund at the end of this fiscal year.

HOPPERT Activities of the Horticultural Society. Winter Meetings. The Nebraska Horticultural Society started its activities for 1932 with its winter meetings during the week of Or - ganized Agriculture, Jan. 5-6-7. The first day was devoted to sub - jects pertaining to Ornamental Gardening. The out-of-state speakers secured for this. occasion were Walter Balch of the Kansas State Agri - cultural College at Manhattan and G. W. Longnecker of the Wiscon - sin Agricultural College at Madison. The former gave talks on "Arranging Annual Flowers in Beds", and "House Plants and Their Care". Mr. Longnecker discussed the topic "Interesting and worth - while Garden Club Programs" and also gave an illustrated talk on "Building Rock Gardens". The attendance at the ornamental meeting was seriously interfered with by a blizzard accompanied by zero weather. In spite of the ad - verse weather about 75 brave people attended these sessions. Various phases of fruit growing were discussed on the last two days. Out-of-state speakers secured for this occasion were Fred Turner of Neosho, Mo., and Prof. E. L. Overholser of Pullman, Wash - ington. Mr. Turner told the group of his experiences with a 90,000 bushel storage house which he built several years ago. Professor Overholser discussed "Marketing the Apple Crop of Washington" and "Thinning as a Necessary Operation in the Production of Quality Fruits." In addition, other problems confronting the fruit growers were discussed. The trucker as a factor in marketing apples came up for a lot of cussing and discussing. The Secretary gave an illustrated talk on "Fruit Growing in Southern Illinois and Colorado". Various spray- </seg>
            <seg id="p556">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ing problems were discussed by Dr. R. W. Goss, W. W. Yocum and Myron H. Swenk. ■ The legislative committee reported that they had been successful in securing more favorable legislation in the removal of cedars from within 2 miles of apple orchards and recommended that the growers get together to request the help of the State Department of Agriculture In tagging offending cedar trees before the next growing season. Meetings of fruit growers were held at Nebraska City and Shubert and written requests filled out to have Mr. L. M. Gates make a survey of the area around the various orchards. The result was that about 3,000 cedars were cut down around Nebraska City, Union, Brownville, Peru, and Shubert. A number of cedar owners around Falls City offered strenuous objections and at Union likewise. The objectors at Union brought an injunction against the law and then Governor Bryan had the work stopped until the Federal courts could decide the con - stitutionality of the law. The case came up in Federal District Court at Omaha in October, at which time "W. B. Banning, Grove Porter, and the Secretary appeared to give testimony for the State. At the time this report was prepared the Federal judges sitting in the case had not rendered a decision. Orchard Tour. The regular summer orchard tour was not held this year. The Board in making its decision felt that the crop was so spotted in most orchards that it was best to omit this activity. How - ever, the Secretary and various fruit growers cooperated with the Omaha Chamber of Commerce in sponsoring a tour of Omaha business men thru the orchard section. Stops were made at the W. B. Ban - ning orchard at Union, at the University Fruit Farm, — at the Morton Orchards at Nebraska City, — at the Weaver &amp; Towle orchard at Shu - bert, and at the Shubert Packing House. In the evening a banquet was held at Falls City. At this time the growers were offered the privilege as using the name "A-Sar-Ben" for their best grade of apples. The Ak-Sar-Ben Board made this offer thru its President, George Brandeis. Dearie Baker of Shubert accepted the gift on behalf of the growers. As a result of this meeting the Omaha group became better ac - quainted with the possibilities of apple growing in southeastern Ne - braska and with the methods used. A number of the visitors re - marked about the business-like way apples are handled in the pack - ing operation, after seeing the cooperative packing plant at Shubert. State Fair Exhibit. The Horticultural Society cooperated with the Fair Board in holding a Fruit, Flower, and Garden show at the State Fair. This year the special nursery exhibit was not held in Agricul - tural Hall.

BAKER: We will come to order now, please, we are just a few minutes behind schedule and we want to give the men who are presenting these papers as much time as they will want, so we will have to go right into our program. This morning we held over one of the addresses or papers entitled "Our Experiences with Legumes in Orchards" by Mr. Bierbaum of Illinois and put it with "Cooperative Marketing of Fruit in Southern Illinois." I don't know if you people are acquainted with Mr. Bierbaum or not. A year ago last fall it was my privilege to make a trip to southern Illinois to look at a cooperative packing plant. At that time they were harvesting an enormous peach crop. I met Mr. Bierbaum at that time and he took me on a tour that lasted several hours. I got a lot of valuable information on this trip and I think we will use some of the ideas I got there. I know our packing plant at Shubert was built along the line they had there. I know Mr. Bierbaum is very well acquainted with conditions in that district and I am sure he is going to give us some information that will be very valuable to us. ■ COOPERATIVE MARKETING IN SOUTHERN ILLINOIS By E. A. BIERBAUM, County Agent, Anna, 111. In presenting a discussion of marketing fruits, whether the dis - cussion confines itself to local conditions or whether it spreads to the subject in general, it seems to be a good idea to present some of the broader phases of the subject. Marketing of fruits or any other com - modity may be denned as that process by which a given commodity is delivered from producer to the consumer including any processing or service necessary to make such delivery. This permits discussion of such acts as buying, selling, transporta - tion, storage, standardizing, grading, dividing, packaging, financing, ; risk bearing, recording and other minor acts incident to any of these. Buying involves a determination of the amount of goods to (1) {have on hand; (2) finding a source or supply of such goods; (3) deter- I mining a regular supply; and (4) purchase at a price that will permit resale. </seg>
            <seg id="p562">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Selling involves (1) finding a buyer and (2) creating a demand by some means, generally by advertising, display or- such means. Transportation involves safe delivery from point of production to storage, to point o£ sale, or even in some cases direct to consumer. -It Is the physical movement of the product. Storage in many cases means holding the product over a period to permit time for the other phases of marketing. Grading and standardization I am sure you are well acquainted with as it is the one phase of marketing that each individual grower or group of growers may perform and, I might say, is essential to any successful marketing procedure regardless of the type of marketing used. Dividing and packaging involves the rehandling of the larger pack - age to the smaller one. The latter being the package generally wanted by the consumer. The consumer, who in general is the purchasing housewife, demands the goods in small packages and demands them when she wants them. She is not so much interested in home storage except for a supply to carry over a small period of a day or two. Financing, risk bearing and others we will not discuss but they are a definite part of marketing and in a large way often determine tho method of sale. Hence we can see that marketing covers a large amount of ser - vice and for every step in marketing that the grower takes, he as - sumes a proportionate amount of responsibility and risk. This addi - tional risk may be reflected in profit and it may be reflected in loss. Cooperative marketing is merely a type of marketing where the growers assume additional steps in the handling of products of their own production. Here may I pause to reflect a thought that always comes to me when I think of that statement. It is as much a God - given right for the farmer or fruit grower to assume such additional steps as it is for any other agency to assume them for him, and per - sonally I have little faith with any person or agency that feels the farmers are stepping beyond their just field when they assume these additional steps in handling their products. Being a type of marketing, cooperative marketing then is subject to most all of the factors that affect marketing in general. These in - clude (1) supply and demand; (2) competition and/or substitution; (3) quality;. and (4) distribution. How far then can cooperative mar - keting go in remedying growers' marketing problems? To this I would answer: Only so far as it may perform one or more phases or steps In marketing more economical than other types of marketing do. </seg>
            <seg id="p563">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Generally this is being done by (1) reducing the cost of markuuuB, (2) Improving the distribution of the product; (3) increasing the de - mand for the product; (4) standardizing the product and package; '(5) protecting the individual grower. And to me this latter improve - ment is essential. In southern Illinois the growers were having their problems as far back as 1890 — apparently problems are not a new thing for fruit growers. At that time large amounts of fruits and vegetables were moving to Chicago, the then largest northern market. Transporta - tion charges were based on l.c.l. rates and the product moved in car - lots. Several growers studied the problem. Thirty cents per package l.c.l as compared with a carlot rate that figured 12 %c per package caused some thought. Cooperative marketing in southern Illinois started with the simple solution of this problem. Shipping associations were organized at each shipping point, a man hired to oversee the loading and another man placed in Chicago to oversee the unloading, and packages moved to Chicago at 15c per package and the associations carried substantial amounts in their treasuries after expenses were paid. These men had assumed another step in the handling of their product. These associations are functioning today. Three methods of sales are prevalent in southern Illinois. (1) Outright sale to speculative buyers. (2) Consignment upon a commis - sion basis. (3) Sale through growers' marketing associations. The latter method is growing but by no means represents the majority of sales in Union County (111.). With the shift in buying and selling methods, with the chain store handling GO to 65% of the foodstuffs including fruits and vegetables, it has concentrated the buying power and no doubt this will demand a concentration of selling power if the grower is to succeed in his marketing endeavors. The sales through growers' marketing associations has in gen - eral been satisfactory. Local units of growers are organized and affiliated with the large regional or state unit which by contract sells the products and assists the locals in field work, purchase of supplies and affords volume buying and selling. Each local is independent to purchase supplies if desired. However, it has thus far been advant - ageous to deal through the regional. In selling the local manager is in constant touch with the regional sales agency and generally auth - orized to make local sales when such are in line with the general market. Several of the local units operate central packing sheds, function - ing as such during the marketing season and serving as warehouses ifor materials at off season. The investments in these buildings vary according to size of crop handled, equipment installed etc., most of </seg>
            <seg id="p564">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE them baying mechanical means for sorting according to size. In the last year or so serious consideration was given to the or - ganization of an agricultural credit corporation to assist the growers finance their crops but with the small rediscount value given fruit growers' paper the idea was dropped and this year the growers are using finances from the Regional Agricultural Credit Corporation re - cently established by R. F. C. funds. With the failure of our fruit crops in 1932 there was practically no fruit handled by the units, so I cannot give you figures covering cost per package etc. that would be of value in light of the adjustment pe - riod we are! now going through. I have been purposely brief in discussing this subject so that we might have 1 time for questions, which I shall be glad to answer as far as I can, but before that I want to read what we have concluded are fundamental principles in this type of marketing, cooperative mar - keting. These I take from Dr. J. W. Lloyd's 111. Agr: Exp. Sta. Circular 244. Fundamental Principles of Cooperative Marketing. 1. Organization for marketing purposes can be most readily ef - fected when conditions in the given industry are such that the need of improvement is quite generally apparent to those engaged in the in - dustry. 2. Unless at the time of organization, the conditions in the in - dustry are so unsatisfactory that striking improvements are possible early in the life of the organization, the organization itself is likely to die from inertia or succumb to attacks from outside interests. 3. At the time a local organization undertakes to handle a crop, there must be a sufficient volume of one product or closely allied products represented by the membership to enable shipments to be made in carload lots and to effect a sufficient aggregate saving in the cost of marketing to more than counter-balance the expense of oper - ation. 4. The organization must be composed of persons whose interests are similar. Membership in a growers' organization should usually be limited to actual growers of the crop to be marketed. 6. Definite provisions must be made for financing the business of the organization. 6. The benefits accruing from membership in the organization should be distributed among the members in proportion to the value of the products handled for each. </seg>
            <seg id="p565">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 7. In a properly-constituted growers' cooperative marketing or - ganization, it makes little difference whether the voting power is based upon individuals (one-man, one-vote), volume of product, or shares of stock. 8. For the purpose of marketing the product of a large horti - cultural industry, an affiliation of local organizations is preferable to a single large organization made up directly of individual growers. In such an affiliation, the identity of each local should be preserved and its interests fully represented in the central organization. 9. Each organization must possess — represented either in its membership or its employees — a degree of administrative ability and business acumen commensurate with the volume of the business to be transacted and the intricacy of the problems to be solved. 10. The details of handling, selling, and distributing the crop must be adapted to the nature and volume of the product. 11. Loyalty of the individual members and mutual confidence among all factors in the organization are absolutely essential to the permanent success of any cooperative enterprise. Discussion Question: How much shade will lespedeza stand? Answer: We find that it grows pretty well under the trees. Where the limbs and branches are down well, we don't find so much around the trunk of the tree. We were highly surprised to find how much it really would grow among trees where the sun was able to get down. Question: Should it be planted right up to the trees in a young orchard? Answer: In the formative period of an orchard I would plant it right close to the trees. I would retain some scheme here by an area around the tree or by strip cultivation to maintain and conserve more moisture for the young tree. We have a rodent problem and we find that we get better development of the tree where we give it hoeing. Most of the men use a double shovel, making an area around 10 feet from the tree. It will probably be 4 to 6 teet in radius. Question: Do you cut this for hay? Answer: We have not used any of it for hay. One reason Is that we really haven't had need to have it for hay. We have had plenty of alfalfa available. In fact, we bought alfalfa, baled and put in the loft of the barn, for $5.00 a ton. </seg>
            <seg id="p566">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Question: How about the cost of this new crop? How much to the acre do you plant? Answer: We have gotten good stands with 8 pounds of seed. Most of the men are using 10 to 12. The cost ran around 6 and 7c per pound. This year there seems to be a substantial amount of seed available and we anticipate around 5c a pound F. O. B., shipping point. Question: What price did you mention? Answer: About 5c a pound is what we anticipate. Question: I was interested in this subject first through a recom - mendation made by Mr. Hoppert. This fall, in September, in the "Country Gentleman" I noticed four different advertisements of Les - pedeza and I just wrote asking information. They describe a peren - nial there under "Ceresa". The price runs up to $5.00 an ounce and that indicates their natural ambition to put it on the market. Answer: We haven't tried Lespedeza Ceresa. I have seen a small amount of it in a garden in Kentucky. I am going to let the other man play with that seed. I don't know whether the fact that it is a perennial is an advantage or not. Korean lespedeza will reseed it - self and you get your growth just the same. I contracted for a sub - stantial amount of seed a year ago last fall for 2 2c and I purchased that seed for 8c by the time I needed it. That is, I think, one of the large reasons for introducing Lespedeza Ceresa. Question: If the Korean clover is cut for hay, is there seed enough left on the ground to give a good stand the next year? Answer: As a general rule, yes. Most of the men cut it a little bit high, which leaves some of the lower branches, and these produce enough seed to reseed pretty well. That was well brought out at the Morganville meeting down in Union County t Kentucky. We haven't any one in our county who has used substantial amounts of it over a period of years. The livestock like it both as pasture and as hay. Question: What about adding nitrogen to the soil? Answer: I think Professor Miller brought that out this morning pretty well. His figures were about 50 pounds of nitrogen to the acre where' a heavy top growth was made. That will run about one-third of sweet clover. Our idea in southern Illinois is that if you can grow the other legumes, Lespedeza is put of your picture unless you are just leaving a field out, that you are not going to do anything with and that you don't want to spend any money on. If it is just going to lay there, seed it. In the seeding of it on blue grass, you want to be sure the seed gets down to the ground. </seg>
            <seg id="p567">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Often times we found the seed had sprouted in the sod and the roots c juld not get down to the soil in time to become established before a hot spell came along so the young seedlings died. Question: Is it sown by drills? . ■ - .-' '■ ,''/■..'.■■■■'..■■'■ Answer: Most of it is broadcast. Some of the men are taking it early in the spring. Some of them have prepared a seed bed like they would for alfalfa. We have decided that about the best thing to do is scratch the soil or sod with a very sharp fine-toothed harrow, bow your seed, and go away and forget it. Question: Is the seed similar to the clover seed? Answer: It comes with the hull on and is about two-thirds the size of the ordinary red clover seed. Question: Could it be sown in the fall? Answer: We can't see any advantage of sowing it in the fall be - cause it is nn annual and first frost kills it. The fall seeding would probably kill out and not come back unless you had unsprouted seed left from the original seeding. Question: If I sowed this as a cover crop along in August after I have stopped cultivating would the p'ants be able to furnish enough seed? Answer: I think that would be too short a growing season to produce seed. Ordinary Korean Lespedeza requires about one hun - dred days to produce seed. Question: If the roots are shallow growing in Lespedeza, will there be enough nitrogen added to the soil to help the trees? Answer: I don't think you can figure Lespedeza as adding a sub - stantial nitrogen supply to the soil. It is primarily a cover, to pre - vent washing. I think it would be better than Fox Tail which uses up nitrogen. You have less the next year than you had before. The Korean clover replaces what has been taken out and over a period of years would add considerable nitrogen. Question. Have any of you had experience with sweet clover in the orchard so far? Answer: Yes, I have used it in mine. Question: Can you find your trees when you want to pick your apples? Answer: The first year's growth isn't so bad. The second year you have to mow it about twice in order to get to the trees. It can be </seg>
            <seg id="p568">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE cut down, or smashed down with a heavy drag. Question: Do you know how long a time you can grow Lespedeza, or does it finally play out? Answer: I was In a six-year old field that had reseeded itself for the fifth time and it was still looking good. . Question: It was brought out this morning that it is quite a fire hazard to an orchard. Answer. That was a new angle to me. There apparently is a resinous compound in the plant which burns readily and in the burn - ing a lot of heat is given off. Naturally this would be injurious among trees. 1 Now I am going to burn some next spring just to see it burn. Some men i as Professor Miller brought out this morning, insist that fire guards be placed in the orchard that will prevent continuous fire through the orchard. But most of you practice this method of fire prevention right now. Question: It Is a slow growing plant. What becomes of the weeds? i Answer: We had one field seeded this spring that was very weedy. This fall we went through it and there was a regular mass of Les - pedeza. It will get ahead of the weeds the second year. The first year I we let them go. Those fields that I saw in Morgansville, Ken - tucky', were just like alfalfa fields. They were nice and green with hardly a weed in them. Those men told me that Lespedeza eventually got ahead of the weeds. Question: What do you think of Vetch? Answer: We think quite a little of Vetch. We have one apple man who seeded Vetch some nine years ago and he still has a cover crop. He hasn't done a thing to it during that time. Where he has run through it with his spraying machinery, you can see it is pretty well tramped down. Question: Is there any danger of cattle bloating on that? Answer: We haven't had any trouble that way. I don't recall any experiences of it either, although I wouldn't say for sure, because that is getting pretty well over into the other field. MR. HOPPERT: You might stress the importance of getting a seed that is free from Dodder. Answer: There is this weed "Dodder" that is rather prevalent in some sections where the seed is produced, and if I were purchasing seed, I would particularly stress in the letter that you want it free </seg>
            <seg id="p569">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY from Dodder. When I order seed, I always order it subject to tne seed analysis of Illinois. Generally we have found that where they say the seed is free from Dodder, it has been so. I would certainly insist Dodder-free seed. Question: Can you get good Dodder-free seed for 6c a pound this year. Answer: Yes. Enormous amounts of seed are available and I think we could have contracted even last year for seed at 6c. Question: Does it grow north of southern Illinois? Answer: I don't know. MR. HOPPERT: Yes, it's been growing down here in Johnson County. We have six or eight different places -where it has been tried i out during the past year. Mr. Chapin of Lincoln used it on one of his farms as a pasture crop and liked it very well. We saw it grow - ing on some of the poorest soil in that section. If you know Johnson County, you know there is a lot of rocky f gravelly soil where there Is practically nothing but tickle grass. Right in with that this Korean Lespedeza was growing fine. It didn't grow very tall but we saw it in several other places where it made a substantial growth and one farmer made hay out of it off a field that was along a creek. It grows on poor soil, on gumbo soil as well as on good soil. Question: I have a little trouble in growing anything close to a slough. The soil is rather damp in the spring although there is no water in it. Will this stand extreme moisture in the soil or not? Answer: I don't recall any experience that would be comparable to that, where you seed right into a sloughy, moist point. We find that after it once gets a good start, it works pretty well with a reason - able amount of moisture. i •*&gt; Question: Where there is considerable alkali in the soil, will it do well? Answer: I don't know about your alkali land. As far as our al - kali in southern Illinois is concerned, we are on the other end of the balance. It is acidity that we are into down there. Just offhand, ve know that it does do better on lime soil. Next on the program is a talk by Mr. Hoppert on "The Benton Harbor Fruit Market." An illustrated lecture. </seg>
            <seg id="p570">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE COOPERATIVE MARKETING OF FRUIT IN MICHIGAN E. H. HOPPERT Michigan has been an important fruit growing state for more than a half century. Its fruit industry is greatly diversified, producing annually from 4,000 to 10,000 cars of apples; 500 to 1,000 cars of peaches; 600 to 1,000 cars of pears; 3,000 to 6,000 cars of grapes; 20 to 30 million pounds of cherries. It cans annually about 80,000 cases of blackberries, 130,000 cases of raspberries, 90,000 cases of strawberries in addition to the thousands of cases of these fruits sold to the fresh fruit trade. Naturally anyone interested in fruit growing in the middle west will find in Michigan many worthwhile horticultural achievements to investigate and study. The region about Benton Harbor is particularly interesting because of its small-fruit industry. In this region the farms are small and therefore greatly diversified. Canning has been developed quite large - ly because in some years the berries ripen so rapidly that the fresh fruit market cannot absorb the crop. Naturally the marketing of the crop has been one of major problems for years. Back in 1913 I spent the summer working on a fruit farm north of Benton Harbor along Lake Michigan. In those days transportation was largely by boat and by train. The growers would bring in their berries or grapes to buyers along Water Street near the Pere Mar - quette Station. The buyers represented Chicago fruit houses primarily and they knew how to keep prices down so as to permit their firms to make good profits. There was some competition from small tug owners who had fruit stand connections in the lake towns in Wis - consin and Illinois. Then came the truck and the improvement of highways. Buyers came from adjoining states to the south and from inland Illinois and Wisconsin. Competition became keener, and there was congestion of the streets that interfered with regular traffic which worried the city officials. In 1924 the city decided to arrange a public market to permit of the bringing together of buyers and sellers with much more dispatch and to do away with traffic congestion but in a few years the con - gestion was as bad as ever. In 1929 a new city market was estab - lished consisting of 5 acres of ground along the St. Joseph river con - venient for the boats and the trucks. Covered unloading platforms were built along both sides of the area. Buyers rented stalls here at $50 per year. Through the central area auto lanes were established Into which the grower was directed by the gate keeper. For each load brought in, whether it be a few cases or a truck load, the grower pays </seg>
            <seg id="p571">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY a 10 cent fee. As the load comes in and stops in one of the lanes, buyers jump on the running board of the car or on the truck as the case may be, and pries the lid off a crate or two. Then the bidding starts usually at a figure 30 or 40 cents below the final selling price. The various bidders drop out as the price goes up and finally the suc - cessful buyer makes out a slip with the number of crates and the price and the grower unloads his load at the stall indicated on the slip and he is given his check immediately. The city officials in charge of the market see to it that there is fair dealing from both sides. If complaints of unfair practice come to them they decide the case. Sometimes fines are meted out and occasion - ally a buyer or seller is prohibited from doing business in the market for a definite period. Sometimes, too, the offending individual is barred permanently from using the market place. It is surprising^ how rapidly fruit is disposed of at this market. During the course of a single day in the raspberry season 3,000 to 4,000 loads pass through the market. This amount represents from 65 to 75 carloads. The growers from 150 to 200 miles away bring their product here to sell and it is bought by truckers from a radius of 500 miles or more. That means a territory that includes a popula - tion of about 40,000,000 people. Of the total sold here approximately 40% consists of tree fruits, 35% grapes, 10% small fruits, 10% vegetables and 5% melons. The Fennville Fruit Exchange. North of Benton Harbor about 40 miles is another fruit section devoted largely to tree fruits such as apples, peaches, pears, and plums. Until 20 years ago each grower at - jtempted to pack and sell his own fruit. In 1914, 10 of the large pro - ducers organized a cooperative for the purpose of selling their pack. Each grower packed his own crop but the cooperative sold it for him. The results the first year were so satisfactory to the individuals com - prising the cooperative that they raised $6,000. for the building of a packing house. From this beginning the cooperative grew to the point where it owns a large packing house equipped with modern wash - ing, packing and loading equipment and a storage house with capacity of about 100,000 bushels. The organization distributes to its mem - bers spray materials and spray equipment, also fertilizers. At present it consists of 82 members, owning equipment and buildings worth over $50,000. It handles over 500 cars of fruit annually for Its mem - bers, 70% of which consists of apples. 17 to 20% consists of peaches, 10% consists of pears. The grower members feel that the Fruit Exchange has been in - valuable to them since they have had little to worry about during the harvest season. The exchange looks after the packing and marketing </seg>
            <seg id="p572">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE of their crop cheaper and better than they could do it themselves and they can give all of their attention to the growing of higher quality fruit. Another cooperative that we visited on this trip was the one at Travers City which handles a large part of the cherry crop grown in Michigan. Those of you who attended the winter meetings of 1928 will remember that I talked about the cherry industry of Northern Michigan in encouraging and optimistic terms. The story was quite different in 1932. In 1928 the orchards looked the part of prosperity, well kept, foliage healthy and a good crop in prospect. In 1932 the orchards were not so healthy looking. On the poorer soils there were many gaps and sickly trees. The crop was only a third of normal and then selling at ridiculously low prices. The price paid by the cannery was only 1 cent per pound. The reason for this change of affairs is not so much because the co-op was overloaded with fruit. In fact the warehouse rooms were practically empty. The general de - pression and lack of buying power on the part of the general public was responsible. In times of depression the people of the country evidently don't eat much cherry pie or at least the wholesalers felt that they would not, unless the price was very low. To meet this situation the general public was invited to come into the orchards and pick the crop for their own use or to sell if they felt inclined to gamble. The price range here was % to 1 cent on the tree. Some growers had truckers some in and try to sell them on the various markets throughout the state. From this standpoint the northern Michigan section is not so well situated because the haul is a long one and com - petition from sections closer the large markets is quite keen. In the end I presume a large share of the crop was canned as in previous years. We visited this region just as. the sweet cherries were being harvested and before the sour cherry harvest got into full swing. One thing is certain; the cherry orchards will be more or less neglected in the next season or two. The growers will not spend money for fertilizers and cultivation when the crop does not bring cost of production. The last two seasons have been unusually dry which has aggravated the situation especially on these sandy lands. No doubt there will be a decline in production in this region on the marginal lands. Cooperation can not be blamed for the condition of the cherry in - dustry. The chances are the industry would have been in worse shape had there been no cooperative. In Colorado for example, only one canning plant was in operation in 1932 and hundreds of acres of cherries were not harvested. After all supply and demand still operate in determining price of </seg>
            <seg id="p573">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY any commodity. The cooperative is practical and it is suctcssmi where properly managed. Discussion Question. Do they retail there? Answer: This is not a retail market as we ordinarily understand it. One can buy in single crates from some grower whose load was not purchased by the larger buyers. It is largely a wholesale proposi - tion. Question: You spoke about the buyers from Wisconsin, Illinois, etc. Those fellows could get together to fix prices they would pay the growers. Answer: If there were only the regular buyers who represent wholesale houses that would be possible. But there are many inde - pendent buyers who come perhaps once a week. These sell the products to small stores and even to the consumers. It would be impossible to get all of these independent dealers together. This particular market serves about forty million people. Even then the growers don't always get profitable returns on their crops. Then they have these cooper - ative canning companies to fall back on. There is another thing I was particularly interested in. Two years ago a concern started to put up apples as the cherries and other small fruits have been handled for several years previously. I refer to the freezing process. The under grade apples were washed, cored, and sliced and then put into 5 gallon tins. Then these cans are placed in cold storage at 3 below zero until they are frozen solid and then they are stored at temperatures just slightly below freezing. Most of this product is sold to the pie bakers. Question: Are they doing that with strawberries, etc? Answer: Oh, yes. They freeze almost all kinds of fruits now. Cherries are frozen on a large scale up in the Travers Bay country. CHAIRMAN: I would like to make an announcement at this time and also introduce three growers who are visiting us from other fruit producing districts. Mr. Hitz of Forest City, Missouri. Glad you are here, Mr. Hitz. MR. HITZ: I am mighty glad to be here with you. I have had a desire to meet you for several years.

CHAIRMAN: Mr. Charlie Scott of Manhattan, Kansas, Secretary of the Kansas State Horticultural Society. MR. SCOTT: I am going to say the same thing the other fellows said. I am not up here getting acquainted but re-acquainted. I spent seven years in Nebraska and I used to be one of the star attenders at these meetings. I am glad to be with you and I bring you the greet - ings from the Kansas State Horticultural Society. We had our meet - ing at Topeka just a month ago. We are still on deck and we are going to try to pull through with the rest of the investors. CHAIRMAN: The Nebraska Horticultural Society is very glad to have you gentlemen here and I think that the sooner we get together cooperatively on these meetings the better off we are going to be. Mr. Hitz and Mr. Groh and Mr. Scott have a matter of business they would like to take up with a few of the growers immediately following the adjournment of this meeting, and with the permission of the President I will name that committee to meet with these gentle - men: Mr. J. F. Shubert, Grove Porter, L. L. Franklin, Vernon Mar - shal, Mr. Hoppert and myself will meet with you gentlemen immedi - ately in this room after the adjournment of this meeting. Going on with the program I note that Mr. Hoppert has li.sted the subject "The Shubert Cooperative Fruit Growers Association" with me to do the talking. When I was invited to attend this meeting and talk on this subject, I felt honored, and I know the management and directors of our association felt it quite an honor, because we know that in presenting these programs they try to have men come before you that have been a success in their line of business, and we really didn't think we had been that much of a success. Nevertheless, we have an organization of that kind down there this year and feel we have accomplished something t so we deem it quite an honor to come up and tell you about it. Discussion Question: Did you keep a separate sheet for each grower? Answer: Each grower had his individual ledger sheet for each variety. Sometimes there would be Jonathon and Grimes on one of these slips. It would be a mixed load. The bookkeeper would list on Sheet so many boxes of Grimes. Then he would go to the Jonathon page and make the proper entry for that variety. Question: The apples were brought in barrels from the orchard? Answer: Some were brought in barrels and some in boxes. </seg>
            <seg id="p575">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Question: Were the apples pooled before the grading was done? Answer: The apples were pooled after the grading. The apples were put through the washing and grading machine and put with the variety to which they belonged, and were packed according to what was being packed at that time. We had some orchards this year that had some hail, some that showed scab. It would be a mistake to make No. l's out of that. We made a special pack and called it S &amp; H Pack. Question: How many grades do you maintain? Answer: We packed about four grades. Where we had extra fancy fruit, we made fancy baskets and boxes. Then we packed a combination pack that included No. l's, fancy, and good 2's. Question: Did you allow the growers to bring in cider apples? Answer: Yes. Some brought them just as they were picked from the trees and others brought them picked up from the ground. They were run over a scale and the grower was given credit. Question: What charges did you make? Answer: There was a 5c charge for the use of the building and equipment and then the packing cost was figured on bushel boxes as received because that was the only fair way we could figure it. Some men's apples required more grading possibly than others but it was all figured on the average. Question: Do you have much trouble reporting shortages; that is, number of field crates delivered not comparing with the number of bushels? Answer: We had only one case of that and we later discovered that the truck driver drove by his house and put off a few bushels which he failed to report. One thing we were very particular about was in making notations. When Mr. Franklin received a load of apples where the boxes weren't full, he made a notation to that effect, or any information that might cause an argument later. We had some growers that brought in barrels. Notation was made if they weren't full. It was very easy by making these notations to discourage any arguments. Question: What per cent of your members this year have signed up for another year? Answer: We have never had a meeting to ask them but I don't know of a one but who is willing to carry on. We have had wonderful cooperation between the growers. Everyone seems to be satisfied. </seg>
            <seg id="p576">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Some of the apples didn't pool as we should have liked them to, but under the market conditions we had this fall, we couldn't do any better. But I will say this: We got a higher price for our No. 2 apples this year than we ever had in the history of our industry. Our combination pack pooled $1.19 and out "C" grade, or what we call a cull-grade apple, paid the grower 40c a bushel without any package charge added. Question: What did you get for No. l's? Answer: We didn't pack enough No. l's to make a price. We picked a few fancy boxes and they haven't been pooled. Question: Did any of the growers sell apples directly out of the orchard? Answer: We only had two cases of where the grower sold apples at his orchard. That was Mr. Smith at Salem whose fruit wasn't very good and he said he thought he could move that grade in his own com - munity and we allowed him to do that. Also one block of apples in the Weaver &amp; Towle orchards at Falls City. They put them out down there but all the rest of the growers brought their fruit into the house. Question: Some of these apples were hauled a long distance to your market. Did you notice any difference as to their condition — bruises etc.? Answer: No, we diiin't. We had a truck that could haul 180 bushels at one time. There wasn't any noticeable difference in the condition of apples hauled long or short distances. Question: How are you going to control cutthroat competition outside of your own state? Answer: By cooperating with other fruit districts. That is just what we want to do and I think we are on the right track. I believe our visitors will tell you that that is going to be our only salvation. Question: What is the mileage from Shubert to St. Joe? Answer: About 85 miles. Question: How can the railroad cut rates? Aren't they under the Railway Commission. Answer: They get emergency permission. We are mighty glad to see them do it rather than to load into trucks, because we know that when fruit reaches its shipping point it's going to be in good shape. If there is any damage, the railroad will take care of it. If anything happens to a truck shipment there is a question if any settlement will be made. </seg>
            <seg id="p577">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Question: About how many bushels do you handle? Answer: We handled about 55,000 bushels this year. We have been able to sell all the fruit and pool everything out except two varieties: the Virginia Beauty and Fancy Box Winesaps. We stored 7,000 bushels of apples this year and we only have on hand less than 1.000 Virginia Beauties and about 95 boxes of Winesaps. Question: What is your best seller? Answer: Jonathon and WineSap Question: How is the Delicious? Answer: Not so good. In this territory they are not worth any more than the Jonathon or Winesap. Question: Are you using box packs throughout? Answer: No, we used very few boxes this year — mostly baskets. We only bought 1,000 boxes this year and didn't use quite half of them, because it was a new package in our trade territory and we didn't know what would happen to it. However, I will say that we packed some of the fancy and some of the combination in boxes and the box pack sold from 35 to 40c a bushel higher than the basket and the packing cost this year we figured at 5c a bushel higher than the actual packing cost of the basket pack. Question: What does your package cost? Answer: The box and the paper in the box figured 20c. Question: Do you wrap the apples in baskets? Answer: No, the basket apples were not wrapped. However, we used shredded oiled paper in the baskets which added to the appear - ance and, in some cases, meant 5 to 10c a bushel more on our selling price. These were paper lined and had paper caps on top. SPRAY TESTS FOR CONTROL OF CHERRY LEAF SPOT R. W. GOSS During the past two years spray experiments have been continued in cooperation with the Horticultural Department in the cherry or - chard supplied by the Otoe Food Products Company at Nebraska City. The orchard comprising both Montmorencys and Early Rich - monds consists of 36 rows of 22 trees each. Each variety was divided into spray blocks of 5 or 6 rows each, and in one spray block of each variety the first spray was omitted, in another the 4th spray was omitted, and the other block received all 4 sprays. Two unsprayed check trees were left in each spray block by covering them during </seg>
            <seg id="p578">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE spray operations. The progress of the disease was determined by counts of infected leaves on marked branches at intervals of about three weeks and records of defoliation were obtained from the same b'Tanches. From 500 to 1000 leaves were thus examined and infection recorded in each spray block of each variety about six times during the summer. 1031 Results: — Leaf spot was not severe in this year. The first spray was applied May 12 following a week of rainy weather during which infection had probably occurred. As a result of this early infection which produced leaf spots on about 20 per cent of the leaves by May 19, the omission of the 1st spray did not affect the percentage Qf disease, and there was as much leaf spot on the sprayed trees as; on the checks. Following this very early infection the weather was unfavorable until the middle of June and the percentage of disease remained about the same. There were rainy periods with opportunity for infection occurring in late May, the middle of June, the tirst of July, and in early August. The effect of the omission of the 4th spray was evident on Montmorency but not on Early Richmond where the amount of infection was much less. On Montmorency on July 14 the block in which the 4th spray was omitted showed as much in - fection as the unsprayed checks while the sprayed blocks showed only 35 per cent infection as much as the unsprayed trees in the same block. On August 10 the percentage of infection, as compared with corresponding checks, was S2 per cent with the 4th spray omitted and 35 per cent for the sprayed. This difference due to the 4th spray was eliminated by additional infection in August so that by the middle of September there was no difference in the various spray blocks but all the spray blocks had much less infection and defoliation than the unsprayed controls (see Table 1). 1932 Results: — Leaf spot infection was much heavier in 1932 than in the previous year. Conditions were not favorable for early infection and there was little effect of omitting the 1st spray on Montmorency. On Early Richmond due to a greater amount of ex - posure to infection, which will be discussed later, there was a marked effect of omitting this spray resulting in as much leaf spot as the un - sprayed checks, while the sprayed trees showed only 37 per cent as much as the checks. This difference due to omitting the 1st spray had disappeared by the middle of June when all the spray blocks had about the same percentage of infection. The July infection oc - curred just before the 4th spray so that the omission of this spray did not cause any difference. Conditions were again ideal for the spread of the disease about the middle of August and this late infection caused a high percentage of disease and severe defoliation on both sprayed and unsprayed trees but the sprayed trees had less infection (Table 1). The defoliation of Sept. 17 in the sprayed trees as shown </seg>
            <seg id="p579">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY in the table is greater than that of the checks due to the fact that the unsprayed trees had lost a large proportion of their leaves by the middle of August. Discussion — In 1932 it was found that the Early Richmond was more severely infected early in the season than the Montmorency and that the effect of the omisison of the 1st spray was therefore more evi - dent. This was surprising as this variety is generally conceded to bo more resistant than the Montmorency. An examination of the orchard disclosed the reason for this infection. Many root sprouts had been allowed to develop in the Early Richmond block, these sprouts being 1 to 4 feet in height had become severely infected, probably due to the fact that the leaves were nearer to the source of primary infection - — the overwintering organism in leaves on the ground. The infected leaves on these sprouts (that had not been sprayed), were producing spores in abundance and being directly under the trees they served somewhat as a ladder by which the organism in the dead overwintered leaves could more easily reach the trees. It was evident that effective control of the disease necessitates the removal or the careful spraying of such sprouts. In general these tests have shown good control by the use of lime - sulphur sprays and in both years the second spray appeared to be the most important as indicated by the fact that the omission of the 1st or 4th spray did not have any appreciable or lasting effect upon the percentage of infection and the late application of the 3rd spray in 1932 on Early Richmond did not affect the percentage of disease. It was also evident that severe infection and defoliation may occur even with all four sprays, due to infection during August. An addi - tional spray would be necessary to control this late infection or it may be possible to apply the same number of sprays less frequently. Further tests will be needed to decide the best means and the value of controlling this late season infection which resulted in such severe defoliation. </seg>

We have to use that material because Bordeaux, although it is a little better in some ways has a tendency to prevent proper development of the fruit, It drops around the stem and then as the Copper Sulphate goes back into solution it kills that tissue there and prevents the cherry from developing. Our regular spray schedule calls for a spray after the petals have fallen; the second, 10 days after that; and the third, 10 days after that. Now after we get through harvesting the crop, we generally put on at least one spray. This year we should have put on two sprays because a heavy infection took place the latter part of July and by that time practically all of the spray material from the previous application was used up. </seg>
            <seg id="p581">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Question: Would it be all right to use Bordeaux lor the last sprayT Answer: Yes. I don't know as there Is very much danger of Lime Sulphur burning the leaves. We haven't found any. That might not be so true in a section like Mr. Bierbaum comes from be - cause the humidity is so much higher there. I think that it would probably be a little better to use Bordeaux after the fruit has been harvested, because Bordeaux will not change by contact with the air quite like Lime Sulphur does. Lime Sulphur is effective for only about two weeks at the most in hot weather. Then you would have to spray again, even though you had no moisture. Whereas with the Bordeaux, if you had no rainfall, you would have no reason for putting on any more spray because it would stay there and not deteriorate ap - preciably. Question: How many sprays are necessary for Shot Hole Fun - gus? Answer: About four. I think no one ought to try to grow cher - ries without putting that many sprays on. That is in eastern Nebraska. As you go farther west there is no need for so many. Probably three would suffice. j Question: Where cherries are used as fillers between apples, it quite often happens that you have to spray cherry trees and use a strong solution of liquid Lime Sulphur, about twice as strong as is used for apples. If it is windy the spray blows over on the apples no matter how one tries to keep this from happening. Is there danger o injuring the apples in such instances. Answer: If it is windy and dry the spray material dries rapidly and the danger of burning apple foliage and fruit is very slight. Lime Sulfur burns much more readily in humid weather. Question: What should you spray peach trees with? Answer: The first spray is a spray composed of Lime Sulphur, about two gallons to 50, just before the leaves break out. That is a spray to control Peach Leaf Curl. Then we use Lead Arsenate, general - ly at the rate of % of a pound together with two pounds of hydrated Lime to 50 gallons of water about twice the first time Just after the shucks' drop off, and again in about 10 days. But just before they ripen, (about three weeks to a month), if the weather is humid and muggy, Brown Rot spreads (softening of the peach). Then we have to use some sort of a fungicide that will control that disease, self boiled Lime Sulfur, dry mix Sulfur lime may be sprayed on or you can use a dust of Sulphur which is very effective. Any Sulphur compound is effective against Brown Rot. Flotation Sulphur and Dritomic Sul - phur are good. For Brown Rot on plums the same things are ef - fective. Brown Rot was very bad on both plums and peaches last year and one timely spray did a lot of good. </seg>
            <seg id="p582">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE THURSDAY MORNING SESSION January 5 — 9:30 A. M. Room 106, Plant Industry Building The meeting -was called to order by Chairman Grove Porter of Nebraska City. MR. PORTER: The meeting will come to order, please. The subject this morning is "Spraying and Spraying Costs." Spraying, as you know, is quite an expensive operation at best and it behooves us all to cut costs wherever we can, so we want to discuss "Can We Re - duce Spraying Costs with Safety?" The first speaker will be Mr. Loy Franklin of Palls City who will discuss "Buying Spray Materials Cooperatively." BUYING SPRAY MATERIAL COOPERATIVELY By LOY FRANKLIN It seems to me that this is a subject which needs very little ex - planation, however I will try and give some of the history of the first movement in buying spray material cooperatively in Nebraska. On January 2, 1913 a meeting was called at Auburn, Nebraska by some of the fruit growers, and a committee of fifteen was named to solicit members for the organization of a fruit growers association. A meeting was held later the same year at Nebraska City, where the Southeastern Nebraska Fruit Growers Association was organized. This organization's name later was changed to The Central Fruit Growers Association, in order that several fruit growers of western Iowa might join the association. At the meeting in Nebraska City in the spring of 1914, representatives from several spray material com - panies were present and made bids on the season's requirement of spray material for the members of the association. If I remember correctly the price made by the different companies' representatives, at this meeting was 4c a pound less than the price made by the same companies to the growers individually, j - The Central Fruit Growers Association was of great benefit and did the growers a lot of good for years, but gradually the interest was reduced, due to some of the orchards passing out of heavy production. | On April 2, 1930 a meeting of the fruit growers of Shubert and vicinity met and formed an association known as The Fruit Growers Association of Shubert, Nebraska. This organization has been very active in its working program and has aided the members to get much better price-quotations and dating on their spray material require - ments. </seg>
            <seg id="p583">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Last year at the March 11th meeting of the association, the rep - resentatives from nine different chemical or insecticide manufacturing companies made bids on the season's requirements of spray material and fertilizer supplies for the association members. The price this year was not so much lower than the price made to individual growers in the same territory, but we feel that the price made to the asso - ciation had a great deal to do with establishing the price that was made to the individuals In this territory, and should be given credit lor reducing the price generally. In Kansas in the section around Troy and Wathena, the price as reported to me was 2c per pound above the price we paid for lead arsenate. The chemical manufacturers and jobbers seem to be anxious to get the business placed with associations or coooperatives and thus eliminate the extra work of making a number of separate orders to individual growers, and it makes it very convenient and economical to the growers to have the spray orders come in car-load lots. We have found that in The Fruit Growers Association of Shubert the different companies were anxious to get the business and were Very courteous in their dealings with us, and we believe that it is greatly to the interest of the growers to work together and buy our fjpray materials and all other supplies that are needed in the fruit 1 usiness, cooperatively. ' Discussion. 11R. HOPPERT: I think it would be well for Mr. Franklin to ex - plain how a person may belong to this organization. CHAIRMAN: There are a great many here from different parts of the state that could really benefit by buying their spray materials through an association or at least get the benefit of association prices. Of course, in order to do that, their credit will have to be O. K. and i . will really be necessary for them to be affiliated with the association. MR. FRANKIN: About all there is to that is that you have to be a grower of fruit. You have to express a desire to belong and then you have to pay down a couple of dollars. That makes you a member. Of course, to get these datings you have to be O. K. and have to have at least some rating. MR. BAKER: I might add a word. Our Secretary asked each grower to submit his requirements. These requirements were pooled and the sheet, showing each growers's name and the material that would be required by him, was submitted to all of the insecticide people, so they knew before they came to the meeting just what grow- </seg>
            <seg id="p584">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE er iney were going to deal with and how much material he would use, and then submitted a price on the volume of pounds. Also I might add that no one had the advantage of these prices unless he was a member of the association. The committee in charge put out a letter to all the growers and members of the association, telling them just what prices they would charge for this material to a non-member, and that price was worked out in line with the prices quoted by the insecticide people. In some cases it ran from 2% to 5c a pound higher than the prices to the association. On liquid Lime Sulphur the price was from 5 to 10c a gallon higher, because we thought the insecticide people were making a special price to the asso - ciation and we felt that we should be in line with them in selling to non-members. CHAIRMAN: Is there anything further on this insecticide prop - osition? I might tell one on Mr. Lord. Mr. Lord has been in the orchard business for eight or ten years but his brother, Tom, has been operat - ing it for quite a few years. His automible business was good and he wasn't paying a great deal of attention to his orchard. He started taking an interest in it. The first year he figured he didn't know much about buying his spray supplies. The second year when he came to the meeting he knew what he wanted to do and what he wanted to buy. The third year he decided he knew just exactly what he was going to do. He was going to use such and such material for the first spray etc. We had quite a meeting at Nebraska City and there were eight or ten insecticide men there. They would tell of the merits of their materials and why they should be used in preference to some other material. Then Mr. Lord spoke up and told his experiences of those three years and after it was all over he said, "I thot I had learned a lot about spraying in those three years but after listening to these salesmen I don't know what to do and I will have to start all over again." They have assigned me a subject that is going to get me into a lot of trouble, I know. I don't know whether I am qualified to talk about it because it seems to us it takes us plenty of time and costs a great deal to spray, but my good friend Hoppert has put me on the spot, bo I will go ahead and tell you what our idea is at Nebraska City, and then you can go your limit. TIME-SAVING METHODS OF SPRAYING By GROVE M. PORTER Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: Orchard spraying can be — and is — done in a number of ways. </seg>
            <seg id="p585">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Many methods are effective, and it cannot be said that any one memoa is best. Doubtless, good results can be secured from most of them. The one selected will depend upon soil type, topography, tree type and water supply. Observation leads to the belief that soms spray methods are dis - tinctly superior to others from the standpoint of insect and disease control, or economy of time and labor, or both. In the Morton Orchards we have approximately 300 acres of apple orchard — average age, 11 years. For the past two years it has taken us on an average of 8 days to spray this orchard. Our equipment con - sists of 3 power sprayers with 250-gallon tanks and pump capacity of 16 gallons. We use a water supply outfit with 300-gallon tank and rotary pump of 60-gallon per minute capacity, mounted on a Chev - rolet truck. Water is hauled to each sprayer, and the only time lost by the crew spraying is when the tank is being filled. We find that | the rate of coverage is practically doubled when a supply tank is used to haul water direct to the sprayers. It is most economical, in spraying trees up to 12 years of age, to use 2 men with spray rods and 3-nozzle broom heads — spraying from the ground, each man taking one side of the row. On trees 12 years old and over, we use one man with a rod and 4-nozzle broom head. (A careful man can use a 6-nozzle broom head to good advantage. This man sprays one side of the tree row at a time, getting the entire row before moving on to the next.) We found that one man spraying from the tank could do just as efficient work as two men, one on the tank and one spraying from the ground. There was much less duplication and wastage of material. Last season, when we were using heavy lime sulphur sprays in an effort to control scab, most of our burning was about half way up the side of the tree, where, evidently, the man on the tower and the ground man overlapped their sprays. Labor is apparently the most expensive item in spraying. There - fore, anything that can be done to lessen the man hours required for proper spraying of an orchard is probably the best way to cut this cost. The amount of spraying to be done and the pressure to be main - tained are the most important factors to be taken into consideration when choosing the type of spraying equipment a grower must have. If it requires more than 6 days to spray an orchard thoroughly, the number of spray machines is inadequate, or the capacity is too small for proper economy and efficiency in pest control. </seg>
            <seg id="p586">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE A summary of our experiences and of Information that I have gathered from bulletins on this subject, is as follows: 1. Good commercial control of pests can be obtained by any of the commonly-employed methods of making spray applications, if rea - sonable care is taken to effect thorough and timely coverage. 2. With one man operating from the top of the sprayer tank, there is a considerable saving in time and materials, as compared with two men working together. 3. As operating pressures are increased from 200 to S00 pounds there is naturally a relatively greater use of the fine adjustment of the gun. The time required thoroughly to cover the tree decreases some - what. With increases in pressure up to 5 Op pounds there was- a tendency to apply more spray material to the tree, but as the pres - sure was increased above that point there was) a tendency to use less. 4. The advantages accruing from the use jof very high pressures, above 400 or 500 pounds, do not offset their disadvantages. Taking all things into consideration, a range of 3 00-400 pounds appears to be most satisfactory. 5. Heavily pruned trees require slightly less spray material than lightly pruned or unpruned trees, but with modern spraying equip - ment operated at usual pressures, good coverage is obtained more or less, regardless of the amount of thinning out of the top, and pest control is not materially promoted by such pruning. 6. No significant differences in pest control or spray injury were found between blocks sprayed during the day and those sprayed at night. Resort to night spraying at critical times or to enable a more timely application is therefore recommended. 7. Dusting was found to be between two and three times as rapid as spraying, and in the tests here reported, gave control of pests essentially the same as those obtained by spraying. However, the cost was somewhat less, due to the higher cost of materials, being offset by one-fourth less labor. 8. It was found that where the water supply was a considerable distance from the orchard, the rate of coverage could be nearly doubled by providing a supply tank to haul water. Furthermore, this was accompanied by a decrease rather than an increase in the cost of ap - plication per tree. Discussion Question: Can one supply wagon keep three operators going? Answer: In the morning when they start out, after the first load </seg>
            <seg id="p587">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 1b off, one -water supply wagon for three machines with a good man on it, who really wants to keep them going, can take care of it nicely. We generally divide the orchard into sections. We use a 4-inch pipe from our supply tank. It is something on the order of the way they fill the boiler on a railroad engine. The 60-gallon rotary pump de - livers the material from the supply truck into the machine very fast. Question: Do you use a pump on the truck? Answer: We have an engine and a pump on the truck. A year ago we used a tractor but the truck is much more satisfactory and we didn't. have a great deal of trouble getting around in the orchard. Question: What does this truck hold? Answer: Three hundred gallons. The truck is a second-hand Chevrolet truck and could probably handle more than that. MR. HOPPERT: There is another point, Mr. Porter that should be stressed more. I thing the common system of spraying is for two men to be on the ground. You can save time by putting these two men on the tank and then spray half of the tree row. Experiments carried on in Michigan showed that it made very little difference in the con - trol of pests whether you sprayed from the tank or from the ground, but there is a considerable saving in time. If any of you don't believe t,hat, perhaps you had better try it out. It gets tiresome dragging hoses around.. I think we can cut the spraying time one-third by putt - ing two men on the tank and having them spray only the inside half of the trees as they go through. So I think we can cut out one man ■without any difficulty at all. I would like to hear a discussion of this matter. I know we are all interested in cutting down these costs. Question: Take a good sized tree from fifteen years old up. Can ; man on the tank get it sprayed on the inside? Answer: With the higher pressures that are possible with the mod - ern spray outfit the spray will get in there in very good shape. Question: I am a little bit doubtful if the fruit and foliage on the Inside of the tree will be covered as well by this method as can be done from the ground especially if the operator starts from the inside near the trunk and sprays out and up. Answer: They worked this out in Michigan on big trees and also on smaller trees. Some trees were forty years old. It was found they could do just as good a job, with the man on the tank as when he was on the ground, so I think you are going to change your mind about that. I think with these newer outfits that you can do just as good a job spraying from the tanks. The records at harvest time showed very little difference in the quality of fruit as far as insect and fungus </seg>
            <seg id="p588">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE damage was concerned. Some folks spray on the windy side one day and wait for the wind to change before they spray on the other side. We sometimes have a week's period when the wind is in the same direc - tion all the time, so if you waited for the wind to change, you might lose the effect of that particular spray. Question: What length of rod would you recommend for spray- Ing? Answer: That would depend on the size of the trees. You don't need a very long rod where high pressures are used except when there is a strong wind. HOPPERT: You wouldn't recommend riding the tank for twelve year old trees? Answer: Yes. You would save a lot of time that these fellows waste in walking and dragging hose. That is one thing you can't very well talk about — ages of trees — because on certain ground a certain variety of twelve year old tree is entirely different from a twelve year old tree in another orchard or another variety, but where a tree is about 25 to 30 feet high and with a spread of that, in our case particularly, it has proved out to be less expensive to have one man on the tank to do the spraying. Question: Do you take one row at a time? Answer: We take one side of a row and usually we ro right around that row. Sometimes we go down one row and back another. That would give the spray material time to dry and there might be some overlapping. Bob Clark, over near Des Moines, is considered one of the best growers in Iowa and is a man really making money in the apple business. He does all his spraying from the top of his machine. using a double nozzle gun. There are a number of cases where they use this double gun and it apparently works out in good shape. Ernie gave me a lot of data and bulletins and in most sections they approve of spraying from the top of the tank, not from the tower. Question: We spray that way on our old orchards but in our young plantings we find by taking a 50 foot hose and using a half inch hose and giving four nozzle broom and 300 pounds pressure that the spray material wagon can just move right along. Answer: We have a lot of orchards like that, but it all depends on the size of the trees. Where a man can go along and spray from the ground, we have had two men go right down the rows, but when trees get larger, we have found that it is more economical to have one man on the tower and handle it that way. It all depends, too, on the man. I remember years ago in your outfits Kruse as a general rule worked alone. Well, that is a system that on larger trees works </seg>
            <seg id="p589">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Dut best for us and I think It would be well to try the two men on the machine because It has worked out very satisfactorily in a good many localities. I am sorry that Mr. Hitz was out too late to get here this morn- Ing, but Harry, we are talking about reducing costs of spraying and different methods of spraying. What do you use in your orchards? Do you have two men to a sprayer or what system do you use? MR. HITZ: As I said last night, I have enjoyed being here be - cause your problems are somewhat ours. I think probably George Groh could take up this matter better than I could take up this matter better than I could for you, because I installed a stationery plant about three years ago and since then I have forgotten how to handle a movable outfit. I still have one portable rig that we use for emergency cases. In fact, there is a portion of one 20-acre orchard that we don't reach with our stationery. Our instructions are to spray three-fourths of the tree from the inside out but our problems are a little different from your because our orchards are old, established orchards. Your trees up here are mostly young, so if you can get some good front our experiences why that is all well and good, but it would be pretty - hard for me to indicate how you should spray. • CHAIRMAN: Well, of course, yours and Mr. Groh's conditions are quite different because of your large trees. And, of course, your hav - ing a stationery plant would let you out of the argument. MR. GROH: My problem is different than Harry's and different than yours. Our trees are forty to fifty years old and we use guns. One man on the ground sprays underneath. In our younger orchards, eighteen to nineteen years old, we use brooms, but we still let the man on the ground use a gun to get under the trees. Our conditions are different altogether than for the orchards you have in Nebraska. I don't believe on older trees you could do a good job of spraying with one man on the tank. Answer: I think we have all come to the conclusion that a spray rig doesn't last forever. I have a brother using a liquid duster that he didn't think much of for a year or so. His trees are fourten years old and he got the best job of spraying I think I ever saw done by" spraying with a liquid duster against the wind. I don't believe it will be a success on tall thirty-foot trees. MR. HOPPERT: The thing I want to bring out is that some of our old ideas about spraying from the inside out may not be as im - portant with the present type of spray guns and spray brooms. In Michigan they tried this very system on old trees twenty-five feet high and they found that the quality of the fruit was no better in com- </seg>
            <seg id="p590">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE parison than where the man rode on the tank, spraying both inside and out. The trees that they mention were thirty-five feet across and they tried different methods such as we are using on older trees. They examined the fruit from those various plats and found very little difference in quality. You save more material where you use one man on the tank because he knows where he's been. The trouble, just as Grove says, is you can see that line where there was an overlapping of the spray material. That is one difficulty where you have two men working on the same tree. Of course, there wouldn't be so much overlapping where you had big trees but you are apt to get burning where you have that situation. I, for one, am going to try this other method, because the spraying expense is plenty high, and if we can save one man and make the job easier for the other two by not hav - ing to walk through the weeds and grass pulling heavy hose, it stands to reason that they are going to bo able to do it more easily and more quickly. Question: When you spray from the tank, what size hose do you use? Answer: Fifteen or twenty feet of hose either one-half inch or five-eighths inch in diameter. Question: What do you claim caused the burn on those trees? Answer: Strength of material. Weather conditions. MR. BAKER: We found in our orchards that any burning we had was due more to pressure than it was to strength of material. Answer: Perhaps it was. The burning we got was because of the extremely hot weather and probably too strong a mixture. Sulphur sprays will burn, as you know, two or three days after drying as badly as they will the day that you apply them. Question: I don't agree with you there. The burning takes place before it dries in the case of lime sulphur. When the spray material dries very slowly (as- is the case in muggy weather) the burning is much more severe than under dry windy conditions. J. F. SHUBERT: It seems very evident to me that whatever ques - tion comes up that there are just about as many different opinions as there are men who speak. Now you take this spraying proposi - tion. I think we could discuss it all day. Each individual has his own peculiar methods which he wants to use. The condition of the wind ■ and whether or not the trees have been thinned out also enter in. So after all, we have to take our own individual conditions into consid - eration before we know just exactly what method we should use. Of course, I think that the most important question that you have on </seg>
            <seg id="p591">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY this discussion this morning is to go back to the original one and that is: What can you do to save some money in this spraying? Some of you think that you should have this high pressure. So do I. I think one of the main things is to have high pressure and have noz - zles fine enough so that you can throw a fine spray. Our experience in spraying is that if you can put the spray on as a fine mist, you can cover quite a good deal more foliage with a tank load of spray than you can if it is put on coarse. I also believe you will get better coverage and it will burn less. I think to use the large tank and have good pressure and put this spray on in the form of a fog is good. And then, above all, what you should do is to buy your spray material at the lowest possible figure and keep your wages down. In that way you will save quite a little in your spraying costs. After all, we have our own individual opinions but let's get together on reduced cost oC spraying material, reduced cost of labor and using larger machines. Question: Another angle affects costs and that is the amount of material applied per tree. I would be interested in hearing that dis - cussed. ; MR. G. SHUBERT: I think that J. P. and the rest of you about stole my thunder. I didn't have anything prepared but a few notes, but I think you are overlooking the best yet. The points brought out are very good. We all have pretty much the same spraying conditions. We all have different ideas about our equipment, what we should use — guns, etc. But I think the main thing is to be thorough and we all arrive at about the same conclusion. We differ on pressure, the num - ber of men and every other thing, but we all try to be thorough. Of course, the purchasing of material and equipment has been discussed. I think the proper timing of our spray is the most important thing, and that is where the Codling Moth situation comes in — not only Codl - ing Moth but Apple Scab. I feel sure our spraying costs were as high as anyone else's this past year. We had one block down there that cost 12c a bushel to spray. That almost knocks a man off the Christmas tree. The crop was very light. It was a 40-acre block. I don't re - call how many times we sprayed it, I think three times. The third time we only sprayed where the apples were. We didn't have any apples there and the cost per bushel box mounted up. Last year we had one block that cost 3c per bushel box and that is the cheapest we had last year. In '31 our spraying material costs were reduced considerably. I believe if we watch the timing of our spray more carefully that would be the big saving. We were able, by carefully studying the Codling Moth situation and keeping in touch with the boys here at Lincoln, to leave off some sprays. j This can be illustrated by relating the experience we had with </seg>
            <seg id="p592">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE one of our orchards we call the King 120, which belongs to the Shu - bert Orchard Company. The crop was very light, some 3000 bushels scattered around over 120 acres, the trees running from 14 to 16 years of age. In our three regular traps in that orchard, we were able to find only a few Codling Moths. Rather than to spray that orchard, we put twelve traps in that orchard, left them a number of days, and figured' out that we didn't think it would be advisable to put any more spray on that. We did put on some spray for Frog Eye but didn't use any lead in our followup spray after the petal-fall spray. The proper timing, keeping in close touch with the Extension De - partment, and bait traps in our orchards will help us all. The con - ditions don't vary a lot but they do a little. I have noticed that usually there Is a day or twos difference between Shubert and Lincoln, Ne - braska City and Lincoln, and so on down the line.

            <seg id="p593">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY I have a graph here that I would be glad to have those of you who are interested, look over and study. We had traps set on May 1. On this we had the Codling Moth, Rainfall, High and Low Humidity and High and Low Temperatures. It is interesting to note the effect rain - fall and humidity have upon the Codling Moth. It is very marked. MR. HOPPERT: Tell them a little of the saving that was made by reason of your knowledge of when these Codling Moths were com - ing out. Answer: We feel that this year the way the crop was, by care - fully studying the Codling Moth situation in particular, that we effect - ed a saving of several hundred dollars. Do you want me to go into it more than that? MR. HOPPERT: Just enough to show this service is of great benefit to the fruit growers. We just used to shoot and hope the bug was there. Answer: We have been setting bait traps at Shubert for the last five or six years. I still want to impress upon you that I believe we all should have a few bait traps in every orchard of any size at all. I think it is the best investment we can make and it doesn't cost very much. It is not hard to do. Our bait traps are inexpensive, easily put up and easily 'taken care of. Almost any of you should know what a Codling Moth is. I think any man owning an orchard should be able to do that. Perhaps some of them wouldn't be able to go into the life cycle of the Codling Moth and figure that out. MR. BAKER: We thought enough of it in our organization to hire a man this year whose duty it was to run the bait traps. He would look at these traps every morning and change the bait when necessary, keeping an accurate record on every trap. And as Guy mentioned, we found if we didn't catch any Moths in these traps in a certain orchard, we left out the lead, because there wasn't any use of putting lead on if we didn't have any worms to kill. Where or - chards showed a heavy infestation of the Moth, we thought it best to add an extra half pound so we would have plenty of lead. I think that if you would study this graph, you would see that it is very thorough. It is surprising to see how temperature and rainfall affect the Moth. CHAIRMAN: I think there is another angle to this timing business and that is the increased efficiency of your spraying. We have talked about omitting the lead arsenate from some applications when it would have done little good because of the scarcity of moths. The most im - portant angle tho is to get our lead arsonate sprays on when they will do the most good. Moth traps if properly handled will give us this in- </seg>

Our next speaker will discuss these mat - ters. "Studying the Flight of the Codling Moi:h with Bait Traps," by J. Clark Gollehon. STUDYING THE FLIGHT OF THE CODLING MOTH WITH BAIT TRAPS Codling moth control is and has long been recognized as a major problem to apple growers where ever apples are grown in this country. And since this problem is recognized as a major one it is only logical that ways and means of improving this moth control should be sought after. It is for this purpose, improving codling moth control methods, that the use of the bait trap has come into use. Why the Bait Trap? Thus far the bait trap is the simplest, most accurate, most eco - nomical and most practical method for the apple grower under ordi - nary orchard conditions to determine when the cover sprays should be applied in order that the utmost efficiency may be obtained. The time to apply the cover sprays wjll be just following the peak of greatest moth activity for each brood. Various experimental data show that egg laying takes place rela - tively soon (about..two days) after the emergence of the female moths. Windy or rainy weather immediately following the emergence of the moths will however retard the activity or flight of the moths and egg laying will consequently be delayed for a! time depending upon the duration of this windy or rainy weather. Determining the Peak of Greatest M &gt;tli Activity. The peak of moth activity is determined from the number of moths caught in the traps daily. The number of moths caught each night will vary but usually a decided rise in the number caught will be noticeable for one or two nights followed by a steady dropping off in numbers of moths caught for that particular brood. Here also weather conditions may cause a variation especially in the emergence of the moths of the spring brood. A few warm days may cause the emergence of moths to be well under way and then If a chilly or cold day should: follow the emergence of moths may drop to zero and then resume with a resumption of warmer weather. By recording each days catch of moths in the form of a graph these peaks are readily decernable. The curve may vary up and down </seg>
            <seg id="p595">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY slightly for several days and the following day a much larger catch may be made which when graphed causes the curve to soar proportionately. If this large catch of moths is followed by a steadily dwindling Dumber of moths caught each day it may readily be decided that the peak of activity for that particular brood has been reached unless it has been followed by a day or two of cool weather which may cause the curve to drop suddenly and then soar upward again with the return of warmer weather. Construction of Traps. Traps may be made from most any open top container. An enameled pan with a bail and of about one half gallon in size will serve very well and has an advantage in that no adverse chemical action will be set up while the bait is in it due to contact with unpro - tected metal. However a No. 10 gallon size) preserving can will serve just as well but it should be lacquered or enameled before using to prevent adverse chemical reaction taking place. A handle will be necessary with which to suspend the can and bait in the tree. For this purpose about 18 inches of No. 9 or No. 12 gal - vanized wire will serve very well. Fasten the ends of the wire Into holes punched in opposite sides of the can. An eye may be twisted into the center of the handle in which to tie the rope for raising and lowering the pails for examination. Twenty-five or thirty feet of clothes line rope or sash cord (depending upon the size of the tree) and a couple of awning pulleys serve very well for raising and lowering the traps. The pulleys are preferable to screw eyes or metal rings, which are some times used j thru which to pass the rope as they do not fray the rope so steadily. The ropes will last much longer if they are waxed or dipped into melted paraffin before use. A quarter-inch mesh screen cover for each trap is very desireable as it excludes many of the larger insects and keeps the birds out of the bait. A varied number of different species of moths other than the codling moth will be caught in these traps but little difficulty will be had in recognizing the codling moths after they have once been pointed out. Preparation of Bait. The commonly used bait is composed of the following ingredients: Blackstrap molasses 1 part Water ~ 9 parts Yeast (per trap) _ % cake </seg>
            <seg id="p596">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I rt d l *J a a .

            <seg id="p597">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Mix the molasses and water, fill each trap about % full 01 mis solution and to each trap add % cake of yeast. This mixture attracts many moths while undergoing alcoholic fermentation. When this characteristic odor of fermentation is replaced by a sour smell due to later decomposition it is well to replenish the trap with fresh bait as this sour odor fails to attract the moths. In warmer weather considerable evaporation will take place which may be made up for from time to time by the addition of more of the bait mixture. Also, after a rain heavy enough to cause the bait pails to over - flow it is well to refill them with frosh bait as the previous bait will be so diluted that it will no longer attract the moths. USE OF CHEMICALLY TREATED BANDS AS A SUPPLEMENTARY CONTROL METHOD FOR CODLING MOTHS Work on the use of chemically treated bands as a supplementary control method for codling moths has been done in a number of places including Indiana, Pennsylvania, "Virginia, Washington, and others not as a control measure in itself but as an aid to the other control measures in use. A number of different chemicals have been used with a number of different banding materials. In general two chemicals, Alpha naph - thylamine and Beta Naphthol, have been reported as satisfactory ma - terials for treating the bands and one-faced corrugated cardboard 2 to 4 inches wide was selected as a satisfactory band material. The Beta naphthol has been slightly more efficient than Alpha Naphthylamine and a mortality of as high as 90% of the larvae hiber - nating there it has been observed. Treating Bands In treating the bands the following procedure is used: Beta naphthol bands, for 50 feet of 4-inch corrugated pasteboard band: Beta naphthol 1 pound Lubricating oil (red engine grade) 1% pints Heat the oil in a shallow pan or vat and then add Betha naphthol. Continue heating until the Betha naphthol is disolved, then apply only enough heat to keep the chemical in solution. The tightly rolled band is then tied to prevent the roll from separating and dipped into the hot mixture. When the mixture foams through the upper side of the roll it is turned and dipped on the other side. It is then set aside to drain. Caution: These materials are inflamable and should be handled with care. </seg>
            <seg id="p598">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE unomically treated bands may be purchased but again, Caution: Purchased bands should be fresh, since it is important that the chemicals are fresh when the bands are applied. How Bands Should Be Used Before the bands are applied, all the loose bark must be removed from the trunk, crotch, and larger limbs of the trees. This should be done during the late winter or early spring, and many larvae will be destroyed by the scraping. The scrapings or bark flakes should be collected and destroyed. Cost of Banding Trees The following figures are taken from Technical Paper No. 557, Pennsylvania Agricultural Experiment Station by H. N. Worthley: 250 mature trees : ....two scrapings Scraping, 81 hrs. at $.20 per hr $1G.2O 1000 ft. 2 in. band (Penn. price) 20.00 Placing bands (est.) 2 men 8 hrs. at $.3 0 per hr. 4.80 Total $41.00 Taking the above figures banding costs amount to about $4.50 per acre or about $.16% per tree. The chief poinjt at which this expense may be reduced is in the development of an effective, low cost band. Discussion Question: How often do you have to change the bait? Answer: It depends somewhat on the weather, but as soon as your bait loses that familiar odor of fermenta ;ion f it will not attract the moths any more. Throw it away. Question: Give us that formula again. Answer: One part Black Strap Molasses, 'nine parts water, half cake yeast. Question: Do you put about an inch in the bottom of the pan? Answer: Fill the pan about three-fourths full. Question: I would like to have Mr. Porter tell us how he tells the difference between the male and. female moth. Answer: I can probably help you out on that. Insofar in deter - mining the time to spray, it won't make so much difference. Taking the moth and turning back the front wing, underneath the front wing of the male moth there is a little brown spot. 'There is a distinct dif - ference in the tip of the abdomen between the male and the female. Either method is satisfactory, but going by the spot under the wing is most satisfactory. </seg>
            <seg id="p599">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Question: Is It necessary to know the difference in determining when you are to spray V r Answer: No, it is not. Question: I would like to ask you this question that came up before. About how much difference do. you think there would be In time of spraying between Shubert and distances north? Answer: I have watched Mr. Shubert's graphs during the summer and it seemed to me that moth emergence at Lincoln was two or three days ahead of theirs, "but in some seasons the situation might be just the reverse. GROWER: I have said this before. I think that the service we have had from the Department has been very valuable, and I want to see it kept up because that is one of the things that has done me more good than anything I know of. I think it is quite an important factor. MR. HOPPERT: In answer to that question about the difference in time of spraying as compared with Shubert and distances north, we figure that for every 50 to 75 miles north you go, moth emergence takes place one day later. When we go west, however t we can't be so sure because there are fewer cloudy and rainy days. I believe in the four years that we have been watching this matter we have been as far apart as a week between Shubert and Lincoln, sometimes a little ahead at Lincoln but usually a little behind. ' In answer to that question about having other people do some of this work, I think every orchard owner who has any considerable acreage ought to put up and observe one or two of these traps to check conditions in his own orchard against observations at Shubert and Lincoln. Around packing sheds you will always have more moths than you will in the orchard proper, so you wouldn't want to spray your whole orchard by what you find around your packing house. The moths don't fly very far, about 350 feet. I would say put them some place away from the packing house about 400 feet or more. L. O. WILLIAMS: This method of fighting codling moths pre - ceded all forms of spraying. My memory runs back sixty years or more before sprayB were first introduced. In Dixon County, in Iowa, they used straight white arsenic at that time. Before that time they thought of this method of trapping codling moths by using ordinary tin cans containing bait. Then they used these bands you suggested. As to these traps they have their place I am sure. CHAIRMAN: Now we are going to have a talk by Professor W. W. Yocum on the "Choice of Materials in the Control of Scab and Black Rot." </seg>
            <seg id="p600">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE TESTING OP MATERIALS FOB CONTROL. OP APPLE SCAB AND BLACK ROT W. W. YOCUM Our experimental spraying of apples during the past season was concerned chiefly with testing of materials for the control of apple scab and black rot. The tests were made on a block of Jonathan trees in the Shubert orchard. The scab infection the past season was very severe and no orchards were entirely free of it. The infection got started early, during rainy weather preceeding the calyx spray. In our experimental plats, at the time of the calyx the infection on 2 plats which did not receive the pink averaged 12.2% while on 5 plats receiv - ing the pink spray the infection averaged 7.4% on the foliage. Con - siderable difficulty was experienced in applying the calyx spray for rains fell on about half the days between the beginning of the calyx and first cover spray. The infection of scab became so severe before the first cover was applied that considerable dropping of leaves occur - red during the latter part of May. The Black Rot epidemic was probably just as severe as it has been the past few seasons but the general use of Bordeaux in the summer sprays kept it well under control. One careful check for black rot infection was made on July 22 but very little was found in any of the plats. Discussion of Spray Schedule. ■ - i In the test of fungicides for control of apple scab and frog-eye several materials were used. Two strengths of liquid lime-sulphur 1 - 50 and % to 50 were each used all season. In another plat liquid lime sulfur 1-50 was in all fungus sprays except that the pink spray was omitted. Two strengths of Bordeaux mixture were used in two other plats following the use of liquid lime sulfur in the pink and calyx sprays. Three other sulfur materials dry lime-sulfur, Kopper's Flota - tion sulfur and Koloform, were tested. In checking the results of these sprays j on the control of disease on the foliage we had considerable difflcuty. Two branches on op - posite sides of each of two trees in each spray plat were tagged. Each branch contained from 150 to 250 leaves. These leaves were examined carefully before the application of each spray for thei purpose of de - termining the progress of disease since the last spray. We did not get a record on leaf dropping so our records are not so conclusive for that reason. Part of the early leaf fall seemed due to frost injury rather than scab. It is evident that some scheme must be devised to determine the leaves dropped between sprays and also the new leaves developed. This work was new this year, but perhaps by using a punch on the leaves a much better record can be obtained another year. </seg>

            <seg id="p602">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The pink spray which is often omitted in Nebraska was needed this season and the calyx spray was badly needed but could not be applied properly. The time is always limited for applying either the pink or calyx spray because of the oncoming! blooming period or closing of the calyx. Since these early sprays are often so important and the time so limited we think it advisable to do some spraying during the blooming period with lime sulfur. Arsenate of lead must be omitted during the bloom or large numbers of bees will be killed. The blos - soms are not apt to be injured by lime sulf lr. The apple growers of Illinois and Indiana have been using a Bor - deaux blossom spray for some time to prevent blossom-blight caused by the fire-blight organism. It does give considerable protection against this form of fire-blight infection so the blossom spray should be of further value to us. The remainder of the data on foliage Infection are not very in - dicative, so I will not attempt to comment on them. Discussion Spray Results on the Fruit. Now the information that we obtained on the fruit in our spray plats seems much more complete and reliable. At harvest time about 1000 apples were gathered from the tree.-; in each plat and examined carefully for scab infections. The scabby fruit was divided luto 1 classes based on the severity of infection or the total estimated area of scab lesions. These data show first, that unsprayed fr n't from check trees was 100% scabby and' 87% severe enough to put them in the cull grade. Second, — the old standard spray fungicides ljhne sulfur and Bordeaux gave the maximum control of the disease. The two strengths of Bor - deaux 2-4-50 and l%-3-50 and lime sulfur gave under 10% severe scab infection. The weaker dilution of Bordeaux gave near 10% severe infections while 2-4-50 Bordeaux gave less than 5% So 2-4-50 Bordeaux seems to be about as weak a dilution as it is safe to use. Lime sulfur 1-50 gave somewhat better results than the weaker solu - tion so seems to be the more desirable strength to use. The results obtained by any of the substitutes for lime sulfur or Bordeaux were not nearly so good. Dry lime sulfur gave over double the amount of severe infection and Koppen's Flotation sulfur and Koloform gave 11 and 14% respectively. The control of scab on the foliage was likewise poorer in the case of these substitute materials. These results on the fruit are directly in line with results obtained in similar spray tests recently made in New York and Michigan. J. M. Hamilton of the Geneva, N. Y. says, "Under seasonal condi- </seg>
            <seg id="p603">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY tions unfavorable to scab development some of the less efficient ma - terials may afford apparent control. Under such circumstances the fruit grower may often develop considerable faith in the performance of a certain product, only to experience partial failure in control dur - ing a "scab year". (Quoting further ) Lime-sulfur 1-40 is recommend - ed as giving the greatest margin of safety of the materials tested. Sprays containing lime-sulfur appeared to be superior to wettable sulfurs if used at proper concentrations." Discussion. Question: How do you explain that your check only showed 9 per cent of the leaves infected with black rot? Answer: I don't know except that the Scab infection was so terribly bad there wasn't any place for Black Rot to get in. Question: In Plat No. 4 what solution was used? Answer: Five pounds of Dry Lime Sulphur to fifty in the pink and calyx. I think the recommendations are between four and five pounds to fifty. If you are going to use liquid Lime Sulphur and put on as much Sulphur, you should use at least four pounds to fifty, a pound of dry to the quart of liquid. If you are going to get the same amount of Sulphur compounds, it takes about five pounds of dry Lime Sulphur to equal one and one-fourth gallon liquid. Question: Were these tests made entirely on apples? Answer: On Jonathan apples. Question: How about using these materials for the rot on plums and peaches? Answer: Some of these materials are better used on peaches and plums. The wettable sulphurs are well adapted for brown rot of plums and peaches. In fact it isn't safe to use liquid lime sulfur on peaches because of the danger of burning the foliage. Question: How about the dry lime sulphur plat? Was this ma - terial used right through the season? Answer: We started with five pounds to fifty in the pink and calyx and in the last two sprays we used three to fifty. , Question: I don't see how you had any leaves left to spray. Who recommends these amounts? Answer: Five pounds is based on the findings of the New York and of the Michigan Experiment Stations in tests that have been made by the chemists of those two experiment stations; they say if you are going to put on as much sulphur by the dry lime sulphur method as </seg>
            <seg id="p604">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE with liquid lime sulphur that you will have to put on' four pounds of dry lime sulphur to equal a gallon of liquid sulphur. Question: You mention two states there but you can go down to Ohio and find that their recommendations are entirely different based perhaps on far more extensive tests than those of any other state. If you use recommendations based on performance rather than chemi - cal analysis, my preference is for results. Answer: Weather conditions vary in different states. Scab is worse in Michigan and New York than in southern Ohio where the results you speak of were secured. Question: I am wondering just how you arrived at using the five and three. Was it based on the manufacturer's recommendations? Answer: They were based on chemical analysis primarily. I am sure the General Chemical Company recommends 4 pounds to 50 in the early sprays. Statement: The manufacturers feels that, based on performance or results, two pounds of dry is equivalent to one gallon of the liquid, leaving out of consideration the chemical analysis. The manufacturer of dry lime sulphur feels that due to the stabilizer that is used the calcium poll-sulphides remain effective longer than these same com - pounds are when used in liquid form, so that five pounds or the ratio of a pound to a quart would be entirely too high if you measure the comparative control of the different strengths. Question: Do you think that using r.he higher strengths would reduce the control? Answer: In some cases control is reduced by using higher strengths but I don't feel that it would be fair to the manufacturer to leave in the minds of the men, that it takes that much dry lime sulphur to equal the liquid so far as control is concerned. Question: Isn't the general recommendation three to four pounds to fifty? Answer: Yes, in the pink and in the later spray one to two pounds, depending upon the weather conditions. MR. YOCUM: Perhaps there should be further tests of those weaker strengths. Of course, this is the first test and we should not put too much weight on one years results. We intend to repeat these tests next year. Answer: Don't misunderstand me. I am not criticizing at all. We are vitally interested in what you men are doing and we want to support the work in every way and at the] same time we want to render to you folks any small part of the general results that we can. Question: In the calyx spray using liquid lime sulfur would there </seg>
            <seg id="p605">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY be any difference on different varieties of apples or would t'uoj an respond alike? Answer: You refer to the dropping of fruit after the use of lime sulphur? I don't know of any difference. There may be some. We get some dropping of fruit due to this factor, but during the past sea - son we noticed a great deal more of dropping, caused by scab lesions on the stems of the young apples. These lesions girdle the apple stems and when dry weather comes the fruits drop off. Question: Did you have any experience with Flotation Sulphur? Answer: We didn't get any material burning on any of these plats. , MR. HOPPERT: Just a word about flotation sulphur. This past summer I was on a tour through Michigan with a number of horti - culturists and fruit growers from other states. Mr. Burkholder from Indiana reported the worst spray burning this year was in the plat where they used Flotation sulphur. Of course, you must realize that burning is a thing that varies considerably with climatic conditions. In Kentucky and Tennessee for instance, the growers wouldn't use liquid lime sulphur nor even dry lime sulphur because of the extreme danger of spray burn. CHAIRMAN: We can go on like this just as we did on the methods of spraying. There are advocates of liquid and of dry. The time and climatic conditions make a big difference. I am located right close to the orchards where the different tests were conducted and their problems are very much the same as ours, but at the same time if those tests had been made in a dozen orchards last year, and if the orchards had been right alongside each other, I doubt if the re - sults would have been anywhere near the same in any two. In Mr. Banning's case the only real fruit he had in his whole orchard was where he had used Koloform. In my case, I used both Koloform and dry lime sulphur and Bordeaux, and apparently I got into trouble on five pounds of dry lime sulphur. There is a lot we have to know about these different fungicides, and it simply resolves itself into the fact that what will do in Kansas or in Missouri or in Ohio has no di - rect bearing on what they will do in Nebraska. Four or five years results of this nature would be very valuable. Each grower, at pres - ent has his own ideas on fungicides and how to use them. It looks like the thing for each one to do is to use the material he has had good results with and that he knows how to use under the different weather conditions such as we are likely to get. It is now about 12:00 o'clock. If there are no more important questions we will stand adjourned. Meeting adjourned. </seg>

ALEXANDER, Lincoln The experimental work being conducted at this station at the present time with sheep is concerned primarily witli those aspects which characterize it entirely as a Nebraska industry. ■| The project which we have been carrying on in our studies at the station for the past year and the one that I will discuss this morning concerns the production of lambs for tlie early spring market. The geographic situation of Nebraska between; the range sheep industry and the markets to which these sheep are sent has furnished Nebraska feeders with an opportunity to develop this industry of spring lamb production to a very large scale and great importance. Thus we find Nebraska feeders buying western range ewes at an age when they have passed their usefulness on the range because </seg>
            <seg id="p611">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION of wearing out their teeth, but which are still capable of lamb produc - tion and making very satisfactory use of feed when supplied under : our Nebraska system. The usual method, and the one followed by &gt; the preponderant majority of Nebraska sheep feeders, is to market these ewes with iheir lambs in the spring. It might be well to re- &gt; mark here that the present conditions existing in the sheep market ■ have brought a great number of younger ewes to the markets rather than only the smooth and broken mouthed ewes as in former years when the range industry thrived. Some of these might be satisfac - tory for keeping over another year. Our studies, however, have been designed to discover the best method of handling these western ewes and lambs in the production of spring lambs for the early market. A comparison of various meth - ods used in Nebraska and Colorado was outlined as the project which we have been carrying on. One method studied was the practice of putting the ewes on feed of grain immediately after being shipping in from the range country, about October 15, and giving them all the grain they would eat until lambing time and then continuing the full feed until they were ship - ped with the lambs in the spring. The second method studied was to feed the ewes on a roughage ration of silage until lambing and then feed grain until they are shipped with the lambs. The third method in the project was that of roughing the ewes with a roughage and supplement ration throughout the period from the time they were procured until shipped in the spring. The lambs produced from the ewes in all three cases were fed gniin on a fattening basis in keeping with the method of production of fat lambs for early market as carried on by Nebraska feeders. All lambs were fed and cared for in the same manner so as to produce an accurate comparison of the three methods of feeding the ewes. The ewes fed under the first method, that of putting them on grain rations immediately in the fall, ate 2.1 pounds of ground ear corn daily. They gained a total of one-third more in weight during the entire period than those fed under the second method, that of feeding roughage until lambing time. Those fed under the second method, receiving grain after lambing, gained one-third more in weight than the ewes fed under the third method, receiving no grain at all. It is apparent to all feeders that in order to increase the value of the ewe for the market and thus insure a larger return on the operation, it is necessary to have the ewe in condition. </seg>
            <seg id="p612">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In the marketing of the three lots of ewes from the experimental lots, the returns disclosed that the ewes fed grain throughout the entire period before and after lambing commanded a price 7 5£ a hun - dred higher than those fed grain only after lambing while those fed from lambing time until marketed sold for twice as much per hun - dred as those receiving no grain throughout the entire period. |. It is also apparent to the experienced lamb feeder and to those studying lamb feeding, that the lamb on a ewe giving more milk eats a larger amount of grain with subsequent increased gains, than lambs on ewes giving less milk. In our project it was disclosed that lambs on the ewes fed under the first method ate more grain. In other words, the full feeding of the ewes from the time that they were (procured produced a more abundant supply of milk after lambing time and stimulated both the growth and the consumption of grain of the lambs. The results were that the lambs from the full fed ewes gained six pounds more before being marketed than' the lambs from either the ewes fed after lambing or the ewes which were not given grain at all. The higher condition of the lambs from the ewes fed grain throuKh - out the period also commanded a higher market price and returned more than the lambs from the ewes fed by the latter two methods. The lambs from the ewes fullfed the entire period sold ut $7.00 per hundred while those from ewes fed only after lambing sold at $6.7 5. Lambs from the ewes full fed after lambing did not consume more grain than those from ewes roughed through under the third method, but gained three pounds per head more as a result of the stimulated milk production of the ewes receiving grain. Thus the lambs under the second method of feeding the ewes were three pounds heavier than those from the roughage fed ewes. The lambs from the owes receiving roughage during the entire period sold at $6.50 per hundred or 50£ below the lambs from fullfed ewes and 25? below the lambs from ewes full-fed from lambing time. Combining the returns from the ewes and the lambs, those fed under the method of graining throughout the period returned $2.20 more per head than those fed after lambing while those fed after lambing returned $2.70 more per head than the ewes fed roughage the entire period. Thus the ewes full fed from the time procured until marketed returned $4.90 per head more than the ewes carried on roughage and supplements from the time they were procured until marketed. From these results of the experimental project it is apparent that </seg>
            <seg id="p613">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION the first method is the most advisable procedure in the production of early spring lambs in Nebraska. It appears that it is the best practice to get all the grain possible into these western ewes from the start until they are sold. Of course higher price levels for both lambs and fed ewes and for the feeds used would change the aspects and the results somewhat. The changing feed values would change the profit relations, and the feeder should be able to figure which price situation afforded him opportunity for spring lamb production. If the ewes were to be kept over for a second year it is not probable that the feeder will want to feed the ewes. The production of later lambs for the August market is less dif - ficult and requires less equipment for caring for the lambs and ewes than the production of winter lambs for the early spring market. Under Nebraska conditions it is less trouble to lamb ewes about April 1 for the August 1 market. Under this method of later summer lamb production it is advis - able, results from experimental work show, to feed the ewes grain while fattening the lambs. Cheaper gains will be made by the ewes on pasture during the early summer months than is produced with the ewes fed during the winter for early spring market. The higher spring market, however, usually pays a premium for the earlier fat - tened lambs and ewes. Under the summer lamb production system it has been found that graining the ewes while on pasture reduces the costs of gains on both the lambs and the ewes. During July heat it is advisable to put the Iambs in dry lot and allow the ewes to run on pasture, nursing the lambs morning and evening. Lambs in dry lot during July produced 3 to 4 pounds more gain per head than those remaining on pasture, in experimental work with the later lamb production method. In these tests it was found to be a paying method to feed ewes grain on pasture. Q. How are the lambs and the ewes separated? A. The lambs were coaxed into the lot with grain and hurdles used to keep out the ewes. More grain was consumed by the lambs when they were penned in for several hours at first until they learned to eat. Q. What about Minerals for lambs? A. It is possible to substitute roughage and ground limestone or steamed bone meal for alfalfa. One pound of ground limestone is a daily feed for 35 lambs. </seg>
            <seg id="p614">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Our experience has been that including steamed bone meal in the ration for the ewes seemed to prevent paralysis in the ewes before lambing and to reduce the number of lambs born dead. Q. What kind of rams were these lambs sired by? A. Hampshire rams were bred to the western ewes to produce the lambs. TYPES AND BREEDS OF SHEEP FOK NEBRASKA FARM FLOCKS W. W. DERRIGK (Types of western ewes, Hampshire eves, Hampshire, Shropshire, and Southdown rams were exhibited to tlie meeting.) The selection of a Rood type of aniim.l is essential in all lines of livestock business and particularly so in sheep. In the western ewes, which are the source of foundation stock for a great many of our Nebraska farm flocks, wide variations in type and suitability for the purpose, .are to be found. The selection of good ewes is esseiiti; 1 to the production of good lambs and good feeders. Kight per cent of the cornbelt farm flocks are based on western ewes, and while tin western sheepman is inter - ested in wool production, the cornbelt man is interested In a lamb that will feed and gain to produce mutton. Sa we want a more of a dual purpose type of ewe for our cornbelt flocl s. Body thickness, mutton type and l.cdy conformation ;ire points of particular importance in buying this oundation stock. The ewes should be sound ewes, free from disease,! strong bodies, deep chested and strong on the back. Broken or smooth mouthed ewes are all right for cornbelt conditions for one year. Although they have passed their usefulness on the range because of inability to graze in the higher altitudes and rough country, they will get along satisfactory In this section where grass and feed is more abundant. To these ewes it is advisable to breed a good ram. It is poor busi - ness to use anything but a good ram, not necessarily one of the tops of the purebred rams but a rugged, thick, mutton type ram which will perhaps cost a little more but will be well worth it. Points to consider in the selection of a ram are width of body, thickness and mutton type. A strong back and rib with a wide deep chest are essential features of a good ram. The packer buyer selects lambs for mutton and wants a lamb with a wide thick loin, a wide back and wide deep twist and leg of mutton. To produce such lambs </seg>
            <seg id="p615">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION' from western ewes it is necessary to use a ram that has these char - acteristics. The largest percentage of the range men use Hampshire rams to produce lambs with mutton characteristics for the market. Other experimental stations have found that Hampshire rams get heavier faster growing lambs from western ewes than rams of other breeds. We advise the use of a good Hampshire ram on western ewes for best results from farm flocks. One feature that feeders find outstanding is that lambs from the Hampshire rams grow very rapidly and attain a weight of 75 or eighty pounds more quickly than other breeds. They are more rugged and hardy and may be more suited to our con - ditions for that reason. The Shropshire ram is a mutton ram, very thick type, and pro - duces good Iambs. The Southdown' is the aristocrat of the mutton breeds, being a very thick mutton type sheep, capable of carrying a great denl of weight for his size. They finish very well and com - mand good prices on the market when properly finished. Though they are not as hardy or rugged as other breeds, some sheepmen have found a Southdown ram to be very satisfactory on farm flocks for breeding a good mutton lamb, particularly if the ewes are lacking somewhat in desirable mutton type. . liAJIBS FOR BOYS AXD GIRLS K. C. FOUTS, Seward In recent years of club work with boys and girls in our great project lesson teacher — the 4-H club — we have come to find the sheep club an excellent project and it has increased in favor very rapidly until we find many of our club members now engaged in learning the sheep business from their sheep club studies. The market lamb project in club work offers an opportunity to the club member for a turnover and completion of the project in a comparatively short time. For the club member, the market lamb project has the advantages of being short duration, enabling com - pletion of the project and realization of results as well as providing an interesting project and excellent example of business for the member. Market lamb club work is particularly an excellent project for younger club members because of the fact that a lamb or several lambs can and very often do, become pets and receive a great deal of the youngsters interest. </seg>
            <seg id="p616">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The feeding and marketing of the lamb in the project affords an excellent demonstration to the member and a concrete object lesson in lamb feeding. It teaches the farm boy to make use of the most desirable methods and to use experimental data by practical applica - tion. The lessons taught by the lamb project work and the popularity of the sheep club augurs well for future sheep business when these club members begin farming and stockraising. The sheep club needs but a small investment and furnishes a quick turnover. The lamb project in club work has been criticlzcjd for "belittling" the business but the object is to teach rather than to become a business in club work. FARM FLOCKS IX NEBRASKA MARVEL L. BAKER, North Platte Farm flocks in Nebraska are not of great, importance when com - pared either with the total livestock industry of the state or even with Nebraska's sheep industry as a whole. About ten times ;is many lambs are produced in other states and fed in Nebraska as are produced from the flocks of the state itself. It is logical that Nebraska feet! lots should finish many lambs as our beet sugar factories with their by-products and our vast fields of alfalfa and corn lie between the ranges where these lambs are produced and the great central markets where they are sold for slaughter. There is no reason why our own Iamb industry should be neglected. I am no advocate for a farm flock for every farm. I am not even an advocate for a farm flock for any particular farm. Not all farms are equipped for the handling of a farm flock and probably not all men are fitted to handle sheep successfully. On the other hand there are many farmers in Nebraska who can well afford to consider the possible place of the farm flock in their operations. Equipment does not need to be elaborate. Shelter should provide dry, well ventilated quarters and at lambing time, protection from extreme cold must be afforded the young lamb for a short time. If the farm flock is to be handled most economically the farm must be fenced so that the waste from different lields can be utilized as the regular crops are removed. If this is dona the farm flock will subsist to quite an extent on products which have little or no sale value. One should not get the idea, however, that a sheep needs nothing to eat as that fallacious belief has ruined any chance for profit from more than one farm flock. </seg>
            <seg id="p617">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION Farm flocks should be kept not merely to clean up the fields and weeds on a farm. They should return a profit to the owner. To do this under Nebraska conditions they should produce a specialty — SPRING LAMB. To do this successfully, attention must be given to certain details — to the breeding stock used, to the feed and care which they receive, and to the marketing of the product. For a foundation flock under Nebraska conditions e I prefer big, rugged, vigorous western ewes. Properly selected they make good mothers; they are likely to be relatively free from parasites and dis - ease and they produce a heavy fleece which is at times an important item. There is no breeding operation in which the male is of more importance than in the production of spring lambs, or for that matter of any kind of lambs. I prefer a ram of one of the more popular Down breeds. A good many people use Shropshires. At the North Platte Substation we have used rams of the Southdown and Hampshire breeds on western ewes. Many people like the Hampshire because of his ability to sire big, rapid growing lambs. If Hampshires are to be used particular attention should be paid to getting low set, thick bodied, thick fleshed rams with quality. The Southdown is without a peer from the standpoint of mutton type, conformation, and quality but is not as large as the Hampshire. He is not as small however as he looks and many people who would think more of the Southdown if they stopped to look him over, pass him by without a second glance. His lighter weight may not be as much of a handicap when mated with western ewes as it would be if his daughters were retained for breed - ing and in turn mated with Southdown rams. As a matter of fact, we have found the disadvantage in size more apparent than real. It is true that our lambs sired by Hampshire rams have averaged 1.2 pounds heavier (10.8 to 9.6) at birth than the lambs sired by South - down rams. They have weighed 6.7 pounds more (73.5 to 66.8) by the latter part of May. On the other hand we have lost from two to four times as many of the Hampshire lambs as Southdown lambs at birth. When we take this into account we find that we have actually marketed a fraction of a pound more lamb per ewe from the ewes bred to the Southdown rams. You may be interested in some of the experiences which we have had at North Platte. Two years age we had 64 high grade Rambouil - let ewes. Almost half of these were yearling ewes. Fifty-seven of these ewes dropped 75 lambs. Nine of these were either dead at birth or so weak that they died shortly after birth. Two lambs were lost by accident. This left us 66 lambs on May 21 and they averaged in round numbers 65 pounds per head at that time. We retained 29 of the ewe lambs as we wished to get some information on ewes of this breeding. It is probably a better practice from a commercial standpoint to sell the ewe lambs on the spring lamb market and then </seg>
            <seg id="p618">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ■ ■ ■ . 1 wnen flock replacements are needed to buy more western ewes. If we had followed this practice with our lambs we would have had a return of $5.78 per lamb or a return per ewe from the lambs of $5.97. In addition to this, each ewe produced a fleece weighing 13 pounds which brought us $1.59 making a total return per ewe of $7.56. If we charge all of the feed eaten by the flock to the ewes, each ewe should be charged with 300 pounds of alfalfa, 5 bushels of grain, 40 pounds of Linseed oil meal, and 30 pounds of bran. Besides this, they had the run of a stalk field until well after the first of the year and had good rye pasture from March 1 to June 1 except during storms. During the summer they tried to keep the lots and roadways free from weeds. After the middle of August, they were given small native pasture which afforded them little more than a place to run. During this year we lost one ewe and discarded three. The next year each one o£ the GO ewes dropped at least one lamb and the flock of (iO dropped SS lambs. Ten of these were lost. The 78 lambs which were left averaged practically 70 pounds on May 24, and netted a little over a nickel or $4.GS for each ewe which we had in the flock. Each ewe again produced 13 pounds of wool which brought us about SO cents per ewe. For this year each ewe gave us a return of about $5.50. Again charging all of the feed against the ewes, each ewe should be charged with 5 bushels of grain, S(! pounds of bran, 30 pounds of Linseed oil meal, and since she bad neither stalk fields in the fall nor rye in the spring, she ate 75 0 pounds of roughage most of which was alfalfa. Of this feed each ewe is charged ■with 62 pounds of corn, 14 pounds of bran, and 11 pounds of Linseed oil meal which was eaten by the lambs. The amount of alfalfa eaten* by the lambs is not known. During this year three ewes were lost. The satisfactory marketing of early lambs from farm flocks in this state presents some difficulties because they should usually go to market as soon as they are heavy and fait enough to go. No one producer as a rule has a large number of lambs of his own. If a few larmers In each community could agree to follow the same method in handling their farm flocks, they could top out their lambs as they are ready to go to market and market them together. They could also work together to advantage in buying western ewes for replace - ment purposes. Mr. Ross can tell you what they should do to get the most out of their wool. To get the most out of Nebraska farm flocks, they must be handled to produce a special product; we cannot compete with western lambs with late, thin, undersized, scrawny lambs put on the market when it is being flooded with lambs from the range country.

The ewes. must be used to clean up feeds which have little sale value but must be brought through the winter in good flesh and must be fed after lambing so they will produce milk. In short we must pay attention to the trifles that will enable us to put on the market a thick, plump, fat lamb with quality at the time the market wants it. The farm flock owner in Nebraska can afford to take as his guide one of Michael Angelos state - ments, "Trifles make perfection and perfection is no trifle." THE HISTORY OF WOOL AND PREPARATION FOR MARKET W, MARSHALL ROSS, Gibbon We all know that wool is the natural hair as well as the clothing of sheep. We know that in some way or another this hair, or wool, as it is called, is removed and made into cloth or yarn, which in turn is made into garments for our use. It is a true name given to it in mythology, when it was rightfully called the "Golden Fleece". When Rome was in her glory the sheep raised on the Bay of Naples, according to Pliny, produced the best wool in the world, the Grecian sheep being the second best. From birth the sheep were given most extraordinary care, in some instances more care than was given their children. The bodies of the sheep were even covered with skins and other coverings to pro - duce a lustrous and wavy gloss to the wool. The fleece on the sheep was examined frequently, parted and combed, and moistend with the rarest oils and oftentimes with wine. The sheep houses were washed very often and fumigated regularly. When two years old the lambs were killed, the Romans believing that the fleece at that age was in the cream of condition. This shows the care of the wool which went into the clothing of the wealthy and refined Roman. It was with the choicest of these sheep grown on the Bay of Naples that the native Spanish sheep were crossed. Thus establish - ing a new variety called to this day Spanish Merinos. This was in about the seventh century A. D. France in the 17th century im - ported Spanish Merinos placing them in the section of Rambouillet and from this cross with the native sheep of France, we have what to - day is known as the Rambouillet breed of sheep. The breeding and raising of sheep did not spread very rapidly in North America or Australia until about the year 1800. From that time on they increased very rapidly. Merino sheep were first introduced into America in 1793 by Wm. Foster, bringing two Ewes and a Ram from Cadiz Spain. But the </seg>
            <seg id="p620">REPORT OF NEBRASKA, STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE largest importation and the one which had the most to do with the improvement of the flocks in this country was the bringing of 75 ewes and 21 rams by Davis Humphrey of Connecticut in 1802. After this, improvement in sheep and wool spread very fast until today we have in the United States about 52 million sheep producing about 397,707,000 pounds of wool for a population of 123 million people. Each person in the U. S. needs to use only about 8% pounds of wool per year to consume all the wool produced each year in the states. The Preparation of Wool For Market. The preparation of wool for the market needs to go farther back than shearing time to prepare a good article for the clothing we are later to wear. In the first place, sheep should be well bred, and along certain lines, to produce a desirable wool. The Merinos and Ram - bouillet producing the delaine fine and half-blood wool, and the down sheep such as Southdown, Hampshire, Shropshire and Oxfords produc - ing the medium or yarn wools. Climate is a great factor in the production of good wool but feed and the manner of feeding are also very important. Sudden changes in the quantity or quality of feed is liable to produce a break in the fibre of otherwise long staple wool. A sickness in the animal causing a fever will also produce a break. Many things may happen In a Hock that does not have regular feed of good quality in regular quantities to cause wool to be of poor quality with breaks in the staple at certain intervals. It is impossible in some sections of the country to keep wool from gathering dust and sand, causing a heavy shrinkage, but this does not injure the staple or otherwise deteriorate the product. However, it causes heavier shrinkage which is usually taken care of in the price paid. But to allow sheep to run in hurry fields, Spanish needles, fox-tail, and other vegetation that clings to the wool does materially cut down the value. An acid must be used to eat out this vegetable matter and this is called carbonizing. This does not damage the wool but great care has to be used to keep from burning the wool, and thus destroying the fibre. Too, it naturally makes unnecessary expense. Sheep should have clean sheds and corrals to stay in, and when they can be left on the grass in clean pastures results are much better. If these rules are followed it brings the sheep up to the shearing pens with a good, clean fleece of long strong fibred wool with no weak places in the fibre, or what is called dry or brashy wool on the back. Cnrc in Shearing Sheep should not be shorn when wet oil damp. Damp wool, when </seg>
            <seg id="p621">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION packed into bags, mildews and molds. It also has a tendency to turn yellow and, especially if any tags are left in the wool, it will become badly stained. The sheep should bo tagged berore shearing if possible and if not, all dung locks should be taken out before the wool is tied up. Range sheep are not bubject to tags as much as farm flocks on account of drier feed. The fleeces should be tied skin side out with paper twine wrapped around once each way and drawn up tight. The wool should not be piled up where dirt and vegetable matter will blow into it, but sacked in seven and half foot wool bags as soon as shorn. To sack the wool, the sack should be hung on a frame with the top of the sack folded about eight inches over a round iron ring about twenty-six or twenty - eight in diameter. To pack a sack evenly, put four fleeces in the shape of a square at the bottom of the bag, with one in the center ot these four, and gently turn the sides of the fleeces down on the outer edge with your foot. This method allows a nice even pack and a sack that handles easily. Sacks which are well packed handle much easier than poorly-packed ones. Ears for handholds should be tied in the corners of the sack before filling. The wool should be stored in a dry, airy place until sold or shipped. We naturally think of wool when it is sold and leaves the farm as being ready for market. We may have separated the black fleeces and ram fleeces from the white ones and think we have done a good job, but the wool has many more phases of grading through which to pass before it is ready to be milled. It is true that the most important part is to have the wool taken care of in the way which I have indicated If the quality from here on is to be procured and best results secured. Grading Wool After It Reaches the Warehouse When the wool finally reaches the warehouse to be graded it is taken from the sack by cutting the seam at the end and unravelling the chain stitch at the side of the sack. This is done so that pieces of the thread may not become comingled with the wool, for bits of thread cannot be combed out of the wool and cause defects in the cloth. The fleeces are then laid on the table and the grader determines its grade. In a flock of fullblooded Shrop or Hampshire sheep there may be four or five grades of wool, namely, Half-Blood Staple, Half- Blood Clothing, % Staple, % Clothing, % Blood Staple and % Cloth - ing. Usually % Blood and V* Blood, either staple or clothing, pre - dominate. The Clothing wool is shorter and usually comes off the old sheep, when they are on the down hill side of life, a good deal the same as man grows less hair in his old age. In the Midwest warehouse we have 7 grades of wool divided into 118 different lines according to shrinkage and origin from various sections of the country. These lines are known by number, for ex- </seg>
            <seg id="p622">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ample, Line 51 is known as Nebraska % Staple and has a shrinkage of 48%, meaning that in 100 lbs. of wool [there would be 52 lbs. of wool and 48 lbs. of dirt and grease; while Line 39 is known us Ked Oklahoma %, shrinkage 57%, 43 lbs. of wool and 57 lbs. of dirt and grease. When the wool is all graded it is resacked and the sack marked with the line number and grade. The line number designates the shrinkage. It is then warehoused and bonded, and is ready to ship to the mills. Sorting Wool For Mills to Be Made Into Cloth ■ You will say, "Now it is surely ready to be made into cloth," but I will give you just a slight sketch of the different operations that must yet be gone thru within the. sorting process at the mill. "Wool Sorting," as defined by Hurt in his book on wool, is the classification and division of the wool fibres in a fleece into various groups or sorts, according to fineness, length, soundness, elasticity, color, spinning, and felting qualities. This process requires great skill, inasmuch as the wool sorter must depend entirely on the sensi - tiveness of feeling and sight. A wool sorter will always make a most efficient wool grader, but a wool grader makes a very poor sorter, which is a much more advanced trade. Some fleeces will make aa high as eleven different sorts of wool being of different grades and lengths. The wool from the shoulders of the fleece contains the highest grade of wool both as to quality and strength, the sides carry the bulk of the grade, while the hips and breech contain much coarser wool. This is true of fine wooled sheep as well. The backs are inclined to con - tain more dirt and vegetable matter also aiid to be dry or brashy. Wool sorters' tables are arranged next tb the windows where they have the advantage of the light. The table is about seven feet long and three or four feet wide. In the center of the table is a large hole covered with a wire mesh so that the dirt, sand and vegetable matter goes thru the screen when the sorter shakes the fleece prior to sorting. Beneath the table is a basket to catch the dirt. The sorter is ob - liged to account for everything taken from the fleece, which includes the string and dirt he shakes out. The tags and loose pieces are put into a little box and the sorter then skirts the fleece, taking off the legs, belly, head, shoulders, sides and breech. A considerable amount of good wool is saved from the belly and legs, but it must be sorted from the poor and stained wool. For instance, if the lot of wool which the sorter was putting through was: a graded quarter - blood wool, which was graded on the high side, the top sort would be </seg>
            <seg id="p623">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION a 50's. The next highest percentage being a 56's. If the wool ran down in grades, the top sort, would be a 50's with the next highest a 48's or 46's, according to the way the wool was being sorted. Alter being sorted at the mill, the wool must still be washed or scoured. It is run through vats with revolving paddles to carry it through and thoroughly wash it and then through a rinsing vat. The water must be a little more than warm and sett. If it is hard water a softener must be used. The alkalies used in wool-scouring are soda, potash, and ammonia. At the end of the rinsing bowl is a set of squeeze rollers which removes the water, and the wool is ready to be conveyed automati - cally into a machine called the dryer, or drying machine, which is capable of drying 600 to 800 lbs. of wool an hour. Here it is dropped into perforated trays. These trays are moved forward by stages through the machine, heated air being blown thru them as the drying proceeds, until it finally reaches the end of the apron and is discharged thru a door at the end of the machine thoroughly dried. From now on the wool is ready for the cards and its preparation is practically thru. Wool is very resilient. One hair of wool if slowly stretched and kept properly moistened has been stretched 70% coming back exactly to its original length when released. It is this property that makes it so valuable in clothing having enough give to keep it from tearing easily. To test wool garments,, apply a match. If it is wool It will burn very slowly, leaving a crust of ashes and the odor of burning flesh. If cotton it leaves a white ash. I could have gone very much farther into detail on this subject, as I have given you only the most important parts, but time does not permit. However it is plain to be seen that the grower who takes care in growing and preparing his wool for market should get increased revenue. The Cooperatives are trying to grade these wools at their ware - houses in such a manner that the careful shepherd will get paid for an improved product. Thus, when carefully prepared wool comes to the grading table, it goes into the best grades and commands a higher price, which is the goal that the Midwest is striving to reach. ' ■ ■ ■ ■ CURING THE LA Ml? CARCASS W. J. LOEFFEL, Lincoln In the past few years, at least since the duration of the present </seg>
            <seg id="p624">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE economic conditions and adversity, farmers and stockmen have re - turned more and more to the practice of curing their own meat as a means of providing the needs of their own family from their own farm. While the majority of this farm butchered and cured meat is pork, and it has reached great proportions in the past year, there is a grow - ing interest in the possibilities of the use of lamb among farm people, particularly the farmer with a flock of sheep. A number of inquiries have come to me recently, concerning the feasibility and the methods of curing lamb meat for use on the farm. The possibilities of curing lamb on the farm are very favorable to quite a widespread use of lamb as a source of meat to the farmer with a flock. The curing of lamb is very satisfactory accomplished by the same general methods and cures used very widely for pork. The legs and the shoulders of the lamb carcass are the most satisfactory for curing, because of the tendency of the thinner portions of the carcass to harden and dry, though they can be treated satisfactorily for home use. One of the fundamental observations in curing a lamb carcass is to use sugar with the salt in the curing. The sugar offsets the harden - ing effect of the salt brine upon the lamb meat. A very satisfactory salt mixture for Iamb meat consists of 5 pounds of salt, four pounds of sugar and two ounces of saltpeter. This should be rubbed on the meat after it is taken from the brine. The meat should be laid in a well ventilated place at 35 to 40 degrees temperature. The recommended brine for curing lamb consists of 8 pounds of salt, 2 pounds of sugar, 2 ounces of saltpeter to six gallons of water. The shoulders and the legs should be cured under this brine for 30 days while 15 days is sufficient to cure the thinner cuts without hardening the flesh. Upon removing from the brine the meat should be washed and soaked briefly in clear water to remove the surplus amount of brine and salt which the outer flesh of the cut absorbs. The freshening should be followed by a light smoke in the same manner that pork is smoked to preserve from spoilage. While the entire carcass of the lamb may be cured and smoked, the legs give the best results because of less spoilage. The thinner cut become hard - ened and dry if kept for a long period after the smoking. In all the lamb meat it is best to use the cured product within six months as the fat becomes rancid and results in spoilage of the meat if kept longer than six months. In preparing the meat for cooking it is advisable to soak it 24 to 48 hours before cooking. It may then be fried, used as a roast or stew very satisfactorily. </seg>

Gramlich Presiding HORSE FARMING COSTS RALPH COLE, Lincoln (College owned draft horses were exhibited previous to the speaking program) The development of present economic conditions and particularly the situation in which the farmer finds himself, viz the inability to dispose of roughage and feed products of his own farm and the con - tinued high costs of mechanical power unit fuels and machinery, has brought a renewed interest in horses as a source of power for farm - ing operations, particularly in the last year. Very concrete evidence of this interest and also of a marked change toward the horse as a source of farm power, is seen in the increased price at which horse3 are selling, the increased number of tractors that are remaining idle and the interest of farmers such as are repre - sented by this audience, in horses and horse farming costs. The changes in the relative prices of necessities for either type of power source in the last three years are responsible for the return of the popularity of the horse and may very reasonably change within the next few years so that any cost or estimate or relative economies of the power sources that we might make at this time may be obsolete within a short time. Also bear in mind that generalizations do not fit every individual farm and that the choice between the two types of power sources for every farm must be left to the farmer himself to be deducted from his particular circumstances. We may however, consider factors which will be taken into account in figuring costs of the power used on a farm. It is apparent from a survey of current and past prices that fuels, oils, and lubricants as well as repairs and mechanical powered machin - ery itself has not declined as much in price as has feed costs, horse costs and horse power equipment. The fact that feed prices have declined so greatly coupled with the surplus of roughages and grains that farmers now find on their hands, are very easily produced, is re - sponsible for the present favorable operation cost of the horse and horse power farming. Here are some cost items per work horse that I have secured from the Illinois college of agriculture along with estimates which I have i ■ . ■ &gt; . ■ </seg>
            <seg id="p626">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE computed from them to fit Nebraska conditions. These are on the basis of a year. Item 111. Cost Nebr. Est.

However, I wish to here call your attention to variations from farm to farm and to leave the exact cost for horse power dependent upon the man doing the farming and caring for the horses and vari - ous factors under which he works as well as the amount of enthusi - asm with which he undertakes the work, for that certainly is a factor which will in this final analysis determine the relative advantage of either horse power or mechanical power farming. There are also other factors to consider. Should a farmer just starting in business of farming equip himself for horse or mechanical power farming? Present conditions I believe would influence more in favor of the horse. Many farmers now have horses and at times have had to consider whether to buy more horse machinery or to equip with a tractor. More prevalent and vexing at the present time is the problem confronting the owner of a tractor and mechanical power farming equipment who is now considering buying horses. Then there is the farmer of large tracts who probably has both horses and tractors and both types of equipment and he must decide which to use. Farming at the present time with prices at their current levels will not permit payment for a new investment of either kind of power re - gardless of respective advantages. Many are solving the problem of equipping themselves with horse machinery by buying second hand machinery and exchanging with their neighbors to get their work done without investing in equipment. That apparently is a very wise plan in so far as it does not cripple farming operations. Thus it becomes apparent that the actual costs of either type of power as applied to a particular farm depends entirely upon the con - ditions existing upon that farm and tTie thrift and economy of the </seg>

The above factors, however, will be found to assist in pointing out the relative differences which for the basis of solution of the individual problem. . HORSE POWER FARMING Delivered at The College of Agriculture, University of Nebraska, January 3, 1933 By GEO. G. SEAMAN, Taylorville, Illinois In lttlD I resigned my commission as an officer of the regular army of the United States to take over the operation and management of 3,000 acres of farm land in Central Illinois, which belongs to my own and my wife's family. As a boy, I had lived on a farm a part of the time and of course, had always been closely in contact with and interested in farm prob - lems through the family ownership of land. When I got into the actual management and operation of these farms, it took me some years to discover that a farm is nothing more or less than a manufac - turing; plant and I would like to get this analogy clear in your minds, as I believe it is a great aid in studying farm problems. First, the land itself is merely the plant in which manufacturing is carried on. The chemical contents of that land represent the raw products that the farmer is attempting to manufacture into cereal and forage crops. The seed that he plants utilizes the chemical contents of that soil and the air above, and is the real manufacturing machinery. Our so - called farm machinery is merely a set of tools with which we adjust these machines or by means of which we convey the raw product to the machines themselves. At the end of the crop season we have manufactured out of the chemicals in the soil and the air, corn or hay or wheat or cane or grass or any of the other crops of which we have planted the seed. Now, as manufacturers, we can sell these to other manufacturers, who will still further process them or we can put them through still other machines on the farm, such as swine, cattle and horses and mules and sheep and turn our forage and cereal crops into beef, pork, mutton or wool; pigskin, cow-hide, horse power or milk, and if we choose, we can go still further and butcher our own meat and tan our own leather and spin and weave our own wool an'd supply ourselves with the large portion of all the things that we require to maintain life. In other words, we have on the farm the perfect foundation for the vertical trust so highly developed by the automobile industry, but we </seg>
            <seg id="p628">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE have not been able to avail ourselves of that fact to the degree which our fathers and our grandfathers did, on the other hand, we have per - mitted first one and then another type of manufacturer or middle-man to take away from us our own natural business until today we find ourselves In a position where our products are practically without sale value, and all this because of the tremendous tax laid thereon, by a distribution system that has brought this great country to a point where they say we have a surplus of agricultural products, that is foodstuffs, in the face of the fact that ten million of our population are actually hungry and cold, with another sixty million of that popu - lation denying themselves a part of the food and clothing that they should have in order that they may contribute to the indigent ten million. There may be, and are a great many causes of our depression which is world-wide, but I do not hesitate to say to you gentlemen that one of the principal and I believe the greatest single underlying cause of this depression is the cumbersome method of distribution of farm products that has been built up in the last thirty-five years by the farmer permitting other people to take his business away from until he is now practically restricted to the manufacturer of the most elementary raw products possible to manufacture upon the farm. We farmers find ourselves today in a most serious plight. How - ever, we are not alone, for every other form of business in the United States and apparently in the world as well, is facing conditions that - threaten them with destruction. It is my personal opinion that never before in its history, has this country faced a crisis so serious as that which now confronts it. At no time during the World War was this country in anything like the danger that it is in today. It is not, however, within the scope of the subject assigned me to discuss those matters further than to attempt to point out one way in which we farmers can in a small way help ourselves by the cutting of our pro - duction costs through the use of horse power farming, instead of mechanical power farming. In 1919, one bushel of corn sold for a price which would pay for ten gallons of gasoline. Today the price of one gallon of gasoline will buy one and one-half bushels of corn. In 1919 and 1920, a bushel of oats would buy from three to four gallons of gasoline. Today a gallon of gasoline will buy two bushels of oats. In 1919 and 1920, a ton of timothy hay would buy one hundred fifty gallons of gasoline. Today, It will buy twenty. In spite of the change in the relative prices of these types of horse feed, a bushel of corn or oats, and a ton of hay will produce just as many horse power today as they did in 1919 and 1920. A bushel of corn would buy thirty- five gallons of distillate; a bushel of oats at </seg>
            <seg id="p629">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION seventy cents would buy thirteen gallons of distillate, and a ton of hay would buy from four hundred to six hundred gallons of distillate. Today a bushel of corn would buy two gallons of distillate; a bushel of oats would buy two gallons of distillate, and a ton of hay would buy seventy gallons of petroleum products used in tractors. Not only is this the case, but there are certain residues in the form of manure that arise from the feeding of hay, oats and corn to horses -which are of very great value to the farmers as fertilizer, whereas the only resi - due from the petroleum products used to produce power in tractors are bad odors and a headache, and wherever a drop of gasoline, coal oil or distillate falls upon the soil, that particular particle of soil Is sterilized for a long period of time. Another interesting comparison between the relative costs of me - chanical power and horse power arises from the fact that tractors don't have little tractors born to them from year to year, while horses do reproduce themselves. It takes but very little of those products which the farmers raise to enable him to have a constant supply of new horses coming on, but he finds that the same amount of farm products that is required to grow eight colts to where they will turn out as much power as a tractor will not come anywhere near bringing enough money to purchase such a tractor. In 1924, we were using both tractors and horses on our farms and were inclined to believe that if we used tractors of sufficient size that we could affect very material economies in our operations. Even in those days of relative high prices for farm products, our cost accounts showed us that this was not possible with small tractors. We had heard some talk of big hitches used on the farms and my own years of experience as an Artillery officer of the United States Army and as Quarter Master in charge of Army wagon trains, had proven to me very definitely that I could use large groups of horses or mules to move any kind of a vehicle through or over any kind of ground. In South Dakota during the Ute Indian Expedition of 1907, I had seen as many as twenty-four mules hitched to one wagon and driven by one man with a jerk-line in extracting heavily loaded wagons from places through which it seemed, impossible to drive a vehicle of any sort. During the campaign in Prance in 1918, I had moved six-inch howitzers over ground that tanks could not nego - tiate by the expedient of doubling up my teams and putting thirty-two horses on a ten thousand pound gun carriage. My local Farm Advisor had some of the pamphlets put out by the Horse Association of America on big hitches and procured for me a copy of the bulletin on that subject published by the University of Montana. We, also, got in touch with the Extension Department of the University of Illinois and they sent Professor Robbins down to </seg>
            <seg id="p630">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE show us how to use these big hitches. From that time on we have used this type of power more and more on our farms and our cost sheets have shown some remarkable economies, resulting from the use of this type of power instead of tractor power, though it was fully two years before we finally were thoroughly convinced that we could do any sort of draw-bar work with big teams, that we could do with me - chanical power. Today in the operation of 3,000 acres of land in Central Illinois, our standard field hitch is the eight-horse team, but as you will see in the pictures that I will presently show you, we sometimes increase the number of horses in one team to as high as sixteen, and on one oc - casion have worked twenty; all driven by one man and all handled with ease. We have one tractor, a 30-horse power caterpillar, which we can't sell to anybody for a decent price and which we therefore retain as a stand-by power unit. You ITave just heard Mr. Ralph Cole talk on farming costs and I am going to say to you that our own cost accounts have shown us as the result of actual operations of tractors and big teams, working on the same tools, on the same fields, and under the same identical con - ditions that a good eight-horse team will do the draw-bar work of a 3-bottom tractor for from $3.00 to $9.00 less per day than the tractor. Comparative Daily Costs Operation of Tractors and 8-Horse Teams If Pulling n 3-Hottom Plow The type of tractor here considered is believed to be one of the best and cheapest of it's size. It costs $1250.00. . ! It has been generally accepted that seven years is the life of all farm tractors. Therefore the annual depreciation would be one-seventh of the price of the tractor for each year and the daily depreciation charge would be that amount divided by the number of days the tractor worked. Prom the best figures available, the average tractor operated with a maximum efficiency, operates at the most one hundred twenty days a year, and we would then have the following daily costs of operation of this tractor: Interest '. $ .62 Depreciation 1.41 Fuel (engine distillate, 10,000 gallon lot, 6 cents a gal., 20.8 gal. for a 10-hr, day 1.25 Lubricating oil 1.87 Repairs — 25c to $1.00, but will say 25 This gives a total daily operation cost without counting the driver, of $ 5.60 all of which is cash money that you have to pay out of your own pockets </seg>

When John Jones works horses he buys all of the fuel that goes into those horses from John Jones and there is another difference and that is that for a small additional sum, John Jones can have eight colts com - ing on every year to replace his eight-horse team until when those original mares are eight years old they have entirely replaced them - selves in usuable horses, with a reserve of 300 per cent, all of which are grown on things that have no commercial value to amount to anything and all of which John Jones sells to himself.

For too long a time have our people listened to the seductive siren voices of the high salaried advertising men of tractor manufacturers. For too long a time have our farmers allowed their eyes to be blinded by the glamour of the beautiful pictures of mechanical power - ed farm machinery moving across the highly glazed pages of the periodicals of the country. For too long a time have we farmers been fooled by the idea that the tractor didn't eat when it didn't work and that it required no care when idle, when as a matter of fact, interest and depreciation work 365 days of a year, twenty-four hours a day, and a tractor does re - quire care through the winter if it is not to have depreciation mount - ing at a much faster rate than set forth above. There is one kind of farm relief immediately available to every farmer in America without legislation and without high salaried executives to put it into force and without any doubt ot its efficacy, and that relief lies in methods to be applied by the farmer himself wherein and whereby he buys nothing from anybody else that he can buy from himself; wherein and whereby he utilizes horses to turn into power those things which he raises and for which there is little or no market value. Whereby he utilizes cattle and hogs and sheep to eat up those things which he raises and for which the balance of the consuming public are loath to pay him anything like the cost of pro - duction. It is true the prices of hogs and cattle and sheep are low, but even at the present prices, corn fed to them brings twice as much as if hauled to the elevator. In discussing with many people the cost of maintaining horses both in idleness and at work, and in discussing the costs of the rais - ing of colts and the maintainence of stallions, I have been very much impressed by the lack of exact information on the subject generally. We find one Department in a University setting horse costs at one figure, and another Department of the same University setting them at another. We find some farmers whose costs are high, and some whose costs are low, but in the case of but very few of the people with whom we have discussed horse costs, do we find any study of these costs based on the maximum efficiency developed by a horse of given type when fed different types of rations. It would appear that there has been very little, if any, study along these lines made by the various experimental stations. We find further that there does not seem to be </seg>
            <seg id="p633">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION much consideration given to the size or type of horses used, or to their training or care, in the discussion of mechanical power versus horse power. This seems very strange to me in view of the carefully worked out methods of promoting efficiency of tractor use. During my many years of experience in the United States army, I had an opportunity to observe very carefully the quality of perform - ance rendered by horses of a definite and uniform type chosen for the various tasks to which they were to be assigned. During nearly three years in the Cavalry I had an opportunity to observe closely the per - formance of the Cavalry horse under all conditions of climate that exists in the central and western part of the United States, both in winter and in summer; both where the horse had shelter and when they had none; where they were fed in a manger and where they were fed on the ground or in nose bags. As an Artillery officer and a Quarter Master in charge of trains, I had still further opportunity to study this same question in practically every climate in the United States and in the Philippine Islands. In France, as an inspector of animal transport, this experience was still further widened. During a period of over twenty-five years, I have been responsible for the feeding, the care and the working of at least ten thousand horses and mules; having at sometimes as high as 1400 draft and pack animals in my charge at one time. There - fore I feel that I can speak with some degree of authority upon the subject of rations for draft animals which permit them to be worked at maximum efficiency under the worst of conditions, and I say to you that as the result of these years of experience and study, I am firmly convinced that ninety-five horse users out of one hundred, destroy a large portion of the power in horses by over-feeding or by improper feeding. You, all of you know, that the average ration fed by the average corn belt farmer to his farm horses; the average weight of which will not exceed 1350 pounds, is twelve ears of corn, three times a day and all the hay that the manger will hold, both night and morning. It is generally accepted that average ear of corn will run 100 ears to the bushel or seven-tenths of a pound per ear. This means that a horse getting thirty-six ears of corn a day is getting seven-tenths of that amount in pounds or he is getting 25.2 pounds of corn per day and approximately fifty pounds of hay. Even at present prices this makes his feed costs sixteen cents a day, and the horse is getting a fattening, and not a strengthening ration, since corn was designed to fatten animals and not to make muscle. The result is that this horse cannot begin to develop his maximum efficiency, and in hot weather suffers terribly from the heat. A horse getting a ration of this sort, gets fat, stays fat, and as I again know from my own personal ex- </seg>
            <seg id="p634">KEPORT OF NEBRASKA. STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE yeneuce, an animal that is over fat cannot deliver muscular effort without suffering. The ration which we use is as follows: For horses from 1000 to 1200 pound, we feed 12 pounds of oats and 3 4 pounds of hay as a standard ration. We then watch these horses very carefully and in the case of those that do not entirely consume their feed, we reduce the ration until they do clean their food up completely, but even when a horse fails to thrive and stay in good working condition on this ration, we do not increase it until after we have thoroughly investi - gated the condition of his. teeth, and have treated him for internal parasites. Then if he cannot stay in good condition on this ration, he is not a horse that we want to own and we sell him. With our draft horses, those over 1200 pound in weight, we use a base ration of two pounds of oats and four pounds of hay, and add to that one pound of oats and one pound of hay for each hundred - weight of horse in good working condition. By that is meant a horse whose flesh is firm; wind is good, and whose coat is smooth anil silky, but the outline of whose ribs can be seen under the smooth silky cout and the covering of muscle that lies between the coat and the ribs, we want no surplus fat on our working horses or breeding stock. This means that a horse that weighs 1400 in the field, would weigh 1700 pounds fat. Such a horse eats sixteen pounds of oats and eigh - teen pounds of hay a day when at the hardest sort of work. This gives us a horse feed cost during the working period, and at the pre - vailing prices of hay and grain as follows: live cents worth of oats and a fraction under four cents worth of hay per day. or a total of nine cents. During the time when our horses are idle, they run on pasture, or if there is no grass, and usually there ; s none when our horses are idle, they go through on a ration of shredded fodder or oat straw, with a small feed of legume hay on Friday night of each week and one pound of ground soy beans on Saturday night: The purpose of the legume hay and soy beans is to keep his digestive tract greased and the kidneys in good condition. We work our horses better than two hundred days a year since there is a great deal of hauling about the places to be done after the crops are harvested. It is usually Christmas by the time we have. our corn all out of the fields, and since we raise a large number of hogs and sheep, and feed a good many cattle, it is necessary to keep most of the teams on the roads a good deal of the time. Those not thus em - ployed, are employed in the repairs of fences and. buildings, or turned loose to run in open sheds and eat rough forage in this way. We have an average of about two hundred work days from every horse at </seg>
            <seg id="p635">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION nine cents a day, and one hundred sixty-five days of idleness at ap - proximately 2 Ms cents a day, or a total of $18.00 feed costs during the working period, and $4.12% during his period of idleness, or an annual total of $22.12% for the horse. Charging interest on the horse's cost, labor for caring for him, cost of stabling, veterinary's service, and everything else that can possibly be charged against him, this cost might under some conditions run as high as $30.00 a year or an average of less than ten cents a day, if you charge all his idle time against all of his productive time, as should be done. Since these horses work ten hours a day and produce two mechanical horse power, this gives you a net cost per horse power, per hour, of one-half cent at the outside. In addition to this low cost, our mares will produce 90% of foals per year and nurse them through the first six months of their life. Right here I want to say something about the feeding of pregnant mares and of foals. We make it a practice to work our mares that are with foal as many days in the year as possible, in order that they shall have the maximum number of days of grain feed, and we feed them two ounces of finely ground raw rock phosphate per day during their period of pregnancy. This is the ordinary raw rock phosphate that we purchase to put on our fields and contains 13% of phosphor - ous, about 70% of calcium carbonate, and a considerable amount of magnesium; thus the mare is furnished with additional mineral with which to build the bone of the colt. This feeding of raw rock phos - phate is continued during the entire nursing period, and as soon as the colt begins to eat out of his mother's box, we fix him a separate feed box In which is placed a little grain and some rock phosphate. This feeding of raw rock phosphate is continued until he is three years old. The result of this mineral addition to the ration, has been the development of larger, thriftier foals and there is much more rapid growth on their part after weaning, with the development of a fine quality of bone and good feet. Getting back to the subject of power farming, horse power farm - ing through the grouping of horses into large teams permits the com - bination of farm tools into a string thereof, which makes possible the elimination of much man-labor just as easily as it can be done if a tractor were used to pull such a string. I have talked enough and now propose to show you just exactly how these combinations of horses and tools are handled on our farms. The moving-pictures which I am now about to show you were all made by myself on our own farms and every horse and every machine that you see there in these pictures is doing merely its regular daily routine at that particular time in the crop year in which the picture was taken. </seg>
            <seg id="p636">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I trust that you will find these pictures not only Interesting, but in - structive and assure you that I will be very glad to stop the pictures at any place and answer any questions that are asked, providing we do not run over the limited time permitted to us by the Committee. HITCHING BIG HITCHES O. O. WAGGONER, Denver, Colo. As previous speakers have said, there are certain definite indica - tions of the return of the horse to widespread use as the cheapest source of power on the farms of this and other sections. The demand for horses already is strong enough to hold the price of good young horses to nearly $100 per head. Last week in Denver I saw horses selling at auction for nearly that figure, the best type of good sound young farm horses. Harness men report unusual increases in harness repair business. And accordingly, since many farmers have big machinery, tractor machinery if you please, to which they wish to hitch horses, they are interested in big team hitches. The fact also that by using a big team they can get along with less men and get more work done, is also partially responsible for the increased interest. In hitching a big team there are but a few things necessary which are not already a part of the regular farm equipment. Eveners on the farm now used for four horse teams can be readily converted to three horse or three and one horse eveners to accommodate methods of hitching five, six, eight, ten or twelve horse teams in tandem instead of abreast. You will find after working a hitch of six horses tandem, three and three, that you will never go back to the six-abreast hitch. You will find five horse hitches, three in front and two behind to be so satis - factory that you will not return to the other methods. So it is with the six and eight and larger hitches. The method of hitching with leader lines only and lead chains and buck ropes while at first apparently complicated and impractically con - ceived, will be found to be possessed of move advantages than any other type of hitch. Safety, driving ease, control of unduly horses, equality of pull, access to air, simplicity of control of entire team and flexibility of the team as a whole are advantages which will convert you to the big team type of hitches. Distribution of the load evenly among the horses will be found a marked advantage of this type of hitch. </seg>
            <seg id="p637">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION The biggest factor in the change to this type of hitch for farm work is the preparation of eveners and equipment. Once that is accomplish - ed, however, it is settled for the eveners can be transferred from one machine to another with relatively small difficulty. To equip ones farm with chains and eveners will cost but little money and relatively small amounts of spare time. Equiping harness for the hitches incurs but small initial cost and no replacements above ordinary. Lead chains used In the hitches will replace halter ropes in the barn and save much time. Buck ropes will replace lines on some of the harness and be more handy to use. After equipment, next in importance is a good lead team that will obey commands or can be quickly taught to do so, and. the other horses can be immediately hitched to work under perfect control. With your horses and your equipment you can this spring adopt and use big team hitches to marked advantage. For information and charts on making the hitches, write the extension service of your college, the Horse Association of America or other agencies which will gladly send them to you. HOG PROGRAM Wednesday, January 4, 1933 E. P. BROWN, Arbor, Presiding PIG TROUBIiES L. V. SKIDMORE, Lincoln In years past, in fact ever since the swinii industry assumed pro - portions of the biggest industry of the cornbelt region, hogs have held a very important place in the economic scheme of the cornbelt farmers life and industry. Years ago, the combination of corn and hogs, profitable to a greater degree than many other branches of farming, became known as mortgage lifters. They have continued to hold the important place, the keystone position of the cornbelt farmers economic structure. Today, despite adversity and economic reverses coming successively in the past few years, hogs are the cornerstone of the farm program. And as their importance grew the industry grew and progressed until the system of converting the corn produced by the land into pork at a profit making basis has brought many problems. To meet economic needs it has been necessary to lift the hog from </seg>
            <seg id="p638">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE his natural way of living and reproducing, into artificial methods more suited to the needs of the farmer. This has brought problems which can be traced largely to conditions of growth and management differ - ent from the natural way for hogs to grow. The early farrowing of hogs is the major reason for hog losses. Early farrowing is not natural and therefore incurs difficulties not incurred in the natural system of hog propagation. These unnatural conditions require the farmer to furnish and surround his hogs with equipment and artificial conditions satisfactory to the successful raising of hogs from farrowing time until they are large enough to withstand disease and the effects of our artificial management system. The young pigs are deprived, first of all, of the air, the sunshine, the freedom which they would have under natural condition. Therefore it is necessary to furnish artificial means of protecting from the cold, and death losses due to the elements and exposure. The conditions of climate and diet are important to the health of the hog and hygiene is most important in successfully farrowing hogs early and carrying them through the period o£ young growth. In this discussion of diseases we can put down as a fundamental rule of hog raising, that hygiene and sanitation — carried out by very simple practices on the farm — are essential to successful (arrowing and raising of young hogs. Many of our prevalent hog diseases can be traced to conditions of raising the hogs and the methods of feeding. Anemia, a lack of iron in the blood is due to privation from green feed, clean dirt and the sun. It leads the way to other diseases which produce drastic death tolls. Equip the hog plant so that the pigs can be out of doors in the sun and can eat clean dirt, and anemia will be largely over - come. Other diseases are caused by viruses which take advantage of the weak unhealthy pig. Cholera is the most important, most serious disease of hogs and can only be combatted by regular vaccination. Investment in the hog industry is unsafe without cholera immunization at all times. No part of the hog area is safe at anytime from cholera. Intestinal diseases are combatted by sanitation methods such as clean group, pasturing and cleaning of farrowing lots and houses. Paraisitic diseases are combatted by hygiene, keeping the soil free from Infestation, the pig healthy and strong enough to withstand infection. Worms are due to unsanitary conditions and infected lots. The basic method is sanitation, though ailing hogs may be aided by drugs. </seg>

NEW METHODS IX PORK MERCHANDISING PAUL GOESER, National Meat Board The National Meat Board is a producers organization. Its work is carried on in behalf of their product, for their benefit. It is a co - operative move between producers, packers, processors, retailers and colleges to enlarge the market and increase the consumption of meat. In the interests of pork, there is a great deal of work being done, part of which is these new methods of merchandising that J. am going to demonstrate here todny. The work is being carried to retailers of pork in all parts of the east — the great pork consuming region of this country and the outlet for your pork products. Work is being carried on to combat the vicious propaganda against meat which has brought a continuing decrease in the per capita consumption of pork and other meat products. A notable example of this is the placing o£ charts in all the schools of the country to educate the school stu - dents of the United States to the value of meat as a food. Meat ranks at. the top of every list of foods in all requirements for the human diet. The people of the United States consume 70 pounds of pork per capita — more than one-half of the total amount of all meat consumed. It is the most important part of the meat diet as well as the most im - portant factor of the cornbelt farming industry. "We do not know everything about pork, but we are constantly finding new methods of merchandising the product, new methods of using and cooking it and are trying to take these new methods into the hands of people where they will be put into use for the betterment of the pork industry. We are teaching salesmanship of meat, methods of cutting, dis - playing and new ways of using the products so that the pork will find greater acceptance in the kitchens of America as a food. It is the best meat, and its uses as the best meat must be taught the retailer, the housewife and the consumer, in order to enlarge the market. I am demonstrating these methods of cutting meat and explaining them so that you may see the effort that is being made on behalf of pork and the effects that they are designed to have. You can see that by these processes of boning, rolling and cutting various portions of the pork carcass that they are made more attrac- </seg>

The meth - ods of cutting and preparing the meat for sale that we are demon - strating to retailers in all the cities are designed to replace the meth - ods for early use so that the choice of the housewife and the con - sumer may come into greater play in selecting the meat for the table. PROTEIN SUPPLEMENTS AND LOW-PRICED CORN ■ ■ By A. D. WEBER, Kansas State College One of the problems confronting corn-belt farmers is whether it will pay to buy tankage at $25 a ton when corn is fifteen cents a bushel and hogs are less than $3.00 a hundred. A successful farmer told me recently that it does not pay to supplement corn with tank - age when one hundred pounds of pork is worth ten times as much as one hundred pounds of corn and only twice as much as one hundred pounds of tankage. He was mistaken, of course; but merely saying that bogs need a protein supplement is not very convincing in the face of such price relationships. And one can find plenty of farmers who say they raise fairly good hogs without a protein supplement. Raising hogs without a protein suppliment is like growing toma - toes without soil. In a recent cartoon Ripley told that at the Smith - sonian Institution tomatoes were grown without soil. But occasion - ally believe-it-or-not statements are not so unusual when all the fuels are revealed. This tomato plant, according to Ripley, was grown in an artificial light with a solution of nitrate and sulphate tin- a soil substance, the seeds being placed in thin blotting paper beds to keep the temperature constant. The farmer who first produces hogs successfully on only corn will deserve even greater recognition than Ripley can give in a cartoon. Corn is notoriously deficient in protein while the dry matter of muscles, hair, nerves and other tissues of hogs is largely protein. Of course, if the hog could make essential body proteins from the carbohydrate of corn, the problem would be solved. But no animal, not even man, can depend upon carbohydrates for its protein requirements. This fact has been demonstrated many times in experiments just as original and interesting as the one in which tomatoes were grown without soil. What farmers really mean when they say they raise fairly good hogs without a protein supplement is that they do not purchase pro - tein supplements. When such cases are investigated it almost in - variably will be found that the hogs are fed skim milk or else have the run of a field or feed lot where, in addition to corn, they have access </seg>
            <seg id="p641">XEHRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION to legume hay or carcasses of some kind. And in the majority o£ cases the hogs handled in this manner do not make maximum gains, doubtless because they are unable to locate enough protein. Modern hog raising is just as difficult a job as growing tomatoes without soil. A tomato seed will not grow into a plant and develop fruit if kept in a jar of distilled water. It is perfectly obvious that a pig will not grow and fatten if kept without feed in a dry lot. Such conditions do not even approximate those which nature provided for tomatoes and hogs in their wild state. In the soil are nutrients which a sprouted tomato seed can transform with the aid of water and sun - light into foliage and fruit. And by eating nutrients stored In plants and lowly animal life, the primitive hog slowly grew to maturity. It is only when scientists and intelligent farmers understand the habits and nutritive requirements of tomatoes and hogs, that tomatoes can be grown without soil and fall pigs made ready for market at six months of age. All the nutrients, except protein and occasionally minerals, are supplied in adequate amounts by homegrown feeds plus water and sunlight. Protein is usually available in concentrated form only as a by-product of some manufacturing process. Because of this fact, protein supplements are relatively high priced when compared with homegrown grains and roughages. Therefore in studying the practical aspects of the nutritive requirements of hogs, iittention should be cen - tered on the values and prices of protein supplements. Let us. then, consider the advisability of paying twenty-five dollars a ton for tankage when the elevator price of corn is fifteen cents a bushel; It has been repeatedly demonstrated that for fatten - ing fall piss one pound of tankape will save five pounds of corn. Approximately s-ix and one-half bushels of corn and forty pounds of tankage are required for one hundred pounds pain, while at least ten bushels are necessary when no protein supplement is fed. In other words, fifty cents invested in tankage at present prices will save corn worth fifty-three cents. Protein supplements stimulate a pigs appetite. Greater feed con - sumption results in faster gains; hence, time is saved in getting pigs ready for market when a protein supplement is-- fed. Thrifty fall pigs weighing seventy-five to one hundred pounds should average two hun - dred twenty-five pounds in three months if fed a balanced ration; but if only corn is fed they will not attain this weight in less than five or six months, and only then when they are fed on pasture as soon as it becomes available in the spring. A protein supplement does more than stimulate the appetite and reduce the amount of corn required per unit of gain. An adequate </seg>
            <seg id="p642">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE supply of protein is good health insurance. Pigs fed a ration deficient in protein are more susceptible to disease and lack the vigor and bloom of pigs fed a balanced ration. The danger of death loss is further minimized by the fact that pigs fed a protein supplement are ready for market when considerably younger than those fed corn alone. We are justified in concluding, therefore, that even at present low grain prices much better results are obtained with corn and tankage than with corn alone. Larger and more thrifty pigs are also produced on corn and alfalfa hay than on corn alone. However, in comparisons of tankage and alfalfa hay, tankage has given better results. Between the weights of seventy-five and two hundred twenty-five pounds, pigs pain ap - proximately one-half pound per head daily more on corn and tankage than on corn and alfalfa hay. In other words, tankage-fed pigs will be ready for market about fifty days sooner than alfalfa-fed pigs. Despite the superiority of tankage over alfalfa liny in correcting of the protein deficiencies of corn, alfalfa hay has a higher vitamin content than tankage. So it is not surprising that a combination of these supplements produces better results than either one ted alone. This advantage is manifested by larger aiid cheaper gains and more thrifty appearing pigs. In a test at the Nebraska Agricultural Experi - ment Station twenty-four pounds of alfalfa hay. when fed in con - junction with corn and tankage, replaced thirteen pounds of tankage in producing one hundred pounds gain. Furthermore, the addition of alfalfa hay increased the rate of gain one-fifth of a pound per pig daily. Many attempts have been made to improve tankage and alfalfa hay. In addition to mill feeds, cottonseed, linseed, soybean, corn gluten, and alfalfa meals have been combined with tankage by investi - gators in their search for the perfect protein supplement. It is gen - erally known that the results obtained witli such mixtures at some agricultural experiment stations do not check with those at others. However, investigators are agreed that a considerable pail of the superiority of various Trinity mixtures over tankage alone is due to alfalfa. Other factors that possibly influenced the results where these comparisons were made are: previous treatment of the experimental pigs; initial weight; length of feeding period and kind of pasture. In practically all cases, the advantage of Trinity mixtures has been less marked where fed to heavier pigs. Likewise, a mixture of tankage and one of the oil meals has frequently given no better results than straight tankage when fed with corn to fattening pigs on alfalfa pas - ture. The upshot of the whole thing appears to be that high grade tankage plus green leafy alfalfa hay or alfalfa pasture provide such a variety of proteins and vitamins that it is not an easy matter to find a combination of feeds that will consistently produce better results. </seg>
            <seg id="p643">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION The Trinity mixture originated at the Wisconsin Agricultural Experiment Station. It consists of a mixture by weight of two parts tankage, one part linseed oil meal, and one part alfalfa meal. The best known of the modified Trinity mixtures was developed at the Ne - braska Agricultural Experiment Station. It differs from the Wisconsin mixture in that cotton-seed meal is substituted for linseed oil meal. If alfalfa meal is not available for use in these mixtures, just as good results will be secured by feeding alfalfa hay in a rack. For feeding on pasture, equal parts of tankage and linseed or cottonseed meal are often used. These mixtures have frequently given better results than straight tankage and have seldom proved inferior to tankage. Therefore the farmer who wishes to use every possible means to get maximum re - turns from his hogs is doubtless justified in feeding one of the Trinity mixtures. True, the difference in returns, if any, will probably be small, but even small returns have unusual significance nowadays. Many farmers object to the trouble and extra labor involved in preparing supplimentary mixtures. However, this attitude has lit tie bearing on returns from hog feeding for those who realize the import - ance of a protein supplement and feed tankage and alfalfa hay. Of coursp, should the spread in price between tankage and the oil meal become much wider than at present, more consideration should be given to the Trinity mixtures. To produce satisfactory results, supplementary feeds must con - tain high quality protein. In other words, a pound of protein in one feed may be much more valuable than a similar amount in another feed because it contains a more complete assortment of amino acids, com - monly called the building stones of proteins. Since tankage is of animal origin it contains a wide assortment of amino acids in appar - ently the amounts needed by a fattening pig. Some protein-rich feeds contain large amounts of certain amino acids but only traces of others. A pig may receive liberal amounts of such a supplementary feed yet starve because of a lack of the right kind of protein. Most proteins of plant origin are inadequate for fattening hogs. For example: At the Kansas Agricultural Experiment Station, Aubel found that in each one of several experiments, corn gluten meal was decidedly inferior to tankage. That this poor showing was because of unbalanced protein, was demonstrated by the addition of minerals to the corn plus corn gluten meal ration. Similarly, linseed meal and cottonseed meal have proved unsatisfactory when fed as the only supplements to corn at the Kansas and other Agricultural Experiment Stations. No combination of these feeds has been found that equals tankage. Apparently they give satisfactory results only when com - bined with tankage or skim milk. </seg>
            <seg id="p644">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Soybean oil meal, when its mineral deficiencies are corrected, com - pares favorably with tankage. It is one of the best protein supple - ments of plant origin. Extensive experiments at the Illinois Agricul - tural Experiment Station, however, have proven conclusively that the oil In whole soybeans causes soft pork. Since it is impossible to tell by looking at a hog whether he has been fed whole soybeans, there is a natural tendency for packers to pay less for all hogs from areas where soybeans are widely grown and fed. Consequently, it would seem highly desirable that hog raisers in such areas refrain from feed - ing whole soybeans. Of course, they can help provide a market for their soybeans by purchasing soybean oil meal. Soybeans may also be disposed of to good advantage by feeding them as a protein supple - ment to breeding hogs. In addition to differences in quality of protein, supplementary feeds vary greatly in mineral content. Tankage, manufactured by reputable concerns, provides all the minerals necessary when used alone or with alfalfa to supplement corn or other grains. Likewise, skim milk is an excellent source of minerals as well as protein. A mineral mixture, however, should lie fed with soybean oil meal. In fact, whenever a protein supplement of plant origin comprises fifty per cent or more of a supplementary feed, it will be advisable to allow pigs free access to a simple mineral mixture. The following inexpen - sive mixture is entirely adequate and appears to be the choice of the majority of those who are called upon to make recommendations on minerals: Special steamed bone meal, forty pounds; finely ground limestone, forty pounds; and common salt, twenty pounds. To those who commonly feed a mineral mixture as a precautionary measure; It is intresting to know that this one is as good as any other and cheaper than most mineral mixtures. A volume could be written on protein supplements. But regard - less of the length of the discussion, skim milk deserves honorable mention because it is the best protein supplement of all. Fortunate indeed is the farmer who has bright leafy alfalfa hay and skim milk to provide sufficent protein for all of his fall pigs. The principal difficulty is that enough skim milk is usually not available to furnish the required amount of protein. For pigs fed in a dry lot one gallon of skim milk per head daily is necessary while half this amount will balance the ration of pigs fed on good pasture. Because protein is more expensive than other nutrients and also because excess protein in the ration serves the same purpose as cheap carbohydrate in corn, it is important that only enough protein sup - plement be fed to balance the ration properly. When corn is self-fed, tankage and alfalfa hay may also be fed in this manner. But if the pigs are not on a full feed of corn, or if a self feeder is not available. </seg>
            <seg id="p645">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION i it will be necessary to handfeed the tankage in troughs. One-third to one-half of a pound of tankage per pig daily should provide suf - ficient protein for dry lot pigs that have free access to leafy alfalfa hay. Less than this amount or about one-fourth pound per head daily is enough for pigs on good alfalfa pasture. The protein supplement problem is not solved when the fattening hogs are taken care of; concentrates must be also given the brood sows. The principles involved are the same for both sows and pigs, although greater dependence can be placed on alfalfa hay for sows. In fact, the brood sow's need for protein will be met if she gets all the bright, leafy fourth cutting alfalfa hay she will eat plus just enough grain to keep her in a good thrifty breeding condition. In addition, one-fourth of a pound of tankage or its equivalent should be fed per sow daily four to six weeks before farrowing. After farrowing entirely satis - factory results will be obtained when the sows and pigs receive the same ration. Feeding a protein supplement insures the farmer more for his corn than he would have received had no supplement been fed; but it does not guarantee him cost of production plus a reasonable profit for his corn crop. Profits are determined by a multitude of factors, many of which are not under the farmer's control. But as long as corn is fed to hogs, it will pay to use a protein supplement. PIGS IN THE CORNFIELD W. J. LOEFFEL, Lincoln This will be a resume of results of an 85 day cornfield feeding test conducted with six lots of pigs at the experiment station here. It is interesting to note that this is the first 85 day cornfield feeding test ever carried on in the cornbelt by any of the various experiment sta - tions. : A number of tests for thirty days have been completed, but tests over a longer period of time, such as might be required for hogs to clean up a field of corn have not been conducted prior to this one. The test was completed December 10 and during the eighty-five days, mild weather prevailed with the exception of one period of cold weather rather early. The factor of mild weather is one to be con - sidered as it determines the feeding period available to the farmer for running his hogs in the corn field. It can be seen from the following results that the lot having access to self-fed tankage gained three .times as rapidly as the lot having corn alone and that the tankage consumed by the pigs eating it from </seg>

One lot was fed in a dry lot and it can be seen that the pigs in the corn field used somewhat more corn in making 100 pounds of pork than those in the dry lot. The experiment, however, did not take into consideration the wastes from shelling and the amounts con - sumed by birds and etc. Prom the results of the test, however ,1 believe that it is readily apparent that cornfield feeding is entirely practical and advisable in that it saves the labor of picking the corn and feeding it to the hogs. As in other methods of feeding on pasture or in the dry lot, it is nec - essary to feed supplements in order to produce the cheapest and most effective gains. It is interesting to note that the lot furnished alfalfa hay made re - markable use of it as a supplement in that one pound of hay saved two and one-half pounds of corn in the ration. Another lot given access to sweetclover pasture during the feeding experiment proved that sweetclover hay was but slightly less effective than tankage in produc - ing gains with corn. </seg>

DERRICK Claus Von Boenig of Blue Hill set a new state pork production record to win the 1932 pig crop contest and gain the honor of being Nebraska's champion pork producer. Von Boenig set a new state record of 1,991 pounds of pork per sow in 180 days time, and won first in the market division of the con - test. His six sows raised nine pigs each. Erling German of Cozad was not far behind the champion in the market class. His 23 sows raised eight pigs each. His litters averaged 1,904 pounds and the pigs averaged 238 pounds each at the end of the 180 days. The pigs were farrowed on moveable houses on clean ground as were the majority of the pigs in the contest. German finished his pigs on a ration of corn, skim milk, mineral, cornfield and alfalfa pasture. Von Boenig used rations containing Corn, Oats, Wheat, Barley, Tankage, Skimmilk, Alfalfa, Mineral, and Alfalfa pasture. Masden Brothers o£ Wolbach finished in third place in the con - test in the market class. They had 1.G47 pounds of weight with !&gt; pigs per litter when finished and the pigs weighed 18:! pounds each. H. L. Yerkes of Phillips won the purebred division with Levi Burton of Bartley taking second. Yerkes had an average weight of 16G4 pounds per litter with six sows averaging 8.17 pigs each. The pigs averaged 203.79 pounds.

            <seg id="p654">REPORT OF NEBRASKA. STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE JOINT SESSION NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION And NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS ASSOCIATION Wednesday, January 4, 1933 DAN M. HILDEBRAXD, Presiding 11ETTEK FARM PASTURES R. R. THALMAN It is an old but accurate statement that says "nothing will take the place of good pasture in livestock management". Under present conditions, it is next to impossible to profitably maintain a breeding herd of beef cows without it. On the other hand, good pastures and livestock make a combination hard to surpass by any other type of agricultural pursuit. Livestock on pasture are living in their most natural environment and nothing seems to be more conducive to the health and contentment of an animal than grass. It supplies an abundance of protein, vitamins, and minerals so essential to the well being of older animals and normal growth of the young. It furnishes a place for exercise, fresh air, and sunshine, all of which hold a mighty important place in the prevention of disease. Unfortunately, however, too many farms upon which livestock are kept are entirely without pasture, or else the so-called pasture is little more than a place for exercise, being almost devoid of vegetation, especially during mid - summer when good grass is most needed. This condition is brought about by two factors: (1) not all farms ever contained an area suit - able to native pasture, and (2) pasture lands of native sod have been allowed to deteriorate beyond rejuvenation. The cause may be due to an increase of weeds, to abnormal climate, to bad handling of the livestock, or to various allied conditions. Whatever their cause, poor pastures are too much in evidence. In many cases the only logical corrective measure for rundown pastures seems to be the plow, re - placing the native sod with annual or short-lived perennial crops. </seg>
            <seg id="p655">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION Thus, temporary pastures are slowly gaining headway in the Corn iien. Interest in these temporary pasture crops has been slow in develop - ing, but it must come into common use if the farmer who raises live - stock is to obtain the maximum pasturage from a given acreage. Even the most casual observer recognizes that the native pastures, which have for the most part been taken by blue grass, are not returning enough on the investment. One of the chief criticisms of the perman - ent pasture is its low carrying capacity. The unfavorable growth habit of blue grass in this territory also adds to the interest in some of the temporary pasture crops. Unlike blue grass, these do not dry up and become unpalatable to livestock during the hot summer months of July and August when succulent pasturage is most needed. In the opinion of many practical stockmen and farmers, these advantages of the temporary pastures in the Corn Belt more than offset the extra labor and expense of frequent seeding. Temporary pastures also lend themselves to the production of hay if a surplus of pasturage should occur. They lit into a farm rotation system which makes it possible to maintain or rebuild the fertility of the soil. This is especially true where legumes are included in the pasture plans. The most important and commonly used temporary pasture crops in this region are sweet clover, sudan grass, and winter rye. In the more easterly sections of the state and the Corn Belt, it is quite common to sow oats with the sweet clover as a nurse crop. Such pastures fit admirably into a rotation plan which makes forage available in abund - ance throughout the entire pasture season, from early in April until after frost. Just when each of these crops will furnish pasture, ol course, will vary from year to year, but generally speaking one may expect in southeastern Nebraska the pasture season to be about as follows: Rye — April 1 to June 1. Sudan grass — June 20 to October 1. 1st Year Sweet Clover — June 15 to November 1. 2nd Year Sweet Clover — May 1 to August 1. Native sod (blue grass) — May 1 to November 1. Sudan may be planted immediately following rye on the same piece of ground, in which case the Sudan pasture is available around July 1. Similarly, the opening date for first-year sweet clover may be altered from the above by sowing oats as a nurse crop. In this case, pasture is available a week or 10 days earlier. Because of the increasing importance of the pasture problem, par - ticularly the temporary pasture, the Nebraska Station started an ex - perimental pasture project last spring. The first of these experi - ments was just completed and it is the object of this paper to briefly </seg>
            <seg id="p656">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Hummerize the results. More data are necessary betore sweeping con - clusions can be made, but it is gratifying to know that the results of this tests are in close agreement with several years of practical ex - perience with such pastures at the University. Yearling steers were used to determine carrying capacity and the results secured are reported in steer-days per acre of pasture. A steer - day is used to represent 24 hours of continuous grazing for one animal. During the time the steers were on pasture, April 18 to October 14, a total of 179 days, they gained an average of 24 6 pounds per head, or 1.37 pounds daily. No significant difference in gain existed between the steers on blue grass or any of the temporary pastures. Their physical condition on all pastures was excellent and no signs of bloat occurred in any of the sweet clover lots. These results agree with 17 years of pasture experience with the University breeding herd. On the basis of yield, the temporary pasture crops were far in the lead of native sod. The latter produced 145 steer days' pasturage per acre as against 159 for rye, 165 for first-year yellow sweet clover, and approximately 200 for the white variety, 220 for second-year sweet clover, and 177 for spring seeded sudan grass. Sudan planted on the same ground immediately following rye produced 153 steer days per acre, which, when added to the rye, gives 312 steer days of pasturage from one acre. Difference in yield of forage between the native sod and the temporary crops is even more significant when length of the pasture season for each crop is considered. Rye and second-year sweet clover carried three steers, first-year sweet clover and sudan grass 2 steers, and native sod 1 steer per acre during the pasture season. The common criticism of native sod (blue grass) drying up during mid - summer did not apply the past season. This was probably due to a much-greater-than-normal rainfall during July and August. Even under such favorable conditions, it did not yield with the temporary crops. On the basis of yield, it would appear that the temporary pasture plan is the best way of increasing the carrying capacity of farm pas - tures. No one such crop, because of the comparatively short pasture season, will be a competitor of native sod. The practicability of tem - porary pastures, therefore, depends upon a combination of two or more crops that will insure a long and continuous grazing season. Two different plans designed to take care of this problem might be pre - sented. Both have been used at the University with marked success. A Rye and Sweet Clover Pasture Plan. One of the most satisfactory pasture plans includes rye and sweet clover. Rye is introduced into this rotation since it extends the graz - ing season approximately one month by furnishing an abundance of </seg>
            <seg id="p657">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION pasture in April and early May before the second-year sweet clover is available. The ground used for the rye can be replanted to corn intended for silage or to sudan grass in case the first-year sweet clover acreage does not prove sufficient. This plan makes pasture available from about April 15 until frost and gives a much higher carrying capacity per acre than does blue grass. In planning the acreage necessary for such a combination, the carrying capacity of the second-year sweet clover should be taken as a basis, if sudan is used to follow the rye. This is desirable since first-year clover gives a lower carrying capacity than the second-year crop. Basing the acreage upon the latter insures against too much pasture during the latter part of June and the forepart of July. "While there is some overlapping of the first and second-year sweet clover, the growth obtained upon the flrst-year crop during June and July will not make the pasture unpalatable to stock. Should it seem de - sirable, and especially if oats are used as a nurse crop, the pasture could be cut high and the hay taken off without serious damage to the following pasturage. Should sudan not be used as a supplement to the first-year sweet clover, it might even prove economical to fall plow a portion of the first-year sweet clover to prevent a wastage of pasture the following season. Under this plan, more sweet clover would be planned each year than would be needed the second year for pasture. A Rye, Sudan, and Blue Grass l'asturc Plan In certain localities farmers maintain that it is impossible to use sweet clover as a pasture crop without danger to cattle or sheep from bloat. Obviously these men would not use sweet clover as a pasture crop. A plan is, therefore, suggested which includes rye and sudan together with the blue grass. Rye coming on about April 15 and continuing until June 1 gives an abundance of early pasture and at the same time gives the blue grass an opportunity to make considerable growth before it is needed. If sudan is planned on the same ground following the rye, it will not be available until about the first week in July. If corn or some other crop is planted on the rye ground and an area reserved for spring-planted sudan, the sudan pasture will be available some three weeks earlier, or around June 15 or 20. In either events, there will be a period from June 1 to June 15 or July 15 ( depending upon whether sudan is planted following rye) when it will be necessary to turn to some other crop for pasture. Blue grass can be used during this time. It will have made a heavy growth and will probably not be pastured for more than 3 to 5 weeks. Because of this short pasture season, the blue grass can be grazed at the rate of 3 or 4 steers per acre. The sudan will furnish good pasturage during the remainder of the summer or until frost, unless taken by </seg>
            <seg id="p658">REPORT OF NEBRASKA, STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE chinch bugs In September. Should this occur, it would be possible to go on to the blue grass again for the late fall pasture. The advantages of the rye,, blue grass, and sudan grass pasture rotation are several. The carrying capacity is increased practically two fold over straight blue grass. Furthermore, pasture is available at all seasons In abundance, and there is little danger from being short of pasture during July and August as is so frequently the case with blue grass. Should there be an overabundance of sudan for pasture at any time during the summer, a hay crop can be taken off. The next growth which comes on in a short time can be pastured again. There is positively no danger of bloat in the livestock, but caution should be exercised in pasturing sudan after frost because of Its poisonous properties at that time. DISCUSSION OF FOREGOING SUBJECT — Lead by P. H. Stewart Q. -When can Rye be seeded for pasture and when does it come on? Referred to Gramlich. A. We have seeded rye here at the experimental station as early as the first week in August and had good pasture by late September. Q. Is there any rule to follow 'to avoid bloat on sweetclover? A. The character of the causes of sweetclover bloat are unknown and account of its unexplainuble appearances cannot be Riven so noth - ing but experience can suide one in pasturing sweetclover. Q. Is it advisable to have other pastures available when using sweetclover, i.e. run the stock on both pastures at the same time? A. That practice has proven very successful for some men- in avoiding bloat from sweetclover and can be commended. Q. How high should sudan be before turning stock on to pasture? A. Sudan should be about six inches high to start pasturing very light and should be allowed to get ten inches or so high before pas - tured enough to keep it down. This enables root systems to develop. Q. If you cannot pasture sweetclover what would you recom - mend to fill the June lapse between Rye and Sudan in a temporary pasture rotation. A. The solution of that problem is best gained by reseeding a portion of the land to permanent pasture for this particular purpose. </seg>
            <seg id="p659">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION WE ARE LONG ON SHORTENING By MILLARD LANGFELD, The Cudahy Packing Co. We are long on shortening. The selling price emphasizes this fact. Shortenings are of two classes, depending upon their source; namely, vegetable and animal. The principal vegetable shortening is made from cottonseed oil; the most widely used animal shortening is, as you know, lard. If selling price is an index of the people's preference, then vegetable shortening occupies first place. The purpose of this paper is to explain why we are long on shortening as a whole, and especially why we are very long on lard. Three circumstances contribute, principally, to the United States being long on shortening. 1. Increased production of both vegetable and animal fats. 2. The gradual shrinkage in export trade in lard. , 3. The gradual substitution over the years of an increasing amount of vegetable oils for use in baking and margarine manufacturing. . If we study the slide now thrown on the screen (No. 1) we see it summarizes the per capita consumption of food stuffs in the United States. It compares the consumption of the year 1900 with the year 13 29. You will notice that the per capita consumption of tats and oils has risen from 34 pounds to 44 pounds, an increase of 29.4%. With the exception of sugar, the consumption of which in this same period has increased 69.2%, the per capita consumption of fats and oils has increased the greatest. Notice that our consumption of meat has decreased 4.8%, that our consumption of wheat flour has decreased 21.2%; but also notice particularly that the consumption of dairy products has increased 23.8%. We believe it would be profitless to try to explain that the items shown on this chart balance each other in such a way that the ingredients of one type of food have been substituted for those con - tained in another. We take this viewpoint because we think in - sufficient collateral data makes comparison impossible. However, it is quite evident that our meat consumption has decreased, and that our protein intake derived from meat has been partly supplied by the protein obtained from dairy products. The decrease in the per capita consumption of wheat flour is strik - ing and it is our opinion that this is directly related to the increase in consumption of sugar. (2) The gradual shrinkage in export trade. It we look at the </seg>
            <seg id="p660">REPORT OF NEBRASKA. STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE slide now thrown on the screen (No. 2) which has to do only with the production and export of lard from 1910 to 1932, you will notice how our export trade has fallen off since 1928. The high figure found be - tween the year 1921 and 1925 is probably explained by the fact that the people of continental Europe were making up for the depletion of fat suffered during the war. Following this period our high point was the year 1928 with 46% of lard exported; then 19 29 with 45% ex - ported. Two years later (1931) 34% was exported, and the estimate for 1932 is that we will export about 30%. But the slide just shown you only tells something of our export trade in lard in relation to production. It does not give us concrete figures of total production and export in any one year, nor does it take into consideration other animal fats nor what is highly im - portant to us, the production and export of vegetable oils. Slide No. 3 gives us this data for the year 1930, a really good year In the exportation of lard. The figures presented are undoubtedly the most impressive that we will have to show you, and we trust will linger longest in your minds after leaving here. They tell a story to the farmer and business 'man in the corn belt that might well make him wonder why he did not awaken earlier to the dangers in the pro - motion and use of vegetable oils as substitutes for lard, and why the resources of these states were not used long ago to conteruct tliia trend. f Because in speaking of shortenings we have in mind principally those made of vegetable oils and lard, the chief interest in the data thrown on the screen is in our production and exportation of vege - table oils and lard. Notice that our production of vegetable oils taken together amounted to 2,110,000,000 pounds, of which we exported only 53,000,000 pounds. Compare these amounts with the total produc - tion of lard for 1930 of 1,600,000,000 of which we exported 656,000, - 000 pounds. Subtracting the export trade in each of these items we have remaining for consumption in the United States 2,057,000,000 pounds of vegetable oils, and 944,000,000 pounds of lard; a total of 3,001,000,000 pounds of fat to be consumed. And these amounts do not include 2,100,000,000 pounds of butter and 150,000,000 pounds of oleo oil and tallow. In the year 1930, as we will show you in a later graph, the mar - garine industry used 200,000,000 pounds of vegetable oil of which the bulk was cocoanut oil, from which we can infer that approximately a somewhat larger amount of cotton-seed oil than lard was consumed as shortening. It is quite probable that our production of both cotton - seed oil and lard has been the same since 1930, but our exports in lard, as we have previously shown you, have fallen off about 11%. The result has been that we have had just that much more lard to </seg>
            <seg id="p661">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION sell in our own markets, and lard has become increasingly more dif - ficult to sell because of the fact that refined and hydrogenated cot - tonseed oil products perform functions in cake making which lard will not, and because of the consumate skill in advertising by which these shortenings are promoted. The Margarine Industry, in the beginning, used animal fats ex - clusively. The first margarine was made from beef fat and later neutral lard was used. However, by 1916 we were using 50,000,000 pounds of vegetable fat in the Margarine Industry. Slide No. 4 is a graph showing margarine production as related to the consumption of fat from 1916-1932. It permits of a ready grasp of the tremendous growth of the Margarine Industry; and also how in this growth there was a gradual substitution of vegetable for animal fat in its manufacture. Notice especially that in the year 1919 approximately equal amounts of vegetable and animal fats were used; namely, about 125 million pounds. But from that year vegetable fats increased in proportion, reaching a climax about 1930 when approximately 200 million pounds of vegetable fat was used and only about 50 million pounds of animal fat. In other words, in 1930 the amount of animal fat used in the Mar - garine industry had fallen to the consumption of 1916. Moreover t with the decrease in the production and consumption of margarine, and de - spite the fact that a certain number of states have limited the amount of vegetable oils permitted in the manufacture of Margarine, the amount of animal fat used has diminished faster in proportion than vegetable fat. As a result, it is estimated that the consumption by this industry in 1932 will probably be no more than 15 million pounds. What has been done, and what can be done to take care of this huge under consumption of animal fat? It is patent to everyone that low priced lard means low priced hogs. Slide No. 0 shows the price trend of hog and lard prices covering the years 1898 to 1932. We need not point out that hog and lard prices when viewed at long range, follow a fairly parallel course, rising and falling together. The greatest discrepancy is exhibited dur - ing the war period when lard sold relatively higher than the live animal. But this is an abnormality we should not permit to con - fuse us. One proposal to conteract our surplus in lard is to limit the num - ber of hogs raised in the country. Another to fatten them less. You know better than I the difficulties this proposal has encountered. Slide No. O. We will not stop to discuss this slide except to call </seg>
            <seg id="p662">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE your attention to the fact that apparently hard times or periods of depression is reflected in reduced average weight of hogs. Another proposal suggested, and already partly carried out in some agriculture states, has been to pass laws limiting the amount of vegetable fats used in Margarine. A step farther would be exclusion of vegetable oil products from animal fat producing states. We do not believe this type of legislation desirable, and we have shown you that such laws as are at present in force have not increased the amount of animal fat used in margarine. Still another proposal, which is now being put into practice is to promote and advertise the use of lard to counteract the promotional propaganda under which our people were misled to use vegetable oils in place of animal fats. This undoubtedly is the wisest suggestion so far made, and large numbers of present consumers of vegetable short - enings are being won back, especially in the corn states to the use of lard again for uses for which it was previously discontinued. But lard has its limitations in baking because it falls short of being an all round shortening, a characteristic which must be conceded to the hydrogenated vegetable shortenings. Therefore, were we able to re - store lard into favor, we could anticipate that its consumption would be restricted to its ultility. It is obvious, then, that unless the sphere of lard is widened we cannot compete successfully with the better veg - etable shortenings. Is it possible to widen this sphere? It is, pro - vided lard can be transformed into a product having additional uses; that is to say, having universal usefulness. I ajn happy to be able to tell you that our laboratory has accomplished all these things, and that our company is now manufacturing and marketing a product made of lard which is on an equal plane with the best shortenings. I trust you will pardon the personal note in the rest of my narra - tive. What I am about to tell you I think will deeply interest you be - cause it seems to offer a potential solution of the problem of bringing back hog prices. We believe you would like to hear how this problem presented itself to our laboratory, and what we had to do to lard in order to give it wider workability. A time-worn proverb tells us, "Necessity is the mother of inven - tion." Our new product illustrates this proverb. We believe our com - pany envisioned what was happening to lard in advance of other packers. Five years ago we began to grapple with the problem of placing lard again in its former high position in the household and bakeries. We saw the necessity for lard being altered so that it would meet a wider public demand, or otherwise let it inevitably sink in price to the level of inedible fats. At that price it would go into the soap kettle. Two and one-half years were spent in research before </seg>
            <seg id="p663">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION our labors were crowned with success. We invented a process, the first of its kind in the animal field, by which lard is advanced to first place in the shortening field. We were able to patent both process and product. We have given the product a trade name but on the package is plainly printed "this product is refined from pure lard which has been improved by hydrogenation." ■ _ -■ t But I have run a little ahead of my story. Just what we have accomplished will be made clearer if we contrast the ordinary lard of commerce with the hydrogenated lard which we are now offering as a competitor to vegetable shortenings. Viewing it in its historical aspect, we must say that lard for gen - erations was assumed to be a finished product, and as such would always hold its place in the kitchen. It was taken for granted it would not have serious competition from other fats. We know that the quality of lard marketed in the past and even today grades from very poor to excellent, and that the best falls short of being ideal. The manufacturing of lard is even now imperfectly understood; a fact brought home to us by its lack of uniformity. We know that identical manufacturing operations result at one time in a lard which grades much higher than that produced at another time. This is the result not only of the unknown factors in the varying rendering operations, but also to the character of animals slaughtered. Over the variability in animals purchased, we have only minor control. As a result we have to contend not only with variations in the hardness or softness of the l'at as found naturally in different locations in the animal, but the fat as a whole may be hard or soft. This much has been said to illustrate lack of uniformity, and to point to a weakness or soft spot in the lard market vulnerable to competition by a more uniform fat. How did the vegetable oil products come to compete with lard? Despite the fact that lard has always been relatively cheap', it, never - theless, has been above the buying capacity of some of our population, at least there have always been those who needed a cheaper fat. About two generations ago cottonseed oil began to be promoted as a cheap substitute for animal fats. A little later, mixtures of it and lard, or cottonseed oil and oleo stearine, became shortening entities. When the selling of cottonseed oil, perse, and mixtures made with it began to be offered for use in cookery, they were sold frankly as lard substitutes. These earlier lard substitutes had the odor and flavor of cottonseed oil, and were not acceptable to those who could buy some - thing better. Indeed, there was an appreciable social stigma attached to the purchase of substitutes. Very gradually, however, the sub - stitutes were improved, and when the process of hydrogenation was invented, improvements followed very fast. A large firm in this country purchased the English patents and made important technical </seg>
            <seg id="p664">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE changes in the process. Finally this company evolved from cotton - seed oil a very superior product. Through refining and hydrogen - ation, both odor and flavor were completely eliminated. Its keeping quality was much improved. A very desirable consistency was given to the oil by the hardening process. Refining and deodorization made it neutral as to Free Fatty Acid, and because of this fact, the oil could be heated to the highest temperature required for deep frying and yet not smoke. This product was found also to cream better than either lard or butter, and for this reason could be used in cakes. These attributes or added constants of the hydrogenated cottonseed oil have been detailed because it was through this portal that cottonseed oil primarily, and later other vegetable oils, successfully entered the shortening field. After producing a superior product out of cottonseed oil, the manu - facturers began to promote it on a large and ever increasing scale. Use was made of the fact that lard has very definite limitations. Its specific odor and flavor, low smoke point, lack of uniformity, and keeping property, and poor creaming quality, were contrasted with this hydrogenated cottonseed oil. Because the processed oil had real merit, it began to replace lard. It gained in favor, and the selling price was raised. To some extent it came into competition with butter because butter has two important objections in cooking: namely, a low smoke point and it does not cream as well as a hydrogenated product. With increase in consumption, the price of hydrogenated cotton - seed oil continued mounting, reaching its peak during the prosperous years of 1928 and 1929, at the summit retailing at 25 cents a pound. The public showed its approval by buying this product in such large quantities that the use of lard in baking diminished, and with diminu - tion in sales the price sank to lower and lower levels. We witnessed the sorry spectacle this year of lard selling under 3 cents a pound re - tail beside cottonseed oil shortening at between 19 and 2 2 cents per pound. Besides cottonseed oil, other vegetable oils are being hydrogenated, such as cocoanut, peanut, sunflower, palm oil, etc. At the height of the inflation, unusual quantities of sardine and whale oil were processed, refined and hydrogenated. The purpose behind the hydrogenation of these other oils was always the same, to obtain a better price thru converting them into a higher grade product with a wider utility. We do not question that live hog prices would have fallen along with other commodities, under our altered economic conditions; but we feel that the low point reached was far lower than would have been the case had not the use of lard been replaced by hydrogenated veg - etable shortenings. The Packer is not entirely blameless for the pres- </seg>
            <seg id="p665">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION ent position of lard. He took lard for granted — that is, a continued demand for lard was taken for granted. He was apathetic not only to the increasing consumption by hydrogenated vegetable products, but he abetted this competition by entering the vegetable shortening field himself, not realizing that he was making competition for his own major product — lard. The awakening came when he found himself with huge surpluses of lard and the price the same or below the cost of production. And what was particularly humiliating, the selling price was far below the price of shortenings which only a few years before were without class. In order to illustrate to you what our laboratory has accomplished, we are going to contrast present day lard with our new product. By doing so, we believe you will understand why we assert that only a limited extension of lard sales can be accomplished with unprocessed lard, and therefore, predict that little progress can be made in in - creasing lard sales by making claims for lard which cannot be sub - stantiated. If it is to recover its kingdom, it must possess additional characteristics which are regarded as superior. In stating the following facts, we would not have you understand that we do not believe in lard as a shortening — quite the contrary. There never has been and probably never will be a finer shortening than lard for certain uses; but as we have already said it has its limitations. It makes excellent pie crusts and crusty pasteries; most excellent bread, crackers and biscuits; but there is a flavor to which many object. It has a low smoke point resulting in smoke and fumes when heated, a particularly objectionable feature when a kitchen is in proximity to the rest of the house. It is difficult to make uniform. Wo have said it has only relatively good keeping quality. Contrast all this with our new hydrogenated lard. Our process of refining and hydrogenation removes the undesirable features found in lard. It is uniform, because we can regulate the entire process with instruments of precision and through the application of chemistry. The process permits us to make a uniform product whether the anticedeut lard is soft or hard. Our product has unusual keeping quality. It is neutral as to acids, odor and flavor. It is the whitest shortening of any kind manufactured, being snow white when solid and water white when melted. It withstands in practice the highest deep frying temperature without breaking down, bo it does not smoke. Furthermore, it does not become liquid at ordinary working temperatures; indeed, cakes can be made with it, at a room temperature of 98°, a thing which can - not be done with any other shortening. Besides creaming at these higher temperatures, it does not set up or become hard at relatively low temperatures. We claim for it unusual plasticity range. Perhaps the thought has passed through your minds that we are </seg>
            <seg id="p666">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OI" AGRICULTURE exaggerating because we are over confident of what we have accom - plished. Besides the fact that our product is well known among Uni - versity Home Economic Teachers and ha3 been given their approval, we should like to add the additional evidence of the gratifying recep - tion, and increasing sales which we are experiencing with it. It has been on the market now about 3 years. Some of the largest national and local bakeries are using it extensively. Within the past year a pound carton has been put on the market, and from the very beginning the sales of this package to the household consumer has mounted week by week. This despite the fact that promotion has been limited almost exclusively to our Sales Organization. One reassuring and very important fact has come to the fore in our increasing sales of hydrogenated lard; namely, we have not noticed that our lard business has decreased. We get a slightly bet - ter price for hydrogenated lard than for ordinary lard. The point I wish to make is stating this fact is that we are creating a larger demand for lard — some of it at a better price and this demand is be - coming greater. It will not be the policy of our company lo limit the making of hydrogenated lard to our own company. Already a company larger than ours has been licensed to manufacture hydro - genated lard under our patents. Undoubtedly, license to manufacture will be granted other companies. Furthermore, since our laboratory lias pointed the way, other firms, thru technical research, may also improve lard in such a manner as lo similarly increase demand. In this way will the farmer be benefited. However, we would remind you the Packers must have the co - operation of the corn states to the extent of demanding a shortening made of lard and eschewing the vegetable oil shortenings. Because of hydrogenated lard this can now be done without sac - rificing quality in cooking and baking: and at the present selling price there is a saving of \'» the price of the best vegetable shortening. DISCUSSION — Win. .1. Lotffel i I have been intensely interested in this problem of shortening. Have watched Dr. Langfeld work in his laboratory in Omaha, and it has been an inspiration. The work Dr. Langfeld has done has been one of the greatest forward steps in the packing industry within my recollection. The problem of shortenings — animal fat shortenings, is facing American agriculture. I don't know whether you have ever thot of it. The corn producer is interested in producing fat. The major portion </seg>
            <seg id="p667">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION of that corn is converted by hogs, by beef cattle, and sheep, by dairy cattle, into fats of one kind or another. The man who raises corn is interested in the fat problem, the man who raises soybeans is inter - ested in the problem. Soybeans are used in the manufacture of soy - bean fat. I want to say one of the principal by-products of cotton problem touches each and every one of us. Touches corn and live - stock producer, touch dairymen. Very, very few not vitally interested in the problem of fats and oils. Fats and oils are used for four principal products — as food, and that is by far the most important use made of fats and oils — greater than all the uses combined. For soap, and that takes a considerable volume of the fats and oils produced. Drying oil in the manufacture of paints and linoleum. We are not so much interested in that branch in Nebraska. And last, other miscellaneous uses. We have a rather crude chart copied from a chart in Washington. These different columns represent the comparative importance of these different uses to which fat is placed. Of the edible fats butter more than 40 per cent; lard, 25 per cent; cottonseed represents more than 20 per cent. Then there are oleo, olive oil, miscellaneous for soap, inedible tallow, grease, whale oil. The least important oil occupying the least important places. Of the drying oils, the oils used in the manufacture of paint, linseed oil represents almost 80 per cent. Chinese oil used in the manufacture of lacquer, soybean oil in the paints; castor oil used in the manufacture of cup grease, and lubricants. So far as this lard problem is concerned, we are Improving the quality of the lard. If we could just bring Nebraska housewives to use it. So many of our high schools are using vegetables oils. A high school girl gets the idea she can't make a product unless she has a certain brand of hydrogenated oil. Things have come to a sorry pass. Why? Because these companies send out a very good cook book, recipe book. They send it out to high schools, the teachers are im - pressed. And it is a good product. I don't have any quarrel with the product. We have just as good. How much we can look for in the way of exportation we don't know. The report of the German office of the Department of Com - merce says the yield of lard per hog in Germany is considerably lower than in the United States. This is due to the consuming habit of the people who desire fatter pork. Lard production is not carried on by the packing houses. There are small butchers, and it is less efficiently made. In Germany a large portion of the lard is used not for cooking but for spreading on bread. It is sometimes preferred to butter for this use. In many cases flavored with onion, thyme, jasmine. Ger - many has been able to produce about half of the amount of require - ments. There is little doubt but that any proposal to increase for </seg>
            <seg id="p668">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE assuming the same yield of lard it would require almost the present number of hogs. This would lead to tremendous overproduction of pork. In other words, just the reverse. Here we come to the point where he likes the lean meat of the pork. It has been a fortunate situation. We could export lard to Germany and Central Europe has found it necessary to put on import quotas. They would import only in the amount of goods we would buy from them. I don't know what to say about this export. Now about reducing the production of lard. We might change our hogs; we might go to a bacon hog, less lard. We might change the average weight of our hogs, market a little lighter. If we market these hogs at 175 to 185, less lard per hog than if at 240 to 250 pounds. We might change rations. As long as we are corn producing state and corn is king, preeminent. I don't believe there is any likeli - hood we are apt to change in this great corn belt of the United States. We might develop other technical uses for hogs such as lubricants. Miss Peters told last fall of some surplus lard they had rendered, got 7 cents per pound. The same day her brother bought some cup grease and paid 15 cents. If they could only have used that 7 cent lard for 15 cent cup grease, it would have been a fine thing. I have been very much interested in the possibility of using lard as a lubricant. It would be a fine thing. We are not ready to recom - mend it, but are working on it. Now I am inclined to disagree with Dr. Langfeld in his talk about uniformity. You don't hear a dairyman talking about lack of uni - formity of butter. Dr. Langfeld showed how consumption of dairy products had increased. There is (saying) too much about lack of uniformity. ' i . DISCUSSION — M. J. Blish I will take up very little of your time. The subject has been cov - ered. I am a specialist, however, in the chemistry of wheat and flour and use of shortening in baking. As Dr. Langfeld said for all purposes, hydrogenated oil are preferable to lard. In commercial bread making where lard is in no way inferior to the hydrogenated vegetable oils. At least there is no scientific evidence that this is in any way inferior. I have been in their plants and a good many of them used lard and others used cottonseed oil in some form. There was no evidence at all indicating that the lard is inferior. I think we could all do very well to look into the subject in our own homes, take up the matter with the bakers in our community, parti - cularly where the price of lard is so important. You will be surprised </seg>
            <seg id="p669">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION to find that lard can be used in baking just as good if not better in some respects than the other shortenings. Question: Nebraska has a law that says any margarine products or anything of that kind must have 50 per cent animal fat. Is it being enforced? I wonder if it has in any way benefited the animal fat producers. Answer: It stopped a lot of margarine manufacture. It has not increased the consumption of the animal fats. Question: I notice the price on margarine is 20 per cent cheaper than when the law was passed. Answer: Everything went down. There hasn't been a single cent collected in fines. None manufactured in excess of 50 per cent. GRAIN AND SWEET SORGHUMS FOR NEBRASKA D. L. GROSS (See Nebraska Crop Growers Report) PRESENT DAY RECO5IMENDATIONS ON ALiPAIjFA PRODUCTION By H. M. TYSDAL, Lincoln (Given on the program of the joint session of the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association and Nebraska Livestock Association, Nebraska Organized Agriculture, January, 1933.) As an introduction of this topic before a group such as this com - posed of those primarily interested in crops and those primarily In - terested in livestock, I would like to point out a rather significant fact. It is no doubt a rather generally recognized fact that livestock produc - tion and crop production are closely related, but the closeness of this relationship may not be realized. The annual report for 1930 of the Nebraska Agricultural statistics gives Nebraska's rank compared to other states in both crop and animal production. To obtain a com - parison between crop and livestock production only those crops which seemed to have a direct relation to livestock were considered. Ne - braska's rank in corn, wheat, oats, barley, wild hay and alfalfa aver - aged for the five year period, 1926-1930, gave an average rank of 4.2. The livestock rank in value and production for horses, mules, milk cows, other cattle, swine, and sheep for the same period is 4.2. This means that compared to all other states Nebraska, for the period 192G-30, stands about fourth in both crops and animal production. </seg>
            <seg id="p670">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE These figures do not take into consideration the important pasture resources ol Nebraska. In still another manner this close relation - ship is shown by the fact that the annual value of all crops for the 5 year period 1926-30 was $310,365,000 whereas the value of all live - stock and livestock products for the same period was $328,79S,000. And so it is that livestock men are interested in problems of crop production and crops men are interested in problems of livestock production. To come more precisely to the subject assigned let us first consider the general trend of alfalfa production in Nebraska and see if this will throw any light on the major present day problems in alfalfa production. Two major declines have occurred in alfalfa acreage in Nebraska since 1911, one in 1917-18 and the other in 192S-29. The first may be in part explained by the advent of war in 1917 but many of you will recall the disastrous winter of 1910-17 when the Nebraska wheat acreage dropped from over 3,000,000 to less than 600,000 acres. The great drop in 1918 may be largely explained by the very cold winter of 1917-1S when the average minimum temperature for January was the lowest for any corresponding period during the 20 years under con - sideration. It therefore seems safe to attribute a large part of the re - duced acreage of 1917 and 1,918 to winterkilling. To substantiate this delineation it is found that the yield in 1918 was the lowest during the period 1911 to 1930. When it is known that under controlled con - ditions the first crop of alfalfa may be reduced in yield as much as 80 per cent from cold injury to the root, both the low yield and re - duced acreage can be readily explained by the cold winter of 1917 - 1918. The decrease in acreage occurring in 192S-29 is not as severe as in 1918 but nevertheless dropped below the twenty year average of 1, - 110,000 acres. One of the chief causes for this decrease in acreage can be traced to the increase in the alfalfa wilt disease in addition to the rather more than usual winter-killing during the winter of 1927 - 28. It was during this period that acreage of alfalfa in Dawson County, which produces the most hay of any county in the state, de - creased by over 6% thousand acres, and it was also at this time that the Agricultural College became actively interested in the alfalfa wilt problem. The wilt disease not only kills out the stand, but in the process also greatly reduces the yield. An infected plant has only a small percentage of the growth of a healthy plant — one of the char - acteristics of the disease being its dwarf habit of growth. A third major factor in determining yield is moisture, although surprisingly enough the average annual yields as reported in Nebraska Agricultural Statistics do not closely reflect the average annual or sea- </seg>
            <seg id="p671">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION sonal rainfall. For example 192G and 1930 were two dry years, and while the average yield for 192C was lower than normal, the average yield for 1030, a still drier year, was above normal. In 191G, an - other dry year, the average yield was above normal. It is clear that the amount of rainfall will influence the yield, but the fact that good yields may be obtained in spite of rainfall is one of the outstanding characteristics, of the crop. The secret in addition to irrigation, no doubt lies in the ability of alfalfa to draw upon the subsoil moisture when such is available. During the last twenty years, therefore, it has been demonstrated that at least three factors aside from economic conditions have been of major importance in determining the fluctuations in acreage and production of alfalfa in Nebraska. To repeat, these factors are winter - killing; alfalfa wilt disease, and rainfall. To what extent are these factors under the control of the grower, and how can their ill effects best be combated? Let us first consider in a little more detail the problem of winterhardiness. Twenty regional strains of common alfalfa obtained from various parts of the United States were planted at Agronomy Farm in 1 it 2 2 . Nine yearn of actual yield data have been obtained on them and if the ten highest yielding strains are chosen it is found that all of them originated as far north as Nebraska, or farther north, with the excep - tion of one lot from Kansas, while the ten low yielding strains came from regions to the south. On further analysis It is found that the yields are in almost direct relation to the stand remaining after a period of nine years. Controlled freezing tests made in the greenhouse by the controlled hardening and freezing method developed at this station show varietal differences similar to those obtained in the field, except that instead of being obliged to wait two, three, or five years for the right winter to come along to freeze out the susceptible varieties, the correct tem - perature can be had and results obtained in two months in the green house. Both the field and control tests have born out the recommenda - tion that in general southern seed should be taboo in Nebraska. Good Nebraska grown or northern grown common or the hardy variegated alfalfa such as Grimm and Cossack are sufficiently hardy for Nebraska conditions. The class of seed known as "Hardy approved" is desir - able because it comes from old fields still maintaining a good stand. These fields have been inspected by agents of the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association. It is highly desirable for anyone who is buying alfalfa seed to take advantage of the present knowledge and services which enable him to have a fair chance at success in alfalfa produc- </seg>
            <seg id="p672">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tlon by first of all being sure that the seed he obtains is suitable for his climatic conditions. As indicated above, however, winterhardiness is not the only fac - tor which must be considered in choosing the variety. Let us now con - sider briefly the problem of alfalfa wilt as it may influence cultural practice and choice of varieties. * For the benefit of those who are not familiar with alfalfa wilt the following description is taken from Nebraska Bulletin 24 0, — "the dis - ease can be readily recognized in the field by the dwarfing and yellow - ing of the plants; the bunch-growth effect produced by the many and shortened stems; the small, chlorotic, rounded, cupped leaves}; and finally, the yellow or brown discoloration just below the burk of the tap root." In 1927 agricultural experiment station and extension workers planted demonstration plots, consisting of several varieties each, at various locations in the Platte Valley. Disease readings made in cooperation with the Pathology Depart - ment give the following results as an average for three separate farms. Stand Will fall Stand fall 1932. reduction 1932 % % ■ % Local Common f&gt; I 44 2(1 So. Dakota Grimm 22 7S 50 So. Dakota 12 77 2:: 1 :: Dawes Count} 1 Common .... 58 4,0 2:1 Among these four varieties Grimm stands out as very susceptible, having been reduced to a decidedly unproductive stand even before 1932 and showing a high per cent of infection in the plants remaining. The others, which are of the group belonging to the common alfalfas are somewhat intermediate in wilt resistance, maintaining the stand better than Grimm and having less wilt infection. It should bo noted that these four are all of the hardy types, so to the wilt disease can be attributed most of the decrease in stand. The variety known as Cos - sack was included in some of these trials, and showed almost as much susceptibility to the disease as Grimm. These experiments therefore clearly indicate that Grimm and Cossack should not be planted where the wilt disease is a factor. The susceptibility of these two varieties has been repeatedly shown also by artificial inoculation tests conducted by the Pathology Department. It -was through these wilt studied that Turkestan came into prom - inence because of its apparent wilt resistance. This having been dem- </seg>
            <seg id="p673">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION onstrated, Mr. Westover, of the United States Department of Agri - culture, went to Turkestan in 1929 to gather various lots of seed from known districts of that country. These have been tested for cold and wilt resistance. In general, most of them have shown considerable wilt resistance, but have varied greatly In cold resistance depending on what part of the country they orginated. Turkestan Is a very large country, and those strains from the southern section were markedly less cold resistant than those from the northern section. For this reason it is not safe to make a general recommendation of Turkestan alfalfa seed. It may be worth trying in small quantities, however, in localities where wilt is especially severe. More recent explorations by Mr. Westover include trips to Africa, Spain and other parts of Europe with the result that we are now testing some over 600 strains or varieties from almost every part of the world. These same strains are being tested by other stations, including Wisconsin, Kansas, and California. A new variety tested, by the experiment station and now being in - creased for commercial use is known as Hardistan. This variety, somewhat similar to Turkestan in its characteristics, originated from an old field in central Nebraska and has proven as resistant to the wilt as most of the Turkestans and is also cold resistant. This year the Agronomy Department has about 4 0 bushels of this seed for distribu - tion to be used for seed increase, and when sufficient seed of this variety is produced it will be one of. the best varieties available at the present time for, wilt conditions, and will be of known pedigree and origin because the Nebraska Crop Orowers' Association is certifying the seed right from the start. In addition to variety, what cultural practices or other means can the individual grower take advantage of to combat the wilt? Time does not permit going to detailed experiments on this phase of the problem. Flriefly. it has been found that cutting the crop more than three times a year weakens the stand so that It becomes more susceptible to the attack of the wilt organism. It may not be serious to cut four crops in any given year, but it is known that continuous cutting of more than three crops weakens the plants both for winter survival and wilt resistance. It is up to the individual grower to decide for himself which he would rather do. Another factor which might be considered is the rotation of crops. Where It is possible there is an advantage to rotate the crop, in other words, do not put alfalfa right back on land upon which diseased alfalfa has been grow - ing. While the wilt disease comes in rather slowly in any field it conies in more rapidly where alfalfa is sown right back on diseased alfalfa ground. In a set of duplicate plots In the Platte Valley near Cozad, the average of five susceptible varieties of alfalfa planted in </seg>
            <seg id="p674">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 1929 on ground just plowed out of diseased alfalfa now have more than 50% of the plants diseased and already sufficient dying to reduce the stand 27%. Just across the irrigation ditch on land never before in alfalfa, the same varieties have an average of 37% wilt and have shown no decrease in stand to date. Thus while wilt is coming into the fleld never before in alfalfa, it is not coming as rapidly and will no doubt mean some difference in the length of time a productive stand remains. In general, however, the conclusion lias been reached that cultural practices will not solve the problem but that we will have to look to resistant varieties to overcome the disease. This is emphasized by the fact that in the above test plots resistant varieties planted right back on the diseased alfalfa field show much less; wilt than the more sus - ceptible varieties sown on land never before in alfalfa, and show no reduction in stand. These data can be briefly tabulated as follows: &lt; In Km! just p'«iwctl I *ri l.ltnl ii.;vlt in out of ull.'illn ali'alta Slaml '.Rcilitc- | Wilt Stand " j Reiluc- Wilt rill lion in fall; kill ■ ti.nm fall 1032 stnn'i !').'•-' i'&gt;. ; - Mail']-.'

The resistant varieties listed above are not desirable in other characteristics, and the object of the co - operative program between the Nebraska Agricultura ..Experiment Station and the United States Department of Agriculture, is to combine desirable agronomic characteristics with as much cold and wilt resist - ance as possible. To this end there are now under test for both cold and wilt resistance several hundred selections, some of which have been carried for two or three years and give promise of produc - ing what is wanted. Our present recommendation of alfalfa varieties must depend on whether the alfalfa is to be grown where wilt is severe or relatively less important. Where wilt is of relatively less importance, as on the uplands of eastern Nebraska, the hardy northwestern Common or the </seg>
            <seg id="p675">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION hardy variegated varieties such as Grimm and Cossack are considered to be most desirable. These are to be preferred to Turkestan since Turkestan in all tests at the experiment station is somewhat lower in yield than the better varieties. Under wilt conditions, however, it is advisable to plant such a variety as Hardistan when it is available, or Turkestan or Ladak, a new variety introduced from India. In the meantime, if these are not available a hardy, north-western common is the best obtainable. The third problem which I wish to touch on briefly is that o* soil moisture; or more precisely, subsoil moisture. According to work done at the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment station, alfalfa uses as much as 850 pounds of water to produce 1 pound of dry hay free from moisture, whereas corn uses only 270 pounds of water to produce 1 pound of dry matter. On this basis it requires 3 2 inches of rainfall to produce 5 tons of alfalfa per acre. In spite of this fact, alfalfa is one of the highest yielding crops grown in Nebraska. Alfalfa roots have been found to pentrate in our mellow Nebraska subsoil from 25 to 3 9 feet, furthermore they draw practically all of the available moisture from the subsoil to these depths. "When one remembers that a great quantity of water is stored in the subsoil ( U % per ft. is considered equal to one inch of water and most of the subsoil contains at least 6% available water), it is easy to see why alfalfa yields as much as it does. In other words, besides using the seasonal rainfall alfalfa draws on a great reservoir of subsoil mois - ture. Other crops such as corn and wheat cannot penetrate to such distances as alfalfa and therefore cannot make use of the deep seated reserve moisture supply. About six years is apparently sufficient time for the alfalfa to draw all the moisture it can get from the subsoil at Lincoln. In 1930, which was exceptionally dry, a 3-year-old alfalfa field yielded as much as 5 tons dry hay per acre, actual weight, while an eight-year-old stand planted on a field which had been in alfalfa 13 years before yielded 2 tons per acre. Two tons compared to 5 tons is a great difference in yield, but this difference can be attributed entirely to lack of subsoil moisture in the field which had been in alfalfa previously. Data have been obtained which indicate that the moisture is not restored in the soil very quickly after the alfalfa is plowed out. As a matter of fact it is difficult to compute how long it would take the soil moisture to be restored 30 feet deep when other crops are being grown on the soil. Certainly after 20 to 25 years the soil is still dry 16 feet below the surface. This has been substantiated by 36 foot sampling in several hundred fields scattered over the state. While </seg>
            <seg id="p676">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE there is a slight difference in the severity of the problem, being less severe in the very eastern and northeastern section of the state, the same general condition was found in all parts of the state. In other words, when a field is plowed out of alfalfa and cropped to corn, wheat, or other crops every year, very little moisture is allowed to pentrate into the soil, the crops using practically all the moisture which remains on the land. Even one or two years of summer fallow apparently does not materially restore the deep subsoil moisture. Irrigated sections naturally do not have this problem, but in some valleys where the land is subirrigated, where the water is from 15 to 25 feet below the surface, there is often a dry layer from about the 5th to the 10th foot after alfalfa has been on the land through which new alfalfa roots penetrate very slowly or not at all. This layer may require several years to become moistened, and if alfalfa is planted back immediately greatly reduced yields can be expected. It should be emphasized, that this deep subsoil moisture depletion does not materially affect annual crops such as corn and wheat, because the top layer of soil is just as dry after wheat and after alfalfa and the annual crops do not depend on the deep subsoil moisture as alfalfa does. Poor yields of corn and wheat following alfalfa in unfavorable seasons may be traced to other causes. The fact that alfalfa draws on the deep subsoil moisture should not be used against it, rather, it is another of the many advantages which alfalfa lias over other crops. The results show clearly, however, that if there is a choice; of fields for the second planting of alfalfa, the field which has not grown alfalfa before should be chosen in preference to one which has grown alfalfa. CATTLE PROGRAM Thursday, January 5, 1933 H. J. GRAMLICH, Presiding WIXTER RATIONS AND SUMMER FEEDING R. R. THALMAN During the past three years the University has conducted some ten or twelve cattle feeding experiments. While several distinctly different problems have been attacked in these tests i the major project consisted of a series of three trials seeking to uncover the most effici - ent and economical way to winter cattle — mostly steer calves that were to be fattened for market the following season. When the tests were first started, the main problem was one of </seg>
            <seg id="p677">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION 1 winter rations. However, we soon found ourselves confronted by a second problem, and a very important one, that of summer manage - ment when the calves were being fattened. These experiments, there - fore, took on a broader aspect and each year another phase of the feed lot management was taken Into account. In other words, these tests have included such problems as (1) the production of feeder steers of good quality to be sold in March or April; (2) the wintering well and summer feeding in dry lot for a mid-summer market; (3) wintering well and feeding corn on pasture for a late fall market; and (4) wintering well, followed by a period on grass without corn, and later feeding corn in dry lot so as to market the steers in mid-winter. The feeds used iii these experiments consisted for the most part of those grown on all Nebraska farms. Special attention has been given to the roughage produced by the corn plant fed in its several different forms and to alfalfa hay. The results of these experiments have demonstrated the wisdom of wintering stock calves on the farm where they are to be fed the following summer. Beyond this, the use of the common farm roughages — for instance, corn fodder — has proved to fit admirably into the winter ration of stock cattle, either breeding cattle or feeders. Furthermore, the value of silage in beef produc - tion on Nebraska farms has been shown in these experiments to be a rather important factor in economical winter rations. There has long been a general lack of interest in silage in Nebraska so far as the Tteef man was concerned. However, he is coming more and more to realize its place in beef production. Perhaps the chief reason why silage has not been more popular with the beef man is that the silo has cost considerable, which results in a heavy capital investment for the storage of the feed. Another factor to be con - sidered is the difficulty in filling a silo at a busy time of the year. Perhaps the trench silo has done more to eliminate these undesirable factors than any other single thing in the field of silage making. There have been constructed in Nebraska during the past three years — very conservatively — 3000 of these trenches. Reports from their owners indicate splendid results. Perhaps another reason for the general criticism of silage has Deen that it is not a feed that can be used under all conditions without some consideration being given to the nutritional requirements of the animal. Cattle cannot be fattened for market, producing choice beef, on silage alone. There is too much bulk and coarse feed in a ton of silage to enable the animal to get a sufficient amount of nutrients that go for the storage of fat in the animal's body. Some grain must be fed and in addition a protein supplement must be added to balance the ration. Neither can one winter cattle successfully on silage alone without the addition of a protein supplement to take care of the wear </seg>
            <seg id="p678">REPORT OF NEBRASKA, STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE and tear which is going on in the animal's body at all times and also to provide lor growth. Properly supplemented, however, corn silage can be worked into either the fattening ration or the wintering ration with a great degree of success. In all feeding operations there are at least two big factors which govern the use of a feed for livestock. One is its nutrient value and the other is its economy. The latter is the one factor which, in my mind, this year upsets the calculations of other years and puts us to work with pencil and paper anew in an attempt to meet the changing economic conditions. A careful analysis of feed prices and an inquiry into what each feed will return ,in the form of beef or how it will maintain the animal is therefore, necessary. This gets us back to how much corn should be fed to cattle that are being wintered. With a full feed of corn fodder supplemented with 2 V£ pounds of alfalfa or 1 pound of cake per head daily, a 400-pound steer cal£ will come thru the winter with approximately 1 'A pounds daily gain. The same steer on silage plus alfalfa or cake will gain approximately 1 % pounds per day. Wintered on alfalfa plus a limited amount of shelled corn — say 3 pounds per head daily — this same calf will gain ap - proximately 1.4 pounds daily, or slightly less than a calf wintered on corn fodder. If a full feed of shelled corn and alfalfa is given, this steer will gain approximately 2.2 pounds daily. These figures rep - resent an average of three years' results of feeding tests conducted at this station. The amounts that a steer will eat per day of the above feeds are as follows: Fodder Silage Corn fodder 14 pounds Corn silage ."!;{ pounds Alfalfa hay 2 i pounds or Alfalfa hay..:... .2^ pounds or 1 pound cake 1 pound cake • • • : ■ ■ ■ .'"'■• I ■■.."■■ Full Feed Limited Corn Shelled corn 11 pounds Alfalfa hay 10 pounds Alfalfa hay 4 pounds Shelled corn 3 pounds With these figures it is possible to calculate the value of each of these feeds in comparison to each of the other feeds. Using shelled corn and alfalfa hay as a standard of comparison, the following values are obtained. We shall use, for example, corn at 15 cents per bushel and alfalfa hay at $5.00 per ton. Ground corn fodder. $3.00 per ton Silage 1.50 per ton Alfalfa 3.10 per ton After making these calculations, one fact is outstanding and that </seg>
            <seg id="p679">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION is that as the price of shelled corn increases, the value of roughage is increased proportionately greater. By the time corn reaches 35 or 4 0 cents per bushel, the value of a limited corn ration and the liberal use of roughage is increased. Under present conditions with corn so ridiculously cheap, the economy of a roughage ration is a minus quantity when figured purely on the basis of cost of gain. It, there - fore, appears as tho the liberal use of corn in the ration this winter for stock cattle that are to be fed out for market next summer would be an economical procedure. This is especially true unless returns are calculated upon a per acre or per bushel basis. AVhen calves are handled on a long-time basis, it so happens that the steer making the greatest gains at the lowest cost might not be the most profitable. This can be illustrated by the results of the summer feeding period in the experiment just closed, and substantiated by the two previous tests. Using the last trial as an example, the full-fed corn and alfalfa calves returned §2.00 per head more than the silage-wintered calves when marketed in July after a 90-day summer feeding period. The full-fed steers had consumed •1G bushels of corn as against 32 for the silage-wintered steers. On the basis of returns per bushel, the former actually returned 50 cents as against G9 cents per bushel, or 19 cents less. On gross returns per acre, the full-fed steers returned 2/3 as much as the silage-winter - ed steers. This method of calculation is not applicable to the com - mercial feeder who buys his corn because he is not interested in the acres of corn required to produce a 1000-pound steer but only in the price of corn per bushel. However, the feeder who feeds his own corn is interested primarily in marketing his crops thru the use of cattle and, therefore, should not lose sight of the returns in a crop or acreage basis. It, therefore, appeal's probable that the farmer feeder should combine roughage and corn feeding this winter under the present economic set-up and thus have fleshy feeders next spring. Whether he would then feed corn in dry lot for a mid-summer market or corn on grass for a late fall market would be determined by probable market conditions and upon the facilities for summer feeding on his farm. It is possible that a combination of the two practices might be advis - able. The high degree of flesh that may be obtained by late summer on steers wintered on such good rations will, of course, handicap sum - mer gains but will not be of serious moment with corn at present price levels. The results secured this summer with steers fed corn on grass indicate that very little difference in economy or rate of gain exists between steers fed on grass or in dry lot. It is, however, extremely difficult to produce high quality, choice steers weighing much over 800 pounds, for a late June or early July market. This is especially true where calves are carried thru the winter on roughage rations. </seg>
            <seg id="p680">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE xnus, it becomes doubly important to feed a rich winter ration to steers that are to be marketed in mid-summer. Where the fall marketing plan is to be used, winter gains of more than 1% pounds per head daily are not so important except that they preclude the possibility of a change to the mid-summer marketing plan if such suddenly seems desirable. The best plan under present economic conditions, therefore, appears to be that of feeding a good winter ration to make possible the use of either summer plan or a combination of the two. The latter appears to be the most practical for a feeder with two or more cars of steers. The fleshy end of his steers could be marketed in mid-summer from dry lot and the lighter, good quality end could be sorted off following the winter period and fed corn on grass for a late fall market. Such a procedure would dis - tribute his marketing over a longer time and, most important, would not place all the feeder's "eggs in one basket". It tends to take the gamble out of the cattle feeding business. CATTLE DISEASES S. W. ALFORD, Lincoln In discussing cattle diseases important to the livestock Industry it is necessary to discourse upon the diseases one by one in order to give an accurate picture of their importance and their several aspects of appearance, effect and control. Perhaps the most serious disease in r.he cattle business is Blackleg, a disease that is highly destructive to calves and young stock and occasionally to older stock if they have not been immunized. Black - leg is a spoor forming disease and lives in the spil in the spoor form indefinitely. Therefore calves are always suceptible when they are running on infected pastures or lots. Where there has been blackleg, and there is practically no areas immune from the disease, it is unsafe to allow young cattle to remain unprotected by immunization. Once the disease breaks out in the herd, they will die rapidly for the disease is capable of killing the stock very quickly. Three methods of immunization are now used and all are methods of vaccination. They are vaccinating with aggressin, tiltrate and bacterine. The aggressin gives the calf an aggressive stage of the disease and for that reason the use of aggressin is very dangerous in herds in - fected in which calves are dying. If a calf has the Blackleg germ in </seg>
            <seg id="p681">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION his body the aggressin will progress the disease and will cause death losses in the infected herd. Serum is not practical for immunization against blackleg and so the best method is to administer one of the forms of vaccines men - tioned above. Abortion is another serious disease in the cattle industry, producing heavy losses in unborn calves and spreading very rapidly due to the fact that it is a contagious, infectious disease. There is no workable way of controling the disease after it gets under way in a herd. There are methods but none practical for the livestock producer. Isolation of the infected animals and segrega - tion of the infected herds is the only method of control'. The blood test for abortion reactors is coming into standard use among pure - bred men to discern the presence of the disease before animals are allowed to enter valuable herds. . ■ ■ . ■ '. Tuberculosis is a serious disease, particularly in dairy stock, and can only be controlled by testing and elimination of the infected animals. Anthrax, which we now have in North Central Nebraska is also a very serious disease, being highly fatal and killing cattle very quickly. An Anthrax outbreak is a very serious menace to the cattle industry over a wide area. It is a disease very often mistaken for blackleg, the lesions of the dead animals being similar. There is no gas as in blackleg. Anthrax makes no discrimination as to age and is 100 per cent fatal. As a disease it is worse than foot and mouth disease due to the fact that it is spoor forming and remains in the soil for years in the infected areas. It cannot be eliminated from the soil. The disease is spreading and may soon cover a very large portion of Nebraska. In the next few years I expect to hear of it becoming more serious as a result of the spread to new sections. The spreading of the disease from the infected areas is progressing now through the transportation of cattle from the infected areas by truck. The rail - roads also carry the disease but as they follow definite lines and carry the majority of their shipments to market, they do not threaten to spread the disease into uninfected areas as does truck shipping. The disease was introduced to Nebraska from South Dakota by this method. I am in favor of some means of control over truck transportation of livestock from the Anthrax infected areas. The disease affects all warm blooded animals and produces death very quickly, cattle having been known to die within two hours. </seg>
            <seg id="p682">REPORT\OF NEBRASKA, STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The disease causes death by the germs getting into the blood and causing a septicemia or blood poisoning and cannot be stopped after the animal has contracted the disease. Great care should be exercised by humans coming in contact with animals having or which have died from Anthrax, because humans are very susceptible to the disease and it is very serious. All dead animals should be burned to prevent spread of the disease and inoculation of the soil with the spoor. Con - trol is possible by quarantine and various means of vaccination. The vaccination is a veterinary job and should not be attempted by the livestockman. Vaccination is also not to be undertaken unless the disease has been determined to be Anthrax. Cornstalk disease is another serious disease for Nebraska live - stock men. It is a peculiar disease — one which we do not know a great deal about. It is certain that we do not know what causes the malady. It appears more serious in some years in others and varies from one locality to another. Livestock will poison sometimes very quickly, sometimes not as rapidly and sometimes not at all. Some deaths attributed to cornstalk poisoning are due to over eating or gorging by the animal. The Kansas horse disease — forage disease as it has been called this past year, has reappeared in Nebraska after being dormant since 1910 and 1912. The causes of it are also unknown. Shipping fever has become a very serious disease to the livestock man importing feeder cattle to his community from other localities. It often causes very serious losses to the feeder and wipes out his profits before he has an opportunity to feed the cattle. It usually appears within ten days or two weeks after the cattle have been shipped, maybe sooner. A widespread practice in regard to shipping fever which I have to discredit here, is that of vaccinating with Hemor - ragic Septicemia vaccine. This practice is of no avail, in fact it has been quite thoroughly proven to me and various feeders that the vaccination incurrs greater losses and that less loss from the disease will be incurred if they are not vaccinated. There is no satisfactory method of immunization. Good care and good handling are the best methods of avoiding losses. CATTLE SHIPPER'S CO5LMENTS BYRON DEMOREST, Omaha Journal-Stockman In my experience at the livestock market. I have come in contact with a great many livestock shippers of all kinds, have come in con - tact with many of you often enough to become well acquainted. In </seg>
            <seg id="p683">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION these contacts certain things have become apparent characteristics of -cattlemen as a group. If I may say things frankly to this meeting, I would like to relate that the biggest weakness of the livestock man, as it has been revealed to me, is a lack of business methods and the failure to adopt business methods which other lines of business find profitable. I refer to accurate and complete records of gains expenditures and costs, so that accurate and valuable cost accounting of your business may become an index to your own progress. A number of successful livestock men have told me that by keep - ing records and cost accounting of their enterprises, they were able to make money this last year. They were able to make money because they knew exactly where they stood with the product of their feeding business. They knew when they could sell to take a profit. The cost accounting of livestock feeding business to my mind is one of the important and necessary duties of management. It is only through this method that a feeder can know when to sell, when to con - tinue to feed, and the cost necessary to do so. Accounting of the amount of feed given a certain lot of steers should reveal with ac - curacy to the man knowing the business, certain factors upon which he can base his judgment. The knowing of costs and their relation to the market should enable a feeder first of all to decide when it is advisable to feed or to operate. The cost accounting of business reveals to the merchant factors upon which he bases decisions to sell, to hold sales, to move goods or to restock. The same can apply to the feeder. Cost accounting enables a feeder to know how and when to sell, so many of my friends who have learned to keep records tell me. They say they know when they can get and and when to take a profit from the market. They also know what price they must have to pay out on their enterprise, and they are the feeders, more than any others that are able to take advantage of a favorable market situation be - cause they know exactly where their costs stand. Among my friends who keep accurate records of their business, I find relatively few who ever "overstay" the market. The selling of cattle at the right time is important both from a market and feeding cost standpoint. To know exactly what it costs to put feeders on the market is certainly an advantage in managing the feeding business. Such cost figures enable a feeder to estimate the results that can be obtained from a planned operation. </seg>
            <seg id="p684">REPORT OF NEBRASKA, STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE They can answer the question of when and how to buy; what kind of stock to buy; when weight can be bought or produced more cheaply, and the prospects of the market and supply of cattle probable at that time are usually deduced accurately by the cost accounting feeders. Other observations of mine have been that the farmer with a small herd of beef cattle from which he markets a small lot of fat cattle raised and fed from his own farm, is standing the adversity of these times as well as anyone, perhaps better than the majority of farmers. I find also that the small producer who has a high quality product finds it appreciated on the market and that the higher quality of his livestock enables him to realize a greater return for his feedstuffs. Another point is the value of new ideas and new methods in the feeder business. The exchange of ideas among feeders and adoption of practical improved methods in a progressive manner are character - istics of the soundest men in the farming or livestock business. These ideas can be exchanged, new methods learned and progress made by meetings such as this, by reading of the farm papers, particularly the authoritative publications devoted to your own business. It occurrs to me that the three most progressive developments within the past fifteen years in this section is the use of Sweet Clover in soil building, the hog lot sanitation system and the practice of feeding and marketing younger cattle. •■ These progressive developments have come to the industry through the dissemination of information, ideas and the free exchange of valuable helps among farmers. MY TRIP TO THE INTERNATIONAL NORMAN E. WEITKAMP, Washington Co. Nebr. Improved Livestock Ass'n. Swift &amp; Co. Having won a trip to the National Boys and Girls 4-H club Con - gress in 1931 by virtue of being county 4-H champion, it was with a great deal of anticipation and pleasure that I looked forward to the winning of another trip. Realizing that the winning of another trip would be possible only by first being a member 01 a state champion judging team. Hoping but not expecting to be so lurtunate my efforts were directed toward livestock judging. Rewarded by my first efforts I was chosen along with Everett Stock and Alvin Jacob by County Agent Mr. Bates to represent Washington county in the state live - stock judging contest. At Lincoln, competing against 33 teams, much to our surprise and satisfaction, we had the good fortune of winning. Along with winning the state contest we gained tlio right to represent </seg>
            <seg id="p685">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION Nebraska in the non-collegiate livestock judging contest held in con - nection with the International Livestock Show and National 4-H club Congress. Thru the courtesy of Swift &amp; Co. and the Nebraska Im - proved Breeders Association, we received $175.00 to defray our ex - penses while making this trip. Our judging team, together with County Agent (Coach) Bates, left Omaha Wednesday evening. November 23. Traveling on the Portland Rose we arrived in the Windy City Thanksgiving morning. Most of this day was spent in resting and visiting places of interest in the loop district. Friday, the day of our contest we went to the International Show grounds where the contest was held. In this contest 16 teams rep - resenting as many states competed. The contest produced some of the highest individual scores ever made in a national contest and was according to officials, one of the hardest ever staged. The teams in order of their ranking were as follows: Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota, Illinois, Nebraska, Kansas, Michigan, Indiana, Virginia, Okla - homa, West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. To show the closeness of the contest, only 60 points out of a pos - sible 1800 points separated the first nine teams. Nebraska in fifth scored 31 points less than the winning Minnesota team. Friday even - ing the coaches and judging teams were given a dinner at the Saddle and Sirloin club thru the courtesy of the International Exposition, at which time the winners were announced and winning individuals and teams were presented with their awards by B. H. Heide, general man - ager of the Exposition. '.-■■ I ' ' ■ ■ Up until the arrival of the rest of Nebraska's delegation, we were at our leisure and visited places of interest in Chicago. Sunday morn - ing we went to the depot and were on hand for the arrival of the other delegates. After the breakfast in the depot, the groups were organ - ized in a marching formation and put under the leadership of Mr. G. E. "Papa" Scheidt. From this time on the groups moved together and according to a pre-arranged schedule. The Nebraska delegation took rooms at the Harrison hotel. Altho the Auditorium was the Club Congress official headquarters. After registeration we attended services at Central Church Orclustra Hall. Sunday afternoon the state delegations were free to visit, the Field Museum and Planetarium. Those wishing to attend church Sunday evening were invited to the Second Presbyterian church where a special service was held. Monday was International Show day. Special trains took the </seg>

As a Swife &amp; Co. winner it was my opportunity to attend a special lunch - eon and program given for all Swift trip winners. At the Swift &amp; Co. plant we were introduced to some of the main officials who spoke to us concerning their plants and the industries connected with them. Assembling at 4:00 p. m. the groups were taken to the Wilson plant, where a special program and banquet was given by the Thos. E.

Wilson and Miss Amelia Earhart, also the presentation of the Wilson national winners. After this program we again returned to the International arena where the entire group of 1400 delegates marched in the 4-H parade. Tuesday was science and industry day. At 7:30 a. m. the boys were equally divided, and a special breakfast was given by Swift and Armour companies, after which special conducted tours were made of their various plants. Immediately following this the groups were taken to the Belmont Hotel. Here a special luncheon was served thru the court - esy of National Livestock Marketing Association. This hotel overlooks Lake Michigan and Belmont Harbor. The remainder of the afternoon was spent viewing the zoo and tropical gardens. Returning early, we attended the club members own banquet and national rally, held at the grand ballroom, Sherman Hotel. Here the style revue was held, winners In this and the health contest were announced and national awards presented. This banquet and program were featured by an address by Edgar A. Guest. Wednesday morning the Club Congress delegates were guests of the International Harvester officials. After touring a portion of their plants a special luncheon was served and a short program .,'iven. Fol - lowing this we were taken to the International Show grounds, where as guests we were taken to the matinee horse show. Returning to the hotel early we were told to do as we wished. At S p.'m. the National 4-H theater party was held at the Auditorium theater. This program was presented entirely by 4-H boys and girls attending the Congress. Thursday was educational day and the boys visited the Chicago Board of Trade building where a conducted tour was made. From there we visited Shedd's Aquarium and at 11 a.m., Professor Fox, the director of Adler's Planetarium entertained the delegations at a special demonstration. During the afternoon a special tour was made of the "Century of Progress" grounds, after which opportunity was given to those who wished to visit places of interest not included on the schedule. At 6 p. m. in Hotel Auditorium the final 4-H "roundup" was held. </seg>

At about 9:30 p. m. the Nebraska delegation assembled and went immediately to the Northwestern depot where at 10:15 we boarded the Portland Hose for Omaha, arriving here at 9:45. This ends another most eventful, enjoyable, and long to be remem - bered trip. Words cau not express the deep appreciation that we feel towards those who made it possible for us to first win and then to make and enjoy this trip. For this we especially give credit to our county agent, Mr. Bates, whose coaching and untiring efforts enabled us to first win the state contest and then to place high in the National event. We were glad that he was able to make and enjoy this trip with us. Also we thank our club, leaders and parents who so worthily assisted us. We were able to enjoy our stay in Chicago only thru the excellent leadership of Mr. Frisbie, our state club leader, and Mr. G. E. "Pop" Scheidt. We thank them together with the companies and individuals that extended to us so many courtesies and uls-u to the donors of our trip, Swift &amp; Co., and the Nebraska Improved Livestock Association.

The meeting was called to order by the president, Mr. Hildebrand. Minutes of the last meeting were read and approved. Before proceeding to further business short talks were given by Dean Burr, \V. H. Brokaw, E. P. Brown and Mr. Hildebrand. The matter of a slogan for meat products was discussed. It was decided to leave this matter in the hands of the same committee. The question was brought up as to whether the meetings were being held at a time when they were of greatest advantage. There was con - siderable discussion on this matter. It was thought that possibly the meetings could be changed to a time when the weather would be bet - ter and more people could be reached. The suggestion was made to have a representative of our association meet with the various members of Organized Agriculture and take it up with these men and investi - gate. It was suggested that the secretary act as the representative from this association and get in touch with other associations and make a study of the situation. Since the secretary was already a mem - ber of that board the suggestion was made that Professor Gramlich sit in with the board along with the secretary. Mr. Hildebrand felt that the date should be changed and asked that Professor Gramlich meet with the Organized Agriculture board and see what could be worked out. Mr. Jackson brought up the question as to whether they should ask for the same appropriation for the agricultural associations or re - duce the amount. A lengthy discussion followed. Some thought that the $1500 assigned to this association was not an unreasonable amount ask for. It was suggested that there be an early meeting of the gen - eral board to go into the entire matter carefully, representatives from all other associations being present and determine at that time the activities that have been carried on with the $30,300. Motion was made and seconded that Mr. Hildebrand represent this association on the committee. Mr. Hildebrand brought up the question of appointment of an ex - ecutive committee to take care of matters that come up unexpected - ly. He thought that there should possibly be two members besides the officers.

Werner and John Pospisil The rotation experiment at the Box Butte Experimental Farm is planned to give information concerning the effect of crop rotations of different lengths and the effect of different crops preceding pota - toes in the rotation, upon the prevalence of potato diseases such as scab and wilt and upon the yield and grade of potatoes produced. The rotations vary in length from one year (continuous cropping with same crop) to five years. Each plat is 1/10 acre. Each series of rotations is located in three different blocks, each a slightly differ - ent soil type, that is, there are three plots of 1/10 acre of each treat - ment. The experiment was begun in 1930. Results reported herewith are for 1931 and 1932 crops. In 1930 there was much rainfall but in 1931 and 1932 rainfall was very low. As none of the rotations have been through one cycle, we are reporting yields for all rotations that have been identical the first three years. The yields, figured on an acre basis, are reported in Table 1. These data indicate that during the two unfavorable potato years, 1931 and 193 2, summer fallow or corn land was most suitable for potatoes. Yields after small grain or sweet clover were less than after any other crops even less than after continuous cropping with potatoes. Table 1. Production of Potatoes Following Various Crops.

            <seg id="p696">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE : . r. Many growers have rather set ideas regarding the effect of cer - tain rotations on diseases. I had some preconceived notions of it my - self until Professor Werner asked me to prepare something on the subject. I studied the results of the rotation experiments at the Box Butte Experiment Farm and those at Scottsbluff under irrigation and also the date from a survey we made some five years ago by planting por - tions of the same lot of seed on 100 western Nebraska farms After going over all that data. I decided that I didn't have any idea regard- Ing the effect of any particular crop upon the disease content of the following crop of potatoes. Rotation is just one factor of many. Many men think of corn as increasing Fusarium wilt in the following crop of potatoes, but the results on many different farms did not bear that out at all. There was very little difference in the percentage of either Fusarium or scab with any of the various rotations practiced on those 100 farms or at the plots of the Box Butte Experiment Farm The one outstanding difference in disease in these plots and surveys was that the amount of scab and Rhizoctonia materially increased where potatoes are planted continuously in the same soil. In that survey made out Here about five years ago none of the fields had been planted to potatoes without at least a two-year interval. The rotations with three and four-year intervals were about the same, while with a five - year interval there was only a third as much scab.

            <seg id="p697">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION discover the most satisfactory rotation. This is an expensive method for the grower. We hope eventually to find out the reason for these rotation effects so we can apply that knowledge to any other soil con - ditions. In conclusion, I will simply state the most satisfactory con - trol method: If you know your land is heavily infected with scab don't plant potatoes on it. THE PERFORJIAXCE OF NEBRASKA SEED POTATOES IN MISSOURI MR. O. O. WAGGONER, Denver, Colo. Burlington Railroad Mr. Pedrett, Ladies and Gentlemen: It is one thing to grow pota - toes and quite another, as Mr. Morrow will testify, to sell these pota - toes. It is natural, of course, that high quality assists in sales, and it was once thought it assisted so much that somebody made the state - ment that if you built a better mouse trap, the world would make a path to your door. To the contrary, however, western Nebraska has for sometime been producing better seed potatoes but it is with dif - ficulty that buyers have been encouraged to make that legendary path to your door. In an effort to assist in letting the world know more about the value of certified seed grown out here in western Nebraska, some of this seed has from time to time, been placed and grown in demonstra - tion plots in various southern table stock producing areas. This in an effort to show people just what good western Nebraska seed would do when planted alongside the seed they normally used in these areas. Last December, a year ago, our Agricultural Agent for Lines Bast, Mr. Hepperly, who was supposed to be here today but unfortunately was unable to make it, attended a group of potato meetings in the St. Louis County section near St. Louis, Missouri, at Spanish Lake, where they grow a considerable acreage of market potatoes. He immediately sensed the possibility of larger yields by the use of Nebraska certified seed In that section, and decided to promote their use through field i demonstrations. In order to get the thing under way, he consulted your own or - ganization here, which he knew had a forward-looking policy of always putting out seed in new territory for demonstration purposes. Your Sales Association through Mr. Morrow furnished the necessary seed, gratis. Under a special enabling act the Burlington was permitted to haul this seed free of transportation charge, and Mr. Hepperly and the local county agricultural agent gave out small amounts of this Nebraska seed to leading growers in the district to be planted right </seg>
            <seg id="p698">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE alongside the seed from other areas that had formerly been used in that territory. Great care was exercised to give exactly equal oppor - tunity to all seed planted. The results of this experiment constitute a short but interesting story. Briefly, the facts are that the Nebraska seed when put under very strict comparative conditions with the seed commonly used there showed up even better than was anticipated. I have a very interesting chart here, giving figures on the various demonstrations conducted by Mr. Hepperly: I I j ™ - ■'«'■■ •° «■ « in ' 5 1 S ™ ~S u i; 1 &gt;a : oi. .2 2 « » ■g-a =i i| ; 5 g : a | «•§ cjj \J _Ji__^ ,g£ ' 15 g'a c"|g ; I Ig U Cost of " j ; Seed 11-26 14.25 12.51 13.9S 14.33 lG.Olj 12.32 I 13.77 Total Yleld 16 «"J 253.18 151.71 183.57 178.4 196.3 [.213.4 ! 2:!5 Yield " : ; ■' No.i' S ... 144 7 232 2 132 n 179 9 1564 j 172 4 1988 ; 2174 % No. ~ 1 ; ■ 1 J— 2's&amp; 8 "}* IO_ _n_ 12 7.S I 7.4 Acre Value 30c per bushel... 45.61 69.S8 54.79 68.35 | 52.13 57.29 60.5G 65.89 Increase Bushels - S6.4 I 31.

Mr. Hepperly computed what would have been the cost per acre of your seed in the St. Louis district. This cost( refer to column one of chart) was $14.25 for the Nebraska certified Cobblers as against </seg>
            <seg id="p699">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION $11.25 (column two) for the Minnesota Cobblers, a difference of $3.00. The total yield on an acre basis was 166.71 bushels for the Minne - sota strain as against 253.18 for the Nebraska Certified Cobblers. On the basis of quality it will be observed that the Minnesota^ yielded 144.7 bushels of U. S. No. 1 potatoes as compared to 232.2 for the Nebraska Certified — quite a difference. The No. 2's and culls amounted to 13% of the total production of the Minnesota seed and only 8% of the total production from the Nebraska seed, 5% in favor of Nebraska potatoes. When marketed, all of the No. l's sold for 30c a bushel and the No. 2's brought 10c a bushel. The acre value of potatoes produced from the Minnesota's was $45.61 as compared to $69.88 for the Nebraska's. The increase in bushels per acre of 86.4 was in favor of Nebraska seed. The increase in dollar return after the acre cost of seed had been deducted was $21.28 in favor of the Ne - braska seed. This is a most outstanding demonstration of the value of certified Nebraska seed. As a part of the test, some Elk River Minnesota Triumphs (see column 3 of chart) were compared to some Nebraska Certified Triumphs (column 4) on the same sort of comparative basis. In that trial the cost of the Elk River seed was $12.51 per acre as compared to $13.98 for the Nebraska seed. The total yield per acre was 151 bushels for the Elk River seed as compared to 183 for the Nebraska's. Of these totals the yield of U. S. grade No. l's was 132 bushels for the Elk Rivers and 179 for the Nebraskas, leaving the percentage of No. 2's for the Elk Rivers, 14%, as compared to 10% for the Nebraskas again, 4% in favor of the Nebraska seed. The acre value, when sold at 30c for No. 1 and 10c for No. 2, was $54.79 in the case of the Elk River seed as compared to $68.35 for the Nebraska Triumphs, or a difference in favor of the Nebraskas of $12.08, after the cost of seed had been deducted. It will be observed that there was an increase of 31.8 bushels per acre in favor of Nebraska seed, another very out - standing demonstration, and I might say in this case, the average of 7 demonstrations. That is to say the average results from plots on 7 different farmes were used to obtain these data. Going on a little farther, we come again to the Cobblers (columns 5 and 6). It' was desired to compare Cobblers from various areas in Minnesota to the Nebraska Cobbler, because the seed that is used in St. Louis county comes from a number of different districts in Minne - sota. Accordingly, some Elk River Cobblers were tried against some Nebraska Cobblers. The cost of seed in this case was $14.33 per acre for the Elk River Cobblers, $16.01 for Nebraskas. The total yield was 178.4 for the Elk River seed as compared to 195 for that from Nebraska. The yield of U. S. No. l's, 156 bushels for the Elk Rivers, 172 for Nebraskas, leaving a percentage of No. 2's and culls </seg>
            <seg id="p700">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE amounting to 13% of the total for the Elk River and 12% for the Ne - braska Cobblers. The acre value for this trial was $52.13 as against $57.29 In favor of Nebraska seed, and the increased income per acre, after the cost of seed had been deducted, was $3.48, again in favor of Nebraska seed. In this case the increase in bushels was 16.8 greater for the Nebraska seed than it was for the Minnesota seed. I might say in all of these trials which included 17 different plots there was only one instance, and that happened to be one in which the Elk River Triumphs were tried against the Nebraskas, did the Minnesota seed out yield or out grade the Nebraska seed. Now going on to the last demonstration, which is a comparison of two plots in which Red River Cobblers were used against Nebraska Cobblers (see columns 7 and 8 of the chart). In this particular trial the seed cost was $12.32 for the Red River seed as against $13.77 per acre for the seed from here. You will notice some difference in the total net cost of Nebraska seed in these various demonstrations. These variations result from the difference in rates and drayage to the dif - ferent fields. The total yield in this last cobbler trial was 213 bushels as compared to 235 bushels for the Nebraska grown seed. The yield of No. l's was 198 bushels for Minnesotas; 217.4 for Nebraskas. The percentage of No. 2's left being 7.8% for the Red River plot and 7.4% for the Nebraska plot, a fairly close comparison; leaving an acre value, when sold at the figures previously given of $G0.5G for the Red River and $65.89 for the Nebraska Cobblers; showing a net profit after the cost of seed was deducted of $3.88 per acre on account of the use of Nebraska potatoes. An increase of 21.5 bushels per acre in favor of the Nebraska seed as against the Red River seed is also shown. This last data is an average of two demonstrations. In summarizing, please be reminded again that in all of the 17 trials, in only one did the Minnesota seed surpass the Nebraska seed, and all of the averages are very much in favor of the Nebraska seed. I did not see the potatoes while they were growing, but Mr. Hepperly advised me that from the very beginning the Nebraska seed was more hardy. Not only did they get a better stand but the vines throughout the growing season were a little hardier and a little freer from dis - ease than was the case where the Minnesota seed was used. As a result of those demonstrations, the people in the Spanish Lake district this year were quite anxious to obtain some of your Nebraska seed, buying it, if course, for commercial plantings. But unfortun - ately, on account of the limited supply of seed which you had here this year and thej great supply which was on hand in Minnesota, your seed costs were considerably above those in Minnesota — so great, in fact, that only one car was sold into the Spanish Lake district. For your informationi a portion of that car is again being used in seed </seg>
            <seg id="p701">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION trial plot demonstrations in another district in St. Louis county, and the present indication is that with the seed coming from the same source in Minnesota, perhaps there will be even more evidence avail - able to testify to the high quality of your product. Those people of St. Louis county who have reviewed these results are very well sold on Nebraska seed, and you can be assured if the time ever comes when your seed here is any way near the same price as the Minnesota seed, these Missouri growers will actually make a path to your door. You might ask yourself: Why is the Burlington Railroad inter - ested in a thing of this sort? And in reply, I would say that it is naturally vitally interested in the territory it serves. A little longer haul and a little greater share of the hauling revenue accrues to the C. B. &amp; Q. on Nebraska seed, but the principal reason is that when the potatoes produced from that seed go out from that district to market, the Burlington is interested in having the highest production possible, because the more potatoes there are produced, the more the railroad has an opportunity to haul. For example: for every 7 acres planted to potatoes under this circumstance (refers to compari - son shown in columns 1 and 2) the Nebraska seed would yield an additional car of market potatoes. For every 20 acres planted here (refers to comparison represented by columns 3 and 4) the Nebraska seed would yield one additional car. For every 27 acres here (columns 5 and G) there would be one additional car, and for every 30 acres in the last test (columns 7 and 8) there would be an additional car of Nebraska Cobblers as against Red River Cobblers. There is no particular benevolence about the Burlington's activity in this connection. It's just plain good business to develop one's own territory, even as it is just plain good business for you to meet here in an effort to further develop the quality and productivity of your west - ern Nebraska seed. The Burlington makes no pretense that its pur - pose in this project is completely unselfish. This just happens to be one of those numerous instances in which the interest of the railroad is identical with the interests of the farmers in the territories which it serves, and a profound reason why each should work for the common good of both. CHAIRMAN PEDRETT: Gentlemen, I think the Burlington railroad has done a splendid work. I wish somebody would make a motion to give that company and its officials a vote of thanks. The motion was made, and seconded, to give the Burlington Rail - road a vote of thanks for its cooperation. Motion carried. </seg>
            <seg id="p702">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE POTATO DISEASES — OLD FACTS FOR NEW GROWERS DR. R. W. GOSS, Dept. of Plant Pathology, University of Nebraska Probably many of you had your first contact with potato diseases when you started to certify seed. Altho you were undoubtedly familiar with scab and the various tuber rots, you were probably startled at the large number of diseases listed in the rule book, and confused by the different tolerances allowed for different diseases. I am going to try to straighten you out on a few of the essential facts regarding plant diseases in general and potato diseases in particular, without attempting to describe and discuss in detail the multitude of maladies with which the potato is afflicted. I will follow this discussion with a few lantern slides of the more common and serious diseases occurring in Nebraska, and mention a few of the high lights concerning their occurrence and control. What is a plant disease? By 'disease' we .mean any condition that endangers the life of the plant. Practically, this means a decreuse in yield or quality, always considering of course the purpose for which the plant is beiiig grown. All of the plant diseases which we will dis - cuss can be divided into three groups, (1) physiological diseases, (2) fungous and bacterial diseases, (3) virus diseases. The differ - ences between these three groups are important in working out control methods, which jare based upon the methods by which the disease is carried from one. plant or crop to another. The first grdup, physiological diseases, is not of great Importance from the standpoint of seed potato production. These diseases are caused by unfavorable conditions existing in the field, in storage or transit. They are not infectious diseases, that is, they do not spread from plant to plant and are not carried over in the seed tubers. They are important factors however in their effect upon yield and quality. Examples of diseases of this type with which you may be familiar are: (1) tip-burn, resulting in the tips and edges of the leaves turning brown due to excessive loss of water during hot weather, when this is severe, as is common in eastern Nebraska the plants die prematurely and the yield is reduced; (2) black-heart, a disease causing a coal - black area in the center of the potato tuber. This is an example of a physiological disease occurring in storage and transit and is due to a lack of exygen, resulting either from lack of aeration or an exedesslve - ly high temperature such as would occur in stove heated cars when the temperature rises to 95°F. The stove n6t only uses up oxygen but the higher temperature causes an increase in the respiration of the tubers so that the inner part of the tuber suffers from lack of oxygen. </seg>
            <seg id="p703">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION The second group, the parasitic diseases, such as seah, rhizoctonia, early blight, wilt, and tuber rots, is of much greater importance. These diseases are caused by small microscopic organisms which may be transmitted from plant to plant either thru the air, soil, or by insects and may be carried over from one year to the next in the seed tubers, soil or decaying parts of the plants. These micro-organisms, the fungi and bacteria, are nothing more than microscopic plants. In many re - spects they are similar to higher plants but there is one important difference; they do not have the green coloring matter that is present in the leaves of higher plants which is essential for the manufacture of food. Therefore, being unable to make their own food materials they have to exist on the food produced by higher plants. Some of them can only live on dead plant material and these organisms are beneficial to agriculture as they break down the crude plant parts that you turn into the soil and thus make them available for the next crop. Others, however, can live on living plants and these are the parasites that produce our plant diseases. Many of these parasites can also live on decaying plant parts in the soil which complicates the problem of controlling them. The growth of these parasites like the higher plants is greatly influenced by temperature, moisture and other factors which accounts for diseases being worse in some years than others. The third group known as the virus diseases, contains such familiar examples as the various forms of mosaic and splndle-luber. These differ from the first group, 'the physiological diseases, in that- they are transmitted from plant to plant and they differ from the parasitic group in that we are unable to find any definite causal organism. A virus disease then, is one that is transmissable but is caused by some - thing too small to bo visible with a microscope. This does not prevent us from studying the action of these diseases and it has been proved that insects are the chief agents of spread from plant to plant. These diseases are also carried over from one crop to the next within the seed-tuber and it is this fact combined with the difficulty of detecting the symptoms under certain conditions that makes it necessary to have such careful field inspections and a check on these inspections by the use of a southern test plot. High temperatures such as occur in western Nebraska prevent the development of mosaic symptoms. Infected plants, even tho no spmptoms are evident under these condi - tions are still carrying the virus and may serve as a source of infec - tion for healthy plants and the tubers will produce infected plants the following year. Mosaic of course is not apparent in the tuber and it is impossible to detect the disease in the bin. Spindle-tuber is affected the opposite way by environment, the symptoms appearing on the plants under high temperature and the symptoms on the tuber are also accentuated by high soil moistures. </seg>
            <seg id="p704">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE inow that we have considered a few of the essential characters of these three groups of diseases, let us summarize briefly their method of transmission because our control methods are essentially based upon the method of overwintering, transmission and infection. The first group, the physiological diseases, are not transmitted and there - fore they can only be controlled by controlling the environment. The parasitic diseases in the second group are carried over either in or on the seed, in the soil or in old infected plant parts left in the field they may also be transmitted from plant to plant in the field either by Insects, by wind blown spores, or by rain and sometimes by contact and thru wounds in storage. The virus disease group is carried over winter within the tubers and spread by insects in the field and by cutting knives and contact of freshly cut seed pieces. CONTROL METHODS:— The methods to be employed in combating these diseases will depend upon the facts given above and will neces - sarily vary with the individual disease, altho fortunately several dis - eases may often be controlled, partially at least, by one "method. The control methods recommended for potato diseases in Nebraska may be briefly summarized as follows: Healthy Seed: — This is the only method of control for nil the virus diseases and also gives partial control for all parasitic diseases except early blight and storage rots. This selection of seed involves ( 1 ) the previous year's crop, when all plants infected with virus disease should be rogued out as soon as they arc detected. The longer such Plants remain in the field the greater will be the transmission by in - sects and the resulting percentage of disease the following y.-ar Fusarium wilt and black-leg should also be rogued. CM The Beiection of healthy seed tubers at time of planting. Mosaic and leaf roll cahot be detected in the tuber but tubers showing symptoms of Bpindle-tuber should be discarded. Seed pieces infected with Fusariun. should not be used and any decay present in the seed is apt to re.n.lt in a seed piece rot and decreased stands. Rotation:— This gives partial control for wilt, RliJzoclonJa and scab. A four to six-year interval should be allowed between potato crops Under irrigation it is advisable to plant potatoes following sweet clover or alfalfa rather than after beets or small grains. Date of planting:— Late planting, that is June 15-25. tends to de - crease wilt, scab, and early blight and also decreases the girdling of sprouts by Rhlzoctonia. The use of medium early maturing strains of potatoes are advisable for late planting. The date of planting is an important factor in the occurrence of the above diseases under irrigation. Spraying:— Spraying with Bordeaux mixture, 4-4-50 will control </seg>
            <seg id="p705">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION early blight but the lack of high pressure sprayer equipment and the fact that only one disease would be controlled usually makes spraying an impractical control method in Nebraska Seod treatment: — For soab: Hot formaldehyde has been found best for scab or for scab and Khizoctonia together. One pint of formaldehyde to 15 gallons of water at 124°F. Treat for 3 to 4 min - utes and cover for 1 hour, then spread out to dry and cool off. Treat some weeks before planting. For Rhizoctonia alone use mercury treatments. Improved Seme - san Bel, on instantaneous dip of whole seed; or bi-chloride of mercury (corrosive sublimate) 4 ounces to 15 gallons of water. Add one per cent hydrochloric acid (11/5 pint), treat for 5 minutes. Caution: All mercury treatments are poisonous when taken inter - nally. ■ ' '.. .

            <seg id="p709">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION DAMAGED POTATOES? HOW MANY ARE THERE? WHAT CAUSES THEM? WHAT IS TO BE DONE ABOUT THEM? MARX KOEHNKE, Alliance In Charge of Certification Inspection Gentlemen: You 'will notice on the program that I have been listed for about twenty minutes. I won't be able to use all of the time I have, in spite of the fact that I have a bulletin I would like to read to you. This question of damaged potatoes is a^/mmi^^^^^m ■' question that faces all certified growers ' \'f '^IJBBHiB^^I particularly because of the fact that the I ,'-i|j^H^^H!0^| grades of certified potatoes do. not permit &gt; tne inclusion of a great part of the dam - ?''•^,--'^Jipfea3fc^?'Bh aged potatoes when shipment is being made. As you know, two seasons past we |9 went on the basis of strict U. S. No. 1 ' : . -^flHi^fe'fe-'I Bfil quality for the Blue Tag Package. Since ! " lat time we nave dama sed potatoes called j *° our attention more and more. Formerly Ij^^k^BE^fe^^ we didn't consider them quite as seriously 'fe^v '"- .'■ as we do now, for this reason: A U. S. No. 1 potato is the same as the time of MARX KOEHNKE digging, as it is two or three months later. Alliance, Ncbr. We used tQ naye tne , dea tna( . j n De . cember or January when we were making shipment of potatoes, a slight crack or bruise on the potato was fit to be shipped. Under the new regulations, the federal supervisor who lines up the inspectors on this grade proposition, says that is not the attitude to be taken. Previous to the last two or three seasons we used to make many shipments into cold storage. At that time this damaged potato prop - osition was very serious. In both of those two seasons, 1929 and 1930, when I was in Kansas City checking these potatoes out of cold storage, it became necessary to re-grade at the time of shipping, a good portion of every car before it could go out. We had not looked at that dam - aged proposition from the right angle. Rot had set in after these potatoes were shipped, and while they were in cold storage. The total loss was very great in some cases. The causes of these losses are principally two: First, the rot of the potato and second, the cost of shipping potatoes that are rotted, into cold storage, and afterwards discarded. Since that time our situation has changed so that we are able to hold all the potatpes right in our own cellars, and as a result, • this loss on paying freight on unsound potatoes is not present any - more. </seg>
            <seg id="p710">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE We have made many recommendations and urged at different times for many seasons, that you do your utmost to prevent damage. Many growers have followed a practice that they feel is best under the conditions, and in spite of that fact have found that a great deal of damage has occurred. In some seasons, I will say as an alibi for the grower who does have damage that in spite of the trouble he has taken, damage is due to factors beyond his control, and at these times he knows that no matter what he does, damage occurs. A few of those factors I will try to bring out in the course of my talk, and call to your attention other things I believe you all know. I do not have the idea of giving you a lot of new stuff — that Isn't my plan. Many of these facts have been brought to your atten - tion for several years. With reference to suggestions for remedying this damaged potato proposition, the constant repetition will not harm anyone, and in fact, some things may be secured from these talks that may be put to good advantage in your potato practices. I have pre - pared some slides that will be thrown on the screen very shortly to bring these various factors to your 'attention and I will use them more or less as of an outline for my talk. During the last ' three or four seasons. Professor Werner, in his work at the experimental station, has token into consideration this proposition of damaged potatoes, and in a great deal o£ detail has examined into the factors that caused damages. He has determined the percentages of damage that have resulted from these various causes. He has written a bulletin which he reported upon briefly last year, and I believe all of you have received a copy of it sometime during the past season. Perhaps you, like myseif, did not get to review this bulletin and to read it in full detail, so I am going to take a few of the high points from this bulletin and elaborate on those facts with some of my experiences as an inspector to bring some of the charts up to date, and to include a couple more years of work. In this particular chart we have a mean percentage of bruises and cuts in certified potatoes for five seasons past. This is a rather long period of record so that we have something now that we can use from which to draw conclusions. I believe five years Is a fairly good basis. Now these records have been taken from our certification records and represent various amounts of rot during various seasons. In 1928 there was a higher per cent of rots than there was in 1929. In 1930, 1931, and 1932 there was an increasing amount. We have now, records for the various counties. Some of the counties in western Nebraska have been grouped. Box Butte, Sheridan, Dawes are sep - arate while Kimball and Banner have been considered together for a number of seasons because of their being adjacent and conditions be - ing similar. I would say Cheyenne should be included with the last </seg>
            <seg id="p711">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION two for the last two seasons as well. Scottsbluff, Morrill and Garden counties were originally started out separately, but Garden County has just come in the last two seasons, and it is being run together with Morrill. Now what do these things mean? In 192S, as you no. doubt re - call, we had a season of low precipitation in the latter part of the growing season, and in some counties, particularly Kimball County, conditions at the time of digging were extremely severe. I recall one large grower who had at that time sold a great number of cars to be delivered during the shipping season. This particular grower encount - ered some of the most severe conditions luid over the territory. His soil conditions were very poor. When he started digging, there was practically no moisture in the soil and it turned up in large clods. As you know, the Triumph potato will not compete with clods. Kimball county as a result, stood far ahead in the percentage of damage. These figured.. all represent percentages. Box Butte was low with only 20%- Sheridan County, 28.6%; Dawea County, 31%; Sioux County, 34%; Kimball, 40% ; and Scotts Bluff, 22%. On account of lack of space I was unable to run an average of the various counties. Scotts Bluff county is a low-damage county tor this reason: the soil conditions at the time of digging are always fairly good. Irrigation is continued up to the latter part of the season and there is generally some mois - ture in the soil when the digging is being done, leaving a mellow textured soil during the time for digging. Let us consider the season of 1929 with only a 1G% average, which was practically the lowest. It was a year that was ideal from the standpoint of digging. In 1930, we have some counties making very good records. Sheridan County only had 9%. In that case the weather conditions were practically perfect. It rained at the right time so that when they began digging very little damage was done. In some cases, for instance the year, 1929, there was a late snow and conditions were fairly good. This damage instead of only including bruises and cuts, also includes cracking. On account of these conditions the cracking was unusually severe. The last two seasons have both been very severe, being almost as bad as 1928. The average shows 2G% in 1931 and 21.2% in 1932. In fact, when I reviewed these records and noted this fact, I was sur - prised to find that this past season had so low an average. Sheridan County was 14.77c ; Kimball and Banner Counties, 14.8%. The in - spectors who were inspecting in those two counties reported condi - tions were unusually good at the time of digging and potatoes came through with a small percentage of damage. Kimball has an en - viable record throughout the five years reported on. Sheridan County is fairly low but it is quite erratic. Local soils and varying local climate are differences that are responsible in those particular cases </seg>
            <seg id="p712">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE What la the significance to be drawn from those figures? I would say that two principal results may be shown from a review of those facts. The most important one is the fact that, unless the greatest amount of precaution is used, taking all into consideration there will be a great deal of damage, which results in the loss of No. 1 potatoes. From the standpoint of a certified grower, you are interested in getting the highest percentage possible of No. 1 potatoes. Later on in Mr. Cole's talk some of the records that were made by a number of growers in western Nebraska will be presented. One of the big factors of low cost is the lack of damage to potatoes when the proper care is exer - cised at the time of digging, and following digging. The excellent results made by some growers are due to the fact that they have used many precautions and secured practically 100% No. 1 potatoes. Let us review this past season. Here is Sheridan County with less than 15% of bruises, cracks, ■ and otherwise checked potatoes, that would have to be thrown out. Kimball and Banner Counties have less than 15%. In the experience that we have had, as inspectors, that is an exception rather than a rule. But Kimball County has been able to do that consistently. The records show this and we wonder why. Those of you who are not from Kimball County should consider these records carefully checking them with your own records. That is a fact no grower who is thinking of his future in continuing with certi - fied potatoes, especially under present conditions, can afford to neglect. Another important result that should be gained from study of these records is, that experiences of season after season shows that differing factors cause damage. Some of you will no doubt know, if you have watched your operations very closely, that what is suc - cessful in one year is not successful in the next, and vice versa. Extra - ordinary conditions occur once in a while. A good grower will grasp the situation and change his methods the last minute to save a lot of damage. This is the important fact I want to impress upon you, that it is not possible to use the same set method for performing operations each season and expect to be successful. As to the factors that cause bruising, cracking and checking, one of the most important, and one that all of you can probably check up and change, is the digger. The past season, when everybody was anxious to hold down his cost, many old diggers were used. That in itself was responsible for an unusual large amount of damage. One grower damaged his potatoes so badly that it was difficult to make a Red Tag grade. He had used his old wornout digger, which was "Penny wise and pound foolish." He could have gained enough had he at least repaired his digger, to have paid for it several times. The speed at which diggers are operated is another important factor. Many growers mechanize their operations, using power take- </seg>
            <seg id="p713">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION offs, etc., but In nost cases have no speed regulator, which resuiu iu the diggers operating too fast. Then other diggers are not properly constructed. Some of the old type diggers had an extremely high apron carrier. This apron lifts the potatoes off the ground three to four feet after which they are dropped all I that distance to the ground. Thus bruising was extreme. I can hay this, most of the new types of diggers have im - proved a great deal in that respect. However, the fact remains that not many of the growers were using new diggers. One of the factors. I believe, that could be used to explain damage on the other chart shown, is the character of the soil. Some of those years when we observed such high percentages of damage, the soil was always packed, and when it was time to dig this caused a lot of trouble. Climate is a factor that many of us do not take into considera - tion. The climate is something beyond our control, but nevertheless we have to watch the climate. If a little rain falls while digging and increases the trouble experienced in separating potatoes from soil, it is time to change the other controllable conditions. It is necessary to increase the number of shakers on the digger, and if the soil gets too dry, a change must be made the other way. Temperature is a factor that we can take into consideration. As you know, a potato left on the surface of the ground at the time of digging for two or three hours is less easily damaged by picking opera - tions. On relatively warm days, it is possible to leave potatoes on top of the soil and get the full advantage of drying out, consequently bruising less when being moved to the cellar. If conditions should develop where rain falls after the potatoes are on the top of the ground, one has to make the best of it. Then we have this exposure to the air proposition. After pota - toes have been exposed to the air three or four hours on a sunshiny day that is not especially warm, the full benefit of drying and harden - ing of the skin is secured so that handling from then on is compara - tively easy. The time of exposure to the air depends on several things including sunlight and temperature. If it is raining and cold, eight or ten hours or overnight is not sufficient to prevent checking or crack - ing. In fact, in some cases it increases. Under those conditions it is better to pick up potatoes immediately after digging. Ordinarily potatoes should lay exposed on the ground for three or four hours. Other conditions that we might mention here occur on various farms. Portions of fields are oftimes planted in low areas, and when such conditions as were had in 1928 are encountered, those low areas •always had a great deal of cracking and bruising on account of large </seg>
            <seg id="p714">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE cloas that came up on digging. In that case it is necessary to split up fields, digging a portion at one time and then digging more later. I have seen many growers do that, i Another fact that we fail to take into consideration is rate o£ evaporation. Some of the results secured at the experimental sta - tion show that evaporation after digging increases almost in direct proportion to the amount of cracks and bruises. I don't believe the average grower considers that angle. He fails to realize what a great percentage of loss is occurring from that standpoint. However, the loss from evaporation is very great and it is a very significant point. Going back again to 1928, the loss due to rotting following bruis - ing and cracking was extremely great, the breakdown of these pota - toes occurring during December and January, which is unusual con - sidered from the standpoint of the average season. This year, in some sections, particularly in the section about Alliance the loss due to rotting was extremely Kreat. I recall one grower at Hemlngford who planned on using the bruised stock for his seed next year. When he came to separating the bruised stock from his Xo. 1 potatoes, he found that only about ten bushels of the seconds out of one hundred bushels were safe to keep. The remainder had broken down with dry rot. This is in face of the (act that he had an uiisiuilly small amount of bruising too, and practically !)0&lt;;e of. that bruising resulted in rot, becoming total loss to him. The final result was that he had to hold considerable No. l's for his own seed for this coming season. Other instances like this just quoted were &lt;iuite general through this territory. This occurred in other sections, but particularly in Box Butte, Sioux and southern Dawes Counties. The conditions at the time of harvest were such that rot set in immediately after bruising and resulted in loss long before the winter was half over. Now in conclusion, I would like to tell you of work we have car - ried on in the last two years. A survey of damaging and bruising of potatoes at the time of digging was made. We have none over many western Nebraska farms checking to find the amount of dam - age being done. We have found at almost every operation some place where growers can check up and eliminate trouble. They might adjust diggers and improve results by putting on one or two inexpensive parts. They might check up on the pickers. They could also check up on the method of putting potatoes in the cellar. We found no man doing everything he should in the matter of eliminating bruises. However, many had it down to the point where but a small amount of damage was being done. They were doing all that could be done to prevent bruising, but those men are really the exceptions. It should be said that, in spite of the fact many growers think they are as careful as possible, at the time of digging, there is usually such a rush that there </seg>

In our experimental work we have put potatoes into cold storage on different dates in the fall and in the spring as shown in. Table 1. In 1931 potatoes were dug on Oct. 3, all were taken out of cold storage into the cellar on June 8, and final weight records were secured June 2 4. When considering the relative merits of the different storage treatments it appears that putting potatoes into cold storage on Oct. 10, ten days after harvesting was the best procedure to prevent weight loss, the weight having been SO.S% of that when taken out of the field on Oct. 1. The percentage of sound potatoes (S7.9%) was how - ever, hardly any higher than in the case of potatoes into cold storage on Nov. 15th (87.7%). This was due to less sprouting and rotting with Nov. 15 storage, probably due to temperature conditions having been better for healing wounds with the delay of low temperature. Storage immediately after harvesting seemed less desirable, the per - centage of sound tubers having been reduced, due to more sprouting. Table 1.

The cellar storage during the 1931-32 winter was exceptionally good, so that the losses in the cellar were about as low as could be expected in most cellars. Prom the standpoint of bushels of potatoes available for planting, it seems that low tem - perature in the spring is very important and that if the potatoes are not permitted to warm up till late in the spring best results will be secured. "When experimental potatoes were planted, the stand of plants from all lots put in cold storage on or before May 15 was about the same. However, when potatoes were put into cold storage for only a short period of two weeks beginning in late May or early June, the stand was always severely reduced', even below that of the cellar stored lots. During three of the last four seasons the yield per acre was de - creased slightly when potatoes were put into cold storage during the first ten days after harvest. There was little difference in yield until cold storage was limited to a short period in early June, which yielded only a little more than the cellar stored lots. During one of the sea - sons yields declined slightly with oach delay in putting potatoes into cold storage during the spring. -,• All things considered — low storage temperatures continued into the spring as late as possible seem to be most desirable.

For each hundred pounds of potatoes put into cold storage on April 1 there were 3.3 pounds more sound potatoes on June! 24 than in the continual cellar stored lot, but when storage was continued till June 8 there were 15.5 lbs. more ill the cellar. Cold storage till June 21 resulted in no rot or sprouts and 2 7.7 lbs. more of sound tubers than in continual cellar storage. The stand of plants was improved with each prolongation of the storage period up to early June. Continuance beyond that time re - sulted in a decreased stand — but all cold storage lots gave stands superior to cellar stored seed. Each prolongation of low storage temperature tended to reduce the number of stems per plant. This might be a factor favoring de - velopment of larger tubers from seed very dormant at planting time, a tendency which is partly counteracted by the superior stands from seed held in cool place for the longer periods. During three out of four years yields increased with each pro - longation of cold storage up to the middle of June. Cold storage beyond that date caused a slight decrease. In one year removal from cold storage on April and May 1 resulted in lower yields than cellar storage but lots in cold storage till June yielded more. In the fourth year all yields were so low that differences could not be detected. It was apparent that very generally some period of cold storage in the spring can be counted upon to increase yields and that continuance up to early June is advisable. Fall vs. Spring Cold Storage. From the data in Table 3 it appears that in the winter of 19. 11-3 2, there were more sound potatoes on June 24 with continual cold storage (lot 3) than with spring storage only (lot 9). Both of these storage methods were superior to fall and spring cold storage (Lot 15). Fall and winter cold storage (lot 3) was only slightly better than con - tinual cellar storage (lot 16) and fall storage only (lot 13) was the poorest of all methods. When potatoes were in the cellar during the spring sprout growth was very great. Rotting was most severe with lots that had been in cold storage during the fall but which were re - moved for all or part of the time after December 1 (lots 13 and 15). With cold storage to and after May 15 instead of April 1 the re - sults were of the same nature regarding sound potatoes, rotting and sprouting. Apparently spring cold storage is far superior to fall storage or to fall and spring cold storage and almost as satisfactory as continual cold storage and probably more practical. </seg>

[When potatoes are taken out of a low temperature to a higher tem - perature they respire rapidly. With this reHpiration much carbon di - oxide is generated and heat is given off. Cutting the seed for planting also accelerates this process. If the potatoes are taken out of the cole! storage and cut and planted at once this process might occur with damaging rapidity. Table 8.

            <seg id="p721">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION Storage of Cut and Bruised Potatoes. Cut and bruised potatoes either cause a reduction in the market grade or may cause potatoes to be entirely unmarketable. In former years I have discussed ways of avoiding some of this damage. How - ever, in spite of best efforts much damage is done to Triumph potatoes at harvest time under some conditions. If potatoes that are damaged too much for marketing can be stored successfully they can be used for seed purposes. It therefore becomes important to learn how such potatoes can best be stored. In the fall of 1932 cut potatoes were handled in various ways and put into both cellar and cold storage. At this date we can report only on weight losses that have occurred from harvest time on Oct. 3 to the last weighing date which was March 1. Exposure of cut seed potatoes to the sun at Harvest Time. (Knife cuts made tangentially so as to expose an area about one inch in diameter.) Potatoes with the cut surface exposed to the sun for four hours and then put into cold storage lost less weight during the fall than those held in the cellar, but after midwinter the cold storage lots were beginning to lose weight more rapidly. By March 1 the weight of cut potatoes in cold storage was down to 78% compared with a weight of 90% of the original, in case of uncut potatoes. Our data indicate that prompt cold storage delays wound healing and this may result in heavy losses late in the season whereas with cellar storage early, conditions are better for wound healing and altho weight losses are then higher, due to the temperature, rot losses are likely to be less later. When potatoes were exposed with the cut surface to the sun, weight losses have always been greater where they were exposed a greater length of time. The losses were more rapid, at first and they have con - tinued at a higher rate. On Mar. 1 the weights of lots unexposed, and those exposed one, four and eight hours were down to 78%, 68%, 64% and 52 % respectively. When cut potatoes were exposed for an 'equal length o£ time with cut surfaces down the weight losses have been very much less. This indicates that when the sun is shining brightly the storage quality of damaged potatoes may be impaired by too long exposure to the sun. The potato grower needs to strike a happy medium so that the potatoes are exposed long enough to avoid exces - sive cracking and yet not long enough to cause excessive loss in storage due to the damaging effect of the sun upon the cut surfaces. The type of cut had some effect upon the rate of weight loss. When cut in half crosswise the weight was down to 49% on March 2, but when cut in half lengthwise in spite of a greater surface exposed the </seg>
            <seg id="p722">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE weight was down to 55%. The difference being due to the arrange - ment of the sap tubes as related to healing processed. The condition of these tubers suggest that tubers damaged as much as being cut in half are very difficult to keep, especially if the cut sides were exposed to the sun. Practical Application. Artificial ice or refrigeration plants are expensive and are not available to many farmers in western Nebraska. Even were they available the question of cost might sometimes render their use a doubtful economical practice. In considering the value of some means of procuring lower storage temperatures the grower must consider not only the prevention of sprouting and shrivelling o£ the potatoes, but also the prevention of rot both before and after planting, the stand of plants in the field and the grade and total yield of the crop produced. There seems to b'e little gained by using lower temperatures (than good cellars provide) prior to about April 1 and as late as May 1 appears to be very practical. Short late low temperature storage periods will prevent shrinkage but sometimes bring about undesirable results in the field. Potatoes should be allowed to warm up slowly before planting. Low temperatures early in the fall do not seem necessary. There are even some indications that low temperatures (3 2° to 4 0 5 F.) may be undesirable if they occur during the first two weeks. This is probably due to their delaying the healing processes. A thoughtful, resourceful and cautious potato grower can devise many means of maintaining a low temperature in his potato cellar without great expense or frequently without any expense. The first essential is of course a good well insulated cellar. During the winter, in storing seed potatoes it is probably well to keep the temperature between 35 and 40°F. Whenever the temperature tends to rise the cellar should be opened up during the time the outside temperature is lower; by mid spring this may often be only at night. When the out - side air is warmer than the cellar, the doors and ventilators should be closed and should be kept closed, being opened only when very nec - essary. A six inch covering of straw placed on the roof of the cellar will reflect the heat of the sun and keep the cellar roof (and in turn the cellar) perceptibly cooler. During 40 days between May 14 and June 25 In 1931 the temperature of the soil of the roof six inches below the surface was 63.1 C F. under a straw mulch compared with 69.5°F. without the mulch, a difference of 6.4°F. Such a mulch applied as soon as the cellar starts to warm up, due to heat coming through the roof, will undoubtedly prove very useful. </seg>
            <seg id="p723">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION Treating seed potatoes with hot formaldehyde, to reduce scab, might be done during April just as the potatoes in the cellar are start - ing to sprout. This will kill the first sprouts and will retard the total sprout growth without doing any permanent damage to the potatoes. It is important, however, that this treating be done either in a part of the cellar which is separated by a tight, well insulated partition or outside of the cellar so as to avoid heating up the cellar. Likewise the treated potatoes should not be returned to the storage space in the cellar till they have cooled off reasonably well. After the cellar temperature is once raised it cools down very slowly. Our thermographic records show that when a truck was driven into the cellar and the motor was shut off at once, that the tempera - ture in a distant portion of the cellar was raised 3 to 4 degrees and what was most important, the temperature did not get down to the previous level for two or three days. Some farmers have resorted to the practice of using some of the bins of a cellar for ice storage. They think that this helps consider - ably. We have not had opportunity to check up on this practice, but it sounds reasonable and could be very widely applied. I have said nothing about humidity. The humidity should be relatively high so as to prevent undue shrinkage. The floor of the cellar should be thoroughly saturated before storing potatoes. During the fall on dry windy days the cellar doors should be kept closed. During the winter the dirt in the driveway should be kept damp. As soon as the dirt in the driveway becomes dusty the humidity is lower than it should be. This is only a brief preliminary report of work which is In progress and which will bo continued for several years more. Additional re - ports will be made from time to time. </seg>

Practical experiences and observations support his conclusions. You are perhaps thinking to yourselves that you are not so interest - ed in these general records on rainfall as you are in the possibilities of getting more out of it in the way of crop yields. That is the final measuring stick. Suppose we take the annual average precipita - tion of 18 inches and see if we can determine what becomes of it. How much do crops actually use, and what becomes of the rest of it? Possibly we can get some hint as to the location of leaks thru which rainfall is escaping. Can we plug up some of these cracks and save more water for crop production? </seg>

It has been reasonably well determined how much water it takes to produce a bushel of corn, wheat, oats and potatoes. For instance, it takes about one inch of rainfall to make 5 bushels of corn, or 5 bushels of oats or 3.3 bushels of wheat. It has been estimated that it requires about 1 inch of water to make from 17 to 20 bushels of potatoes. By using average yields of crops in the panhandle of Nebraska, we find that about 5 inches of rainfall are actually transpired by the com - mon crops each season. </seg>

True, tney cool the atmosphere and add to the humidity, thereby reducing trans - piration. In some cases moisture from showers is caught by plant leaves and concentrated somewhat about the base of the plants. For the most part, however, light showers may be considered of slight value so far as adding to the soil moisture available to plants is con - cerned. Studies at the North Platte Station indicate that showers under one-half of an inch add little, if anything, to the storage of sub - soil moisture. Winter Losses of Water. Figure 5 shows that, on the average, we may expect 27% or 4%" of precipitation during the winter months. Most of this comes as light snows or as drizzling rains. Much of it falling as snow, drifts into canyons and along roads and adds but little to the stored soil moisture of fields. Moreover since the ground is frozen for a con - siderable per cent of the time, the winter moisture is not likely to be taken up by the soil. It therefore seems reasonable to believe that of the 4 % inches of winter precipitation at least 3 inches are lost for crop production purposes. Runoff Losses. "When it rains it pours" is only too true of Nebraska. Weather records show that a considerable amount of the summer rainfall comes as dashing showers. Mr. Zook of the North Platte Station in reporting the results of 193 2 experiments points out that altho over 10 inches of rain fell in June and July at the Station very little entered the subsoil. I recall getting caught in a downpour on the level table land north of Sidney last July. This driving rain falling on a dry soil ran oft for the most part as evidenced by the flooded draws and overflowed roads which made it impossible to pass over the highway for some time. Work reported from erosion stations, where the per cent of runoff was being studied, shows that relatively level grain fields, having a 4 to 8 per cent slope, lost from 12 to 30 per cent of the season's rain - fall which amounte^d to from 3 to 9 inches of water. These fields also lost from 2 to 5 tons of good fertile surface soil per acre during the season. These figures show that the runoff and loss of soil from culti - vated fields such as fallow, potatoes or corn is particularly heavy. It seems reasonable to believe that on average hardland, well over 3 inches or 17 per cent of the season's precipitation is lost annually by runoff. It would, of course, be lower on reasonably level sandy soils, and yet one caught in the sand hills during dashing rains cannot help </seg>
            <seg id="p730">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ; but notice that there is much runoff even on these sandy soils. What can be done, if anything, to save at least a part of this runoff. Terracing is being suggested as a practical means of saving both soil and moisture. In Webster, Red Willow, and Furnas counties, there are some GO fields already terraced for the dual purpose of saving runoff and the top soil with its organic matter and nitrogen. In Oklahoma and Texas, thousands of acres are being terraced. Is thia practical on the relatively level farms of the panhandle? I believe that it should be given a trial. The use of the broad based graded terrace, also known as the Mangum terrace, is suggested. One crops over these and no time or area is wasted. The cost of terracing aside from the labor involved is very small. Mr. L. L. Zook, Agronomist at the North Piatte Station, reports that in 1932 when 10 inches of rain fell in June and July, the effect of the loss of runoff and its accumulation on certain plots was very striking. For instance, oats on a plot which lost its water by reason of being on a slope made 10.0 bushels, while a comparable plot which received some of the runoff made 41.9 bushels per acre. On two other plots, where oats followed potatoes!, the plot which was so located that there was considerable runoff, yielded lo.G bushels as compared to 43.8 bushels for a comparable plot which' received some of the run - off from higher on the .slope. If by terracing we can save three-fifths of the water necessary to produce an average crop, this should be worth while. Loss by Weed Growth. Figure 4 shows that about 4 inches or 22 per cent of the annual rainfall of 18 inches is lost in other ways than we have already dis - cussed. Weeds seem to be the chief culprits In causing this loss. Water which gets 6 inches or more into the soil is used chiefly by plants of some kind. If the weeds are allowed to grow they will use enormous amounts of water. A sunflower, for instance, has been shown to use three times as much water as a corn plant. Other ■weeds, -while they may be somewhat more efficient users of water when measured in terms of dry matter produced, are, as a class, heavy users of soil moisture. This is shown by the reduced yields of weedy fields. Table 2 shows the yields of fields of corn one of which was not -cultivated at all and the weeds allowed to grow; another was scraped to destroy weed growth; while a third was given 3 normal cultivations. </seg>

This difference was due chiefly to the use of soil moisture by the weeds. Likewise at North Platte, Mr. Zook in Bulletin 279 on "Dryland Crop Production at the North Platte Experimental Substation", re - ports as an average for 20 years, that winter wheat on clean fallow - made 30.1 bushels as compared to 22.2 bushels on weedy fallow. He also reports that, on the average, for 20 years, small grain land plow - ed early for winter wheat made 20.4 bushels per acre as compared to 14.7 bushels for late plowed land where weeds had been allowed to grow following harvest. Here again weeds made a difference of 5.7 bushels per acre. Water Storage in the Soil. In considering the possibilities of storing water in the soil several questions come to mind. How much water available to plants will the soil hold in each foot? How deep do plant roots go to get soil water or does it rise to the surface so that crop roots can use it? Is there any danger of water percolating downward so far that it is un - available to crop plants? The normal subsoil of the hardlands of western Nebraska will hold about 1 % inches of available water per foot. If one can fill the upper 6 feet of soil with water this would amount to 9 inches of rainfall. Mr. Zook reports that as an average for 18 years at North Platte during which 19.4 inches of precipitation fell, 5.24 inches was stored on fallowed land. This amounts to 27.1 per cent of the annual rain - fall. During the 18 year period the per cent stored varied from 8.6 per cent to 41.3 per cent. The greatest number of inches stored in any one year by summer fallow was 9. The lowest was 1.8 inches or 8.6 per cent of the seasons precipitation. </seg>

Until Mr. Young told us why he was here this evening, I was at a loss to determine why I had been asked to :^^^^^^^^^^^^^_: appear here in this capacity, but in view of the answer which was given by our toast - }M^KKf&amp;^' master, there seems to be no doubt as to jflj^B 'JB3r the reason. ■kuw.' jH Seriously, there is no cause for going into "*■'""' Vflj detail concerning the fact that we have a de- Wgp gfl pression, or to show that the condition 01 tflfl^^Hwr^ I economic affairs in the country is serious.

In view of that fact, I am going to take time to show you just a few charts which will give some indication of what has happened in years past. The first one is a chart of the general price level, running back a little over one hundred years, beginning in 1800 and extending down to the present time. You will notice that about halfway up and down on that chart is a line which is labeled "100 per cent line", or the bare line taken as a starting point, and the heavier line which is irregular in form, going above and sometimes falling below, indi - cates the position of the general price level as compared with the base of 100 per cent. The indentation there that you see gives the rises which have taken place and the drops which have come following those rises. Along about 1812 you will notice a very appreciable rise which took place during the War of 1812 and lasted through the period of that war and declined immediately following.

Following that there was rather a definite decline for thirty years which brought it down to 1S96, the low point in the nineteenth century. Then a gradual rise in prices took place which kept up until about 1914, or when the World War began, following which there was an appreciable rise almost to 225 per cent and lasting during the period of the war. Immediately after ilio war, in the latter part of 1920 and all through 1921, prices dropped. Then they flattened out somewhere near the level of 150 per cent nnd remained fairly stable until 1929. Most of you can re - member what has happened since that time. The line gives you a definite indication of the course of prices since about the middle of 1029, bringing them down to the end of 1932. That line is Pimply an average of all prices to indicate the general level of prices, and it does not mean that there are not some prices which have fallen much below that. The tiling I should like to show you in Figure 2 is the difference which has taken place in the depth to which prices of different classes of goods have fallen. The heavy line is a line indicating the prices of farm products and the broken line is a line indicating the prices of commodities bought by the farmer. You will notice the break which took place and you will notice how much more the heavy line dropped than did the broken line. That is a thing which has occurred in </seg>

The prices of raw ma - terials fall much more rapidlyNand farther than the prices of indus - trial products. If you will dfaw a perpendicular line between the very ends of those two lines, you will see that there is a considerable difference between the level at which farm prices stand and the prices of commodities which farmers buy. The prices of farm products have declined to a point which is just above 50 per cent of what they were in the five-year period, 1910 to 1914, which was a fairly stable and normal period before the World War. Prices of farm products are just about half as high as they were in 1910 to 1914. Prices of things which farmers buy are just a little above the figure at which they were from 1910 to 1!H4. This gives you all indication ol the disadvantage at which the farmer is placed when he attempts to sell the products' which he raises and to buy others. The third figure is very closely related to this second one, and tells to some extent the story of why that disparity exists. We have three lines on this one instead of two. As in the figure just preceding this, the heavy line indicates the prices bf farm products. The broken line just above indicates the retail price of food products, and the other broken line at the top represents the cost of distribution. By distribution we mean all those services and activities which take place from the time the raw products leave the farm until they are delivered into the hands of the consumer. That may be, in some cases, merely transportation and selling. In other cases, such as with wheat, It means processing, making into flour, making into bread; or in the case of cream, making into butter. You can see that the one broken line is about halfway between the heavy line and the broken line above it. The retail price of food is made up in part by the price of raw </seg>

The prices o£ things which the farmer has to buy have not come down in. the same proportion as the prices of things which he sells. If we stop to think a minute we can account for that. In the first place, when a period of declining prices comes along, farmers bo on producing about the same amount as they did before, because if corn is 10 cents a bushel it takes twice as many bushels to pay off a given amount of indebtedness as if corn were 20 cents, and this may cause the individ - ual farmer to attempt to produce more than he would have tried to produce under more favorable circumstances. In general, we can say, that a decline in prices in a short time does not cause very much decline in the production of farm products. On the other hand, a decline in prices of industrial products does affect production very promptly. The industrialist, that is, the manufacturer, has merely to turn off his laborers and to quit buying raw materials, and by so doing avoid a lot of expense. All he has left is his overhead, but his oper - ating expense of which labor and raw materials form the greater part can be eliminated by his going out of production, or can be greatly re - duced by cutting his production down one-half, two-thirds, or even ninety per cent. On the other hand, on the farm that is not so easy. In the first place, overhead forms a great part of the expense of agri - cultural production. There wouldn't be anything gained by letting a farm lie idle. Taxes go on just the same. If the farmer is in debt, the interest goes on the same. There isn't much choice on his part but to go on producing to a place where he can at least meet cash ex - penses and have a little left over to apply on overhead. As I said before, there are probably a hundred and one suggested </seg>
            <seg id="p742">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE reasons for causes of the depression. We may go further and say you will ! find very little agreement among people who write and speak on the subject as to just what the exact causes are. Bafore gotng fur - ther, however, I want to tell you that I don't know anything about it and I am not going to make any predictions. The best I can do for you is to suggest a few causes which have been put forward by men whom I think have a right to speak and write on the subject, and then let you use your own judgment as to whether or not they are reason - able. As to causes of the depression, I think there are probably three upon which there would be rather general agreement. The first one is the change of the United States from a debtor to creditor position. Second, is the growth throughout the world of a policy of tariff and trade barriers which have cut off international trade. Third, is the expansion of money and credit which took place in the United States, and throughout the world as well, through the years of 1922 to 1929. As you noted on Figure 1 which showed the world price level for the last one hundred and thirty-two years, there was an abrupt drop in prices following the close of the World War in 1920. That brought the price level down to about 150, or 50 per cent above the pre-war level. Then business activity recovered until about the middle of 1929 when we went into another nose dive, and we aren't out of it yet. As to what pulled us out of the difficulties in 1922, there is a little disagreement again, but there is agreement that circumstances then were quite different in some industries than they are now. Throughout the period of the World War very little building was done in the United States. At the close of the war period there was a shortage of building space after the drop in prices in 1920 and 1021 the demand for labor and materials used in building gave an impetus to the business revival which took place from 1922 to 1925. Another factor worthy of mention is that 1922 to 192G was about the time the automobile industry made its great progress forward. The use of raw materials and labor in the automobile industry created such a demand for them that it gave an impetus to business. Along with that, during the period of the World War, the agricultural indus - tries had accumulated some reserves of cash. Of course we got into debt quite heavily, but at the same "time there were reserves far ahead of the reserves that existed in agriculture in 1929 when we went into this depression. Thus there were several favorable factors which helped to bring out the depressed condition which existed at that time. - : ' .•■'■■■ ' X ■ ■ ;• ' . Y .■..::;: </seg>

You will notice that this table is headed "Wealth and Indebtedness in the United States (in Billions of Dollars)." In 1912, one of the normal years which oc - curred just prior to the outbreak of the World War, there were about $1SG, 000, 000,000 worth of wealth in the country, and $63,000,000,000, worth of indebtedness. The indebtedness was equal to about 34 per cent of the wealth in the country. In 1922, after we had gone through the period of the World War, during which time prices in - creased rapidly and land values soared markedly, we had estimated in this country $321,000,000,000 worth of wealth and $136,000,000, - 000 of indebtedness. The estimated debt was equal to 42.4 per cent of the wealth. In 1929, there were $362,000,000,000 worth of wealth and $203,000,000,000 indebtedness. The debt was 56 per cent as large as the total wealth — more than half-. Now the significant thing is what has happened since that time. As all of you realize, prices have dropped so much since 1929 that we do not have $362,000,000,000 at the present time, if we had that amount in 1929. According to an estimate made by Dr. Warren of Cornell, and he is the man responsible for this complete feet of figures, the total of the country's wealth is probably about $20*0,000,000,000 at the present time, or just about equal to the indebtedness. It may be said that we have paid off some of our indebtedness. We have paid off a little of it. At the same time some other types of indebtedness have actually increased. The debt of the Federal government in 1926 is given as $16,000,000,000. Since then there has been a $4,000, - 000,000 increase. So, all in all, Dr. Warren estimates that we have at the present time in this country about $200,000,000,000 worth of wealth and about $200,000,000,000 worth of indebtedness. In other words, we have about as much debt as we are worth. The next ques - tion is what to do about it. Dr. Warren's suggestion in this connection is that there are just two things to do. One is to adjust prices upward and the other is to scale the debts downward. Which course will be taken, nobody knows and perhaps no one would be so foolish as to predict. However, </seg>
            <seg id="p744">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Inasmuch as there are some who own more than they owe, there are others who cannot come out under present conditions. Prices must come up or debts be scaled down. I am going to give you briefly the makeup of that $203,000,000,000.

He is an agricultural economist at Cornell University. He was born in Clay County, Nebraska, and I think it is safe to say that Mr. Warren is closer to the farmer in his viewpoint and in his experience than any other man in the United States who claims to be an economist. Now, in general, there have been about three classes of proposals as to how we might remedy the present situation. I am going to men - tion briefly the three classes and then forget about two of them. First, changes in the monetary system of the country; Second, the so-called farm relief programs; Third, the adoption of something which will facilitate trade both locally in the United States and throughout the world. Now, just a word on that first one, changes in the monetary system of the country. Many of you have heard suggestions made within the last few months as to how we might meet this situation. One has been to issue a lot of paper money, such as Germany did following the World War on two different occasions. Another is to bring back silver as a standard money. At one time we had bimetallism, 16 to 1, 15% to 1 at another time, down until 1873. As a matter of tact, it was not erased from the statute books until 1900. That simply meant that you could take either gold or silver to the mint and have it coined into money. Another suggestion in the way of bringing silver back, or perhaps I had better mention one more point concerning bimetallism. The difficulty was that when either one of those metals, say silver, got too plentiful, it drove the other out of circulation. On the one hand, if gold got too plentiful and cheap, there was a tendency to take gold to the mint and sell the silver. So much of a problem did that become that in 1853 it was necessary to pass what they called the "token coinage act" which took out part of the silver put </seg>
            <seg id="p745">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION in small coins, and made it unprofitable to melt them up and sen mo silver in them. Another plan that would eliminate this difficulty is what is called "symmetalism" which merely means that instead of a dollar having 23.22 grains gold, it would have a certain number of grains of gold plus a certain number of grains of silver. All of these proposals are based on the idea that if we get more money into cir - culation, we will be able to increase prices and remedy the difficulty. Another one which has been suggested is the one referred to as "re - valuation of the dollar." That is, instead of about 24 grains in tho dollar, we will change the law so there will be only about 16 or 12. Therefore, with a given amount of gold, we could make more dollars and the* gold supply would go farther. As stated before, these pro - posals are all made by a group of men who feel that more money in circulation would remedy the difficulty, increase prices, and bring us out of the depression. There is some disagreement on that and we are not certain as to just what this effect would be, if we do not correct some of the more fundamental things which are affecting the situation at the present time. When I Bpeak of that, I am thinking of our foreign trade problem. 2.OOI 1 ; — I 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8o \ ,.. ■r-^r 1 ' Rr" - ~ WO 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 \ Export GRevp - Mo«« . CoTTom .

If you will read along the left side of the figure O at the bottom, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 on up to 180. This is based on the pre-war level at 100 per cent. One hundred is regarded as the starting point and the figure begins with the years 1920 and 1921. You will notice that the non-exportable group of commodities were high and they came down to where the export group went above them and continued there until 1925. Then in 1928 export products went down. Notice what commodities are included in those two groups. The non-export group includes: butter, cattle, poultry, potatoes, etc. In the export group you have, of course, cotton, wheat, tobacco, etc. I wonder if there is any way of explaining why at the present time the export group of commodities stands at only 40 per cent, about 42 per cent, of the pre-war level, while the non-export group stands at 80 per cent of the pre-war level, or about four-fifths of what the price level was in 1910 to 1914. There are those who believe that that is directly attributable to the fact that within the past few years we have lost heavily on our world trade. In the first place, it began right after the World War ended. Europe was re - divided into a considerable number of smaller states and countries, each of which thought it should be a separate entity in inself. Each of those countries felt that the nearer it could come to being self - sufficient, that the better it would be in time of trouble, or as a matter of fact, any other time. So there grew up, in Europe especially, a policy which they have called "nationalism" and which aims at pro - ducing within each individual country all those things possible to produce there which are necessary to the existence of that country. That naturally led to an increase of tariffs within the countries; to going further than merely increasing tariffs and erecting trade bar - riers against imports. I suppose, as a matter of fact, we can say that they have copied us because the United States has been a leader in the direction of high tariffs. The tariff which was enacted in 1922 increased the duties against imports coming in here. The tariff enacted in 1930 further increased those tariff duties and did its part toward cutting down the trade which we had with foreign countries. </seg>

The Chase Economic Bulletin issued by The Chase National Bank of the City of New York, November 17, 1932, Vol. XII, No. 4. Table 2 has to do with 1922 and the years that followed. We were exporting more goods than we were importing. We have always planned to do that because you will remember we accumulated a debt in the War o£ the Revolution. Just about the time we got that paid up, we got into the Civil War. All through our history practically the United States has been a debtor nation. Therefore, it was easy enough to find a foreign market because we didn't have to import as much as we exported. In 1920, far from being a debtor nation, we came out of the World War the greatest creditor nation in the world. The right hand column shows the amount of foreign loans which were made each year, 1922, 1923 and on down, and you will notice in several of those years that amount of foreign loans was six figures and extended over into billions of dollars. We were selling goods to Europe and lending them money with which to buy those goods. In general, there are just two ways in which a country can pay for its imports. One is to pay for them with exports and the other is to pay for them with gold. When countries are off the gold standard as they are now, foreign countries, of course, are not accepting the depreciated currency of other countries of the world. One way is to pay for them in goods and the other is to pay for them in gold, and we know that with eleven or twelve billion dollars worth of gold in the world and about two-thirds of that in France and in the United States, there is not enough gold left to enable the other countries ot the world to keep that up very long. That brings it down to a place where there is no alternative. The only way we can expect to sell to them is to let them pay for imports from us with exports to us. </seg>
            <seg id="p748">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Just where has that affected agriculture? We can go back into history and see that through all that period when the United States was paying off its debts to England and other foreign countries with exports, a great part of those exports was farm products. The policy of the United States has been to develop the Middle West and the West in order to produce a. surplus of farm products to be exported. The farmers of the country prospered and especially was that true after 1896 when prices were rising. Farm prices were increasing more rapidly somewhat than prices of other products and land was selling at a premium. But now, we have just the reverse taking place. In - stead of expanding our world trade, there seems to be a tendency to reduce it. We have gone ahead and built up in this country a plant to produce agricultural products. The farms are here, they are im - proved, the people are living on them, and they are improving their methods of production in such a way that they are producing more all the time. Yet, even though they are producing more, the prices they are able to get for their products have dropped to such a place that they can not make "cost of production." Figure 4 shows that farm products which are exported are selling at just about half as high a level as farm products which are not ex - ported to any great extent. Here is what happened. The first of the farm products to be affected in this part of the country was wheat. Wheat is the principal export product in this section. As soon as wheat fell, there was a tendency for producers of wheat to shift out of wheat production and find something else which they could sell. There were increases in butterfat production and hogs and other things so that the non-export group of commodities suffered, due to the fact that there was a shift in production. Now there is a group of people in this country who would have you believe that the solution of this problem is to cut down production. On the basis of that we would produce just enough wheat, corn, cotton and hogs to support the people in the United States. I am wondering if they realize how difficult a thing that is. For many years we have been in the habit of exporting 50 per cent of the cotton, 20 per cent of the wheat, 30 per cent of the lard, 35 per cent of the tobacco pro - duced in this country. When you consider that in spite of the low prices which have existed for wheat during the last three years, the estimate of the acreage sown to fall wheat last fall showed a reduction of just one and three-tenths per cent, how long do you think it would take to get down to a domestic basis for wheat? There is a pretty general belief that if we are to commit ourselves to that policy of re - ducing our agriculture to a domestic basis, it is going to mean bad times for agriculture for many years to come. A lot of agricultural land which is now being used and cultivated regularly would have to go out of cultivation. A lot of equipment would have to be scrapped. </seg>
            <seg id="p749">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION because there is too much to produce the required amount of food products for the people •who live in the United States. Now as to this question: Why have any -world trade? There is just this to say. We probably have world trade for just the same reason that we have any other kind of trade. Some of you men pro - duce potatoes, some produce corn, some produce wheat, but you don't produce cotton, you don't produce tobacco, bananas, or oranges. Why don't you? Because you feel that somebody else in some other part of the country can produce those things cheaper than you can, and that you can trade your potatoes, wheat, cattle, or whatever you produce, for the oranges, cotton, and coffee produced elsewhere. When it comes to this matter of exchanging commodities, there is a possibility of both trading and making a gain. These differences In adaptability don't stop with state lines. They don't stop with the boundary lines of countries either, because if you people in this coun - try, or any part of the United States, had to produce your own coffee, and the rubber in your automobile tires, you probably wouldn't have very much of either. So there is an advantage in world trade. Some of our industrial friends tell us that to let foreign manufac - tured products come in would destroy the standard of living of the American laboring man, that it would destroy the market for indus - trial products. To my way of thinking they have already destroyed the greatest market for industrial products — namely the American farmer. Men of influence have changed their viewpoint on this very question within the last eighteen months: O. D. Young of General Electric is one, and Louis Brown of Johns-Manville is another. Within the last six months I have noticed statements from both of these men indicating that they would favor a reduction in tariffs in the United States, that they would favor a settlement of the world debt situa - tion, that they would favor any kind of reciprocal agreements be - tween the United States and the rest of the countries of the world which would give back to the United States her lost foreign markets for agricultural products. Those men aren't thinking only of the farmers out here in the Middle West. Their reason for saying that Is this: that due to the fact that the farmers have suffered perhaps worse from the standpoint of financial loss, the industrial east is unable to sell industrial products to the farmers of the country. If a recovery of world trade and farm products would put the farmer back on a reasonably profitable basis and make him the kind of buyer he was in the period from 1922 to 1929, nothing better could happen to in - dustry and to the American laboring man because the farm is where the best market for industrial products always has been and always will be. We hear it said occasionally that American labor and American </seg>
            <seg id="p750">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Industry cannot compete against the low -wage level which exists in foreign countries. I am wondering if that is true. Ifi the first place, we export a lot of farm machinery. The International Har - vester Company for many years has exported farm machinery to South America, and in recent years has worked up a trade with Russia. We export a lot of automobiles, typewriters, etc., and not more than live years ago I recall reading an incident of where Japan had entered a vigorous protest against rice being shipped from California to Japan and competing with Japanese rice. The California rice grower was at that time probably paying $3.00 a day for labor. Still he was able to produce rice and ship it. to Japan because of certain advantages he had — machinery and land which was more favorably situated. In any case he was more efficient than was the Japanese rice grower. I ■do not believe you can h ly that the low wage levels of foreign ■countries necessarily will be able to drive the American industrial man or the American farmer out of business. Xow if Europe and the rest of the world can produce industrial products, such as watches, which require a lot of time and labor, cheaper than we can, why not let them produce them, and let us produce the products to the production of which we are best adapted. In getting out of this muddle there are about three remedies which stand out ahead of the others. One is to get back some of our foreign trade. Tied with the problem of getting back our foreign trade, a great many men will put foremost this matter of tariffs nnd trade barriers. In general, Germany, France, England, most of the Euro - pean countries have gone us one better in this tariff question. Then we have another problem closely connected with that, and that is this matter of stabilization of foreign exchange rates. England is off the gold standard. England has been known as the banker of the world. The fact that she hns be^n off lias led to a grent deal of Instability in exchange rates. Closely connected with the problem of foreign ex - change rates is this matter of the war debt. The allied debt, the present value of which is about 5% billion dollars, as it is to be paid out over a period of sixty years will amount to about 10 billion dollars. There are those who believe that, if necessary, we might well make them a present of that 5 Vi billion dollars rather than to go on quibbling and losing ten times that much every year because of idle productive capacity in this country. First, the recovery of foreign trade; second, some adjustment of our credit situation; and third, some adjustments within the price structure within this country. By that I mean simply this — Figure 2 indicated that prices of farm products were down to about 50 per cent of pre-war prices and the prices of other things were about 100 per cent, under such conditions the farmer isn't going to buy any more than is absolutely necessary. There are some kinds of service and commodities the prices of which have not yet been reduced at all, and it seems to me that as a part of </seg>
            <seg id="p751">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION the adjustment which will help to alleviate the situation, we are going to have to look to some of those things. The wage earner is in this sort of dilemma. If he has a job he may be getting about as much for the amount of work he puts in as he was three years ago. Some workers have taken 10 per cent reductions, others have taken more, and non-union labor in many cases has taken very heavy reductions. There are a good many who believe that one of the smartest things that could be done on the part of industrial interests would be to reduce the prices of their products to somewhere near in line with a. level at which they can be purchased. I am going to read just one illustration of that point. First, I am goins to read a statement from the National City Bmk Letter. A The National City Bank publication due to the investigation which took place a few days ago, may not carry so much weight with you as for - merly, but at the same time I still have a little confidence in the author of their monthly letter. Here is what he says: "The disparity between the prices of what the farmer sells and what he is accustomed to buy has increased until, as recently reported by the Department of Agriculture, farm staples will buy only about one-half as much of the other things as over the five years ending in 1913, This is not to the advantage of other gioups in the industrial system. On the contrary, it has been their undoing. It is destruc - tive of trade with the agricultural population of this country." This viewpoint seems to be filtered pretty well through the East, among the industrial and financial interests there, aud I have hopes that some day it will filter far enough through that we will get some constructive action. Now with all due respect to my friend, Mr. Waggoner, over here, I am going to read a little incident that has to do with railroads. This instance has to do with an eastern railroad and not with a western road. It took place in Pennsylvania. A paper mill, the owners of which had under consideration an opportunity to shift from coal to crude oil, laid the conditions before the railroad company by which it was accustomed to receive coal. The representative expressed his regret that they were unable to make a more favorable rate and said: "I am sure you are conversant with the conditions confronting the carriers at the present time and appreciate the seriousness of our situation, and if you should determine to change your fuel, it would cause us to suffer a very heavy loss in revenue right at the time when we can least afford it." The paper company replied as follows: "We are engaged in a business that must meet changed economic condi - tions or close up. It is obvious that we cannot meet the changed con - ditions and continue to deal with companies that refuse to meet changed conditions." </seg>
            <seg id="p752">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Tiie prices of some things have not been reduced. The reply usually is, "We have an investment in this company and today we are not making 5 per cent interest on our investment. How can we reduce?" In that connection, it may be said that a lot of farms aren't making 5 per cent on the investment, nor even one per cent. That isn't the question at all to my way of thinking. The question is: Just what can a company do, or an individual do that will make the best of a bad situation? Just what rate policy or what price policy can he follow which will give him the greatest return after expenses have been paid whether or not that begins 1 to cover interest on the investment. It seems to me that is the question for every business concern to answer in making price decisions which they are compelled to make. I am not using this as a criticism at all but I do believe, there are some interests which are losing heavily by their rate policy. We will talk about the telephone companies this time. I was down home some time ago and found that my father and most of the neighbors had taken their phones out. Upon investigating, I found that only about three on the country line had phones. The rate was $1.75 per month. There is considerable question as to whether the telephone company might not better reduce the rate and keep the subscribers, rather than to keep it up. and have only three out of a number of subscribers. I have taken too much time already and I am going to wind up by a .quotation from the man of whom I spoke earlier in the evening — Dr. Warren. The reason that I think there is some good in this is that it does lend a rather hopeful slant upon this situation in which we find ourselves even though we do have -a lot of things which are not entirely satisfactory. "While it is not the purpose of this discussion to consider what the individual can do for himself, I should like to unburden one possibility to the millions of farm and city home owners who are losing their homes and lifetime savings. If one lias a good farm, it seems to me the best thing to do is to retaTn possession of it as long as possible in the hope that there will be some temporary rise in prices or possibly a monetary change which will enable him to keep the property. If he gives up the savings are surely gone. He has little to lose from holding on as long as any slight chance remains." That comes out of the movements which have been made toward a moratorium, toward agreements which may be made between debtor and creditor throughout the country. "The man who has failed in business or is out of work is blamed for it and he often blames himself. This is adding insult to injury. Most failures are not due to unsound business but to unstable money for which no individual is to blame. The farmer or businessman who has failed should not be despondent or commit suicide. He should feel like a man who has just gone through a tornado, stripped of his property but escaped with his life. His family and friends should treat him accordingly." </seg>

LESSONS FROM COST ACCOUNTS KEPT BY 100 NEBRASKA CERTIFIED SEED POTATO GROWERS RALPH COLE Mr. Chairman, Gentlemen: I want to take just a little time this morning to show you some results of the cost records which some of the men out in this section kept last year and turned in to us last fall. I don't know just who is responsible for the starting of this performance, but when I came back here last summer it had already been started. Quite a number of potato growers out in this section were induced to keep records of production costs. We collected those last fall and worked up a study on the results. Some of them we have here to show you this morning. I want to say that these records were kept up to the time the potatoes were put into the storage cellar and do not include marketing costs and other costs which are incurred between that time and when they are sold. In all there were 31 of these records which were kept and turned in before the time that the averages were made up. Table 1.

You will notice that the divisions are divided into: Growing Costs, Harvesting Costs, Land Charge, Total Cost per Acre, Number of Acres, Yield per Acre and Average Cost per Bushel. The Growing Costs are divided into the following divisions: Man Labor, $2.55 per Acre; Horse Labor $83- Tractor Use, $1.96; Seed, $5.82; and other costs amounting to $1.74-1 making the total gross cost $12.90 per acre. The Harvesting Costs </seg>
            <seg id="p754">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE averaged $5.59; Land Charge, $2.62; Total Cost per Acre, $2i.ll. Dividing that by the Yield per Acre of G8.4, we find an average cost of $.31 per bushel on 31 farms. Then we divided the 31 farms into 3 groups: the 10 which had the lowest costs of production and the 10 which had the highest costs, leaving the intermediate 11. The 10 farms which had the lowest costs of production averaged $11.08 per acre Growing Cost, while the 10 farms which had highest costs averaged $14.88 per acre. The Cost per Bushel averaged $.23 against $.01. Of course, there were two factors there which operated: the growing costs per acre and the yield. An average yield of only about 35 bushels per acre was secured on the 10 high-cost farms, while it was about 81. G on the low-cost farms. Q. May I ask what that land charge is? How do you arrive at that? A. The basis used on that is this: with corn or wheat, we use the share of the crop which ordinarily goes as grain rent. With pota - toes, share rent is not common, wo use the cash rent. In case a man operates his own land, we use the cash rent figure which is common in that neighborhood. Q. How many of these 31 farm records represent certified grow - ers? ! A. They are all certilied except two, as I remember, and I think one of those had some certilied and some not. Q. Do you know whether those 10 low-cost farms were largo acreages or small? A. 61.6 acres in the low-cost farms, and the average acreage here is 28, so that shows that the low-coat farms average considerably larger acreages. Q. I notice your power cost on your low-ccst farms is higher than the high-cost farms. That is to say, your horse and tractor labor is higher. Did they cultivate more or what caused that? A. Evidently they put in more hours, but I can't telhyou whether it was in cultivation, preparation of the laud, or just whit the reason was. \ Q. I just wondered if that explained the higher yield. \ A. That is possible of course, and weather conditions Waried con - siderably last year. There are records here from Kimball.l Cheyenne, Box Butte, Sheridan and Dawes counties. These are scattered over a considerable area and there is quite a little variation in the rrfinfall, etc. that occurred during the past year. </seg>
            <seg id="p755">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION Q. Why is there so much difference in price of seed — $4.70 against $7.50? A. I don't know exactly how to account for that. I suppose some of the men who kept those records. can do that better. Q. Does that represent the invoice value of the seed? A. It is invoice value of the seed. The amount of seed put on per acre was fairly uniform, but I did find that there was a group of farms where the seed valuation averaged around $.40 a bushel, and then there was quite a large group where it averaged about twice that much, so that would indicate that possibly two classes of seed were used, but that is another point upon which our information is not complete and upon which we should like to secure more complete data in the future. Q. I think possibly you had more new growers in the high-cost group. We had more old growers in the other group who had their own seed and may have used their own seed. A. That occurred to me when I saw the figures. Q. Your power costs are about the same. The horse costs were less and machinery more. What rates were used for labor and power. I A. We figured man labor at $.20 per hour; horse labor, $.09; the rate for tractor power varied depending on the size of the tractor used— 2-plow, $.G5; 3-plow, $1.00; 4-plow, $1.10. Table 2.

            <seg id="p756">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ™ oiner, $.20. Now the way these two line up illustrates to you the two important reasons for variations in cost per bushel. The first one is illustrated by Farm No. 1 and the second by Farm No. 2. You will notice that the cost of growing ran rather high on Farm No. 1, a total of $19.62 per acre, as compared with $8.67 as the growing cost for Farm No. 2. But at the same time Farm No. 1 on a 5-acre field, which was a small acreage, secured a yield of 175 bushels. That Is pretty much out of line for this year but it did occur in this one case, and brought the cost down to $.18 per bushel. Farmer No. 2 was very successful in holding down growing costs per acre and at the same time secured a very good yield, 81 bushels, which is about equal to the average of the low-cost 10 and quite a little above the average of the 31 farms as a whole. Along with keeping his growing costs down to a low level, this man was able to secure a good yield. As stated before, this exemplifies the two chief reasons for variations in cost per bushel: one of them growing cost per acre and the other, yield per acre. ■ ' ' ' ; ■'■•■':■■■' One of the men who turned in a record; in fact, the man who turned in the record for Farm No. 2 is here and I am going to ask him to tell you in a few minutes the things he considers of importance relative to his growing 165 acres of potatoes at an average cost of $.20 a bushel. Mr. Johnson. MR. JOHNSON: I am not much of a speaker but I will tell you the method I used since 1928. I think it is mostly in the machinery you use, the seed, the way you prepare your ground and the time you prepare your ground. I am using 3-row machinery to raise potatoes, 3-row plow and 3-row cultivator. I believe that has quite a lot to do with it. I am also a great believer in using good sound seed. I use certified seed to raise certified potatoes. ■ I believe if a man keeps his seed good and sound up to planting time, prepares his ground early, uses a good planter and sees that it is planting right, that he will have better success and cut his costs in raising potatoes. If there is anything you want to ask me, I will answer it if I can. Q. How many days does it take to plant and what date did you start planting? A. I started planting last year on the sixth day of June and I finished the thirteenth. I planted 165 acres. Q. What time do you start plowing your ground? A. I disc it as soon as possible and then I plow as early as I can get to it. ■ ';■ - ■"• •■••;. Q. How much rainfall did you have before you planted last year? </seg>
            <seg id="p757">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION A. Why, there wasn't very much. I can't remember now. Now I had these fields scattered out in different places, and there is one field — two fields — that got more rain than the other two fields. I had a field of 90 acres quite a ways off and this 90 acres did not get half or even two-thirds of the rain these other two fields did. The yield was pretty good for last year. I think on that ground I got 90 bushels average. Q. What was your crop the preceding year before you put in the potatoes? A. This 90 acres I am speaking of, I broke this land five years ago and I raised nothing but grain on it, and I have been waiting all this time to get that ground in shape for potatoes. Now the soil is just right for potatoes. Q. What do you do with your seconds? A. Those were seconds I planted last year but they were sound potatoes. I kept them from sprouting up until the first part of May, and then I dipped them in hot Formaldehyde which sets the sprouts back, and by planting time they were still in pretty good shape. I have found that to be very successful. I leave my cellar open at night and then shut it up tight in the morning and it stays shut all day. Q. Do you have them in sacks? A. In sacks. Q. Do you move the sacks every ten days or so? A. I moved them once before I dipped. Then after dipping, I moved them a couple of times. Q. When do you sack them? A. As soon as I am through with potatoes, I sell them and then I go ahead and deliver my seed. Q. That would be about January? A. About February. They are sacked and packed 4-high across the cellar. Q. How often do you cultivate? A. Last year I cultivated twice. Before that I cultivated about four times. I believe, considering the weather conditions here last year, if the weather is pretty dry, the less you cultivate the better off you are. I used to believe the other way, but by experimenting and from what these College men tell me, I have commenced to believe that the drier it is, the less you had better cultivate. </seg>
            <seg id="p758">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Q. Do you think it injures the potatoes to break the sprouts? A. It may set them back a little but you do more good than harm. Q. Do you harrow crosswise? A. Lengthwise and crosswise. Q. How deep do you plant? A. Well, around three or four inches. Q. How much dirt do you mean to tfirow on top of them when you blind cultivate? A. I don't mean to throw any dirt on top of them. The rea - son 1 favor planting a little deeper than some do, last fall a lot of potatoes froze in the ground. My potatoes had no frost at all. I believe in plowing six or seven inches when plowing early. You may plow three inches deep and plant three inches. That doesn't mean that they are going to set any deeper than what you plow. Q. You spoke of plowing early. That is early in the spring? A. Anytime in April. Q. Do you plow after weeds have started? A. After weeds have started, I disc and then I plow. Then I let it lay there until about the middle of May and I disc that good. Q. Do you have to sow your potatoes by hand? A. I never sowed potatoes, till last year. Two fields I had a little trouble with on account of some hard rains and I couldn't get in with a. cultivator. Those were the only fields I ever sowed by hand. Q. Then do you disc this land good before you plant it? A. About the middle of May I disc and harrow it across and then I plant. By the time you are ready to plant, if any weeds have started up, they are torn up by the machinery. Q. What do you estimate your total rainfall was on that crop, 81 bushels, you have there? A. Well, I couldn't exactly tell you but on two fields we had three pretty hard rains. I don't believe those rains did very much good because they only lasted fifteen minutes. On the other field, I don't know, I believe there was just one pretty fair shower during the growing season. Q. You didn't cultivate after rains? </seg>
            <seg id="p759">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION A. No, I didn't, because the rain wasn't enough to pacK me ground, that is, on this 90 acres. But the other fields I did cultivate after hard rains as soon as it was dry enough, but I couldn't do anyv thing in the way of controlling weeds because I couldn't get deep enough. Q. Do you throw dirt over the plants when you cultivate? A. Close to them. I also practice using a spring weeder follow - ing the cultivation. I found that to be a pretty good idea. If there are any weeds, it helps as it leaves the ground in good condition. Q. You went over the ground the third time? A. First and second time. The weeder was the third time. I follow up with the weeder right behind the cultivator. I use a team on that. Q. Here is an item that might be of interest to some of you men. Mr. Nuckolls, who has been making an investigation of sugar beet cultivation in the valley, has come to the conclusion that three culti - vations for beets on clean land are more valuable than five cultivations, which is quite a saving. A. I used to believe that the drier the land the more cultivation it needs and you hear some old timers say that today. In fact, I had a little trouble with the landlord last year on account of that. He wanted his potatoes cultivated more as he thought I didn't culti - vate them enough. He actually believed that the more you cultivate, the better potatoes you raise, but I don't believe that any more. If your potatoes are clean, I don't believe It is necessary to cultivate and cut through those little roots. Q. Where is your farm located? A. Seven miles south of Hemingford. Q. What is the nature of your soil? A. It runs a little sandy. Q. What is your subsoil? A. The subsoil is magnesia-like. It is deep soil. Q. How. deep? A. You have to get down about two feet. That is another thing I always watch in planting potatoes, I always pick out the deep soil. Q. How deep do you figure your potato roots grow? </seg>
            <seg id="p760">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE A. I don't know. I just believe the potatoes do better on deep soil. I never dug down. MR. WERNER: We have dug some and find that they go down two or three feet. If there is moisture, they probably go beyond that. Q. How many bushels do you plant to the acre? A. About twelve. Last year I planted them about fifteen inches apart. Q. How much do you cut your seed piece to weigh? A. I believe in planting good sized seed. Q. What kind of a planter do you use? A. I have a Eureka planter, 3-row. Q. Mr. Werner, in your investigation on cultivation of potatoes. Is there any benefit derived from breaking the small roots at any time? A. I don't think there is any benefit. Q. How close to the surface do those roots that bring in moisture usually grow? Mr. Werner. A large number of them are in the top three inches and right next to the plant, and then as you go out to a distance of about eighteen inches, they will be down 'to about six inches. That picture which Mr. Stewart showed yesterday is a very characteristic picture. ' - ; Q. To get back to cultivation. You made the statement that you believed in fewer cultivations. Would you go to this 1 extreme of not cultivating. at all after your plants were up, if you could see no excuse for cultivation, if no weeds had started or there had been no rains? A. I don't believe you could keep weeds from growing it you don't cultivate at all. I believe I would cultivate once at least to throw the dirt a little closer to the plant. Q. How is your grounds? Level? A. Pretty level. Q. What is your theory of throwing the dirt to the plant? A. Well, my theory is that it covers small weeds. Q. Do you cultivate with horses? </seg>
            <seg id="p761">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION A. With a tractor. Q. Do you use horse labor at all? A. Just in pulling that weeder. Q. Did you give us to understand, in case of a good rain, that you would cultivate after this rain even if you had cultivated twice? A. That depends on what time of the year it is. Q. Say along in the summer. A. If it is getting pretty crusty, I believe I would tear it up a little. I wouldn't get in, until it is pretty dry. Q. How deep do you plow? A. Between six and seven inches. Q. For early or late plowing? A. For early plowing. Q. Quite a few questions have been asked about this soil. I happen to have four soil samples taken in this section, and if any - body is interested in those samples, I will be glad to bring them up tor some soil analyst to work on. A. This 9 acre field I am speaking of is not out there. It is four miles south and one west. MR. COLE: I just want to say that we have a number of circulars containing the figures given in these tables. Any of you who are interested may get copies of them by stopping at the desk. . In addition I might say that there is probably just one reason for collecting these cost records, and that is on the theory that they may be of some good to the men who keep them. As to whether they are or not, you fellows will have to be the judges. We have dem - onstrated that the two reasons for this difference in cost is; difference in yield and difference in growing cost per acre. The thing we ought to be able to do is to go back of that and find out why the difference in yield and why the difference in cost. If we can get back further, we may be able to do a lot more good. </seg>
            <seg id="p762">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN POTATO MARKETING THAT MAY AFFECT WESTERN NEBRASKA GROWERS E. P. McKUNE, Denver, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture Mr. Chairman, Gentlemen: Mr. Sheldon spoke a few minutes ago about Flea Beetle injury in the Platte Valley. Before I go on with the subject that has been assigned to me, I wish to take a few moments - to discuss the subject of Flea Beetles. Mr. Sheldon spoke about Flea Beetles and the damage they are doing. As far as Platte Valley is concerned, Flea Beetles are doing probably more damage than we realize. A few years ag0 r had occasion to estimate, t'^H f rom figures that we had on hand, the actual damage that was being done in the -*'^^^H Greeley district by Flea Beetles. Now this happened to be a year that prices were fairly high. I believe they were getting I $1.00 or $1.25 a hundred at that time. Our estimates showed that the Greeley dis- trict lost something over $50,000 that year from Flea Beetle injury alone. Of course. _ _ „ „,.„_ during years of low prices, the loss would U. s. Department of be considerably less, and years of high Agriculture prices, it would be considerably more, but the Flea Beetle is doing damage, and as far as the Platte Valley is concerned, the damage is probably nearly as great as it is in the Greeley district. Your program committee has assigned me the subject of "New Developments In Potato Marketing that may Affect Western Nebraska Growers." I assume that that subject not only covers dry land and certified potatoes but irrigated land and table stock potatoes as well. The potato industry, "like all other industries, has passed, and is now passing, through a series of changes. Any one of these changes is hardly significant in itself, but taking the changes as a whole, we find that they play a very important part in our marketing scheme, or system. I made note of a few things I have witnessed personally, and possibly some things we may anticipate, that do affect the potato industry. My experience has not been long — approximately fifteen years — in watching the marketing of these products, but during that period of fifteen years there have been several notable changes. The first Important change that I have here is "The rolling of un - sold cars." As I understand it, your certified seed organization is not </seg>
            <seg id="p763">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION affected by that practice except indirectly. You have a reputation established; you have your quality established; and your market fair - ly well lined up so that you roll very few cars unsold. In fact, I am told that many of your orders are booked far in advance of the time the cars are to be loaded. But going back over a period of years, we find that that practice crept into the industry probably fifteen years ago. There was a time when practically all cars were sold before they were loaded. Many of these sales were made by letter — rather a slow process, but a process that was effective, and I believe, a process that had its merits: But the old line shippers were more or less suc - ceeded by shippers who were of a speculative nature. To begin with, one or two reasoned that by having cars on the road toward certain markets that they felt were prospective markets, they could make quicker sales, quicker deliveries; consequently, they began loading a few cars and sending them toward these prospective markets. They were successful in that they could place these sales, or these deliveries, promptly and give a little better service. Now this worked out success - fully for the first few. Others found that they had to follow a similar method in order to meet competition. This system progressed until at the present time a very small percentage of the table stock is sold before it is loaded. Many organizations are using the system of loading cars, starting them out toward prospective markets, tramping them along, and eventually placing them. There have been a number of efforts to correct this method. The latest one occurred six or eight months ago when by united effort an attempt was made to limit few diversions. This, I believe, has had some good effect. The effect of unsold cars is this: Many shippers conceive that a certain market is a prospective market and they start cars rolling in that direction and eventually if they are not sold these cars reach that market. The receivers have become educated to this system so that they do not buy cars in transit to any great extent. They wait until these cars reach their market and then they go down and check several of these cars, pick out those that they wish and make an offer on them. It puts the shipper at a disadvantage and it gives the buyer all the ad - vantages. Now as to arguments as to whether the advantages of rolling unsold cars offset the disadvantages, we could argue this here from now until next year at this time and still the problem would not be settled to the satisfaction of all. The second noticeable development was "standardization and in - spection." This work was started during the War as an emergency program. It was found that it did have certain benefits. After the War was over steps were taken immediately to get this work establish - ed on a permanent basis. Ordinarily we think of standardization and inspection as being one and the same, but they are two distinct op - erations. However, either one is more or less dependent upon the </seg>
            <seg id="p764">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE other. Standardization is merely grading. It is placing like with like. If we go back into history, we find that standardization in some form has been practiced for thousands of years. However, it has not applied to fruits and vegetables until comparatively recently. Stand - ardization has, and doe's, materially assist in the marketing program. It enables the grower, the buyer, the receiver, and practically every - one Interested in the industry to deal on a more intelligent basis. It makes it possible for contracts to be more intelligently drawn, and at the present time it is possible to force deliveries on the basis of standardization. Inspection follows right along with standardization. Inspection means the use of inspectors. Inspectors, while many of us may consider them as pests and nuisances, do have a tendency to help the industry. Inspectors enable us to properly interpret the grades or standards that have been established. They give us official documents in the way of a certificate that makes settlement more easy for every - one connected with the industry, and settlement, as far as I know, is the chief thing we are all interested in, no matter whether a grower, a buyer, or a receiver. It is the actual cash we are after, and in - spection, I know, has materially assisted along these lines. Along about the time that people were working out standarization and inspection, we found the certification of potatoes for seed pur - poses crept into the picture. Certification, to begin with, was more or less crude, like other new ideas. But there have been changes, new developments, along that line until at the present time we think that it is worked out to a rather perfect condition. Yet the probabilities are that twenty years hence we will look back and say that in 193 3 we were using crude methods in our certification work. Just how far we can go with all certification it is difficult to say. We can't take great, big steps any one time. The steps must be short and taken at different periods or intervals. Your organization here has taken an advanced place in the certification work. It has been through the efforts of you people here and through your organization and those who are in charge of it that has forced your organization to the front. I feel, if I may divert here, that you are fortunate in having your College people take such an active interest in all of your work. I don't believe that they are anxious to install any new ideas or methods until you yourself approve of them. It has been my observation that these governing agencies, like your state organization, your govern - ment organizations, are not inclined to jump in and suggest drastic changes. Their procedure and their methods have been to a more or less extent put into practice the suggestions that you yourselves have made, and possibly work the practices and suggestions out or change them in such a way that they are more workable. Certification has proven to be of decided benefit to the potato industry. I think the figures this year of your own organization show that you received </seg>
            <seg id="p765">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION considerably more for your certified stock than you would if you ■were not able to have it certified through some agency. - "Equipment" has followed right along with the development of the potato industry. There was a time when potato equipment was crude, but the machinery manufacturers, the railroads, have seen fit to follow right along with the various developments and improve their equipment and machinery in line with the wishes of the industry. In going on from the development of equipment, I find that changes have taken place in containers. Those of you wlfo have been in the industry for some time will recall when potatoes were handled in bulk, that they were hauled in bulk from the fields, stored in bulk, and transferred from cellar to car in bulk, and went to the point of destination in bulk. This was a cheap method in some respects — yet I wonder if the actual handling charges of your bulk stock was not more than the handling of the potatoes in sacks. I don't know of any one who has ever kept any figures on this, so I haven't any thing to give you on that, but we have seen changes in that respect. When we first started to use sacks, some one conceived the idea that the bigger the sack the better, and I am wondering why they didn't use wool sacks to start with. I have seen one hundred and fifty and two hundred pound sacks used. Just why these larger sacks were used, I don't know. They were inconvenient to handle. It took at least two men to handle one sack and it was just impossible for an inspector to check entire sacks of potatoes in a car. Personally, I am in favor of the smaller package. To start with, we were using, as I said before, large containers. We have seen these containers cut down. That process, too, has been more or less gradual. The one hundred and fifty pound sack was cut to one hundred and twenty pounds, and for a long time the one hundred and twenty pound sack was used, possibly because this container held two bushels. Numerous complaints were made against this two bushel container or one hundred and twenty pound sack, so this in turn was cut down to one hundred pound sacks. I think that the one hundred pound sack is plenty large enough. Some of our neighboring states have assumed that the one hundred pound sack is too large, so they have cut containers down to fifty pounds. The fifty pound sack was cut to twenty-five, and then they went as far as to use ten pound sacks. They have gone further in regard to cartons. They have cut the carton down to five pounds. This, how - ever, is not used to any great extent. It has been found that the majority of potato cars are loaded with one hundred pound sacks. The fifty pound sack is used to some extent and the small size package to a lesser extent. There is a certain trade that does demand small packages. It is possible to go too far on the cutting down of the size of packages, but, we, as producers and shippers and others interested, have very little to say regarding our wishes. It is the consuming mar- </seg>
            <seg id="p766">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ket that makes the demands, and if we are going to sell our products ■we must meet the demands of the market, for if we do not do it, some - one else is going to, and that market will be lost. Approximately two years .ago, after an effort of ten or twelve years, an act was passed in Washington known as the P. A. C. or per - ishable agricultural commodities act. This act is the modification of an old act that was in effect during war time. Those of you who were in business during the period of- the War will recall that many of the arguments that arose were settled by a commission in Washington. Apparently that commission did its work so well that everyone wanted it re-established. So after ten or twelve years this act was estab - lished. The P. A. C. Act or Borah bill, has certain functions com - parable to the old war act. Chiefly, these duties are to settle disputes and make adjustments along rules and regulations that have long been known to the trade. Possibly the greatest factor that is now affecting the potato in - dustry and will continue to affect the potato industry in western Ne - braska is one that can be argued and discussed many hours. Some of the remarks I am about to make are of vital importance to the rail - roads as well as to the grower and shipper. The subject I am going to discuss is trucks. - ■ ' ■ . i .. - ■ I was interested this winter in checking over some of the reports from the various state legislatures. Everyone in the United States I think, with the exception of a few of the truckers, seemed to think that something must .be done about this truck situation. There have been a good many theories and suggestions advanced, but as far as I know, no one individual or organization has advanced theories or suggestions that are going to accomplish the things they want. In most of the legislatures that met this winter the organized truckers prepared a bill. To offset it the railroads presented -a trucking bill, and possibly half a dozen or more energetic senators or representa - tives presented bills. A good deal of discussion resulted from these bills and compromises were made. I think in a majority of cases the bills were cast aside as being bills that were not able to pass to the satisfaction of all concerned. Now there have been bills passed during the winter in some of the state legislatures, but as far as I know, no real advancement has been made. The truck situation has developed by leaps and bounds during the past two years. In fact, I think I can say that the truck situation has developed more rapidly since 1929 than in any period during truck history. The rapid development during the past three or four years was caused by the depression. Many of our truck owners found them - selves out of employment in their usual lines of work, and because of the necessity of making a living they had to look to other fields. It </seg>
            <seg id="p767">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION •seems that the fruit and vegetable industry lends itself best to the trucker. The trucker at the present time of low prices is able to go into the producing district and buy a load of produce easily. After he has bought it by cash or check, he is able to become more or less independent in this respect. He can go any place he wishes. He has no diversion charges, no demurrage charges. He can go wherever he thinks the market will take his commodities. I am speaking of the itinerant trucker in this respect. There are well established truckers and truck lines that make regular runs. They know the quality of the commodities they are buying and they know the price they should pay and the price they should get when the stock is de - livered. In many cases, this stock is actually sold before the trucker leaves his point of origin to secure his load. If that was the general situation we would have no concern about trucks, but it is not the general situation. The itinerant trucker, the man that is not regulated, the trucker that knows very little about the commodities that he is attempting to merchandise or where he plans to dispose of his load, is the trucker that is giving us concern and, in - cidentally, he hauls a very large percentage of the fruits and vege - tables distributed by truck. The new trucker, the itinerant trucker, will drive to a district that he has heard of that produces apples, potatoes, etc. He doesn't know the price that he should pay and he knows very little about the quality or the grade he intends to buy. He wants to get a load of potatoes, apples or peaches — and he does get a load. He may get them at a reasonable price or he may pay an exhorbitant price, but he gets this load. Then he starts out to what he considers a likely district, a district that will consume his load. He has possibly heard of this district through some other trucker or through some friend who has written him, but possibly before he gets to his destination that information has gone out to a good many other truckers and by the time he reaches that point, the market is simply flooded and there is no sale. Then he starts out to dispose of his load. If he can't sell it at retail or peddle it from house to house, he goes on to the next town, or the next, or the next, until his load is practically worn out. He finally disposes of his load at a price, but it hardly pays him for the time and transportation costs. If that were all, it would not be serious, but by selling his load at a com - paratively low price, he has established a market price for that com - modity. ' This does not affect the truckers alone. It affects the carload dealer as well. Carload dealers, whom we consider the backbone of the industry, are finding it more and more difficult to dispose of their carload lots. Every village is visited by trucks hauling the commodity that he is intending to sell in carload lots and, with the exception of your seed potatoes here, your certified stock, carload dealers in pota- </seg>
            <seg id="p768">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE toes have found it extremely difficult to place cars. Even the large markets are affected. Chicago, Omaha, Kansas City are simply over - run with trucks. The truck will go any distance. We used to think that the truck was limited to a certain small radius. We spoke about a truck radius; that the carload dealer could place his wares beyond the truck radius. But that is all changed. I do not believe the truck has a radius any more. It goes anywhere. The San Luis Valley of Colorado potatoes are right now being trucked to Brownsville, Texas. Arkansas Valley of Colorado onions are being trucked into Chicago. Colorado peaches are trucked to Kansas City, to Houston any distance. The truck situation is something that concerns us all. I would not be surprised to see certified seed potatoes being trucked out of here within the next few years, if they haven't been already. The truck is here to stay; there is no question about that. If times return to normal again, many of these trupks will go back to the work they were previously engaged in, but some of them have found that this produce game does pay and they are going to stay in it and continue as stores on wheels. Now as to the volume of fruits and vegetables they are moving out on trucks. I hardly believe you notice the truck movement as much in this section as they do in some of the other sections, for example, the Platte Valley, or some of the Colorado fruit and vege - table districts. But the quantity that they haul is tremendous. Two years ago the Colorado legislature passed an act making it compulsory to inspect truck load lots of anything over one thousand pounds or more. We immediately attempted to set up a machine to inspect these trucks. We found that our inspection stations had to be portable. In fact, we had to move faster than many of the trucks, but we did in - spect trucks. We didn't get them all, by any means, but we did in - spect many. During the year ending November 30, 1932, our records show that we inspected twenty-one thousand trucks during the twelve months. If these twenty-one thousand trucks were placed end to end, they would make a string of over one hundred miles in length The quantity that they haul is approximately twenty per cent of the total. In other words, the trucks are hauling twenty per cent the railroads eighty per cent. Now as to what is to be done about the trucker, I don't know I have attempted to study the truck situation several years but if any body were to ask me to suggest a s'ingle remedy or a single control that would be effective, I would not be able to answer them. Colorado in adopting its truck inspection did not control the trucker. He can haul Just as many truck loads as he wishes. He can haul any grade he wishes, and he can go to any point. </seg>
            <seg id="p769">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION Shipping by truck does have advantages. Possibly the greatest advantage of the trucker is this: That he does assist in placing products into markets that could not otherwise handle a carload lot. In that way he helps the marketing machine to dispose of some prod - ucts that wouldn't otherwise be disposed of. But this, I believe, is offset by the fact that he isn't particular enough in the quality of stock that he handles and that he isn't well enough acquainted with his marketing needs and with the quality of stock that he is handling to merchandise his stock to an advantage. It is true that oftentimes he will go out and pay the grower more for his produce than the car - load man can afford to pay, and on the surface it would appear that the. grower is being benefited by getting this other nickel or dime a hundred more than the carload man can afford to pay. But I am just wondering if this trucker were not in existence or not peddling his wares indiscriminately, if the carload man would not be able to pay more. The carload man is controlled by the price that his markets can afford to pay. I think, as I pointed out previously, the trucker does have in many cases — I am not saying all cases — a tendency to beat down the selling price. I know that my time is up, but I do want to say this in closing, that the inspection work which has been going on has been working out very satisfactorily. We have had the fullest cooperation from you growers and with the officials of your organization, and I think, with possibly one or two exceptions, that our work has been more effective here through your cooperation and your help than any other place in the district in which I work. I do thank you people and your organiza - tion for your cooperation.

            <seg id="p771">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION ANNUAL MEETING OP THE DIRECTORS OF THE NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION The meeting was held in conjunction with dinner on Thursday, March 16, at Alliance. A number of items were discussed and agreed upon informally. It was decided to continue with the annual meeting of the Association in March just prior to the meeting ol the Certi - fied Potato Growers Cooperative. It was also agreed that the two bushel commercial pack certified seed class should be emphasized more in connection with the show and that the prizes should be In - creased, in this class. On motion of Young, seconded by Stenberg, the Directors voted to make an emergency reduction fee to 60c per member for the year 1933. On motion of Stenberg, seconded by Ehrman, the Directors voted to request the Nebraska Certified Potato Growers Non-stock Corpora - tive to take out a membership in the Association for each of their mem - bers in view of the fact that this Association does much educational work which is of direct benefit to the members of the Cooperative. On motion of Young, seconded by Tollman, the Secretary was author - ized to set aside $300 from the State Fund to be used for travel ex - penses in connection with local educational potato meetings to be held in communities desiring same in northwestern Nebraska, — The Messrs Morrow, Koehnke, and McLean agreeing to assume responsibility for speaking at these meetings. H. O. Werner, Secretary, reported a balance of $119 collected as rental in excess of cost of the automobile purchased in 1929 for use by the Dept. of Horticulture in connection with its research work in western Nebraska with potatoes. On motion of Stenberg, seconded by Young, the Secretary was authorized to trade in this car and secure another car of similar type for this use, the understanding being that the Dept. of Horticulture will be responsible for the maintenance of the car and that out of the rental paid the insurance and other ex - penses will be paid and that by annual payments the Association will be reimbursed for the capital cost. All motions as reported were unanimously adopted. Mr. Nibler, County Extension Agent in Kimball county submitted the suggestions of those interested in 4HClub work. The Secretary was instructed to give consideration to these suggestions and to adopt them in so far as practical in connection with the next annual show. </seg>

M. at the Capitol Hotel in the dining room immediately after the banquet at Lincoln, Nebraska, President Erie Smiley presiding. PRESIDENT SMILEY: The meeting will please come to order and Secretary Knudson will call the roll. Secretary Knudson started the roll call, but Mr. Norberg moved that it be suspended and the motion was seconded and carried. The Minutes of the previous meeting were read by Secretary Knudson. It was moved by Mr. Skinner and seconded that the Minutes of the last meeting be accepted as read. The motion was unanimously carried. The President called for the Treasurer's Report. TREASURER BURNHAM presented his report as follows: SHOW FUND Balance of report at 1932 meeting $240.13 Received from Secretary $294.00 3.00 8.50 50.00 355.50 $595.63 DISBURSEMENTS January 7, 1932 Superintendent's salary $ 35,00 January 21, 1932 Secretary of State 4.00 September 5, 1932 Secretary's salary 350.00 September 5, 1932 Advanced to Secretary to start this year's show fund .:... 50.00 $439.00 Balance in show fund ....• $156.63 COOP FUND f As there were no disbursements in 1932, the bal - ance is the same as last year $ 48.37 </seg>

PRESIDENT SMILEY: Is there anything to be brought up in regard to unfinished business? If not, is there anything in regard to new business, or miscellaneous business? MR. CLAYBAUGH: The situation is just this, moat of you folks know that we have a perfectly equipped plant at North Platte, Ne - braska. We have been trying to figure out just how we can use this plant to the best advantage. We wonder if we could run some kind of an Egg Laying Contest. We would ask that the breeders who enter this contest put out the eggs and that one hundred eggs be turned over. These eggs would be hatched and wing branded and sent out to the station for brooding, giving the owners the privilege of buying them back. We hope to raise enough pullets to enter the con - test. Our object is, of course, to help encourage the breeding of better males, especially for the hatchery breeding folks. We feel that it will, also, help the standard for the size of eggs. If you folks are interested, I would like to have your names so that I can send you applications. PRESIDENT SMILEY: I am sure that the breeders of the state will assist you all they can. We will proceed to the election of offi - cers. We are to elect President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer and two (2) Board of Directors. PRESIDENT SMILEY: How do you wish to nominate your candi - dates? It was moved and seconded that the nomination be by ballot. The motion carried. PRESIDENT SMILEY: I hereby appoint Mr. Roscoe Hill and Professor Mussehl as Tellers. You will now prepare your ballots for the nomination of a candidate for President. Secretary Knudson suggested that it was necessary that each one receiving a ballot belong to the associa'tion. PRESIDENT SMILEY: I hereby announce that we will not enter - tain proxies. The motion was seconded and carried. PRESIDENT SMILEY: All those in the room that are not mem - bers please stand so that the Tellers will know who to present with ballots. SECRETARY KNUDSON: We are now to nominate a candidate for President and you are to either re-elect President Smiley or nom - inate a new bunch against him. </seg>

PRESIDENT SMILEY: The secretary will now read the results. Results of the informal ballot for a candidate for President: Mr. Smiley 28 Mr. Cook 14 Mr. Norberg 1 SECRETARY KNUDSON: I move that Mr. Smiley has already been nominated in as much as he has the greatest percentage of ballots and that we declare him as nominated. The motion was seconded and carried. REV. ROWAN: I object to that on the grounds that we have already moved that nomination be cast by ballot. SECRETARY KNUDSON: Since that motion was made, I made the motion that we declare him President because he has really been elected in as much as he has ! the greatest majority of votes.

WHITTMAN: When I was taken into this organization and paid my money, I was allowed ten votes, one for each share. President Smiley gave Mr. Whittman the ARTICLE 5 to read. MR. WHITTMAN read as follows: 'Each share of stock shall entitle the owner thereof at the meetings of the stockholders to one vote, but not more than ten </seg>
            <seg id="p779">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION shares of stock to be owned by any one person.' REV. ROWAN: I suggest that the shares of stock be left out of this election, as It is not fair for the man -who has the most money and can buy the most shares to have the most power. WHITTMAN: There are four other members that own more than one share of stock beside myself and if the association objects to our having our ten required votes, I will ask for a refund on my money. As long as you have my money 1 I expect to have one vote for each share.
