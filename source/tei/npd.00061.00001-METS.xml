PRESIDENT JACKSON: I am sure it is a pleasure to have the Governor of Nebraska with us today, even for a few moments snatched from his busy time. We appreciate his coming to speak to us and I take pleasure now in introducing Governor Adam McMullen. GOVERNOR ADAM McMULLEN Members of the Agricultural Association: It is a pleasure to be present with you this afternoon, if only for a short time. It is always a privilege to join with the men of this state who are interested in our great industry, the industry whose basis is the soil. Agriculture is not only a necessary industry but it is one that is most commendable, most laudable, because it provides those things which give sustenance to the people, and when the people of a state or nation are properly sustained in a physical way they are apt to be better and stronger mentally and physically, and likely to be in better condition to do those things that add to the progress of civilization, and so agriculture is not only our basic industry but it is the basic industry of all things throughout the world. The special work that you are doing, interesting yourselves in those societies that increase the products of the soil, is always a most com - mendable work; there are so many things needed to add to the upbuild - ing of the farming interests, and one of them if not chiefest of them is to build up the quality of our products, and these county fairs and our Great State Fair, that we all hope will become greater and greater as </seg>
            <seg id="p015">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURK 15 the years go by, are organizations for instruction, organizations where these people who are interested in the products of the soil are able 'to learn how to improve the things that we are trying to produce and the country is something to be reckoned with when we are striving to attain what we are all hoping to attain for these agricultural products — better prices. There are so many things involved in this industry, and it is so hard in the functioning of its processes, on account of the number of people engaged in it; but we have made progress during the past fifty or seventy-five years and there is no questions but that by applying our - selves as we have, our progress in the future will be marked and it will show as much of an improvement between now and fifty years hence as it has between now and fifty years ago. And so, my friends, while these matters are coming up and we take an intelligent view of the situation, we make real progress. The farmer must depend to the extent of ninety per cent, on what he can do himself; ten per cent may be accomplished for him through man-made systems or man-made laws; legislation will help in building up the measure for what we all strive for, co-operation; but legislation cannot do the co-operative work, that must be the man himself; and so we must not mislead ourselves in this great industry by depending upon others to do something that only we ourselves can do. I want to assure you that not only as a citizen, but as an official for the time being, it is my endeavor to do what ever I can do within reason to assist in the advancement of this great industry, and if there were nothing else that in my own mind would be a matter of credit to me, if I could do some little thing during my two years that would make me feel that I had contributed even a small mite to our great industry of agriculture I would feel that all other labors connected with this office were as naught and that I had rendered at least a very small frac - tion of the service that every man would like to have the opportunity during his lifetime to render. And so I hope your meeting will be as profitable as I know it will be successful; I hope the county fairs of this year will be improvements in many small ways over the last and that they will continue to improve until they become institutions that we will be proud to support and to lend our endeavors to sustain. I thank you. SECRETARY DANIELSON: I arise at this time to ask a personal privilege.

            <seg id="p017">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURB 17 PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS Our By-Laws provide that our President shall, at the annual meet - ing held in January, each year, render in writing a detailed statement of his official acts during his term just completed. It seems to me this is superfluous, a duplication of the Secretary's report, and of no value to the Association. With your permission I wish to disgress somewhat from the usual custom and take up the early history of Fairs, what they have done in the development of our great State of Nebraska in the past; our responsibility to the agricultural interests; and the development of men and women in the future. The first Agricultural Fair held in the United States, that we have record of, was held in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1784. Its only purpose was to better the methods of cultivation. Another Fair of early date was held under the auspices of the Massachusetts Agricul - tural Society at Cambridge in 1804; no premiums were awarded, the Fair being characterized chiefly by selling and bartering farm pro - ducts and stock. From these pioneer Fairs there has developed such an interest in bringing together for competitive display of products of agriculture in all its branches, that now three thousand five hundred Fairs are held an - nually in this country and Canada. Fairs have multiplied very rapidly in the past ten years, and we find a great increase in the number of fairs as well as the quality of the various contests. In the fall of 1858 Nebraska held its first territorial fair at Ne - braska City. Long rows of automobiles were not to be seen, aero - planes were not heard flying overhead, nor was there a wireless station. But you could see the faces of Robert W. Furnas, J. Sterling Morton, and many others whose names are common household words in Ne - braska, and who were pioneers of advanced ideas for better agriculture. These very men deserve more credit for building up agriculture in Nebraska and the fairs of our state than does the leading agriculturist of today. Their responsibilities were not so great possibly, but their hardships were greater. I can imagine I see the patrons of that first fair coming for miles afoot, horseback, in wagons and no doubt many made the trip with ox teams taking several days to make the journey. Little did those pioneers think that they were initiating an organization of fairs second to none in any state, and they wore charter members of an organization that in three score years and ten would build up an institution for the State of Nebraska valued at over one million and a half dollars, and that a quarter of a million people would pass through its gates annually, seeking information and pleasure. Many years passed, however, before any great advancement was </seg>
            <seg id="p018">18 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE made in the organization of county fairs in Nebraska. After 1870 counties began to organize and in 1887, thirty-three county societies made their report to the State Board of Agriculture. But during the nineties, continued crop failures forced many out of existence and their grounds and buildings were sold. However, after the county aid law was passed in 1903, many organizations were formed, but the law passed in 1921 was a great stimulus for the fairs of Nebraska, and from that time on they have made a steady growth, not only in num - ber, but in the development of agriculture in the progress of the state. Today we have seventy-nine fairs in Nebraska with a total average attendance of approximately one half million people. The educational value of the annual fair is well understood, and rt county fair organizations realize their responsibility and are build - up and cleaning up. tThe majority of fairs in the state, and other states as well, have several years over-reached their resources to meet the demands their patrons. One of the most perplexing problems that con - fronts every fair management is how to meet the demand on a fifty cent gate admission. So it is very important that rigid economy be practiced. Usually when we speak of economy the first thought is to save money, but in many instances it is economy to spend money. What we must see to in the great problem that confronts this organ - ization is that we get one dollar value for each dollar spent, or in other words, that the patrons of the fair take out at the gate more than they pay in at the gate, so they may go home filled with that er.chusiasm that lasts. In fact, the 183 acres of land owned by the State and used for Fair Grounds, should be filled with an atmosphere Eis uplifting and inspiring, so that it makes no difference where turn you will be filled with enthusiasm for a bigger and better raska, and a more prosperous people. The 1924 Nebraska State Fair was one of the most successful Fairs ever held in this state. No doubt our attendance was larger than any other Fair, based upon the population within a radius of one hundred miles from where the Fair was held. We cannot say, how - ever, that it was a great financial success. But the permanent success of Fairs should not be judged by the gate receipts or bank accounts altogether. Not what was taken in at the gates but what was taken out at the gates. The highest compliments come to us from many sources on the cleanliness of the amusements and the balanced program, no. criticism from anywhere. As far as complaints were concerned we had no use for an executive office. We attribute the success along these lines to years back when it was almost a crime to endorse clean amusements, and it was several years before carnival companies began to realize that the State Board of Agriculture of Nebraska would not tolerate their class of amusements any longer, and we had to say to </seg>
            <seg id="p019">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 19 them in language that could be interpreted by any one, if you expect to play Nebraska you must come clean under a contract that we will dictate, and in that contract you will find that no games of any descrip - tion will be permitted on the Nebraska Fair Grounds. We had to demonstrate that a contract made with the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture was law, and must be recognized as such. The taxpayers of Nebraska are willing to spend vast sums of money in conducting our public schools, and operating our public in - stitutions of higher learning where the more technical knowledge may be obtained, in fact over sixty per cent of our total tax goes for schools. We are willing to make the expenditure in order that our children may become good citizens, and be successful in the business and social life. But there are too many of our so-called educated people who fail in life because they have not been taught the lessons of marketing; they fail when it comes to disposing of the finished products they have pro - duced, but are unable to sell. The highest scale of education (some - one has said) is to make yourself useful and be able to apply what you know. The Fair steps in where the school leaves off, it teaches by object lessons, it stimulates the energy and intellect, and broadens the vision. There is something about a well regulated Fair that makes people stop and think; thinking people do things and are a greater success. It is carried home to a greater extent and can be used in everyday life more than any other educational advantage. We are al - ways pleased to see our agricultural hall filled with farm products, end we boast of our great improvement in stock, and justly so. But the real problem of today is not the production of agriculture, nor the development of fine stock, but the production of men and women. The citizenship of tomorrow can be determined by the standard of our young people of today. The environment surrounding our young people has a great deal to do with their future. We must realize the importance of building men and women. So in the development of the Nebraska State Fair, I trust we may never overlook the 508,000 Boys and Girls in Nebraska. We have no right to invite parents to allow their children to join the Club work, exhibit and demonstrate at the State Fair, and then All the grounds with gambling devices of all kinds; we have no legal right and God knows we have no moral right. We have no right to foster an organization that has for its purpose the tearing down of our young people; it must be an educational institution; if it is not, its continuance cannot be justified on any Fair Ground, for it is not a proper function of state or county government to conduct an enterprise which has for its primary purpose that of lowering the standard ef citizenship. What has the Nebraska State Fair done for Nebraska? What can it do in six days in the year? I sometimes wonder if there are </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE not too many who look at it from this viewpoint. It is true the Fair lasts but six days, but I want to endeavor to prove to you that its influence and enthusiasm lasts three hundred and sixty-five days in the year; and it makes no difference what your vocation in life may be it can be put to use every hour of the day. It is a market place for enthusiasm, inspiration, co-operation, and stimulates a desire to win. Every man who visits, studies, and makes it an educational outing, will get the Fair spirit and will soon become a leader in his home com - munity for he knows more and is better prepared to apply his book knowledge. Ninety per cent of all stock breeders got their inspiration from some Fair, and these men deserve more credit than they are getting. The ultimate of the hog is the pork barrel, and the fellow who can breed and develop a hog that will fill that barrel the quickest and on the least amount of feed, is worth while in any community. In the past thirty years they have increased the earning value of the hog over one hundred percent. By judicious breeding, care and balanced ration, they have im - proved the milk cows to even a greater extent than they have the hog. All over Nebraska you will find big broad back steers raised by some - one who knows how, not only to get the pounds of beef from the grain consumed, but how to get the high priced beef. All high class meat on any animal is high up on the animal, and the wider the backs the more high priced meat they carry. They have not only improved this beef factory to such an extent that they can get almost double the pounds from the grain consumed but they may expect double the pounds of high priced beef, both quantity and quality. You will find without a question of doubt that the men interested in agriculture in its broadest sense and in all its activities, got their inspiration from some Fair. We boast of our wonderful inventions, and justly so. In the days of our forefathers the entire family worked on the farm; they raised practically everything they needed and very little more. The measure of the farmers success was his ability to raise his own food and clothing, the few farm tools were so crude and the farming so poorly done that the family raised little more than it consumed. But now with the latest improved machinery one man can raise enough to feed a regi - ment. Many of these inventions were conceived on the Nebraska State Fair Grounds. It is not generally understood, but the big factories in farm machinery have their experts and mechanics at the different State Fairs, getting ideas and watching the demonstrations of others. I per - sonally know that the Dain Combine Hay Stacker was manufactured through a hearing that was held on the Nebraska State Fair Grounds in 1910 with the mechanic from the Dain factory. I personally know that a dealer in farm implements sold a car load of binders one season </seg>
            <seg id="p021">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 21 from the influence of one farmer who watched the demonstration on the Nebraska Fair Grounds. We are not only furnishing the incentive to raire, develop, improve and invent, but we are also furnishing the mar - ket for the finished products. It is conceded by all that the State Fairs of our country are the greatest advertising medium we have. Many sales are made on the Fair Grounds annually of cattle, hogs, sheep and poultry, the best seed in the land going to every state in the union. If time would permit I might go on and on and recite to you many in - stances where the State Fair of Nebraska with its six day duration has linked the home and the school, and has provided the lasting informa - tion that is so very essential to a successful life. The problem of maintaining the State Fair buildings is one of great concern to the Board of Managers. The appraised value of the build - ings and other improvements, as shown by the inventory, is approxi - mately one million dollars. Taken as a basis that is used by other Fairs and institutions of like character, it would require at least three percent annually for maintenance. Due to the fact that a number of the permanent buildings are just reaching a point where the roofs must be replaced or repaired, it will require a much larger expenditure during the next few years to properly preserve and maintain the property than it has in the past. The grandstand and many of the buildings need painting as well as repairing, and many other minor improvements must be made. The future of the State Board of Agriculture and the State Fair cannot be answered. It depends upon the co-operation we receive from the State. It is going to be impossible to keep abreast of the times and meet the demands of its patrons upon the average gate receipts from the population we have tributary to Lincoln.. The State of Nebraska is just a little over a half century old; during that time it has developed to such an extent that we wonder where Nebraska will be in another half century. We feel safe in making this prophesy, that Nebraska will develop much faster in the next half century than she has in the past. But it makes no difference how Nebraska may rank in Agriculture, Me - chanics or Education, it seems to me that I can see the State Board of Agriculture up on the horizon beckoning to all the different activities of the State to COME ON — we are waiting to foster and promote any and every thing that will place Nebraska in the realm of greater pro - gress, and its people on a higher plane of Citizenship. In order that the Nebraska State Fair may continue to be appreciated by its patrons and function and carry out its real purpose, it must never become a political football, nor be governed by men whose integrity is questioned, or who are in the work for financial gain. We are the one outstanding Board of the State that knows no party politics nor do w« have any political bosses, we are looked to f«r service, for we are a power for good. Just as long as we hold the confidence of the people we may expect a close co-operation between the Fair and the people it serves. </seg>
            <seg id="p022">22 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Then the Nebraska State Fair will continue to do real service for a better and a bigger Nebraska for all the people, where agriculture is supreme, and citizenship is valued. Then it matters not where you may - be, you will take great pride in saying, I AM FROM NEBRASKA. SECRETARY'S REPORT In a way, Nebraska came nearer reaching a normal condition in 1924 than has been our lot for the past four years. This condition was brought about by the maturing of a favorable small grain crop, with prices somewhat in keeping with the general price, which farmers have right to expect for their labors and investments. The corn crop was very disappointing at harvest time, instead of a bumper crop as was predicted earlier in the season, we now find that a large percent of this crop is soft and much of it is short of the average feeding value. This condition was brought about by a late growing season, a very wet September, followed by an early frost. 1924 was far from a normal year, as far as weather conditions were concerned. Many paits of the state were visited by excessive rain - fall, washing the crops badly, many other parts were visited by destruc - tive hail and wind storms, along with intermediate dry spells. Such a condition was found to exist to a large extent over the mid - west states and therefore instead of our production of grains being nor - mal or above we find our production much below the general average. This is the big factor in the present market price of our soil crops. Usually large crops brings the farmer fewer total dollars than a small crop, and often large crops sell for less than it costs the farmer, on an average, to produce them. His is the lot of working on faith, personally carrying all the risk of weather, heat and cold, flood .'and drouth, de - structive storms, insect pests and plant and animal diseases. The one deplorable situation existing at the present time, is the fact that the energy and intelligence with which the farmer works, the num - ber of hours he spends, the cost incurred in producing his crops to feed the world, are not taken into consideration when the price is set upon his wares. Up to and including the year 1920, the price the farmer received for his products was more in keeping with the general price index of all other commodities, but with the closing of the World War and the finan - cial condition of the European countries, a great change took place. With a protective programme established by our government, in - cluding the tariff, the Edge and Webb-Pomerene bills, the Esch-Cummins </seg>
            <seg id="p023">RKPORT OF NEBRASKA STATK BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 23 bill, the Immigration bill and many others- of similar nature, they have protected all lines of labor and industry. The crops of which we produce a surplus for export have been sell - ing during the reactionary period, at less than cost of production, to the profound distress of our farm population. This results from an economic system which we feel can, and should be cured by our government. When there is a surplus of any product, it is elementary economic law, that the price of the surplus fixes the price of the whole product. We have to sell our surplus crop abroad, where they come into compe - tition with the crops of other countries, operating on standards of cost, price and living, very much lower than ours. Our surplus — and hence our whole crop — is, therefore, sold at an European price level well be - low our own. THESE CROPS ARE THE ONLY AMERICAN PRODUCTS WHOSE DOMESTIC PRICE IS FIXED BY WORLD CONDITIONS AT A LEVEL FAR BELOW THAT OF THE HOME MARKET. On the products of industry, the protective tariff keeps out cheap foreign competition and maintains an American plane of prices much above the world level. These are the prices that make the farmer's cost, they are the prices he must pay for all that he buys and a large portion of the population being dependent upon agriculture, he buys everything. Herein lies an injustice. Our tariff makes the farmer buy in a pro - jected market and p.-iy a high American price for all that he buys. The surplus makes him sell HIS WHOLE CROP, those products of which we export a surplus whether for domestic or foreign consumption, in a free trade market, at a world price much lower than the general plane of protected American price? for what he buys. Before the War this burden was not too heavy, because the world level was more nearly an American level. As a result of the War the markets of the world were demoralized and depressed by debt, taxes, and inflated currencies, until the spread between the American and the world price planes became so great as to make it no longer possible for our farmers to stand the burden of selling on the basis of an Ar - gentine peasant and buying on the basis of an American citizen. No class of our people should be asked to endure such an inequity. We cannot help it by giving the farmer a higher tariff on export farm products because, since we export more than we import, a tariff on export crops would not cure the ill, even if we raised it to a point of complete exclusion. The farmers export crops ought to have a buy - ing power equal to that which they had before the war, that is, wheat for instance, ought to bear at least the same ratio to the average general price index of all commodities as it bore before the war. </seg>
            <seg id="p024">24 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tHere is where the remedy must be created. Here is where our rnment should show their good faith to one third or better, of our ilation, who are engaged in an industry that up to the present time, not been given the consideration of our protective programme. A bill along these lines was before Congress last sprinsr, but failed passage. At that time, such a bill would have been of wonderful assist - ance to our agriculture interests. Many are now saying that there is no need for such a measure, due to the fact that the general market prices have taken care of the situation. We will grant that for the present time, but let us look to the future and figure where we will be should the year 1925 be one of over production along agricultural lines. tThe situation will then revert to just where we were this past two rs or more. kin order to guard against a repetition of what we have passed ugh, let us turn our efforts towards protecting the future of our cultural industry. The creation of a Farmers' Export Corporation with power to divert a surplus above domestic needs, to the world market, so that co-opera - tive marketing associations, assisted by the buying activities of the Farmers' Export Corporation, may be able to make the protective tariff effective in equalizing differences in cost of production of major farm commodities in the United States and in competing foreign countries, would, to the minds of many, cure the evil now existing. There must be adequate working capital. k There must be power to collect from each unit of each commodity died in this manner, as it moves in trade, an amount sufficient to rent impairment of working capital. The protective tariff should remain, t These powers should be granted in as simple a measure as possible, that it would not become intricate or cumbersome in its operation. The above suggested remedy was embodied in the McNary-Haugen Bill, but there were so many others, that it is no doubt possible to draft a measure along simpler lines, that omits features to which serious ob - jections were raised in the McNary-Haugen bill, and still maintain power ample for an effective farmers' export corporation. The life of such an organization should be extended to a time long enough to give something of this nature a thorough trial. A loan of such funds as may be needed to be advanced from some source — perhaps the War Finance Corporation — returnable to the corporation out of the equalization fees. </seg>
            <seg id="p025">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 25 While many will object to the subsidizing of any industry by our government, still, when you stop to analize the situation and come to the realization that our basic industry in this country has been seriously handicapped for the past four years, and by handicapping the purchasing power of the farmer you have stagnated all lines of business, is it not time to lay aside all precedents and step out with a programme that will put us, as a nation, back on a normal business future, assuring the farm - er that he will receive for that part of his home consumption produc - tion, a price equal to the price of other commodities now on an Ameri - can level? Naturally the farmer will have to take the world market price for his surplus, but with an American price for the home consumption and a world price for the surplus, will put the farmer in a better financial condition than he has been since 1920 and at the same time, will equalize us as a Nation. Many will say that the government ought not to interfere in busi - ness, especially not in favor of any class. In answer to that, permit me to say that the government has already interfered in favor of every other class when it passed the tariff. By that act it insured an Ameri - can price higher than the world price to every class in America except the producers of export crops. A condition now arises, due to world de - pressions and the consequent multiplied spread between American and other prices, when the burden thus pressed upon the farmer, of paying a high protected price for what he sells, becomes too heavy to bear without bankruptcy, because it forces him to sell at a loss. We must remove this burden and erase the inequity. We are not desirous of favoring the farmer, but the intention is to bring him to an equality of favor with the remainder of our population. I say not favor, but abolish disfavor, and put the farmer on an equal plane with industry. The tariff wall had two great breaches. It did not stop the inflow of labor and therefore did not protect labor, we have cured that by im - migration restriction. It did not protect the farmer on export crops. We must now cure that, with a home consumption price level measure, and ways and means of caring for the exportable surplus. By such action upon the part of our government, we could not see where it would be interfering in business, it would simply permit a cor - poration to combine farm products for export sale just as the Edge and Webb-Pomerene bills now permit industry so to combine. Many opponents of such relief for our agricultural industry say that economic ills cannot be cured by legislative remedy. Legislative enact - ments effecting commerce are nearly all economic phenomena. If it was an economic ill that America, before protection, was simply a reservoir </seg>
            <seg id="p026">26 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE of raw material, the doctrine of protection, expressed as a legislative remedy cured that ill. If it was an economic ill that hordes of aliens, incapable of absorption, threatened our labor market after the war, legis - lative enactment cured that ill. If it was an economic ill that the states under the Articles of Confederation could not exist as a Federal unit the Commerce Clause of the rConstitution and the myriad statutes enacted under it, stand as refutation of the objection. Those who are striving to find a way of equality for all our indus - tries and activities are not seeking to invade the economic field, the only thought in mind is a proposed restoration of a nice balance between ag - riculture and industry which has been shattered by many prior invasions — rthe tariff, the Adamson law, the Esch-Cummings act, the restriction of immigration and many others of like nature. Pre-war exchange value means only cost plus a very small profit tno profit at all. Prices the past four years have meant a loss to the mer on the average of every pound and bushel sold. Argument for maintenance of the present condition is simply argument for taking the farmer's crop without paying for it, justifiable we say in this case, by a' desire to keep the cost of living down. Following this programme through to its fnal conclusion,, you will find that such a relief measure will not raise the general price index to exceed 2.5 points, while on the other hand the benefit to be derived from a greater purchasing power by the farmer and a more stable basis for our industries, will more than offset a small increase in the general price index of our commodities. This is the one breach in our protective wall fhat must be closed, not in favor of agriculture, but in favor of the whole nation, and in com - mon justice to the fanner. But even if there were other classes equally prejudiced — which there are not— is a precedent of simple justice something to be avoided? Not long ago industry asked the right to combine for export trade, t was granted instantly. It has long been the custom for industries to sell in export at less than the domestic price. Agriculture seeks no greater or different privilege, the precedents are all behind us. There is no other class in like case with agriculture. Is it not possible now to close the last gap in our protective outworks? The cause that should be reached is the surplus, the distressed world and an unfinished protective programme. It cannot be reached here less than the segregation of the surplus from the domestic market. Our trouble is the surplus product and it applies not to wheat alone, or corn alone, or any other product in particular but to any and all. There are vast areas available only for wheat farming, and it is a Barmecide feast to proffer the farmers of these areas "Diversified Farming." </seg>
            <seg id="p027">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 27 Diversified Farming means, "Raise more cattle, corn, swine, eggs, poultry, and butter fat." The consumptive capacity of the country for these things is not cosmic. It is being supplied now. Some astute ob - servers believe that a crisis is not far off in each of these products. If the 20 percent of the wheat acreage could and would turn to these pro - ducts, what would happen? We would have precisely the same situa - tion with the other products that we now have with anyone of them. To the extent that the market demands a product at a profitable price, natural laws will supply that product. The moment we produce in excess of the normal demand for that product, we destroy the profit thereof. There is no profit in any of the commodities suggested for in - creased production by the advocates of diversification which indicate that the total supply on the domestic market should be much increased. It could not be increased without destroying profit. Therefore, conver - sion from one to another of these crops will result merely in a shifting of the field of loss and distress. Should we set up agencies through which to loan the farmer more money? No, all the projects to finance the stricken agricultural districts cannot cure the farmers' ill. He owes too much now. What will it ad - vantage the fai-mer to change his creditor and extend his time when he sees no profit out of which to pay and no future save a deeper debt. What the farmer must have, and is entitled too, is an equalized price for his product, not a change in the person of his creditor. Repeatedly it has been said, "Let the farmer get back to the sturdy self-denying existence of his grandfather. Let him give up his movies, automobiles, radios, phonographs, electric lights, and other fancy contrivances. He can live." Yes, he can live and perhaps we find one here and there who will say that this is good logic, but it comes from those who are against allowing the farmer as square a deal as he is demanding for himself. The world moves on and the farmer has not nearly so many of the conveniences of modern living as the common laborer, the clerk, or city dweller in any walk of life. He has some, and of course he has more than his grandfather. But, we shall have no more luck in creating a peasant class on our farms than we had in creating a submerged class in our labor. The benefits of the industrial age in America are very great and we have preserved them by tariff, restriction of immigration and other legislative enactments. Restoration of fair exchange value to the fanner will not do one iota of harm to any other class in the country. It will do great good to all. It will restore to the market a great block of buyers who have long been out of it, purchasers of all these things which go to make life convenient and progressively easier. This will give increased employment and profit to every class and im - prove the general prosperity. </seg>
            <seg id="p028">28 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE k Frugality in the farmer is necessary and desirable. Denial to the ler of a modest share of the conveniences of our constantly improv - national life is not only unnecessary and undesirable, it is impossible. Many are the advocates of, "Let the present situation alone, it will cure itself." Will it not take some five years of continued depression to beat down the sturdy resistance and the grim struggle of owners and tenants of our wheat and corn lands to preserve their homes and the remnants of their fortunes? In five years perhaps, only 80 percent of the fittest will have sur - vived and the surplus will have starved out. The "fittest" does not refer to the most efficient workers. It refers to the most efficient areas, lose nearest markets. The wrecked homesteads, deserted villages, the rained fortunes and the scattered families proposed by the opponents of programme of this kind would not result at once. Several years at east, would be required. Most of us recognize that this breed does not quit in the face of adversity, this has been exemplified, they stick. Such people as these are what have built up our Nation, and built it on the firm foundation upon which it stands today. It is not a council of sanity to build up, destroy, build up, in alter - nating periods of half decades. What we are after is a programme to preserve agriculture, to give it an equal standing with all other industries and activities, in short, place it where it rightly belongs. We realize, from the present status of the farmer of the nation, lat it is impossible to organize all of the sceptical, refractory, and ob - tuse, among six millions of farmers into one great wheat, corn, cotton, wine, or cattle co-operative, while on the other hand this is the only way that results can be obtained for their relief, or they can permit thers to do their relief work for them. It seems as though in this day and age, everything is organized but the farmer, and because he is not rganized as are others, he is still at the mercy of the exportable sur - &gt;lus of his crop and paying an American price for all that he buys. No oubt the time is well within sight, when we shall consume our entire arm surplus at home. At the present rate of increase of population, ecreased fertility, soil erosions, and considering the fact that we are already near the limit of practicable production acreage, that time is terhaps not more than fifteen years in the future. But what are we to o while we are reaching the point where we will be able, as a Nation, o consume the surplus products from our farms. Are we to let the ondition of the past few years run along as it has been, or are we going o take a stand and ask for what we rightfully believe our agricultural industry is entitled too? It is up to the men engaged in our basic industry to bestir them- </seg>

Bear in mind this, Agriculture is not asking anything peculiar to itself, it is simply asking for the same kind of treatment that has been accorded all the other lines of industries — a square deal. THE 1924 STATE FAIR Nebraska's Fifty-Sixth State Fair and Exposition is history — Ne - braska's Fifty-Seventh State Fair and Exposition is in the making. The State Fair of today has become an institution and the manage - ment is not any more than through with one until their efforts are turned towards the next. In making a study of Fairs in general, we find that they are insti - tutions that are very much misunderstood by the general public, for the reason that they are only open such a short period of the year gives the average citizen the opportunity for criticism, especially along the line of the necessary grounds and buildings to properly stage a Fair in keeping, with either the county or state, in which such Fair is held. The big work the Fairs are accomplishing is overlooked by the large percent of our population. Until the individual, in some way, becomes either connected with, or interested in, some of the work the Fairs are doing, it is very hard to make them see just what place these Fairs oc - cupy in the progress of our states and our Nation. While Fair grounds and buildings are only occupied a short period of the year, yet they stand the year around as an incentive to the industries and activities of the state to do better each succeeding twelve months. If such institu - tions were abolished, where would we find a place for our products in competition arid comparison? How would we know from one year to another, just what progress we had made towards the betterment of our human race, our livestock, our crops, our machinery, our labor sav - ing devices, our domestic products and in fact, all lines of progress in general. This, and this alone, is the one big place that the Fairs fill in the general progress of our several counties and states. It is impossible for the Fairs of today to be self supporting. If they are functioning as they should, keeping the educational features in the foreground, this creates an expense and does not derive a revenue only through an increased attendance at the outside gates. Every added educational feature of a Fair means added expense from the standpoint of the Fair treasury. Each year finds added requests from various activities and industries </seg>
            <seg id="p030">30 RKPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE of our state, for a place in our State Fair ,and it is a real problem for the management of this great Exposition, to find adequate receipts to take care of these many requests. tNo one is disputing the fact that these new organizations and ac - ities are not entitled- to recognition, but to find a way to properly •e for them and the financial obligation involved from the standpoint the Fair, is the one problem that is confronting the management daily. From time immemorial the charge for attendance at our State Fair has been the customary one-half dollar, with the exception of a two year period when seventy-five cents was charged. This extra charge caused such a dissatisfaction amongst our citizens in general, that it was eliminated, and again the one-half dollar reigns in its depreciated pre - sent day standing. I say depreciated for the reason that the half-dollar of today is insignificant in its purchasing value of present day con - ditions. The only way your State Fair can hope for relief from the situation as it now confronts you, is by a greatly increased attendance, which we cannot hope for in the immediate future, for the reason that Nebraska is not, as yet, as thickly settled as it will be in the next ten to fifteen years. Surveys show that only about 5 percent, or a little less, of the average population of the agricultural states, attend their State Fair. Fair attendance is composed principally of those vitally interested in our basic industry. With us in Nebraska, these people have to travel ong distances to pay a visit to our annual exposition. If weather and oad conditions should be unfavorable during Fair week, those desiring o attend, lose, and your Fair loses. While, as I say, only a small per ent of our population attend our annual exposition, still those who do attend from the several communities of the state, carry back to the rest of the people in those communities, the lessons they learned while at he Fair and indirectly every citizen of the State derives some benefit from the holding of these annual expositions. Therefore, should not the people of the state, as a whole, support these institutions the same as we support our educational institutions? Your State Fair — as a State Exposition — is obligated to recognize the worth while activities and industries of our state. If we cannot do this by a sufficient charge at the outside gates, then other sources of revenue must be provided. To more vividly draw to the attention of our citizens the needs of this institution, permit me to make a few comparisons, for instance, be - fore the premiums could be paid at the 1924 State Fair, it was necessary that 92,000 one-half dollars be dropped in the turnstiles at the gates. It took 19,000 more for advertising, 60,000 for maintenance, 28,774 for </seg>
            <seg id="p031">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICITLTIRE 31 help to stage the Fair during the week, 62,000 for an entertainment program and 10,000 for a few permanent improvement on the grounds, made necessary by the gradual growth of the institution. In all, it took 329,726' one-half dollars to do the work of this institution during 1924. Your outside gates brought in 128,914 half-dollars, your grandstand and bleachers 63,589, concessions 53,428, and the rest of the half dollars came from various sources, such as pen and stall rent, entry fees, etc. In going back over the history of the State Fair, we find that the first Territorial Fair was held at Nebraska City in 1858. From that time until 1901, the period of annual succession was broken and the Fair was, so to speak, on wheels. It seemed in years past, that whatever city offered the greatest inducement to the Board, was granted the priv - ilege of having the Fair for that year. This did not spell for permanancy. But in 1901 the legislature evi - dently recognizing the worth while work of the state Fair was doing and recognizing its value to the state, made an appropriation of $35,000 for the purchase of part of the present site, including a few wooden build - ings thereon. As the years have advanced, each session of the legislature has made some appropriation for the State Fair. While a session or two during this period made such an appropriation rather lean, still they have all recognized the institution as part of the state's activities. From 1901 to 1915, the total appropriation from the state for the State Fair, amounts to $248,500.00, with an annual allowance of $2,000 for premiums. From 1917 to 1923, the appropriations amounted to $391,666.14, with the annual allowance of $2,000 for premiums, in addition. While the state has spent an amount of $640,166.14 for the original purchase of the grounds, the addition of more land, along with the erec - tion of a few permanent buildings, the receipts from the Fair have been staging twenty-four State Fairs, placing permanent improvement on the grounds to the extent of $372,082.00, have taken care of a maintenance of the grounds and buildings to the extent of $374,089, or a total expen - diture on the grounds and buildings of $746,171, a sum of $106,005 more, put into the grounds and buildings from Fair receipts, than has come from the state. In addition to all this, pemiums have been paid from Fair receipts to an amount of $705,347.49, over this period of twenty-four years, $48,000 of which has come from the state. Comparatively speaking, the attendance at the State Fair has not kept pace with the increased demand for an increase in premiums and added activities. </seg>
            <seg id="p032">32 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In 1901 with an attendance of 46,880, premiums were paid amount - ing to $11,403; in 1910, attendance 130,144, premiums paid, $29,409; in 1915, attendance 146,381, premiums paid $29,530; in 1920 .attendance 271,024, premiums paid, $47,742; in 1924, attendance 265,594, premiums paid, $46,132. Thus it will be noted, that your greatest increase in premiums of - fered and paid, came between the period of 1915 and 1920. This was brought about by a just demand from exhibitors on account of the in - creased cost of feed, labor and transportation. In 1901 the half dollar had a purchasing power equal to practically three times the value of a half dollar today. It did not take nearly so much to satisfy the public then, as it does in the present day. Seven or eight thousand dollars a year, expended on the grounds and buildings in the way of maintenance, took care of them in very good shape twenty years ago, now it is necessary to expend a sum of twenty thousand or better, in keeping up the appearance of the grounds and making some of the old buildings presentable to go through a Fair. This does not allow for many repairs and improvements, which should be made, in order to properly protect the buildings from too great a deteri - oration. Twenty years ago, there was less than a quarter milllion of dollars invested in the property, today there is better than a million and a quarter, and as the institution grows and the property becomes more valuable from year to year, the item of maintenance will of necessity become greater. There are approximately seventy-five buildings on the grounds owned by the state, covering a ground area of better than a half million square feet, with a roof area of about twelve acres. A detailed report of these buildings, the size of each, with an item - ized account of necessary repairs to these buildings, will be filed with this report. The work of the State Fair over the past twenty-four years is to be commended. With an investment by the state of $64,000.00, surplus Fair receipts have added $746,171 to the improvement and maintenance of the property, thus more than doubling the investment by the state in the value of this property. LFew institutions of like character can show a better record than s Nebraska. An invoice of the personal property owned by the institution, will show some $30,000. This property must be kept on hand in order to properly care for the grounds and buildings and have same in readiness for the proper opening of the Fair. </seg>
            <seg id="p033">RKPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AORICUL.TUKK 33 Large sums of money have been spent the past few years in the installation of an adequate sanitary anil storm sewer system, an electric light system and a water system. Much money has been spent in the continuance of the filling of the low place? on the grounds, in cindering and graveling the street? and in the beautification of the grounds ir. general. The fact must not be overlooked that your State Fair grounds is a city in itself, you must have the proper accomodations to properly care for from forty to sixty thousand people daily, for a period of six days. To do this and give satisfaction, calls foi the expenditure of money. In the study of human nature, we find that the larger percent of our citizens appreciate growth and progress in our. state through its ac - tivities and industries, and no institution stands as a greater incentive to this growth and progress than does your State Fair. The fact should not be overlooked that the State Fair is the great - est advertising medium and asset that the state possesses. In 1923, 1,053 automobiles representing twenty-five foreign states, passed through our gates; in 1924, 1,290 automobiles representing twenty-eight states passed through our gates. It was here these visitors had the opportunity to see Nebraska at a glance. They received a perspective of our industries, activities and resources. We are satisfied they went back to their homes loudly pro - claiming our achievements. What is such advertising worth to the State of Nebraska? How else could the state have presented itself before these visitors in a more convincing way? So we feel there are a very few who would declare that the Fair was not worth all it cost and more. It is the one big medium through which the state is displaying it - self to the world. In proportion to the support received, is our state ad - vertised either advantageously or disadvantageous^-. When state support is placed upon a per capita basis you will find that it has cost the individual citizen! around a cent and a quarter a year to advertise their state through the medium of our State Fair. It is an institution that needs to be better understood by the people as a whole, once the proper understanding regarding this institution and the work it is doing, then will it be granted the support it so rightly de - serves. To sum it all up, the Fair has been more than self supporting in years gone by, but we are living in a much different age today than we did even ten years or more ago, then the half dollar had a much differ - ent purchasing power than it has today. In the past, Fairs did not have the competition from as many sourc - es as they have today. It used to be, that the Fair was the one big an- </seg>

Dance halls, movies, swimming pools, automobiles and the numerous recreatienal inventions of the present day, are taking the attention and idle moments of our coming generation. This is the one big reason why the Fairs of today have taken such a keen interest in the work of the Boys' and Girls' clubs. They have realized more than anyone else, outside of our agricultural colleges, the necessity of keeping these boys and girls on the farms, for we cannot, as a Nation, endure long if we permit the building up of large cities at the expense of our rural popu- t Such work as this is strictly educational, and requires a large amount of money to properly care for the exhibits of these junior farm - ers and pay adequate premiums as an incentive to these boys and girls to continuue in the work they are engaged in.

In looking over the past, the present, ami trying to visualize the fu- ture, I am inclined to feel that Nebraska and her activities are just starting to develop. It reminds me a great deal of our human lives. Here we find youth, manhood and old age. Nebraska has passed through its days of youth and is to me entering upon its days of manhood, the days of greatest development and progress. The next decade should see wonderful strides made by our state, and untold progress and development can be accom - plished if we all put our shoulder to the wheel and do our individual part in this development. As I have repeatedly stated, Fairs and Expositions are community builders and therefore, it behooves those in charge of these institutions to always be alert, ready at all times to advance those things that will assist us to develop. It is easy enough for us all to prosper and make progress when everything is favorable, but it takes one with real stamina to stick and fight in the face of adverse conditions. The Fairs of Nebraska, as a whole, have come through in wonderful shape the past four years, and this is demonstration enough that the men behind these institutions are the kind that do not quit in the face of adversity. Year by year the Fairs of Nebraska are getting better, year by year they are looked up to in their several communities, as the leader for better conditions in general, and this is the work they should be do - ing, and I know are doing. With your Fair you are able to create an interest in your com - munity which no other agency is able to create. You can be the leader in the development of the things that stand for better living, better farming and a higher standard for your community. It therefore behooves you, as Fair men, to study your community, see what is needed and then put it across through the agency which you have at your command. After all, the biggest thing about your Fair, is the people that at- </seg>

They are yours for the short period of time they are in at - tendance, what lessons do you wish to leave with them that they may take home and profit therefrom. You are the instructor, your patrons the students, and the results will be, not what they bring to your Fair, but what they take away. I could not close without expressing my appreciation, and that of the Board, to all our co-workers for the splendid co-operation which has been exemplified towards a greater State Fair and Exposition for Ne- braska. Every thought and effort should be for a greater and better state and with this in mind you will have the personal satisfaction of knowing that you have given of your time, effort and energy, to a worthy cause. As long as we call Nebraska our home and state, we should at all times be willing to give the best we have for the future development and advancement of our commonwealth. You as Fair men, have that opportunity, and I know full well that you will discharge the obligation with credit to yourselves and the state at large.

The following resolution with reference to the ser - vice of Secretary E. R. Danielson, was read by Mr. Weaver, who moved its adoption, and the same was adopted by a unanimous rising vote. WHEREAS: E. R. Danielson, for twelve years a member of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture, and since 1917 its Secretary, has severed his official connection with this body for the purpose of resum - ing private business, and WHEREAS: During his long service, both as a member and as Secretary, he has shown a fidelity and ability recognized by his associat - es and the people of the state, and WHEREAS: Especially during his service as Secretary he has shown such adaptation and special ability as a Fair Manager as to be recognized throughout the United States as one of the ablest of Fair Managers, serving as Secretary of the Association of American Fairs and Expositions; THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED: That the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture, while expressing its sincere regret at the decision of our Secretary which removes i'rom this body his strong personality, hi? fine comradeship and his splendid ability, attests the qualities of service and leadership above set forth, and extend.- to him the hope that every hap - piness and success will attend him in his new field of endeavor. The following resolution was then presented and on motion of Mr. Weaver was adopted: roads a:xi&gt; gas tax RESOLVED: That the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture de - clare its opposition to the S-18,000.00 Road Program as proposed by the Good Roads Association of this State. We favor good roads, but we deem such a large expenditure of money within the six year period recommended as inexpedient, unwise and a questionable experiment. We further declare our opposition to the creation of a State Highway Com - mission, Tor the reason that we consider that the state and counties have ample departments and officials for the administration of road construc - tion and maintenance. We consider that additional administrative offices would only add unnecessary duplication, expense and eliminate the local control which tax payers are entitled to in the administration of their affairs. We favor the enactment by the State Legislature of a law provid - ing for a State Gasoline Tax; Provided that the same is a substituted tax and not an additional tax. If such a law is enacted, we favor a reduc - tion of an equal amount in the property and automobile license taxes. We favor, as just to the users of gasoline, a refund on all gasoline used for any purpose other than road transportation. </seg>
            <seg id="p048">48 KEPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tWe recommend legislation providing for an additional tax on pub - conveyances carrying passengers and freight for hire. We favor the ;ribution of ?uch taxes and licenses for road building and maintenance stantially as now provided by law. The following resolution on the Intangible Tax Law was read by Mr. Weaver, who moved its adoption. INTANGIBLE TAX LAW tWe favor the repeal of the so-called Intangible Tax Law and recom - ld that all so-called intangible property be taxed on the same basis real estate and other tangible property. We oppose the issuance of all tax exempt securities and bonds. We deem the present laws providing for the issuance of improve - ment bonds and special taxes in many cases, by the respective subdi - visions of our state, as unwise, and conducive to public extravagance and high taxes. We therefore favor action by the legislature which will in the future restrict the issuance of such bonds and special taxes. MR. MITCHELL: I think these people ought to take care of these things for themselves, and I am not in favor of the resolution. A MEMBER: I believe that resolution ought to be tabled because it is too indefinite. MR. GUSTAFSON: The large part of our taxes are caused by our local subdivisions, school districts, precincts and counties. We are all for tax reduction and we all know that the larger part of our taxes are not from the state at large, and we know how easy it is to vote bonds for this, that, and the other thing, and two years ago there was the feeling in the legislature that there should be a larger percentage necessary in order to vote bonds. The legislature urged two years ago that sixty - re per cent of the vote be necessary to carry, and the intention is just tighten it up a little tighter than we have had at this time and this in line with tax reduction. MR. A. B. WOOD: I move that the resolution be tabled. I do not believe this is the proper line of attack; if we made stricter rules and regulations in regard to the qualifications of those who vote we will get quicker results. LMr. Wood's motion was seconded and the vote resulted in 21 ayes d 40 noes. Vote on Mr. Weavers' motion resulted in the adoption of the reso - lution. The resolution referring to the Child Labor Amendment was read by Mr. Weaver and on his motion was adopted. </seg>
            <seg id="p049">REPORT OF XKBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 49 CHILD LABOR AMENDMENT We oppose the ratification by the Nebraska Legislature of the Child Labor Amendment to the Federal Constitution, submitted by Congress. We regard it as an encroachment on the rights of the states, an at - tempt to centralize government at Washington and a violation of the principle of local self government. Under the new constitution of Ne - braska we have ample' authority to pass all necessary laws for the pro - tection of the children of this state. Regardless of our position on this proposed amendment, we favor a referendum vote at the next genera! election of 1926, for the guidance of the Legislature. (Signed) A. J. WEAVER, Chairman, C. H.

With considerable regret, my friends, I am submitting a name to you for this position. Circumstances l! en which make it necessary for us now to select a new secre- tary. The Secretary is the director of the work of this great body. While he has the Board + o outline his work, he is the man who must remain on the job practically day and night. Such a man v.-e have had the past eight years, and now it becomes our duty to find someone to take his place and I am here to say to you, gentlemen, that there is not a man among us who can fill the place with the ability that the outgoing secretary has filled it. It is a position that no man, unless he has had experience in that office, can handle as well as the man who is going out has handled it. Therefore with me it is a regret, as well as with you, that we must select a new secretary. : L CET ".: ' : '!.■■?

            <seg id="p052">52 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE But now we need a new man, and I want to nominate a man who has grown up in this work; a man every one of you knows; a man who I feel can succeed Mr. Danielson there and render the necessary services better perhaps than any other man who at this time could be found. You know that man; it not necessary for me to make any effective remarks about him; I want to nominate George Jackson of Nelson for Secretary of the State Board of Agriculture. Mr. Mitchell moved that nominations close and the secretary cast the entire vote of the body for Mr. Jackson. The motion was adopted, the vote cast, and Mr. Jackson was declared unaniomusly elected as Sec- MR. DANIELS ON: It gives me great pleasure to cast the unani - mous vote of this body for George Jackson as Secretary, and in addition may I ask for a question of personal privilege, the privilege to extend to George Jackson my right hand; and with it, Mr. Jackson, every thing that I possess in the way of experience, of knowledge, of information, or human possibilities, may I assure you, will be yours in connection with your duties in this Board, to keep the institution we have loved so dearly in the line of progress. MR. GRAFF: Mr. President, I would like permission at this time to digress just a few minutes from the regular order of business. PRESIDENT JACKSON: You have permission. MR. GRAFF: Mr. Chairman, and Gentlemen of the Board. Almost twenty years ago when I was first breaking into the show game at the tate Fair, of course I had to first become acquainted with the superin - ndent of cattle who was O. E. Mickey from Polk County. Mr. Mickey trought with him a young, inexperienced, baby sort of Swede. I be - came acquainted with that young man, and of course without any flowery ompliments to be paid to him, I want to say that in the way he took old of matters and the ability he displayed, this organization soon found place for him higher up, and eight years ago he was assigned the position of Secretary of this body. For eight long years he has con - tinued in that service, until he has become acquainted with the people f the soil in Nebraska like perhaps no other man has become acquainted, e has endeared himself to those with and for whom he has labored, and I want to say, Ed, that these men regret to see you go; but since ou must go, our very best wishes go with you into your new field of abor, and we sincerely hope that you will find in your change that you will not be called upon by the whole population of the State of Nebraska very hour during the twenty- four, but that you may get a little needed rest now and then. UAnd in showing our appreciation, Ed, the boys have seen fit to pre - t you a little souvenir by which you may remember them, and that </seg>
            <seg id="p053">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 53 souvenir is of a kind which you will be able to carry with you as you go through life. When I first saw it I thought it was a package of cigarettes, but it doesn't seem to be that; it has a little more heft. This, Ed, we hope and believe will help you a little as you go on through the journey of life, and that you will not find it burdensome; and we trust that wherever your lot may be cast in the future you will at least have a fair chance. Gentlemen, I present to Mr. Danielson, our outgoing Secretary, on your behalf, this little token of esteem. We will just take two or three minutes recess so that you may come forward and shake Ed's hand and then we can proceed with the balance of our business. Mr. Graff, on behalf of the members then presented to Mr. Danielson a beautiful white gold watch with chain and knife attachment. A three minute recess gave all members an opportunity to examine this gift and extend their free hand to Mr. Danielson, after which the Board reconvened. MR. PURCELL: We would like to hear from Mr. Jackson, our in coming Secretary, at this time. MR. JACKSON: I haven't much to say, only to thank you men for the confidence you have placed in me. I think the Secretary job of the State Fair Board is one of the biggest jobs in the state, if not the very biggest, and I know we look upon it as an honor, but it really is not an honor to be elected to a position of this kind, when you are elected. The honor I expect to receive, if any, is not when I go in but when I go out; and I only trust I may leave this Association ,when the time comes, with the same degree of honor that we have given to the secretary who is leaving at this time, and if I do I will be satisfied. However, I know that I will not fail. When I think of the personnel of the Board and of the members, and the co-operation we get from the county fairs, I know I will not fail. I know this fair work is going on. The beginning of my fair work goes back to when I was twelve years old. I want to tell you a little story. I had a colt I called my own at that time and the neighbors around talked, to my mother, my father was dead, and got her to allow me to take the colt to tne Fair of Jo Daviess County, Illinois, and I got so wrapt up in that colt that I thought there was no possible show for anybody to beat me; and I took the colt to the fair and several of my neighbor! boy and girl friends were out to see me get the blue ribbon — I got the red ribbon; and I was terribly disappointed and the first thought that came to me was "I will never have anything more to do with this fair, or any other fair," but the old judge, a farmer, I guess could see I was terribly wrought up over it, and he came to me and said "my son, if you will take your colt home and feed it up and fatten it up and come here next year you will beat these fellows; he is </seg>
            <seg id="p054">54 UKPORT OF NEBRASKA STATIC BOA RD OF AGRICULTl'RK not fat enough, he is going to make the best horse, but he is not fat enough to show." And I thank God that that old judge told me the and that has followed me all my life, and when I looked into the face of the fellow who beat me I thought "I will beat you next year," and I went home and after that I went down to the pasture every day for the next year with sugar or Halt or something for the celt, and the next year I took the colt to the fair and I got the blue ribbon. And that little instance taught &lt;: e seveial things. It instilled into my mind that desire to win and when I go into anything I want to win. I don't always do it, but it has taught me two or three things and I am just as good a loser as I am a winner. Charley Graff, too. There is one candidate here for governor. And these things are what make me interested in the 500,000 boys and girls of this state, and if we, as an asscociation, can instill into their young: lives-, that desire to win, it is not the raising colts or pigs or calves, but it is that desire to beat and win cut and put their very best efforts in that means so much to their.. Wherever I go I put in my very best tffort, and I will do that in this fair business. It would be very foolish for a man of my age to take a position of this kind if he had not been drilled up in this work, but I feel that I know practically every angle of it and if I fail it will not be because I have not tried, and I hope I may leave the Association with the same de- iee of honor that Mr. Danielson is leaving. I thank you. M*&gt;. PUKCf.LL: May we rds 11 MR. DANIELSON: Well boys, nobody has dreaded to see this m ment come, in a way, any \ orse than I have. But I have realized es peciallly during the last two years, that it had to come, and to come in in a way, connected with 11'" t i was doing something for the stat h whom I !i-\-e &lt; of Neb ot for oursel Four years ago I was unfortun ing that I took up too soon the stre: res, that any man will hav ho occupies this position I have straggled over this with my think I ever made a decision that elf, all alone in the night ,and I don't wa i any harder for me to make, or that I regretted to make any more than I have this one. The only ray of sunshine that I can find for myself lies in the fact that I think I will be as welcome to throw my hat into that office in years to come ns I have been in the years gone by. I kr.o.w it is foolish of me to be so affected, but I want to tell you that there are men on this Board with whom I have labored over this long period of years, who have been dads and brothers to me. The fact is thev have come the nearest to being ate in having an operation ami follow- luous responsibilities, the worries and the very near future. I know that 1 havo not words that can convey to you what 1 have gone through with in the last right years. I want you to understand that practically every moment of this eight years has been a happy one so far as I am eoiic rned, because I felt that out of every moment, and every hour of every day in that period of time, I, </seg>

No father after I passed the age of seven years, no brothers, and I have found my com - panionship in the big men of Nebraska; and the big men of Nebraska as I see them are men who have composed this Board. Mr. Jackson, or George, I want to say to you, and I want to say to Elmer and to Tom, and I want to say to Jake, and I want to say to Artie Lamb, and I want to say to Art Weaver, and I want to say to all the boys that I have lived with and slept with, and we have eaten together, and what has been the problem of one has been the problem of us all, that that does not stop; the line is not drawn so far as our work and activities are concerned. We have even reached out in years past, and what was the welfare of my family was the welfare of the other boys. So I do not feel, men, that I am just leaving a position; I feel in a way that I am leaving the best and dearest friends that I have on earth. And as I stated to you before, George, I want to be at your right elbow, to give you any time you a?k all the information or advice that I can, and I do not want to do it in a manner of dictation; I want to do it as I have done my work over the period of this time, for the best inter- MR. PURCELL: I feel, as 1 stated before, that I am very for - tunate in being associated with the men who compose the Fair Manage - ment Board for this coming year. The next thing that I am required to do is to announce the ap - pointments for the Board of Managers which is the privilege and duty of the incoming President each year, and I will ask the delegates present to confirm them if they see fit to do so, after I have announced them. The Board of Managers is composed of the President, Second Vice President, and four appointed members. I have appointed A. W. Lamb of Boone county, Jake Sass of Sarpy county. Perry Reed of Hamilton county, and Irl D. Tolen of Valley county. In doing this I want to call attention to the manner in which the Board of Managers, or rather I might say the officers of the Fair, are distributed over the state. Each congressional district now is represented by one or more of the officers of the State Fair; there is no district that has more than two and every ests of I^ebiaska as I see them. I thank you. MR. JACKSON: It is a pleasure to me at this time to turn over the gavel of this organization to a n;an whom I know will make good, a man who is not only qualified as a Fair Manager, hut as a business man, a n'.an who can say no, and nsafce vou like it. I consider it a privileged work to appoint E. R. Puic:-ll as President of this organization. Mr. Puicell, I am very gted indeed to turn over to your keeping this gaveL </seg>

I feel that the Nebraska State •'air is growing bigger and greater, and I hope that during the coming year, with the aid of these officers, with the aid of the splendid Board hat makes the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture, with the assistance of the splendid line of County Fair Managers over the state, it will be possible to make the State Fair bigger and greater. I thank you. Mr. McCarthy moved confirmation of the appointments made by the President and the motion was seconded and unanimously carried. MR. DANIELSON: Boys, I know I have been rather upset. I hardly think it is necessary for me to express to you my appreciation of this token. I full well realize the spirit in which it is given to me, and I want you to know that I shall cherish it as long as I live and there won't be a day pass, there will hardly be an hour pass in the day when this will not keep fresh in my mind memories of the beautiful associations that I have had with this organization, and it will be con - stant reminder of worth while men.

            <seg id="p211">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 213 PRESIDENT DANLY: I am much pleased to see this large crowd in attendance. We have a very interesting program and we will take up immediately the debate which has been scheduled by our Committee. This is upon a subject which has been very much in the minds of the people during the past campaign; everybody wants to help the farmer, no matter what political party he belongs to. This morning we are to have a debate upon the question "Resolved, That Congress at its next Session should pass the McNary-Haugen Bill or some similar measure." I will appoint Mr. Cook as time keeper, and each side will have forty - five .minutes. The first speaker on this debate will be Mr. C. B. Steward who is the present secretary of the Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation, and who in the past has been a prominent Shorthorn breeder at Red Cloud, Nebraska. We will hear from Mr. Steward, whom I take pleasure in introducing to you at this time. Mr. C. B. Steward First Speaker for Affirmative Mr. President — There probably has been no question that has aroused such wide-spread interest in the past few years as the so-called McNary-Haugen Bill and similar measures that have been proposed having to do with so-called agricultural relief. Your Committee in selecting this question no doubt had in mind the present session of congress which is now open. We take that for granted. I assume that I should try to confine my remarks very closely to what I have pre - pared in order that those speaking on the other side of the question may have something definite in mind to speak to. The program com - mittee has given us a question for discussion this morning that is of vital importance to the economic welfare of the American farmer. No proposed legislation of recent years has brought out such a thorough discussion of the relation of Agriculture to that of labor, commerce and industry as the proposed McNary-Haugen Bill. The committee very wisely recognized that the defeat of the Mc- Nary-Haugen bill in the last session of Congress did not settle the controversy or remove the demand on the part of agricultural inter - ests that agriculture should receive the same legislative consideration in our American policy of protecting labor and industry against the lower standard of European nations. Hence they have broadened the question to include not alone the McNary-Haugen bill but legislation along similar lines and designed to accomplish the same objects aimed at by the McNary-Haugen bill. Permit me to call your attention to statement of the question: </seg>
            <seg id="p212">214 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE RESOLVED: That Congress at its next session should pass the McNary Haugen Bill or some similar measure. Since this question was stated prior to the convening of the pres - ent session I think we can all agree that the Congress now in session is not referred to in the question. The avowed purpose of the spon - sors of the McNary-Haugen bill was to give to the American farmer the same economic standard of equality as that enjoyed by labor and commerce in relation to the prices established in the world markets. Tariff Has Legislated Industrial Prosperity, By legislative action we have established an American standard of living for the industrial worker and those engaged in commercial pursuits. Tht American laboring man is better housed, better clothed, better educated, enjoys better social conditions than his foreign com - petitor because we have given him the protection afforded by our American Tariff system. It is true that quite recently current prices of certain grains have advanced substantially in the markets and the American farmer has reaped some advantage because in the face of a serious shortage in these crops in those countries which are our prin - cipal competitors the Anerican farmer has enjoyed a bountiful pro - duction. But this condition is only temporary and does not correct the basic principles of a system that spread disaster to agricultural interests immediately following the great war. It must be obvious that the same forces, economic and man made, to which the current advance is attributable, promises at best improvement only in the im - mediate condition of agriculture and does not address its fundamental effect, with no assurance whatever of permanency or stability for the future. When there is a surplus of any product it is elementary economic law that the price of the surplus fixes the price of the whole product. We have to sell our surplus crops abroad, where they come in competition with the crops of other countries operating on standards of cost, price and living very much lower than ours. Our surplus, and hence our whole crop, is therefore sold at a foreign price level x»st well below our own. These crops are the only American products whose domestic price is fixed by .world conditions at a level far below that of the home market. Disparity in Domestic and Foreign Prices. Our highly organized tariff on the products of industry makes the farmer buy in a protected market and pay a high American price for all that he buys. This condition makes him sell his whole crop of those products of which we produce a surplus, whether for domestic or foreign consumption, in a free trade market, at a world price, much </seg>
            <seg id="p213">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 215 lower than the general plane of protected American prices for what he buys. Before the war this burden was not too heavy because the world level and the American level were more nearly equal. As a result of the war the markets of the world were demoralized and depressed by debt, taxes and inflated currencies until the spread between the Amer - ican price and the world price planes became so great as to make it no longer possible for our farmer to stand the burden of selling on the basis of an Argentine peasant and buying on the basis of an American citizen. The farmer should not expect more than the world price for his surplus; he has a light to expect pre-war purchasing power for his domestic crop. That is what everybody else gets for what they earn or sell in the domestic market. The McNary-Haugen bill would have given him that degree of equality. Deflated Dollar Must Pay Debts of Inflated Period. Another point we must remember is that agriculture, in common with every other industry, incurred a tremendous debt when prices of farm products and farm necessities were on a highly inflated basis.. That debt is now to be met and though it was incurred at a time when the prices of farm products were from 100 to 200 percent higher than they are today, the farmer is required to go about the payment of that debt with prices on the whole at about the same level as they were before the war. Industry and labor are retiring the debt they in - curred during a period of high prices by returns which they are receiv - ing on a high price level. Labor and Industry retires its debt by pay - ing our dollars for each dollar of obligation, while Agriculture is re - tiring its debt by paying two dollars for every dollar of obligation. Without suitable legislation the farmer cannot correct this unfair economic relationship. Agriculture has remained unorganized indi - vidualistic, fighting its battles with nature and accepting the in - equalities forced upon it by the influence of other groups. Since, we have a well defined American policy, which by legislative act limits the natural law of supply and demand in fixing prices for the products of labor and industry, agriculture is justified in demanding similar protection . Legislated Industrial Prosperity. Labor has been protected from the competition of cheap foreign labor by the Restrictive Immigration Act, the Adamson Act, the eight hour law and favorable working conditions. The railroads are pro - tected by the passage of the Esch-Cummins Law and the establishment of the Railroad Labor Board. Capital is protected by our Federal Reserve Act and favorable taxation policies. </seg>
            <seg id="p214">216 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Industry receives enormous benefits from the Fordney-McCumber tariff act which is made still more effective by the enactment of the Webb-Pomerene and Edge bills which gives it control of its own mar - keting machinery, permits and encourages it to combine for export trade and to allocate its own loss of operation represented by the dif - ference in the price obtained between the domestic and foreign mar - kets. Principles of the McNary-Haugen Bill The McNary-Haugen bill, had it been enacted into law, would have given to agriculture the same advantage enjoyed by other groups. First, by enabling the producers through an agency created for them to purchase, or to contract with others to purchase, certain basic crops until the price thereof rises to the same exchange value compared with other commodities that obtained for a normally representative period prior to the war. The law now proposed, while not identical with the McNary-Haugen bill, still properly comes within the realm of this dis - cussion because it is similar in the basic character of its operation and the object to be attained. The bill provides for the creation of a Farmers Export Corporation organized in the most simple and direct manner consistent with the preservation of business principles neces - sary for successful action. These principles are: First, power to divert a surplus above domestic needs to the world market, so that Cooperative Marketing Associations, assisted by the buying power of the Farmers Export Corporation, may be able to make the protective tariff effective in equalizing differences in the cost of production of major farm commodities in the United States and in competing foreign countries. The Farmers Export Corporation would consist of the Secretaries of the Treasury, Agriculture and Commerce to represent the general public, and twelve other persons, one from each of the 12 federal land bank districts, appointed by the President from nominations made in each district by farm, live stock and commodity marketing associations. This board will have power to create a smaller executive committee rom its members, hire managers and exercise corporate powers. The Corporation will have power to buy and sell farm commodities and ex - rcise all the powers necessary to segregate the surplus of a farm com - modity above domestic requirements and hold it or dispose of it, at world price levels, with authority to operate a premium or bounty on xports, if desired. Provision will also be made for the collection of an equalization fee and the apportionment of expenses and losses in xport sales among equalization funds. above powers were all in the McNary-Haugen bill, but it is ible to draft a bill along simpler lines, omitting features that </seg>
            <seg id="p215">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 217 aroused objections among other groups, and still maintain ample power for an effective farmers export corporation. Second, adequate working capital to be provided by a loan of funds to the Corporation, by the War Finance Corporation and returnable to the corporation out of the equalization fees to be collected from each unit of the commodity handled. The equalization fees received from the sale of each commodity are to be placed in an equalization fund for each commodity, out of which will be paid the losses and expenses chargeable to such commodity during the time for which the fees were collected. Authority is given to collect from each unit of each commodity handled in this manner as it moves in trade, an amount sufficient to prevent impairment of working capital. Third, to protect the value of a product so established by an ade - quate tariff. We adopted a policy of patriotism in government when we legislated a protective tariff for the benefit of industry, and this insured an American price higher than the world price to every class in America except the producers of export agricultural crops. We further insured the benefits of a protective tariff to labor and industry by restricting immigration and permitting industry to combine into an export corporation under the Edge and Webb-Pomerene bills, for the purpose of moving into export channels at the world price, that portion of manufactured products in excess of the demands of domestic con - sumption. The government does nothing for the Farmers Export Cor - poration except give it a start by loaning funds from the War Finance Corporation. The bill simply permits an Agricultural corporation to go onto the market, utilizing existing marketing agencies, and buy and sell exportable surpluses of farm crops at the expense of the farmer in exactly the same way that the officers of a commercial corporation act for their stockholders. The suggested legislation would insure that existing tariff schedules would operate effectively on all farm commodities of which there is an exportable surplus. This eliminates two features of the McNary-Haugen bill which aroused bitter opposi - tion, the ratio price and the power conferred upon the President to fix tariff rates at will. The basic principle of our American Protective Tariff system is that duties shall be levied at such a level as to equalize the difference between cost of production at home and abroad. The McNary-Haugen bill violated this principle by authorizing the President to establish agricultural rates that would insure a domestic price level that fluc - tuated with the general price level in this country as measured by an all-commodity index and not in harmony with the world level. The present proposal adheres to the long established principle of </seg>
            <seg id="p216">218 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE establishing an American price level at the height of the tariff well above the world price. The McNary-Haugen bill compelled the Cor - poration to buy agricultural surpluses at the established ratio price and this furnished argument to those who opposed the bill as a price fixing The law as now proposed permits the corporation to go into the market and buy and divert the surplus at prevailing prices and thus et the surplus out of the way so that the domestic price will rise to le height of the tariff wall or be forced there by the Cooperative Mar - ceting Associations aided by the activities of the Export Corporation. No ew tariff principles are involved and all producers would share in ab - orbing the costs incurred in disposing of the surplus. With the tassage of this bill our tariff policy will apply to all economic groups n just proportion and the farmer will share equally with labor and ndustry in the benefits to be derived from our American Protective ariff System. PRESIDENT DANLY— Ordinarily we have an affirmative speech followed by a negative speech, but due to the fact that Mr. Danielson is obliged to leave early, I will introduce him next. Mr. Danielson as Secretary of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture is responsible for putting on one of the best State Fairs in the United States. We will now hear from him on the affirmative of the subject. E. R. DANIELSON (Second speaker for affirmative) Gentlemen, I don't want any of you to think that this is a per - sonal speech in any way whatsoever; but we are trying to bring*, out here this morning conditions as we see them, in an effort to bring about better results. For some time past, with the exception of cotton perhaps, the crops of which we produce a surplus for export are selling at less than the cost of production to the profound distress of our farm population. Cotton, in a different case, is usually in the same situation. This results from a fundamental failure in our economic system which can be cured by the principles of a bill similar to the McNary-Haugen bill which was before Congress, and not otherwise. Surplus Determines Commodity Price When there is a surplus of any product, it is elementary economic law that the price of the surplus fixes the price of the whole product. We have to sell our surplus crops abroad, where they come into com - petition with the crops of other countries operating on standards of cost, price and living very much lower than ours. Our surplus — and </seg>
            <seg id="p217">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 219 hence our whole crop — is, therefore, sold at a European price level well below our own. THESE CROPS ARE THE ONLY AMERICAN PRO - DUCTS WHOSE DOMESTIC PRICE IS FIXED BY WORLD CONDI - TIONS AT A LEVEL FAR BELOW THAT OF THE HOME MARKET. On the products of industry, the protective tariff keeps out cheap foreign competition and maintains an American plane of prices much ABOVE the world level. These are the prices that make the farmer's cost — they are the prices he must pay for all that he buys and a large portion of the population being dependent on agriculture, he buys every - thing. Herein lies an injustice. Our tariff makes the farmer BUY in a protected market and pay a high American price for all that he buys. The surplus makes him SELL HIS WHOLE CROP— those pro - ducts of which we export a surplus whether for domestic or foreign consumption — in a free-trade market at a world price much lower than the general plane of protected American prices for what he buys. World War Caused International Price Disparity. Before the war this burden was not too heavy because the world level was more nearly an American level. As a result of the war the markets of the world were demoralized and depressed by debt, taxes, and inflated currencies until the spread between the American and the world price planes became so great as to make it no longer possible for our farmer to stand the burden of selling on the basis of an Argentine peasant and buying on the basis of an American citizen. No class of our people should be asked to endure such an inequity. We cannot help it by giving the farmer a higher tariff on export farm products because, since we export more than we import, a tariff on export crops would not cure the ill, even if we raised it to a point of complete ex - clusion. There is only one practicable course and this was proposed by the McNary-Haugen bill. An Analysis of McNary-Haugen Bill. This bill said: "The farmer's export crops ought to have a buying power equal to that which they had before the war, that is, — wheat, for instance, ought to bear at least the same ratio to the average gen - eral price index of all commodities as it bore before the war." To effect this, the bill gave the farmers a corporation, authorized to go into the American market and buy quantities of such export crops as are sell - ing at less than pre-war exchange value until the price rises high enough to bear the pre-war relation to the general price index. When - ever this happened the corporation stopped buying and it only bought when, and as long as, the price was below that ratio. When the price was equal to or above that ratio, the corporation did nothing. This insured the pre-war exchange level and permitted prices to go freely above that level as far as economic forces would send them. </seg>
            <seg id="p218">220 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Of course, it resulted that the corporation would thus buy up all the supply in excess of domestic DEMAND — which is to say, the sur - plus at the pre-war relation. Its sole function was to skim off this surplus from the domestic market, leaving equality of supply with de - mand to determine price. There is only one thing to do with this surplus — sell it abroad and at a price LESS THAN the price the cor - poration paid by just so much as the world general price level is less than the American general price level. Now the question arises as to who shall stand this loss. The bill charged it back to the farmer by requiring that he accept, as a small fraction of the much increased purchase price vouchsafed by the bill, a few cents in certificates like the "participating certificates" of the co-operatives. It would afford a fund to absorb the loss on the surplus and to pay the expense of the corporation. At the end of the year, when this loss and expense had been accurately determined, the remainder in the fund was to be returned to the farmer by redeem - ing the certificates pro rata. As an example, suppose we raise eight hundred fifty million bushels of wheat and the domestic demand is seven hundred million bushels. If the Liverpool price is $1.00 per bushel, the farmer, without a bill of the nature, gets eight hundred fifty million dollars for his crop, not - withstanding the fact that the price of wheat in America would give wheat its pre-war purchasing power which would be $1.50 per bushel. At the latter rate the farmer SHOULD have gotten one billion two hundred seventy-five thousand dollars and, while he ought not to expect more than the world price for his surplus, he HAS A RIGHT TO EX - PECT pre-war purchasing power for his domestic crop — that is what everybody else gets for what they earn or sell in the domestic market. Exactly this is what the McNary-Haugen bill gave him. For every bushel he would have sold under that bill, he would receive the pre-war exchange rate — now about $1.50 per bushel, a small fraction of which is paid in certificates. The corporation keeps the price to that figure by buying up the surplus at that figure. Of this $1.50 about $1.38 would be in cash — 38 per cent more than he now gets and 12 cents in certificates. The corporation entails a loss to the corporation of 50 cents a bushel on the hundred and fifty million bushels sold abroad, amounting to seventy-five millions of dollars. This loss — about 9 cents per bushel on the whole crop — is paid out of the certificates fund and the other hree cents is returned to the farmer by redeeming the certificates. Instead, therefore, of receiving— as he does WITHOUT the bill — eight mndred fifty million dollars for his entire crop at $1.00 per bushel, the &gt;ill would have given him one billion fifty million dollars for the por - tion sold at home and one hundred fifty million dollars for the portion </seg>
            <seg id="p219">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 221 sold abroad or one billion two hundred million dollars for his whole crop — $1.41 per bushel as an average price on the whole — an increase of 41 per cent over the price without the bill. This is all there was to the McNary-Haugen bill. Exactly the same principles apply to other export commodities, and in executing its function, the corporation would set up no new mechanism and duplicate no existing facilities. Some Criticism of the Bill. The details of its operation were more particularly demonstrated in considering the objections and criticisms that were made against the bill. In anticipation of the many objections that the negative represent - ative will no doubt raise and having no chance for rebuttal, I trust you will accord me the privilege of raising some of these objections and answering same to the best of my ability. The first criticism of this bill was that it is "paternalistic", or "communistic", or "radical", or "politically unsound". This objection is otherwise worded, "the government ought not to interfere in business, especially not in favor of any class." Now the government has already "interfered" in favor of every other class when it passed the tariff. BY THAT ACT IT INSURED AN AMERICAN PRICE HIGHER THAN THE WORLD PRICE TO EVERY CLASS IN AMERICA EXCEPT THE PRODUCERS OF EX - PORT CROPS. A condition now arises, due to world depression and the consequent multiplied spread between American and other prices, when the burden thus pressed upon the farmer, of paying a high protected price for what he buys and accepting a free-trade world price for what he sells, becomes too heavy to bear without bankruptcy because it forces him to sell at a loss. The McNary-Haugen bill simply removed this burden and erased the inequity. IT DID NOT FAVOR THE FARMER. It merely in - tended bringing him to equality of favor with the remainder of the population. It did not FAVOR, it ABOLISHED DISFAVOR and put him on an equal plane with industry. The tariff wall had two great breaches. It did not stop the in - flow of cheap labor and therefore did not protect labor. We have cured that by immigration restriction. It did not protect the farmer on export crops. We must now cure that by the enactment of a measure similar to the McNary-Haugen bill. A bill of this nature should be regarded simply as an amendment to the Hamiltonian Doctrine of protection rendered necessary by a violently distorted world condition. </seg>
            <seg id="p220">222 " REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE Perhaps the Tariff is paternalistic, but, having afforded this kind of protection to two-thirds of our people, at the expense of the other, What kind of good faith is it to refuse exactly the same protection to the other third on the pleas of "individualism?" Who has the cynical audacity to say that what is the sound foun - dation rock of our economic policy for industrial New England is com - munism for Nebraska? Are we repentant of the "political unsounclness" of the tariff and the immigration restrictions? The pious penance is to repeal them. It is certainly not to segregate their rich benefits to two-thirds of the population and then flaunt "economic orthodoxy" as a reason for re - fusing them to the other one-third. Such is not piety. It is scurvy hypocrisy. We are not repentant. We adhere to our belief in the principle of protection. But so to adhere we cannot apply it to in - dustry and deny it to agriculture — certainly not on the argument of anti-paternalism. That would add larceny to hypocrisy and neither can long endure as a nation policy. By this bill the government would not "interfere" in "business." It permitted a corporation to combine farm products for export sale just as the Edge and Webb-Pomerene bills now permit industry so to combine. The "government" itself was to do nothing but give the corporation a start. It created no new governmental bureau or de - partment. It simply permitted a great agricultural corporation, organized in the only way it could be organized, to go into the market and buy and sell, thus correcting an insufferable condition. The corporation created no new mechanism. It utilized existing agencies for manufacture, storage, transportation, purchase and sales. It would operate merely as would an individual buying and selling in the exchanges. The farmers' agents — officers of the corporation — act for him and at his expense — not at government expense — in precisely the same way the officials of an industrial corporation act for its stock - holders. The government as such did nothing. The farmer pays every cent of expense and bears every risk of loss. He asks neither favor nor fund of any one, except the original capital of the corpor - ation which would have been returned intact to the Treasury of the United States at the expiration of the emergency. Many opponents of the bill said that "economic ills can not be solved by legislative remedy." This is almost ridiculous. Legis - ative enactments affecting commerce are nearly all economic phe - nomena. If it was an economic ill that America, before protection, was simply a reservoir of raw material, the doctrine of protection, ex - tressed as a legislative remedy cured that ill. If it was an economic ill that hordes of aliens incapable of absorption threatened our labor market after the war, legislative enactment cured that ill. If it was </seg>
            <seg id="p221">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 223 an economic ill that the states under the Articles of Confederation could not exist as a Federal unit, the Commerce clause of the Consti - tution and the myriad statutes enacted under it stand as refutation of the objection. As I have repeatedly stated herein, the McNary-Haugen bill sought no new invasion of the economic field; it proposed only a restoration of a nice balance between agriculture and industry which has been shattered by many prior invasions — the tariff, the Adamson law, the Esch-Cummins Act, the restriction of immigration and many others of like nature. Such platitudes are unworthy of consideration unless their appli - cation to the matter in controversy be shown and there is no application of this creaking fallacy to the point in question here. Again we hear the opponents saying, "the proposed increase in price would in turn raise the general price index. This would auto - matically raise the price of the product. This would again raise the general index, and so on. The bill would start a vicious circle of price-raising until the cost of living would gradually rise to infinity." The slightest examination will show that this terrifying objection is without foundation in practice though it has actually been seriously argued by men otherwise reputed for unusual intelligence. Consider wheat for example. A rise of 20 points in the wheat index raises the general price index 1 point. Considering an example in which the figures are taken for convenience of computation, we shall suppose that the wheat index and the general price index both stand at 100. The bill passes and raises the wheat index to 150. This would raise the general index 2.5, or to 102.5. This would raise the wheat price again to 153.75, which in turn would raise the general price index but a very small amount this time, — 19 hundredths points, or to 102.7. Up goes the wheat index, but only 29 hundredths on this calculation, which in turn raises the general price index AN AMOUNT SO SMALL THAT IT WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED— 14 thousandths, or to one hundred two, seven tenths and fifteen ten thousandths. On the next calculation the increment in the general price index -would be only 1 thousandth and 5 hundred-thousandths, and since only two decimal points are computed the terrifying process is at an end. The argument is scholastic — "how many angels can stand on a needle's point?" If one cared to carry on these silly calculations, he would find that, whereas restoration of wheat to its pre-war exchange value would raise the general price index 2.5 points, ten thousand subsequent cal - culations made on this nonsensical argument would not raise it another half point, and every subsequent calculation would carry the increment </seg>
            <seg id="p222">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 224 tther decimal point nearer zero. In other words, the increment idly becomes indefinitely small, and would be disregarded in practice the second calculation when it becomes less than one-fifth of one percent. But in order to get a view of the morals of all these arguments suppose it were literally true that restoration of fair exchange value to agriculture would raise the cost of living substantially. Pre-war exchange value means only cost plus a very small profit or no profit at all. Present prices mean a loss to the farmer on the average of every pound and bushel sold. Argument for maintenance of the present condition is simply argument for taking the farmer's crop without paying cost for it — "justifiable" we say in this case by a desire to keep the cost of living down. Nearly every argument against this proposed relief for our agricultural depression stoops to similar motives. Once more we hear the critics saying, "The bill is a price fixing measure and the whole history of economics stands as an argument against such valorization." "Price fixing" is the attempt to prescribe prices by an arbitrary exercise of human discretion. It is palpably unsound because the dis - cretion that "fixed" price has no power over the elements that make price. Nothing could be farther from this definition than was the McNary-Haugen bill. It was the exact antithesis of price fixing. The essence of the bill was NOT the clause LIMITING by a efinition of price relationship, the power of the corporation to go into le market and buy. If the power in the latter clause were not limited n some very powerful and effective way, the corporation could continue o buy until the domestic price rises to $5.00 per bushel. It would ell about the same surplus at $1.00 a bushel, and raise the farmers' income to fantastical figures. The price clause was not a grant of &gt;ower. It was a limitation of power. Its purpose was not to "raise rices to an artificial level." It was to maintain them at an equitable evel. The bill merely said to the farmer, "We recognize that you are not getting a square deal. We will give you a square deal. You can go to the market and buy till you get a square deal — and not one instant longer. The measure of a square deal is a domestic price for your product equal to its pre-war purchasing power. "Purchasing power changes constantly in precise relation with the general price index. Therefore you can keep on buying, at any time, until the price of your product bears the same relation to the general price index at such time as it bore before the war." </seg>
            <seg id="p223">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICl'LTCRE 225 So there was no price fixing. There was only limitation of power. Even that, was not a fixed limitation, and it was far removed from human discretion as it would be possible to remove it. The general price index fluctuates constantly with the conditions of business in the country and the limit of the power to buy fluctuates with it in mathematical accuracy. Since no man or combination of men can control or affect the fluctuation of that index, no man can control or affect the limit of that power. Since there was nothing remotely resembling price fixing in the proposed bill, all the anti-price fixing arguments must be dismissed as wholly inapplicable. Once more the anti's raised the question that this proposed biil "would cause an increased price promptly and thereby make matters worse by increasing production." The effect of increased production to reduce price would be far more certain and emphatic than it is now. The hold-back in partici - pation certificates (script) would be directly proportioned to the sur - plus, would be known and would be the most significant warning against inflated production that could be well imagined. Would Bill Cause Overproduction? The pre-war price relationship produced the pre-war acreage. Only that relationship was proposed. Logically only that acreage will ensue and, because we have a considerably increased population since then, at least that acreage should be maintained. And if the argu - ments be "Even so: let them keep the pre-war acreage but do not restore the pre-war relation" — and it is only to this that the argument can reduce — then it is a bold, bad argument in favor of depriving agriculture of all profit — an argument immoral, unworthy and unutter - able. There would be no increased production, but to show how shallow is the argument, suppose there was. Who is hurt? Not the Amer - ican people, for, no matter how great the surplus, the price will not on that account rise above the pre-war relationship. Under the bill it would never fall below. The only person who is interested in the harmful effect of increased production is the farmer. He and he alone stands the loss on surplus. Therefore, the whole argument of in - creased production due to the McNary-Haugen bill as proposed, is a scarecrow. Oh, yes, we have heard them say, "It is a bad precedent. If we do this for farmers we will be called upon to do it for others." </seg>
            <seg id="p224">226 KE1HJRT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The precedent was established when we enacted the tariff and other economic legislation which omitted the farmers from protection. The •ill was merely rectifying the omission. It was not a precedent. It was sequel. It was not even the first sequel. The immigration law gave ahor its piotection but left agriculture still out in the blasts of a win - ry world. So far as we know, this is the last breach in the protective •all. It is a breach that must be closed — not in favor of agriculture, »ut in favor of the whole nation, and in common justice to the farmer. But even if there were other classes equally prejudiced — which therw? are not — is a precedent of simple justice something to be avoided? Not long ago industry asked the right to combine for export trade. It was granted instantly. It has long been the custom for industries to sell in export at less than the domestic price. Agriculture seeks no greater or different privilege, the precedents are all behind us. There is no other class in like case with agriculture. The McNary- Haugen bill would have closed the last gap in our protective outworks. I heard a business man in discussing this proposed bill, say the other day, "The farmer will not accept a portion of his price in par - ticipation certificates." If a farmer, who can get only $1.00 for his wheat without a bill f this kind is offered $1.45 in cash and 10 cents in participation ertificates under the bill, will he refuse the forty-five cents because le is also given an extra ten cents in participation certificates which may be redeemed at three cents? A silly objection. This is exactly he practice of co-operatives. Someone said, "The bill would prevent hedging or future trading by millers and grain men." The ratio price is a minimum price — not a maximum price . Any miller making a future contract to sell flour; any grain man with an ye to future delivery, will have the same incentive in principle as he now has to protect against future price fluctuation, either up or down. Certainly he will have the same facilities and opportunities to do so. t may be true that the latitude of future fluctuations will be less ample nan that of the past, but why should any miller or grain dealer do otherwise than applaud? The professional speculator and the gambler might explain. This should give agriculture and business no concern. Effect on Cooperative Elevators. Once more we hear the opponents say, "The bill would destroy the country elevator." The country grain buyer is interested in handling .as much grain as he can at a margin that includes his handling cost and profit. That opportunity was not restricted or changed by this proposed bill. The </seg>
            <seg id="p225">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRIOlUTrRK 227 » language of the proposed law required the corporation to utilize the existing agencies in its operation. The plan outlined could neither replace or destroy the country elevators which perform a useful service in our present grain marketing systems. The question has been raised that, "The bill required a ponderous mechanism, very expensive and administratively unworkable." The bill conferred power to accomplish its purpose. Is there any - thing unworkable in commissioning existing grain or cotton or meat or milling companies to buy the exportable surplus? Is there anything unworkable in commissioning the same or others to sell to export the quantity of the products thus purchased ? Individual operators do this daily — single-handed and alone. That is all there was to the operation. It involved no mechanism and in - curred much less expense than that now incurred many times over in repeated commissions reaped on speculated sales. It duplicated no facilities and interfered with nobody's business. The objection is a make-weight, signifying nothing. We have also been reminded that "Co-operative marketing will cure the ills." Now co-operative marketing will help but cannot cure the present condition. A co-operative, handling a commodity consumed in the do - mestic market can affect price, but not with full effect with a surplus product. Even if it were possible to herd all of the skeptical, refractory, and the obtuse, among six million farmers into one great wheat, corn, cotton, swine, or cattle co-operative, and it is utterly impossible to do this in time to do any good, still that great co-operative could produce but little effect on the terminal price of an export crop unless it had precisely the facilities and powers conferred on the proposed corpor - ation by this bill. It could not do so because it would not be able to address the cause. The cause is the surplus, the distressed world, and the tariff. Ii is an extraneous thing. It cannot be reached by effort here less than the segregation of the surplus from the domestic market. The bill did not oppose co-operation; it fostered, encouraged, and made co-operation possible. It interefered not at all with the benefits derived from co-operation. By just so much as the co-operatives could secure more equitable grading, reduce the cost of domestic distribution, shorten the road from farm to market, can they save for the producer portions of the difference between farm price and terminal price. But without such a bill such is the limit of their power. They can do the things above mentioned, bill or no bill.

Value of Diversified Farming. Here and there appears an individual who has a remedy for the present situation by claiming that "diversified farming will cure these ills." Our trouble is the surplus product and it applies not to wheat alone, tcorn alone, or cotton alone, but to any and all. There are vast as available only for wheat farming. It is a Barmecide feast to ffer the farmers of these areas "diversified farming." Diversified farming means, "Raise more cattle, corn, swine, eggs, poultry and butter fat." The consumptive capacity of the country for these things is not cosmic. It is being supplied now. Some astute observers believe that a crisis is not far off in each of these products. It is already upon the producers of corn, cattle and swine. If the 20% of the wheat acreage could and would turn to these other products, what would happen? . We should have precisely the same situation with the other products that we now have with wheat. To the extent that the market demands a product at a profitable price, natural laws will supply that product. The moment we produce in excess of the normal demand fox that product we destroy the profit thereof. There is no profit in any of the commodities suggested for £reased production by the advocates of diversification which indicates it the total supply on the domestic market should be much increased. It could not be increased without destroying profit. Therefore con - version from one to another of these crops will result merely in a shift - ing of the field of loss and distress. There is much murky thinking on this subject and to say that diversification offers the slightest help to this grievous situation ad - dressed by the McNary-Haugen bill is either insane or immoral depend - ing on the information of the person saying it. Diversification is a wise council for the individual. It is simply the old admonition about putting all eggs in one basket. But it is nothing more and it has no application whatever to the basic economic problems addressed by this Do We Need More Credit? One more panacea for this present situation, "We will cure the ills by lending the farmer money." All the projects to finance the stricken agricultural districts cannot cure the farmers' ills. He owes too much to the rural banks, suppliers, </seg>
            <seg id="p227">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 229 and for taxes to his state and county. What will it advantage him to change his creditors and extend his time when he sees no profit out of which to pay and no future save a deeper debt? What the farmer must have is an equalized price for his product, not a change in the person of his creditor. All this is obvious. What is the purpose of the suggestion? It can hardly be other than an attempt to still his clamor by a deferment of his most persistent present annoyance — and a mortgaging of the future. The only help that can be held out in this project is that he can stay on his land hoping for some change for the better. But, if the only possible solution of his problem is elimination of the surplus, and the only methods of elimination are starvation of this acreage or segregation of surplus, how does it help the case to lend money to perpetuate the acreage? It does not and cannot do so. The argument that he can stay, diversifiy, and live, has been shown to be unsound. Whether so intended or not, the project to extend credit is only a camouflage to soften his political protest. It is no remedy be - cause, far from eradicating the cause of the difficulty, it simply aggra - vates and prolongs it. Reduction of Farmers' Expenses. Again we hear the opposition demanding for "decrease of expense and cost — not increase in price being the remedy. The farmer must get back to the sturdy self-denying existence of his grandfather. Let him give up his movies, automobiles, radios, phonographs, electric lights, and other fancy contrivances. He can live." Good logic — we say — from the standpoint of the one who is against allowing the farmer as square a deal as he is demanding for himself. The world moves on. The farmer has not nearly so many of the conveniences of modern living as the common laborer, the clerk, or the city dweller in any walk of life. He has some and of course he has more than his grandfather. But, we shall have no more luck in cre - ating a peasant class on our farms that we had in creating submerged class in our labor. The benefits of the industrial age in America are very great and we have preserved them by the tariff, restrictions of immigration, and other "legislative enactments." Restoration of fair exchange value to tMfe farmer will not do one iota of harm to any other class in the country. It will do great good to all. It will re - store to the market a great block of buyers who have long been out of it — purchasers of all these things which go to make life convenient and progressively easier. This will give increased employment and profit to every class and improve the general prosperity. Frugality in the farmer is necessary and desirable. Denial to the </seg>

Natural Economic Tendencies Will Correct. (Everyone is willing to admit that the present situation is bad, but sy also say, "Let it alone. It will cure itself." Now this is the inchester doctrine of let it alone. It is sound in its economics. The uation will cure itself by the immutable law of compensation. "Let alone does not, however, follow as a conclusion. Smallpox becomes iocuous to a race if left alone. That is no argument against vac - lation. Let us see how the situation could be cured or cure itself. kit is due to a combination of two causes: The tariff, raising Amer - price level above the world price level on all the farmer buys, the lus, importing the world price level into America for the farmer e on every crop producing a surplus. Therefore, the cures are these: 1st — Free trade — give the farmer world prices for what ha buys as well as for what he sells. 2nd — Curing the demoralization of the world and thus raising world prices to the American plane. 3rd — Elimination of surplus by (a) Its destruction as such (b) Its consumption at home by a 20% increase in pop- ulation. (c) Its avoidance by abandonment of acreage. (d) Its segregation as proposed by the McNary-Haugen bill. There are no other ways save these or the combination of two or more of them. Free trade may be dismissed. No matter how ardent theoretical free-trader might be, he would not, being an equally ardent American, favor a sudden throwing down of the dykes and letting in n our guarded domestic structure the existing depression of the world n phaos — an influx of goods representing the hollow-eyed labor of gaunt T.urope, entailing the sudden destruction of American living standards. le would not — at this perilous juncture — toss away, for a beautiful heory, the relatively happy state of our whote people. Even the &gt;ankrupt farmer — his home threatened and the savings of his life al - eady absorbed — does not ask this. LThe most bloodless Manchesterian would not counsel the farmer wait until the world is restored to something approaching normal prosperity. The causes of its depression are too deep — too menacing of further depression. We need not consider as a counsel of value, </seg>
            <seg id="p229">REPORT OF XEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICT'LTl'RK 231 the voice that tells the farmer, "Wait till the world is restored to pre - war prosperity." Nor would anyone dare suggest that we bum our surplus or sink it in the seas — not in the presence of the hungry mouths that wail across the world. We are hardly ready to espouse such sabotage on a scale so vast. It is quite true that the time is well within sight when v\-e shall consume our entire farm surplus at home. At the present rate of in - crease of population, decreased fertility, soil erosion, and considering the fact that we are already near the limit of practicable productive acreage, that time is perhaps not more than fifteen years in the future. But they would be Job's comforters who would sit down at the farmer's barren board and attempt to console him with the thought that all will be well in fifteen years. Now the "let-it-alone's" mean that the situation will cure itself much quicker than in any way yet discussed, by the abandonment of, for example, some 20% of our wheat acreage. It is a pretty theory. It will take, say, five years of continued depression to beat down the sturdy resistance and the grim struggle of owners and tenants of the wheat and corn lands to preserve their homes and the remnants of their fortunes. In five years perhaps, only 80% of the fittest will have survived and the surplus will have been starved out. The "fittest" does not i - efer to the most efficient workers. It refers to the most efficient areas — those nearest to markets. The wrecked homesteads, and deserted villages, the ruined fortunes and the scattered families proposed by the opponents of this bill would not result at once. Five years at least will be required. This breed does not quit in face of adversity. It sticks. Then we shall have to give further years while the indicatoi - needle of domestic demand shivers nervously and begins the upward swing which will restore tenants to those abandoned lands and so on for five years further up to the limit of our productive power when we shall either begin to import these products or widen our own borders. Is this a counsel of sanity? Build up — destroy — build up — in alternating periods of half decades. Is it not better to use an emer - gency measure to preserve ? For what will happen in these five years of destruction ? Are our people a race of yellow-faced economists who will respect this scientific reasoning with stoical indifference be - hind their horn-rimmed glasses? They are not. They are freckle - necked, hairy-chested fighters. Such powerful forces can crush them but not as one could press the life out of a sick kitten. They will press back. There is a social and political bearing in this economic problem. </seg>
            <seg id="p230">232 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE LWe know by repercussion, what 'precisely this situation once did to nation. It brought the bloodiest civil war in the history of the world. Beginning with the South Carolina eruption of nullification, exactly this same subsidy of northern industry, by the tariff, and at the expense of the export — producing agricultural South — this was the economic cause of the Civil War and economic causes are the only real causes of modern war. Would it now result in a red revolt? Per - haps not, simply because it is not sufficiently sectional and more be - cause we have learned the greater effect of more peaceful means. But it will result in something far more objectional than was the McNary- Haugen bill. It is resulting so. We have here an intrinsic inequity — an immoral policy, a great subversive cause bearing bitterly down on one of the sturdiest and most independent se,gments of our population. The tariff has saved us from the present world collapse. The farmer applauds, but says, "Save me too." There is no argument against a bill of this kind which can be said tgo on its merits. There are only grievances. These grievances not for wrongs done or threatened. They are for inequitable privileges, accustomed franchises of subsidy and exploitation, now felt to be threatened. They are simply protests against the cleansing of an unjust condition. They cannot prevail because they have no right to prevail and no man can advocate them without miring himself in a morass of deceits, inconsistencies and evasions. Economics vs. Man Made Laws. "Let it alone" may be the answer to a proposal to interfere with the working, of a natural law. But when natural law has already been interfered with by the interposition of artificial controls, such as the tariff, and those artifices create subsidies, oppression and rank injus - tice, "Let it alone" of the resulting condition is a counsel of dissolution. We can either abolish the old intereference entirely, or we can amend its evil. But we cannot "let it alone." We are dealing with an American public of the twentieth century and not with the European peasant of the eighteenth. Industrial Protection Requires Agricultural Protection. LIf we are to retain the doctrine of protection — and we are — there only one practicable way' to restore justice and that is to segregate s surplus, sell it abroad and re,gulate supply to demand on the do - mestic market. Such was the intent of this bill. Another objection to the bill is: "It is improper that farm prices should be made by the prices of other things. They should be made by cost of production plus profit." Now, the price of every commodity is made by the "price of other </seg>
            <seg id="p231">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 233 things." That is the essence of the law of barter, the law of trade, the law of supply and demand. The price of a thing is merely the measure of its value in terms of the things for which it is exchanged. The proposed McNary-Haugen bill did not make this law. God made it. But as far as export farm products is concerned, man amended the law or at least changed the scene of its operation from Chicago, New York, and New Orleans, to Manchester, Hamburg, Rotterdam, Genoa and Liverpool. The price of every other American commodity is made by the price of "other things" in Manchester, Liverpool, and other foreign markets where their "other things" are on a price level just as much lower than the American level as the war-shattered world outside our three-mile limit is lower than our fenced and guarded condition within. This bill simply brought the outcast farmer home and would have permitted the price of his product to be made by the price of "other things" in America. Still another objection raised in this: "Millers and packers will not manufacture for export if they have to pay a higher price for wheat or swine than their foreign competitors." This is simply a misconception of the bill. Flour or pork for ex - port are as much a part of the exportable surplus of wheat and swine as the raw material. The bill recognized this and provided for it. The corporation would have absorbed the difference between the domestic and the export price of wheat and swine purchased on the domestic market and sold as flour or pork on the markets of the world. Will McNary-Haugen Bill Cause Inflation? One of the most serious objections has been raised as follows: "Participation certificates — script — will increase our circulating media and thus inflate currency." Participation certificates constitute the obligation of the corpor - ation to pay the balance of the amounts withheld by it against loss and expense. As commercial paper it would have increased circulating media to the exact extent that the commercial paper of any corporation does so — less rather than more — because, technically, it is not even "negotiable paper." It is ridiculous — mere childish prattle — to say that it would "inflate the currency." Relatively this issue of com - mercial paper is insignificant compared with the negotiable paper emitted by industrial corporation of like size. I have heard it remarked that while the bill appeared to apply to a variety of products it was really intended to apply only to wheat. The bill applied to no product except when, and as long as, its price falls below the pre-war exchange value. When that happened </seg>
            <seg id="p232">234 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE o a product the bill applied. It would not apply to cotton today be - cause the boll-weavil and a temporary shortage of supply has increased le price. There has been plenty of times in the past when it would lave applied. The lack of such a measure once caused a Civil War. ; is true that the proposed bill would probably never have application o wool because we import wool and can protect that price by tariff, "he assertion that it would not apply to meat products is astounding, ts application was relatively easy and had no effect to put the cor - &gt;oration into the slaughtering and packing business. Its application o corn would have been both direct and indirect through its effect on wine. Some one raised the question that "Foreign nations would con - strue this proposed bill as 'dumping' and would retaliate." Here is another objection which deserves an answer only in defer - nce to the very high authority who voices it. Not one ounce greater urplus would have reached the shores of other lands than is now the ase. Nor would the price abroad been one cent lower. From with - it no one would have been able to know by their own experiences that le bill was a law. It prevented the price of the surplus from depress - ng the price of domestic consumption but it left every foreign nation irecisely where it was before. Foreign nations can hardly retaliate &gt;ecause the American farmer gets an American price for the portion f his crop consumed in America. The objection is without merit. Constitutionality of McNary-Haugen Bill. tLast but not least, when every * objection has been raised to this 1 and none of them stick, along comes the legal mind and says, "It unconstitutional." This is a smoke screen. Exhaustive analysis conducted by legal council of more than one branch or department of the government has not discovered one clause in the bill upon which a substantial claim of unconstitutionality could be based. Their conclusions have been single and emphatic on the constitutionality of the bill. For nearly four years our economic progress has been clogged by he depression of our agriculture. No wide constructive movement in ommerce and industry has been possible againt the resistance of the eaden drag. Each forward acceleration has come to a swift and mys - erious stop before it could fairly enter its stride. Confidence in any iusiness future more remote than a few months has been conspicuous &gt;y its absence. The cause is perfectly obvious. With almost every ther circumstance favorable, it goes without saying, that the integral unit of this nation cannot move forward with its basic segment in a ruinous condition. Through this great gap in our protective barriers we have been invaded by the European malady and our progress has been frustrated. We feel that a bill similar to the McNary-Haugen </seg>
            <seg id="p233">KEPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BO.'RD OF AGRICULTURE 235 bill will cure this fault almost instantly. Not only will it bring the agricultural segment of our structure promptly abreast of our industry, it will preserve and keep it there. Never again — if, during the period covered by a bill of this kind, the farmers' co-operatives should per - fect their own marketing mechanism — need we apprehend a shattering of our economic balance in this grave regard. Fundamental prices will forever fluctuate but there will be no paralyzing disproportions in these movements. The whole structure will move up and down in harmony and unison. The entire pattern will be stabilized and rendered homogenous. It makes no great difference whether prices be high or low so long as thy are fairly related one to another and such a bill will tend to make and keep them so. Its immediate effect will be to raise the price of wheat nearly one - third and the price of corn and liveptock in somewhat lesser proportion but to equally just relationship. The result in terms of immediate general prosperity need hardly be dwelt upon. 1924 would have been a year of wonders in our economic annals and business could have looked to a sound and equable future with a confidence it has never dared indulge in since the fearful eruption cf 1914. Let us not forget that the farmer is the food-producing machinery of our nation. Let us not forget further that he feels it his moral duty to feed the world. Let us not forget that he cannot manipulate his production to the nicety of the manufacturer as he cannot control the elements and all the ravages that many times overtakes his crops. He is at the mercy of many unforeseen events that may occur be - tween the time he plants his crops and the time of harvesting same. Let us be just a bit more charitable toward him in his trials and tribulations and if we want our business to thrive and prosper bring ourselves to an understanding that he must be furnished with a finan - cial purchasing power equal to the other fellows dollar before he can assist in bringing about a general prosperity in the nation. It is a well established fact that many men in other industries thought their business would thrive and prosper regardless of whether our agricultural industry flourished or not. The present situation is exemplifying to them that they have been laboring under a misappre - hension. Have we not, from a depressed business standpoint endured this condition long enough? With economic principles and economic precedents all shattered in every other channel are you going to handicap your business future by a refusal to the basic industry that has been so far left high and dry </seg>
            <seg id="p234">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 236 without any assistance in this protective legislative program, simply because you say it is wrong in principle? The only principle involved, that I can see, is to make a bill similar tthe McNary-Haugen bill a law, thereby closing the one breach now n in our already protective program. Agriculture is not asking anything peculiar to itself — it is simply asking for the same kind of treatment that has been accorded all other lines of industries— a square deal if you please. PRESIDENT DANLY: I am sure we all agree with the affirm - ative of this question and there is no doubt in anybody's mind now that the affirmative is going to win this debate. Of course we may change our minds when we hear the negative, which we will now proced to do. The first speaker on the negative is Mr. Arthur Medlar, of the Rural Economics Department of the University of Nebraska, whom I take pleasure now in introducing. ARTHUR MEDLAR College of Agriculture, First Speaker for Negative Mr. Chairman, and friends of the Crop Growers' Association: Everybody ought to agree with the affirmative; they have presented both sides, and there is no reason why we should not agree with them. I am glad to have the question spread out before us in a way that we may see it after discussion. In taking the negative side I want to bring out the factors that must enter into such a bill and then see if they are economically sound. QUESTION: Resolved that Congress at its next session should pass the McNary-Haugen bill or some similar meas- ure. It is quite evident to farmers and economists alike that a restoration of the prewar relation between farm products and other products would relieve the agricultural distress. No one can follow the path of the calamity just past and think otherwise. No class of people comprised of thinking- individuals can feel justice or long maintain their self respect when they see other classes turning their labor into more dol - lars — the measure of standard of living — than they themselves receive. It is to remedy this condition and aid in maintaining a contented agri - cultural class that those of the affirmative are presenting this question. It is for us of the negative to point out the fallacies of the proposed scheme and to show how the problem cannot be selved by legislative measures. Legislative Measure Must Have These Features. The proposed bill whether it be the McNary-Haugen bill or one </seg>
            <seg id="p235">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 237 similar must carry four distinct features. Each of these is essential to the success of the measure. 1. A determining of the price of all agricultural commodities in - cluded in the guarantee. This calculation must be done by a disinter - ested, fair-minded commission, in all probability a government-appoint - ed body. 2. The government or some body supervised by it must offer to buy all the exportable surplus of commodities in the bill. 3. The surplus must be sold in the world market and a separate home market must be maintained. 4. A tariff must be enacted in order that none of the products can be returned by speculators who would profit thru market manipu - lations. Of these four principles the first is the simplest in application. We may find the relation of the value of farm product to the value of all commodities in pre-war times thru statistics carefully compiled by various branches of the government. Next we may find the position of all commodities for the current time. By substituting ratios and solving the desired or required price may be found for any farm pro - duct. Suppose we let "m" be the pre-war price in percentage of a certain farm product, "n" the pre-war price of all commodities, "p" their price now and "x" the required price of a farm product now. If eggs were 20 cents per dozen before the war, say in 1913, and the commodity price is now 164 and 100 in 1913. Then to find the price of eggs use the formula n:p::m:x or 100:164: :20:x. Solving the equa - tion gives 32.8 cents or what eggs should now bring per dozen. The great difficulty with this theory is that all farm products were not on an equality in 1913. In fact over a period which has been proposed by advocates of this bill w4ieat has had a decided advantage over other cereals and cattle over other meat producing animals. It seems then that our opponents would favor giving wheat farmers and beef pro - ducers an undue advantage over other agricultural producers. Can we call this justice? Is there a demand for all corn farmers to pay tribute to wheat farmers? Should producers of pork surrender the advantage they have recently gained to feeders of cattle ? Let us not be too certain that we are solving an economic ill when we appease the cry of a producer who is now suffering a calamity brought on by the action of his class. Legislation Would Cause Over Production. In the second place the government or some government-supported agency by the purchase of products written into the guarantee would force all those prices up to their pre-war base. If others chose to pay more there could be no action by the government. This merely means </seg>
            <seg id="p236">238 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE that producers would be assured of a certain price and yet no attempt would be made to take away any profit when the law of supply and demand raised the price of the product above the established base. So long as men are human this feature presents an impossibility. Over - production of certain products would be bound to follow and the bur - den would later be borne either by them or the tax paying body of our Law of Supply and Demand Must Rule. tThe third principle necessitates dumping. It may be possible for monopoly or a near-monopoly to dump with profit but agricultural oducts which are produced the world over do not yield to such a actice. As old as history itself is the story of such failures. Eng - id with her sheep and wool, India with her calico, Brazil with her Tee and beef besides many of the ancient nation have at one time or other demonstrated that in the end the law of supply and demand s balanced production of all workers including the farmer. What About the Tariff? Finally we reach the tariff question. Many maintain that the ariff on manufactured goods has been beneficial to all citizens of the ation. Without doubt agriculture has been more rapidly developed, ransportation hastened and world markets opened because of a tariff n manufactured goods. There now arises the question of whether a part of our notion is not paying too heavy a tribute to the manufac - urers and the time may be near at hand when there must be a re - djustment. The tariff on farm products would have to be sufficiently ligh to prevent speculators from buying them on a glutted world mar - cet and bringing them back to our own market. These tariffs would need to be revised every time the price of a commodity changed. At &gt;resent it is proposed to make the prices monthly. Summary of objections to Bill. Briefly stated the main objections to the passage of such a bill are: tl. It is uneconomic. We measure off a little line on the great irve of supply and demand and then say let this be our standard for 1 time. The proposal is preposterous. 2. It is class legislation. Not only do we attempt to set the farm - er off by himself but we unwittingly perhaps array one farmer against his brother. And we further penalize the producer among the farmer class who was unfortunate enough to be in financial despair during the period which we now choose as a standard. Does this meet the ap - proval of fair minded men? 3. It injects government into business. To most minds this is the most inefficient way of doing business. We gladly submit to govern- </seg>
            <seg id="p237">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AORICl'LTI'KK 239 merit direction and inspection but few even among farmers are ready to concede that the government as a business manager is a success. 4. It requires dumping. For years the American mind has op - posed this practice and nations have prevented dumping whenever it interferred with their production and have retaliated against nations which insisted on using their markets as a dumping ground. 5. It has been tried by political factions and by entire nations ana never with success. History fails to record even a single instance where artificial or legislative measures have cured permanently an economic evil. It is true that success may follow for a short time or to a limited degree but economic evils must be finally controlled by economic laws. 6. It is bound to become a boomerang both politically and finan - cially. No nation can long exist in its fullest efficiency if divided into classes which legislate against each other and seek by various devices to extract an undue return from others. Financially it would encourage the producer to create mere goods which could be sold at a given pi ice but the producer would e\entually bear the loss directly or indirectly. In the due course of time a settlement would have to be made that would leave the producer in a worse state than at the begin - ning. 7. It pumps from the same pool into which it pours. It is only an apparent solution of a problem which might be solved if special privileges were taken from all those who now enjoy them and all men given the same opportunity, legislatively speaking. 8. Prices are based upon an average made by the unhampered action oi supply and demand but new prices are to be paid upon the base not the result of this law. In other words we assume that at one time all were in their proper relation but now we are out of step. We forgot that some other producer was probably suffering while we 9. There would be a heavy drain on the National treasury because of cost in supervision, financing, storing and possibly transportation. 10. It would be practically impossible to distribute the loss and would create a swift script which would likely be used as a medium of exchange. This would doubtless tend to cause inflation, damaging the class for whose benefit it was calculated. 11. The advance in the price of farm products would increase the cost of living to other workers. If their standard of living were maintained their wages would have to be increased and this increase would come back to the farmer in goods which he purchased. His financial position would doubtless be weakened by this process. </seg>
            <seg id="p238">240 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tl2. There is a question whether such an act would be constitu - il. That point need not be discussed here but it must not be ected while considering this important question as to whether station favorable to one group should be passed. PRESIDENT DANLY: I think perhaps we will all have to admit by this time that there are two sides to this question. The other speaker on the negative was to be Mr. E. M. Pollard, but we learned at the last minute that Mr. Pollard was ill and could not appear, and we are very fortunate in being able to secure a very good man in his place a man who knows agriculture and knows the farmers' problems and can speak on this subject; he needs no introduction to you. He did not know anything about this debate until about ten minutes before we began. I take great pleasure in introducing Mr. C. H. Gustafson. C. H. GUSTAFSON, SECOND SPEAKER FOR NEGATIVE Mr. Chairman and friends: I knew nothing about taking any part in this debate until coming into this room, therefore I am not as well prepared as I would like to be, but shall try to make a few remarks on this subject which is of great importance to the farmer at this time. Three years ago, during President Harding's Agricultural Conference, Mr. George Peek of Malin, Illinois, proposed this idea, now embodied in the McNary-Haugen Bill. I was a member of the Committee before which this subject was presented and we discussed it at length, but did not endorse it. Mr. Peek finally succeeded in getting Congress to take notice of this plan. You know very well how popular this subject has been during the past year, and how many meetings and conferences have been held, and how it was nearly passed by Congress. I am convinced that there is no question but that the farmer is in dire need of improvement along the lines of marketing. I have added my little mite in helping to improve our Marketing System; but I want to say to you folks that I have not changed my mind during these years and I still maintain that the only safe and practicable way for the farmers to gain any advantage or lasting benefit is for them to stick to the idea of self-help and true co-operative marketing, and not get mixed up with the government or anybody else. I have always held that that is the soundest proposition ever offered to the farmers, and I still hold that it is. Too Much Government Involved. LI object to the provisions of the McNary-Haugen Bill, and all sim - bills, which provide for the government entering into this business or into competition with any citizen or with any class of citizens. I think it is not a good thing. I believe it is impractical and will ulti - mately work out just opposite to what the friends of this proposition are hoping for. My friends on the affirmative of this question main- </seg>
            <seg id="p239">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 241 tain that this legislation is going to give the farmers a better price for their product. If it does that, it will then increase the cost of living. If wheat goes up, flour will go up; if cattle and hogs go up, meat will go up, and so on all along the line. The farmers of this nation are only about one-third of the voting population, and it seems to me, that if we know human nature at all, it is stretching it a long ways when we farmers propose to increase the cost of living for the other two-thirds of the people, and expect them to submit just because we ask them. If in sorce way you could get such legislation, how long do you expect we could maintain such a law in operation? It is abso - lutely unnatural, and I don't see how you could in:agine such a thing would work out. During the war we had price fixing on wheat, and you know that the representatives of the consumers worked day and night to get the price of wheat as low as possible, and we as producers had quite a time to get the price that we finally did fix on wheat. Especially did the representatives of organized labor insist that the price of wheat should be much lower. If they did this during the war when we were all more willing to give and take, what do you expect they would do under normal conditions? It looks ridiculous to me to expect that two-thirds of the people will stand for laws that will increase the price of things they have to buy. In the second place, if this proposition, to have the government do this for the farm - ers, and use the money of the government to increase the price of our produce is just and right, why is not the same thing right for the manufacturer and others? Why shouldn't the laboring man also come in and say, "We are out of work and you have done this favor for the farmer, why not have the government create more work for us so we can get better wages and take our pay out of the government treasury?" To my mind this plan is not sound. I am really surprised that so many of our Congressmen fell in with this idea, but there has been such a great demand for "something for the farmer," and those men are very busy and have so many things to look after that they prob - ably did not take sufficient time to properly inform themselves on the matter but voted for it because someone else did. It is my opinion that if in the future there are any bills similar to this one introduced, they will not get as far as did this one in the last session of Congress. Interferes With Co-operative Marketing. It has been said here that this will in no way interfere with the co-operative marketing plan. I beg to differ with that statement. If we could, for a year or two, make a scheme of this kind work, I am here to say to you, that the farmers would slack up appreciably in their present efforts of working out their own salvation through co-operation. Usually the farmer is not lazy, he works hard; but believe me if he can walk up to the "government crib" and get something for nothing he is going to neglect the truly co-operative marketing plans, the self </seg>
            <seg id="p240">242 REPORT OF XKBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AGRICULTURE help organizations where the farmers put up their own money and efforts in real co-operative business organizations. Co-operative mar - keting, has in years gone by, received many back-sets and met with many reverses, but I am still convinced that self help is the most sub - stantial and the best help for the farmers, and that after all we will get further by that method than by any other scheme. Suppose the McNary-Haugen Bill had passed, and we had such an organization and plenty of the government's money to buy the surplus with and raise ths price of our product, 'Jiat would immediately induce the farmer to produce more of such commodities and that would in turn increase the surplus. What would we do with this increased surplus? It would break down of its own weight The farmers would not wait to see how it would work out because if there was an prospect of increasing the price of wheat they would plant more wheat. The best way to judge the fu - ture is by the past. In 1914 the cotton producers got together pretty well all over the South and decided that they were going to try to curtail production and in that way raise the price of cotton. That is a way to get better prices if the farmers could get together and stick, but they can't. These cotton farmers then said, "We will cut twenty-five per cent on the acreage." Those folks were in a hurry to get away from the meeting and to get home and wake up their families and tell them, "Brown is going to cut down his cotton acreage this year and I guess I will increase mine about ten per cent." The result was an increase in total acreage. If there is any hope that this scheme would work, the production would increase immediately. It is human nature. These unnatural rreans look good on paper, and some folks tell you that they are fine, but to me they are pretty much like the farmer who sheared the hog. He said, "A lot of noise but very little wool." There has been a lot of noise about helping the fanner, and many have been elected to Congress and to public office because of these promises, but the results so far have been "mostly noise and very little wool." It t certainly a selfish and unsound scheme, and from the things we have ird this morning it looks to me as though they were trying to mix :ialism, communism, paternalism and other "ism" into this scheme. I predict that the first tirre that that can get a shaking up, you will witness the worst explosion you ever heard and the results will be a let of disappointed farmers. I don't claim to know all about this plan but I have carefully studied and investigated, for many years, the ques - tion of marketing and I am trying to give you briefly my reasons for relieving that this scheme is not practical and not sound. I think we hould look twice before we go into this thing, I can see no chance of any real or lasting improvement in this plan. Many of my friends are on the other side of this question and have from time to time been asked to support this bill. I have said that if it were not for the two mndred millions of dollars they are asking for I would be willing, if necessary to have Congress pass the bill and see what we could learn iom the experiment. </seg>
            <seg id="p241">REPORT OF XKHKASK.V STATK B&lt;M RI) OF AGRlCl'I.TfltK 243 I agree with the other speakers that the thing that bothers us a great deal is over-production and the surplus, but we can take care of that without having the government do it for us and without asking for special privileges. Suppose we tax ourselves five or six cents a bushel on the wheat and add that fund to the price received for the wheat we export, that would give us a good price for the surplus and after getting- rid of the surplus we could sell the rest at home market prices based on supply and demand, providing we could protect our - selves with a tariff such as other classes of our citizens are protected with. We would not have to borrow anything from the government and would not be placing our marketing problems in hands of politician? or the care of the government. I am opposed to th3 state and the government doing the market - ing for the farmers, because we farmers are only one-third of the pop - ulation and there will be two consumers votes to the producers one. But if you organize yourselves, use your own money, your own brains and your own voting power and work out your own salvation, then you will get some real relief. I just want to leave these two thoughts with you, first under thi - scheme we farmers would place ourselves, as a small minority, into the hands of the big majority for them to do as they please with our mar - keting problems; second, if this scheme were put into operation it would increase production and would ultimately break of its own weight. Schemes of this kind have been tried before but they have not been successful or satisfactory. We have been told that in Australia they have the government mixed up in the marketing of wheat, but is. is not satisfactory, and they want to quit right now but found themselves so badly mixed up that they will have to continue this year, and then they will positively give it up. Can you cite us where any government has been success - ful along these lines? Ic is composed of promises based on nothing substantial and hoping that it will work out all right. I think it will not as I have no good reason t&gt;&gt; believe that it will. PRESIDENT DANLY: Now I am sure we all agree with the negative side of this question and feel that there is no affirmative side. But we will hear from Mr. Steward in a short speech in rebuttal. MR. STEWARD — In Rebuttal. We are not so very far apari after all. We have agreed that it would not be a good thing to pui the government into business, and as a last proposition our opponent has proposed to take care of the surplus by putting on an excise taj which the government will collect and take care of the surplus.

I am wondering, — we hav« asked that the government shall permit the organization of the farm ers Export Corporation or Commission, and what have we done in other </seg>
            <seg id="p242">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 244 lines? The people of this country asked the government, to create a co-operative system known as the Federal Land Banks, and we did this by legislative acts. The government loaned this organization liberally money on which they operate, and this co-operative association has paid back that money and is now acting as a co-operative organiza - tion. Was the government entering business when they loaned this association money with which they could begin business? That is what we are asking them to do; that the money shall be loaned at a reasonable rate of interest paid from the equalization fee. Our oppo - nents tell you that the script would inflate our currency. What is this script? I want to endorse everything that Mr. Gustafson said about co-operative organizations, but the delivery of the receipt which every cotton farmer takes home when he delivers cotton to his associ - ation is of exactly the same class as the equalization certificate that a farmer takes home when he sells his wheat. The advance to a grower on tobacco when it is sold to a co-operative is of exactly the same class, to the extent that it has no tangible value because until the product is sold they have no way of knowing what the return will be on that receipt and it is not inflating the currency. Have the warehouse receipts of the grain corporations inflated the currency? All we are asking the government to do, is to permit us to issue a tter - tificate showing that when the crop is finally sold and we have equal - ized the prices between the surplus and the domestic price. I submit that, in the event we propose to raise the price and over-production takes place, we will pay for the over-production. We have a certain amount of land subject to agricultural production today, and if we shift crops on this land the farmer must bear the burden. I would rather subsidize the farmer of the northwest than encourage him to go into the production of dairy products when I can produce dairy products in a far better way than he can. We are permitting the cheap labor of foreign countries to set the prices of our domestic farm pro - ducts. We may say that the other two-thirds of the population will not permit the farmer to do that, but we have already done it. We have enacted legislation by which the manufacturer can sell his product on the domestic market at a price plus the tariff, and we have submitted to it and endorsed it as an American principle, because we believe that American is living on a little higher plane than the rest of the world. It is not putting the government into business, but only that we are permitting a certain class of our citizenship who have heretofore not had that opportunity, to place themselves upon an equal footing by legislative act with other industries. Our co-operative organizations cannot affect their prices, but can only affect economy and correct abuses in marketing our products, which we all admit exists. Mr. Medlar in Rebuttal. There is little to be said on the negative side of the question by </seg>
            <seg id="p243">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 245 way of rebuttal. The affirmative side has based its claim upon grounds that if tariff is right for one side it is right for all. This may be right but a tariff will not aid a producer of a surplus product. That the farmer has not been receiving his fair share of return since the war we do not deny but claim that so soon as he shall have adjusted his supply to the world demand he will again receive ample compen - sation. We still maintain that two wrongs will never make one right: that the sane remedy would be not to add another favored class but to rectify present evils thru proper channels. Oversupply has always been taken care of by producers. They shift from one product to another trying to regain their losses. The man who used to sell top buggies and self rake reapers does not de - mand that a government should help him make a living selling those implements but casts them aside and sells autos and self binders. Farmers must use the same business judgment. They have in the past and may be depended upon to do the same again. Our opponents demand something which will help the farmer right now. Do they think tariff will save a business ruined by poor judg - ment? Witness the failures of manufacturers of farm implements all of which were on the tariff schedule. Competition wages its ruthless warfare regardless of tariff-protected manufacturers or world-compet - ing farmers. An eminent writer has summed up our case as follows: "As a source of economic fallacies, this failure to see more than the immediate and most obvious side of the problem is probably second in importance only to the demagogue's desire to prey upon the prejudices of people. The obvious side cf the problem, to the proponents, is that prices of farm products are low, and that the adoption of their proposal would cause prices to rise. The unseen or less obvious side is that the adoption of the proposed plan would result in more taxes; higher costs of living; higher prices of commodities the farmer must buy; artificial stimulus of agricultural production; the bringing of poor land into use; class antagonism and the eventual repeal of the law; serious depression and suffering in agriculture following the inevitable removal of the artificial stimulus of a guaranteed price. In short the proposed remedy would be worse than the disease which it is designed to cure." MR. GUSTAFSON: On Rebuttal. In our neighborhood, Saunders county, Nebraska, there lived a farmer who homesteaded there in 1869. I had the opportunity for many years to observe how he managed things. He raised wheat, corn, oats, and clover; he kept cattle, hogs, poultry; he raised his own garden stuff, and fruit; he seldom bought anything on time except land; he waited to buy until he had the money to pay for it, that was the way he conducted his farming business. He lived well, gave his children a fair education; took part in social, re- </seg>

He never dreamed of such a thing as a McNary-Haugen Bill, or anything similar. When he sold his products, he always kept enough over until the next crop to carry things over in case he should have a failure or shortage of any crop. If we farmers today would do more of this kind of manage - ment it would be better for us. One thing I want to criticize this man for: he permitted others to build up a marketing system that was not the best for him or for his children. But if we farmers managed things as this man did we would not find it necessary to ask for so many things at this time. I mention this to illustrate what self-help will do for the farmers. It is a distressing thing to think that we farmers are getting so helpless that we can't help ourselves, but must crawl around on our knee? asking for help and special favors. I beg the farmers to get up ar.d help themselves, organize their own lrarket - ir.g machinery, then we will know how to produce and market to the best advantage and we won't have to beg for any legislation or special privileges such as proposed in the McNary-Haugen Bill or similar measures. C ORN BELT LANDS AS AN* INVESTMENT Frank D. Tomson, Lincoln Mr. Chairman and Members of the Crop Growers Association: Formerly I was Editor of "The Shorthorn in America", and was also with the Breeders Gazette, but I am now with Woods Brothers Corporation in Lincoln. I believe the reason why I am on the program is that our Company has invested pretty heavily in farm lands during the past year and a half, when people were rather inclined to avoid land as ar. investment, and the fact that we have, pretty largely from my own recommendation, purchased something like seven thousand acres of land in Eastern Nebraska and Central Iowa, naturally has attracted somo attention. People naturally want to know why these people, who have several lines of activity, should be so lacking in judgment as to go rat and buy land under present conditions. I am not surprised that The Nebraska Crop Growers Association should take note of this fact and feel that there should be «in investigation of any person or firm who would be so reckless as to invest money in farm land at the present time. Frankly, I am of the opinion that we never have encountered v. better opportunity for investment. We have had some difficulty in the farming business; we have had some difficulty in getting land to make returns, but I want to give you this little word of encouragement that came to me a little while ago. A man wrote me not long ago about his uncle who had unfortunately contracted the seven-year itch, but he was a very energetic sort of a man and he scratched at it so </seg>
            <seg id="p245">KEPORT OF NKBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICl'LTTRK 247 persistently that he scratched it out in three years. Perhaps if we will get after the laml business, for ourselves, with a little bit of energy and patience and confidence, very likely we will get by better than we expected. Need Stability oi Purpose. In all of our various lir.es we are quite inclined to go first from one thing to another ar.d back and forth and do not stay put as we should. They tell a story of the south when there was a great exodus of darkies going to the promised land flowing with milk and honey. They were very busy getting ready to get away. The day came and they were even n-.ore busy getting the people out and getting them started. One darkie stood leaning aeainst the station who didn't seem to be at all conce?ned about the movement to the south, nor about the great possibility offered. The fellow in charge came along and said to him: "Here, Sambo, get on the train, you'll get left"; Sambo answered, "I ain't goin'." "Not going"? "No, sir, I ain't goin' "Why arer't you going"? And Sambo said "Well, I ain'r goin', I'm in Class B." And the man aid "What do you mean by Class B"? "Well sir, I be's here when they go and I be's here when they come; back". We can apply that to investments in land, to the activities in farm - ing'and to the condition of the business we happen to be engaged in. We have money in the activities with which we are identified. We rush nuickly to the right and to the left, go forward and back and become identified with every activity that comes along. Happily there are al - ways some of us agreeable to staying on the job with patient industry and with confidence and hope, we reap a rich reward by so doing. Land Has Always Been Too High There are some men in this audience I dare say who have been in Nebraska, for fifty ov forty or thirty years, and so on. If I were to ask each one of them what the price of land was when he came to Ne - braska, whether it was two dollars, ten dollars, forty dollars, or a hun - dred and fifty dollars, and if I were to again ask them what the current expression was concerning the value of land at that time, they would probably all, without exception, say that land was too high, at two dol - lars an acre, or a hundred and fifty dollars an acre, or whatever it might have been. Loans and Interest Rates Now considering land as an investment, in considering the situation </seg>
            <seg id="p246">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOAHD OF AGRICULTURE 248 as it is, and as it will continue, we ought to strike out of the records the past ten years during which time we had the great advance and the in - evitable decline. It is not fair to take into consideration the past ten years record because we had an abnormal condition that could not be foreseen, could not be forecasted and could not be prevented, but it af - fected the entire world. It was not Nebraska alone nor the United States alone, but the entire world that was affected. But now we are pretty nearly on a plane that savors of normal conditions, and that indi - dates that we can give some consideration to a comparison of conditions formerly and the prospect of the future. The tendency of land is up - ward and has always been upward; the tendency of land will continue to be upward unless we should get some kind of a burdensome unwarranted and ill-advised taxation. Then land probably would not advance to the extent it would otherwise, but the tendency seems to be rather in favor of land advancing. Within the past few days I have obtained from sev - eral of the leading loan people some opinions as to the rate of interest and the demand for loans, both of which have a very definite effect upon land valuation and its tendency. I obtained from the Nebraska Invest - ment Company of Lincoln, a letter, this paragraph of which will interest you: — "The writer has loaned money on farm mortgages in south - eastern Nebraska for almost forty-five years. During twenty - seven years of that time he has had a direct connection with the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company of Newark, N. J., and has had an intimate knowledge of the interest rates on this class of loans during the periods named. Until the year 1900 the normal interest on farm loans in this section ran, with slight upward modifications at times, at 6%. Since that time, except for the temporary advances caused by war conditions, the 6% rate has become to be considered normal and adequate. "For a brief period in 1901 and 1902 the writer loaned on farms in Nebraska at 4%%, which I think was the lowest rate ever made by an investing company on Nebraska lands. Could that rate be now had, it would materially aid in hastening the re - covery from the depression under which our farming industry has been suffering. The gain during the past year has been material, and with normal conditions as to crops and prices for crops, it does not appear probable that anything higher than 5% for investment funds on land mortgages in eastern Nebraska will be quoted. And it is a question in the mind of the writer whether the 5% rate will induce sufficient business to satisfy the demand on the part of the investing companies." In every case where I have had an expression from a loaning com - pany or agency they say the demand for loans is very much less than it has been at this time of year for a number of years. You will be inter- </seg>

            <seg id="p248">250 REPORT OB' NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ested in a statement from the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Com - pany, written by E. B. Stephenson from which I quote as follows: — "Replying to your question as to March 1st loans and ex - tensions. They are being taken care of rapidly and we are anxious to obtain a larger number of applications. "Replying to your question as to the prospective trend of the interest rate. So long as there is a more or less business depression there will be an unhealthful supply of money. This will naturally trend towards a lower interest rate. In my opin - ion, 5% semi-annual interest is about the lowest rate that farm loans can be negotiated. "For a long time it has been my business to observe land conditions in the states of Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, the Dakotas and on south in the middle west to the Texas line. While there have been years of depression and low values for farm pro - ducts, immediately reflected in farm values, yet the general trend in value has been upwards year by year. You will easily recall that during the war our very best bonds, including the Governmen't issue of war bonds, were selling on the market at considerable discount. In all of that time, so far as I am in - formed, we had no farm mortgages that depreciated any per cent. As a proof of the steady, reliable value of land on a rea - sonable basis, the fact that we have not taken over a dollar's worth of property in the past twenty-two years in satisfaction of a mortgage loan, speaks for itself. The regrettable thing as I see it, is that so very many men claim more or less of a divine right to settle all farm problems who know no more about a farm than they can obtain by looking: through the windows of a parlor car." That indicates pretty positively the security of land as an invest ment and as collateral. Another interesting thought in that connection is that in spite' of the situation which we have been through there never was a time, bar - ring this period of inflation, when you could borrow as much money on land as you can today and borrow it as cheaply. I talked with Mr. Mellor, trust officer of the Lincoln Trust Company, and he gave me the interesting information, which was confirmed by Mr. Carlson, that of 350 farm loans they had but one man who was delinquent; and out of some 650 city loans they had twenty delinquent, both of which are exceedingly low. This letter from George J. Adams who is in charge of the Se - curities Department of Woods Brothers Company may interest you: — "Replying to your inquiry as to the local situation in the field of investments, will say that the rates of interest on all </seg>
            <seg id="p249">KErORT OF XKBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRHTI^Tl'RK 251 classes of securities have been declining steadily here for a year past and all indications point to a further decline. The following table will give the average yield at the present time of the different classes of securities handled by us: Security To Yield About Municipal Bonds 4%7r Industrial First Mortgage Bonds 6Vr First Mortgage City Bonds 5Ms% First Mortgage Farm Bonds 5% "The eastern life insurance companies are turning at this time very strongly to city and farm mortgages. The competi - tion among them is so great that interest rates are declining steadily. The funds formerly invested in city and farm mort - gages will, in our judgment, be diverted to agricultural, com - mercial and industrial lines offering larger interest return. All of these lines have been handicapped during the past few years for want of sufficient working capital, but with these funds at their command, this part of the country should enjoy a period of increasing activity and profit. The agricultural situation looks especially hopeful, for cheap money combined with a high price for the products of the farm will certainly stimulate the sale of farm lands." So much for the interest situation and the loaning situation. Farm Lands are Safe Investments. Now as to fai-m loans as an investment, you will recall we have heard a great deal in the last three or four years about our people leav - ing the farms. We hear a great deal about our going to have aban - doned farms by enormous acreages; yet you drive across Nebraska east and west, north and south, without, finding these abandoned farms. If you go into the industrial regions, in Ohio or Michigan, where the farms are not attractive from an operating point of view and where the people have moved off or their sons have gone to town to work in the auto - mobile plants, you will find abandoned farms. But that is a local situation and does not apply to any extent in Nebraska, Kansas and Iowa. We are an agricultural people, with agricultural purposes, with agricultural thoughts and agricultural inclinations, and we will remain that way as long as people live in Nebraska. Why shouldn't it be so? What other business can you think of that offers any steadier and safer and surer line of operation than the business of farming in this agri - cultural country? I don't care whether it is banking, the grocery business, or the shoe business or whatever it may be, it is a business that fluctuates. Colonel Woods used to say that the auctioneer busi - ness was the best business in the world because when everything is high everybody wants to sell and when everything is low everybody has </seg>
            <seg id="p250">252 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE got to sell. Now every fellow thinks when things are high is the time to hang on, and it is equally hard to get them to buy when they are low because they have the assumption that they are going to re - main low for a long time to come. I believe if you men who have been in Nebraska a long time will analyze the situation you will find that we have as fine an opportunity for investment now in farm lands as we have ever had in the state. Nebraska is still a young state, our activities are young, our resources have been scarcely touched; yet we have a development that invites investment, and a prospect that invites location. We have a short railroad haul, near - ness to markets, and about everything you could combine in an agri - cultural country that could inspire investment. A few things possibly can be done to help investments, but as long as we are on earth there will be things to be done to improve a situation. Whenever we get to the point where we do not need to do anything to improve a situation or to improve ourselves, we will be ready to go to the other country. Nebraska has its problems, but they are problems that can be solved. Corn Belt Land Valuable. In the first place we are situated in the corn belt, and the corn belt produces approximately four-fifths or five-sixths of all the corn in the world. Some of you can recall the time when the only corn roduct that came to the table was corn meal in the form of Johnny cakes, mush, canned corn, and old lye hominy. Now there are some - ling like forty or fifty corn products that have become articles of manufacture, for human consumption, and a great deal is being shipped. fe are developing a foreign market to a certain extent and we are making sugar in a very considerable volume. I am told that a refin - ng process has been put into effect by the corn products companies lat will take a low grade sugar made from corn and refine it into a ery fine article comparable to cane or beet sugar, and made at a much Reaper cost than any of the others. This will become a factor in rade and a factor in the value of corn lands. At the present time corn is worth, here on the farms of Nebraska, somewhere around a dollar ten. It is quite likely that we won't be seeing' any cheap corn for a good while to come because of the influence of the increasing amount needed for human consumption. We have lad three years of high priced corn and we have had four years of [uite large crops, above the average yield. The price seems to be well maintained and it is likely it will be maintained on that level for a very considerable time. The effect has been to pay off a lot of interest and to pay off a .good many mortgages and make improvements on ;he farms and to do the other things that we do when prosperous con - ditions exist. </seg>
            <seg id="p251">UEPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 253 Will Farm Land Pay Returns? We bought in Jefferson county, 240 acres for no other purpose than to sell again. We have been operating that at long range with the usual inconveniences, but it has paid interest on the investment, taxes, what help was necessary, and all the charges that should rightfully be made against the proposition and we have made a fine lot of money on it. That does not apply to every farm we are operating, but it does to that one and it is in a region where we do not ordinarily have as large a production as we do in the northeast. I know many farms in this state under practical management which are making similar re - turns. Valuable Corn Land in Compact Area. Another factor that we need to consider is that we have a large body of this good land. If our good land was isolated here, there and yonder, you could not insure as high values as you can in Nebraska and Iowa where the great area of land is good land, and very uniform in character. With the markets of Omaha, Kansas City, Chicago, St. Louis and others, the short and inexpensive haul, the quick movement to market, and the class of people who understand advanced agriculture, people who intend to be farmers for generations to come, I can think of no better place in the world to invest money than in a region like tnat. Waterways Will Aid Agriculture of Midwest. Another fact is the development of the inland waterways. There las been since the war a barge line operated by the War Department as a hold-over from the war. This makes a low rate of freight on water shipments and runs in connection with the railroads. That is, most of the shipments come into some point on the railroads and go onto the barge line and then are discharged. The result was in 1923 a saving of freight to Mississippi Valley shippers of a million dollars because is was shipped part of the way by rail and part way over this one little barge line. In August 1923 this barge line carried thirty-five hundred thousand bushels of wheat, a large amount of which came from Nebraska, and I think the saving was something like thirty thou - sand dollars. Now it appears that the inland rivers can be developed for further freight transportation. There is a bill before Congress for that purpose and the barge lines have been given five million dollars for development. We are likely to have the opening of an inland river service working in connection with the railroad that will not only serve the people on the farms and the shippers in and out, but will serve the railroads as well. The day is at hand when the railroads will need some further facilities for the quick movement of our enormous crops. The question is asked why did the traffic leave the rivers in </seg>
            <seg id="p252">254 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the early days? That is easily explained. When the railroads built across this country toward the Pacific coast the freight traffic as you can understand, was very limited and they wanted to do everything they could to bring the business to their lines. The railroad officers at that time were agreeable to rebating to the large shippers who were using the boats and in that way they took from the river boats the large part of the traffic. Now the situation has changed because the railroads have an immense tonnage and there are seasons when they cannot handle anything like what is offered. Consequently these rail - roads probably will encourage the development of this inland river waterway service. Whenever we get any considerable amount of this service we will place a greater value on every bushel and ton grown, and on every acre of our farm land, the government has already declared the Mississippi river up to St. Louis to be a navigable stream. It may be news to some of you that boats of traffic used to come far Jip the Missouri River. That is rather interesting when we don't think of the Missouri River any more as being available for traffic at all. Legislation May Stabilize Agriculture. There is another thing that probably will come about. I shall touch on it very briefly because there is a difference of opinion as to how it should be applied, and whether it shall be applied, but it comes from a recognition of the fact that agriculture needs to be safe-guarded, that it is fundamental and we must provide a degree of equity as be - tween the business of agriculture and other lines of business.. The proposition is whether legislation can be provided that will tend to stabilize prices. A great many think it cannot be done, that you can - not legislate values, and maybe they are right. But we have to recog - nize some things as they exist. We have to recognize that the pro - tective tariff extends certain things for certain manufacturing interests; that the law known as the Adamson law has taken care of the labor interests to a very considerable extent; we must recognize that the Esch-Cummins law has been of value to the railroads, and the conten - tion of a very large school is that all that needs to be done is to give to agriculture similar advantages along with tha other interests; to place that on the same level and let them proceed rather than to keep any one, railroads, labor .manufacturing interest, or anything else at any disadvantage. I have an impression that out of this discussion, — out of this general interest all over the United States — we will ac - complish something thoroughly good, and achieve some constructive thing which will tend to stabilize the business of agriculture and place it along with all the other interest which we desire to see fostered. What Is Land Worth? When land prices were pretty high you often heard the expression "how can a farm be worth three hundred dollars an acre, tell me that?" </seg>
            <seg id="p253">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BO.'ED OF AGRKTI/rrRK 255 This man was probably a banker or a merchant, and he would discuss this in a clear and argumentative way. But this man will probably have a home in the city in which he has something like twenty thou - sand dollars tied up and the only thing that happens to that home is that he lives in it. It means a great expense for him every year and is the source of outlay continually, but he thinks nothing of that be - cause it is his home. We feel in the city that every man must have a home, and if he had a good home we speak of his forehandedness and think he is a citizen of some account. And, my friends, it seems to me that we have just as much right to consider the home on the farm as we have to consider the home in the city. It enters into the value of your farm as much as its producing value, and we must take that into account. All Farm Land Not Mortgaged We bought 5,000 acres in one community in central Iowa. Natural - ly the people around said, "these people want more land and we will sell off our land." What has impressed me through all this has been 1 he. level of the prices that these people ask for their farms, and the large number of them that had not a dollar against them. We say everyone is broke over in Iowa, and yet here were those letters every day wanting to sell farms and quoting a price of $350 probably and rarely below $200. I think, as compared with Iowa, Nebraska is in an infinitely better condition than she thinks she is, and also believe that Iowa is in a much better condition than she thinks she is. We have in Nebraska a greater production of alfalfa and in increased pro - duction of sweet clover which is a quick soil rejuvenator. We have Sudan grass which furnishes an abundance of forage. We have a large number of crops here that do not grow so luxuriantly east of the river, which is to our advantage. There are many people living on the farms today who have no other thought than remaining on the farm. And there are coming back from these institutions of curs considerable numbers of boys and girls trained in agriculture and home economics whose joy will be to go back to the farms and spend their lives there, and their children will do the same thing. That is true all through the agricultural country of the United States which being the case you can bank on it that thr agricultural business and lands uced for agricultural purposes are go - ing to move onto higher levels rather than to decline. It is easy to tee that things are going to take a turn; there is nothing easier to see than that. I heard this story told the other day. There was an animal con - vention presided ever by Mr. Fox. All the animals seemed to be assembled, but the last one to come in was the skunk, who took a seat beside the bear. The bear looked Ground and sized him up and slipped </seg>
            <seg id="p254">256 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE off the seat and went out the door; one after another the other animals looked around and saw what was sitting: on the seat and slipped ' out the door. Finally every animal was gone except the skunk and the fox, who was presiding, and the fox said "I think we might as well adjourn," and the skunk said "I do not know what I have done that caused everybody to leave the room?" The fox replied, "it is not what you have done but what they are afraid you are going to do." That applies to the pessimist; it is not what he has done but what his everlasting talk will do to the business that the people resent. Have Many Undeveloped Resources. I think we have only begun throughout the corn belt in the develop - ent of our resources. I have an impression that we will make strides agriculture, crop production, marketing and every phase of the in - ustry that we have never dreamed of, and instead of assuming that e are on the decline and discouraged, I think we are at the threshold a very, very great and continuous incline. Our people have bought and from the speculators' point of view, and one interesting thing )out it is that we have been able to buy land with nothing against it leaper than we could buy land that was heavily mortgaged. We have &gt;ought it from people who from various reasons needed to leave the arms, and we bought it for no other purpose than to, get the benefit : the rise which will come to that land. I am willing to make this rediction, that if we hold this land for five years we will realize 100% dvance on every acre of land we have bought. I believe that is pretty Fig. 2 — More than 85 per cent of the corn crop is fed to livestock. Hogs con - sume more than 50 per cent of this crop thereby adding; value to corn belt lands. </seg>
            <seg id="p255">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 257 generally true with the people who have invested in land at this time. I do not know of any reason why the time may not come when our good corn belt farms will have a value of $300 per acre; I don't know of any reason why the best farms should not reap a value of $400 an acre. I know there are those who say we will see the corn belt land in time reach a value of $1,000 per acre. In the mountain country on the west slopes we have many orchards where the values are held at one to three thousand dollars per acre and they exchange on that basis, and yet in eastern Nebraska we have orchard possibilities com - parable with the best on the western coast anywhere. I believe we are just as certain to have advanced values now as we were when the old settlers came here and land was worth from two to five dollars an acre, and so on up. I would rather invest in Nebraska land today at two hundred dollars per acre than in those old days at five to ten dollars per acre, because we are getting more for our money today than we got in those early days. I thank you. PRESIDENT DANLY: I am sure we have all enjoyed very much this talk on Nebraska farm lands . I imagine there are a great many people here who would like to ask Mr. Tomson questions, but are afraid to speak up. If you wish to ask anything about what he has said now is the time to speak up. MR. ROGERS. I would like to ask how he values farm lands MR. TOMSON: That is an interesting question. I would say pretty largely by comparison, the question of production entering into it to some extent, location being another feature, possible selling value an - other, and neighborhood another. You will find a good many things that have a relation to the value of the land. I believe we are going to be more discriminating in the purchase of land in the future than we have been in the past. We will look more to the intrinsic value and the way it has been managed, and that will help to determine the value. There is no absolute basis for fixing the value of land. QUESTION: Would you consider a transportation outlet any con - sideration ? MR. TOMSON: Yes, quite important. Transportation costs are so heavy that when you start something from there to the market you have absorbed something of its value before it gets to the market. And that is our advantage here, that we are close to the market. QUESTION: What percentage would you place upon neighborhood or community conditions? I ask this for the purpose of getting at the real per cent of value to be placed upon that. MR. TOMSON: I would not think of it myself in percentages, but if I were looking for land to sell again and could get it in a prosperous </seg>
            <seg id="p256">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 258 German community or in the heart of a Bohemian community, I would pay a premium for land there. QUESTION: How about consolidated schools? MR. TOMSON: I can tell you we have a good deal of an invest - ment in school buildings, and maybe it is in the line of progress, but it certainly affected the land situation considerably. In some places they have built consolidated schools in which the consolidated tax is not excessive, but in many places it is excessive. There is another factor that I did not mention that enters into the attitude toward land. Did you ever notice that if you come up to the city and mention something about farm problems to almost any man he says "I grew up on the farm and there is no phase of farming I don't understand?" You casually ask him later when he left the farm and he will probably say he was thirteen years old when he left. But city men all have some connection with the farm and all have a hank - ering to go back to the farm. Around the big cities we have some of the most interesting evidences of elaborate improvements on the farms and these are put on to satisfy the craving to go back to the farm. That merely reveals that the thought of the American folks is to get back to the land. PRESIDENT DANLY: Our program shows a discussion on this subject by Mr. P. L. Gaddis. Mr. Gaddis is pretty well known to this audience and needs no introduction; we will hear from P. L. Gaddis. DISCUSSION P. L. Gaddis, Lincoln Last summer Dr. David Friday, former President of the Michigan Agricultural College, delivered an address in which he sounded a very rmistic note on agricultural conditions in general. He thinks we making "the last turn to the right," as he calls it, "out of the slough of despond on to the high road of prosperity." He proposes to back this up with history. In order to better bring out his ideas and present some of my own, I have prepared a chart for which he is not responsible, which shows the trend of population in the United States, the relative prices of farm products and the direction of land values from 1850 to date. </seg>
            <seg id="p257">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 259 From the chart you will see that the population of the United States in 1850 was about twenty-three millions; by 1865 it had reached thirty-five millions; and in 1880 about fifty millions, and we kept on growing until we got up around one hundred and five millions when we lost count. History of Farm Products' Value The price of farm products is expressed on the chart in percentage of 1920 values. In 1850 the price of farm products was a little under forty per cent of the 1920 prices, and it remained much the same for ten years. In 1861 the Civil War broke out and the next four years were given over to destruction and consumption rather than to produc - tion. Consequently food became scarce and prices advanced until dur - ing the last year of the war they were approximately eighty per cent of the 1920 values. This was followed by the same kind of a depres - sion that we have been experiencing since the World War. The 70's were bad years for the farmers. If you have any doubt of it ask an "old timer" who was farming at that time. It was not until 1879 that Nature gave them a little relief, at least in America. The cause of this was a very bad summer in Europe. It was very cold and men were wearing their overcoats on the streets of London in June and July. They did not get enough warm weather to make a good crop, </seg>
            <seg id="p258">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 260 a food shortage followed and we got good prices for a good crop in this country. In 1880 the world crop was better but the carry over was small and prices did not suffer much decline. The scarcity con - tinued for two or three years but could not go on indefinitely because we were developing a new country and millions of acres of productive corn belt land were being brought under cultivation yearly. In the decade of the 70's the number of farms increased about one million and with the production of food supplies increasing relatively much faster than the population, prices went down steadily until about 1896 when wheat reached the lowest price level since the Civil War. In Septem - ber of that year wheat sold in Chicago for less than sixty cents a bushel. It is hard to say what would have happened to the farmers had not Nature again saved them. This time there was a short crop in India and a drouth in France — the shortest crop in ten years. The price of wheat had recovered considerably by December and it con - tinued on up. The strange thing is that the upward trend continued for more than twenty years. Doubtless the money market had some - thing to do with this but the steady rise seems also to have been due in part to the fact that the population was finally keeping pace with production, that the cities were beginning to balance the farms. Then in 1914 the war broke out and in less than three years we were in the struggle with the rest of the world. With more men under arms than the world had ever seen thus engaged before it was natural that de - mand should increase, production decrease, and prices go "skyrocket - ing". The rest of the story we all know well. We reached the peak about 1920 and then came deflation. 1921 was the "morning after" for the farmer. Everything went to pieces. Corn sold in some localities for less than twenty cents. Cattle and hogs sought lower levels. Men who had stocked their ranches with high priced cattle on borrowed money during the inflation period found their increase and a year or two of feed and labor swept away, and in many cases there was a deficit besides. Banks found their cattle paper badly lacking in security and in not a few cases had to force liquidation. Only within recent months have prices again sought appreciably ligher levels. The 1923 crop of both corn and wheat was short and he 1924 corn crop was the poorest in years in some of the principal corn producing states. It seems that Nature had a third time within the period of our chart come to the rescue of the farmer. It may seem strange to say that a poor crop or two saves the farmer but that proves to be almost the case. The smaller crop with the resulting shortage of food is often worth more than a larger crop would be and he larger crops following a deficiency may be life savers for those who have weathered the storm. Upward Trend of Land Price. Meanwhile what had land been doing? We have it on the chart </seg>
            <seg id="p259">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 261 starting in at about $11 or $12 per acre in 1850 as an average for the improved lands of the United States, and gradually increasing in spite of the falling price of farm products. Working up very gradually, it reached $20 per acre in 1885, and $21 or $22 in 1890. Then we had a short depression and the price of land declined slightly until 1900. Probably as a result of the upward trend of the prices of farm products beginning in 1896, land began to advance after 1900 and like the price of products continued to rise for many years, until it was commonly said that one never lost money on land. If he bought it a little too high all he had to do was to hold it until the advance again gave him a margin. The sensational rise of 100 per cent in land values from 1900 to 1910, however, was as nothing, compared with the ultra-sensational in - crease during the years of 1918 to 1920. In the latter year land values reached an average of nearly 70 dollars an acre in the United States. Then for the first time in a half century the price of land tumbled. Men who were in position to do so in most cases held their land, but many have not been able. Forced sales have resulted which in many cases have carried prices of barely a half of the 1920 valuations. In some of the foreign communities where less land changed hands at fancy prices and in parts where the inflation was less pronounced, the depression has been less severe. Not infrequently when men able to buy have competed for desirable land, prices are noted that almost compare with peak values. A man has a precedent for paying almost any price he wishes. In fact land prices are chaotic. In the same locality similar land may sell at widely varying prices. But in gen - eral land prices are sharply lower than five years ago, perhaps on the average, two-thirds of the 1920 price. Low Value Dollar Causes Hardships. With the water squeezed out of both land and farm products, con - ditions would seem fairly well adjusted were it not for the prices the farmer has to pay for what he buys and his heavy toll of interest and taxes to meet obligations contracted when money was cheap. The cost of living along with city wages has not been deflated and farm labor only partially. There has been considerable talk, though nof so much recently, about holding up all prices to the war standard until liquidation of wartime debts is complete. This is easy to talk about but hard to accomplish. We have not in the past been able long to withstand the law of supply and demand. The farmer cannot control the amount of his output. When a surplus exists, we talk legislation and organization to hold up prices, but before a country of our size can legislate or a group of the nature and proportions of the farming interests can get sufficiently organized, conditions change, farmers cut down production because of necessity or a shortage of crops occurs </seg>
            <seg id="p260">262 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE somewhere — Nature comes to the rescue — legislation "dies a horning" and farmers lose interest in co-operating with their neighbors. It seems that legislation should be relied upon only to establish equal opportunity for all. Co-operation to be successful requires long edu - cation. This education should start a generation or two before results are expected. What Does the Future Hold for the Farmer? But what of the future, is the question most common today. On - lat we can only speculate. Barring war or other general calamity we lall expect a gradual increase in population with a continually greater emand for food. Our cities are growing rapidly in size, we had about orty-five millions in the cities in 1900 and that has increased to eighty lillions in 1920 and probably will be not less than ninety millions in. 1930. 'his makes the more distant future look favorable for the farmer as e imagine a time when he can set his own price on his products. The mmediate future is not so promising. Although the next year or so romises well because of the general shortage of crops the past season r two, we are still very liable to fluctuations in prices with periods of epression occasionally that are ruinous to men with heavy obligations. If we should draw a line from the 1880 price of farm products to the present price it runs almost paralell to the line of average prices from 1900 to 1913. If it is projected into the future it reaches 1920 prices in twenty-five or thirty years. Possibly this should be a curved line bending upward, but there are so many unknown factors affecting prices that any estimates is little more than a guess that far into the future. Sufficient to say that "getting back to normal" is not return - ing to 1919 or 1920 prices but rather to 1916 or 1917 prices with many years to wait for average "peak prices" for products. Now what of the future of land values? There again it is hard to say. Let us suppose that the decrease in land values from 1890 to 1900 was unnatural and we draw a line from 1890 to 1913 and pro - duce it into the future. It indicates a return to boom prices in about 30 years. It may be that a shortage of food will come more quickly than we think and the pick-up be accordingly more rapid. At any rate the trend of the future is upward and the man who wishes a stable in - vestment at a low rate of interest that will grow in value should not overlook an investment in cornbelt land. He should not go in too deep expecting the land to pay taxes and current rates of interest. Things to Consider in Buying Land. To come to a little more practical side of it, in buying farm land what things must a man consider? We have talked mostly about the speculative value of land but we must take into consideration other factors. Of course the man buying only for speculation will look at </seg>
            <seg id="p261">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 263 the speculative value first; but for a farmer, production is the largest factor in land value. If a farm does not produce regularly and well it is not a very practical farm for a man of limited means. In 1900 farm land was $20 an acre and in 1910 it was $40; the man who bought a farm doubled his money in ten years. We cannot expect to do that any more. Perhaps it may be done in special cases where a man can buy at a low price at forced sale. Usually it pays to buy the best. If a man has a farm that will wash away, or that is sandy and will blow seriously, he has rather a critical investment, but if he has smooth land and rich soil, he has something that has a steady value. Some - body of course has to own the poor land, but the man should own the poor land who has not much to invest and who lives on the land and by using the proper methods can improve it. The second factor to consider in buying a farm is its general de - sirability. This will include the distance from market, its adaptability for the type of farming a man prefers and its suitability as a home. Not a few mistakes are made in buying land. In the first place, it is a serious error not to consider climate in buying a farm in Nebraska. I don't know how many times I have examined land in the western part of the state and the man would tell me how much he paid for his farm and he would say, "I used to own some land back East but this land looked to me like just as good land at half the price." Perhaps he paid entirely too big a price for it, not realizing that his climate had changed and though the quality was in the soil the rainfall was not sufficient to produce good crops many years. I have used this rule sometimes: Starting in eastern Nebraska just west of the Missouri river bluffs at the place where the upland smooths out perhaps in Sarpy county and drawing a line up through western Washington, Burt, Thurston and northeastern Wayne counties, we pass through a country where one will do well to buy the best land at $200 an acre. Iti traveling west and south across the state, for about every mile you travel deduct sixty or seventy-five cents per acre for the same quality of land. This continues out to where the hot winds cease and you get into a higher altitude and perhaps a little better condition where the decrease will be less. This rule will come close to giving the aver - age selling price the people are getting for smooth upland in the aver - age American communities. Land prices are usually considerably stronger in a foreign neighborhood. In the second place the average man does not give enough con - sideration to the quality of the soil. Poor land nearly always sells relatively higher than good land. It costs more many times to farm a poor acre than a good one and the production is much less and the expense of keeping the soil productive much greater. In the third place, buildings are often considered too strongly. I think they fool more people buying land than any other one thing. A </seg>
            <seg id="p262">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 264 man may see poor buildings and decide against a farm, 'when the soil is of the best quality. He may afterwards go across the road or a few miles away see some pretty buildings that have been fixed up to sell to someone and he is taken off his feet by the fine buildings and overlooks some soil deficiency and buys the farm on the strength of the buildings. The fourth point is high taxes. You have mentioned consolidated schools. I think consolidated schools are a good thing if they don't run into too much money. I know a place where two or three districts went in together and pulled their schoolhouses to a central location and made a high school. The pupils furnish their own transportation and it doesn't cost much. I know another place where they put a uarter of a million dollars into a consolidated school building and lave mortgaged all the farms in the community to pay for it. Besides : costs a lot of money to take care of that school and deliver the upils. Drainage and irrigation taxes are also sometimes factors in and values. The fifth point is a man's ability to handle a farm. If he doesn't have money to stock and handle a farm it is not a good investment, if he is dependent upon the farm for an immediate income. And sixth, buying land under too great optimism is a mistake of a good many people who have suffered for it. Corn now approaches a dollar but a man who buys a farm on the strength of it will probably see it go back to sixty cents some of these years. If a man can buy his land so he can get along fairly well in an average year, in a good year he can accumulate some surplus that will tide him over a poor I think without question this is a good time to buy land particularly if you can buy of someone who needs to sell. It may be a good deal for both buyer and seller. </seg>
            <seg id="p263">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 265 WINTER WHEAT PRODUCTION IN NEBRASKA T. A. Kiesselbach College of Agriculture Lincoln Introduction and Importance of Winter Wheat. Winter wheat ranks second in importance among the grain crops grown in Nebraska. Its acreage is surpassed only by that of com. During the 5-year period of 1920-1924, this state's average annual pro - duction was 7,784,000 acres corn, 3,331,000 acres winter wheat, 2,453,000 acres oats, 257,000 acres barley, and 249,000 acres spring wheat. The annual grain production for the state during this period has been: corn —224,510 bushels; winter wheat— 50,426,000 bushels; oats— 73,308,000 bushels; barley — 6,495,000 bushels; and spring wheat — 2,661,000 bushels. Winter wheat is now grown throughout the entire state. It has practically replaced the spring type (Figs. 3 and 4), which was vised almost exclusively in Nebraska prior to 1890. The popularity of winter wheat spread rapidly after this date due largely to better knowledge regarding varieties and their culture. Hard winter wheat of the Turkey Red or Crimean type had but recently been introduced into this country by Mennonite emigrants from Russia. With a general recog - nition of the superior hardiness and excellent milling and baking quali - ties of this type, wheat growing became, revolutionized in Nebraska. The adoption of better cultural practices has greatly reduced the haz - ards of fall seeding. Fig. 3 — Spring wheat distribution. Each dot represents 1,000 acres grown tn 1922.

Data from Agricultural Statistics for 1922, Nebraska Depart - ment of Agriculture. Comparative Value of Hard and Soft Varieties. The winter varieties of "common" wheat grown in this country, classified according to character of the grain, consists of 3 types: hard, semi-hard, and soft. The soft varieties are restricted largely to the more humid regions of the Pacific coast. The hard sorts are grown chiefly in the hard red and winter wheat region of central United States where the annual rainfall is relatively low. The semi-hard varieties are most common in the eastern third of the United States where the rainfall is intermediate. In a comparative test in the variety nursery during the 7-year per - iod 1915-1922, 25 hard winter wheat varieties and strains averaged 31.9 bushels per acre compared with 27.2 bushels for 24 soft to semi-hard varieties. Thus the. hard wheat proved 4.7 bushels per acre superior. Of the 25 hard wheats included in this test, 22 equalled or surpassed the common Turkey Red which has been grown at this Experiment Station since 1885. Of the 24 soft to semi-hard sorts only 3 yielded as well as the common Turkey Red. Probablj 99 per cent of the wheat grown in this state is of the hard type and it is doubtful if any varieties of the semi-hard or soft types should be grown. Improvement of Winter Wheat, After the superiority of Turkey Red wheat had been established by early tests at this Experiment Station, a systematic effort was made </seg>
            <seg id="p265">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 267 Fig. 5 — Variety test of winter wheat showing differences in winter hardiness. to select more productive pure strains from it. This work of selection and testing for comparative excellence has continued for 20 years with the result that several superior strains have been isolated and dis - tributed extensively among the wheat growers of the state. Nebraska No. 6 and Nebraska No. 60. These two strains were selected as the most desirable among an original 1,000 strains isolated from the common Turkey Red variety. As an average for a 12-year test in field plats (Table 1), 1912-1923, the original Turkey Red was surpassed 3.8 bushels or 12 per cent by Ne - braska No. 6 and 2.9 bushels or 9 per cent by Nebraska No. 60. Ne - braska No. 6 has been somewhat less subject to black stem rust where - as Nebraska No. 60 is fully as susceptible as the original Turkey Red. Both strains show a slight improvement in winter hardiness with Nebraska No. 60 somewhat superior in this regard. Results of Recent Variety Tests. Accompanying these wheat improvement investigations, continued effort has been made to compare the best Nebraska sorts with those that had proved outstanding in other states. A very important test of this kind was conducted in the variety nursery during the- period of 1915-1922 and is reported in table 2. This test compares a number of Nebraska varieties and Turkey Red selections with the best wheats obtainable from other states. A 3-year test of the more important varieties and Nebraska strains in field plats is given in table 3. </seg>

            <seg id="p270">272 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Kanred Of all such varieties and strains from without the state Kanred has proved most productive under Nebraska conditions. This is a pure line selection made by the Kansas Agricultural Experiment Station from Crimean wheat. The first seed of this strain planted in Nebraska was C lined from the Kansas Station in 1914 and was tested for several rs in small nursery plants only. Here it proved so winter hardy, relatively rust resistant and high in grain yield that its use on Nebraska farms was encouraged. Kanred became very popular and its acreage increased rapidly. Since its introduction, Kanred has averaged materially less subject to Black Stem rust than any other variety. During the severe rust epi - demic of 1923, however, it rusted as severely throughout the state as dm Turkey Red. In a 7-year nursery test Kanred averaged 19 per cent higher yield than common Turkey Red. In a 4-year field plat comparison, 1920-1923, it has yielded 1.8 bushels more. Blackhull. This strain has proved very productive in southern Kansas and has come prominently to the attention of Nebraska farmers during the last three years. In a 3-year test at the Nebraska Station it has yielded 31.4 bushels compared with 33.5 for Kanred. While this is a very fine appearing wheat, it has proved less winterhardy and its extensive use cannot be recommended for this state.

            <seg id="p272">274 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Effect of Seed Source and Previous Condition of Growth. Inquiry is frequently made regarding how far seed wheat may safely be moved without resulting in inadaptation. Especially in the case of newly introduced strains or varieties, seed is sometimes obtained from a rather long distance. It appears that a pure line of wheat, such as or Nebraska No. 6, may be moved any distance without mater - y influencing its hereditary characteristics. In no cases under obser - vation has the hereditary adaptation of such wheat been influenced by source of seed or previous conditions of growth. To illustrate, it is con - dered just as safe to plant pure Kanred seed secured from any other ource as it is to use home-grown seed. In the case of commercial va - eties, however, it must be remembered that much confusion of names xists and a single name as Turkey Red or Crimean may represent a umber of independent importations of seed from Europe. Such varie - es are natural mixtures of pure line strains and through the principle f survival of the fittest may become changed somewhat in their char - cteristics. Fig. 8 — A field of improved Turkey Red winter wheat growing at the Nebraska Experiment Station. Relation of Seed Grade to Production. Use of the fanning mill for grading seed wheat has not been found to increase yields materially. During a 17-year period 2 grades of Turkey Red wheat, the heaviest one-fourth and the lightest one-fourth as separated by a fanning mill, yielded 34.0, and 33.6 bushels per acre as compared with 33.4 bushels for the original ungraded seed. Such slight differences suggest that the chief value of a fanning mill is to remove trash, weed seed, and inert matter from the seed. </seg>
            <seg id="p273">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 275 Time of Seeding. A striking relation has been found to exist between the time of seeding and the yield per acre. During 5 years, 1919-1923, Turkey Red winter wheat was seeded at the Experiment Station on 9 different dates for the purpose of observing the effect on yield. The first date has been somewhat earlier than normal and the seedings were made thereafter at intervals throughout the fall, winter and early spring. The average acre yields (table 5) were as follows: Sept. 16, 32.1 bushels; Sept. 22, 34.2 bushels; Oct. 1, 32.2 bushels; Oct. 16, 25.1 bushels; Oct. 31, 20.2 bushels; Nov. 25, 16.7 bushels; Feb. 9, 11.8 bushels; March 4, 5.5 bush - els; and March 25, 0.1 bushel. In comparison Java Spring wheat seeded at the normal date of March 25 yielded 14.9 bushels. It appears that in the average year there is a period of about 10 days which may be considered as most favorable for seeding. There is M advantage in seeding earlier than the optimum date, and in years of Hessian fly prevalence it is best to delay until the latter part of tihis optimum period, which usually coincides with the fly-free date as es - tablished by the State Entomologist. This delay may be expected to materially reduce the fly damage if generally practiced in an infested territory. The time to seed becomes earlier northward and westward within the state because of change in climatic conditions.

Wheat sown in the fall, which for any reason does not come up until spring, cannot be expected to yield well in eastern Nebraska. This is true even if it has been subjected to freezing weather. With an ap - proach toward western Nebraska where a cooler climate prevails, much less reduction from this cause is experienced. Rate of Seeding. There may be a rather wide range in seeding rate without a cor - responding effect upon grain yield. Turkey Red wheat has been drilled at five different rates during the 5-year period, 1919-1923, with the fol - lowing results (table 6) : Seeding three pecks per acre yielded ;'28.t&gt; bushels; 4 pecks, 30.4 bushels; 5 pecks, 30.5 bushels; 6 pecks, 31.5 bush - els; and 8 pecks, 30.7 bushels. Seeding thinner than 4 pecks per acre is not recommended for east - ern Nebraska conditions. Five pecks is regarded as the most practical rate for this section, since it results in a more satisfactory stand in years of severe winterkilling, than does a thinner seeding. With an ap - proach toward central and western Nebraska the rate is commonly somewhat reduced. Table 6 — Relation of rate of planting to the growth and yield of Turkey Red Winter Wheat.

A semi- hard variety of winter wheat known as Marvelous was in - troduced and extensively exploited by seedmen about 10 years ago. It was especially recommended for an alleged stooling capacity far greater than that possessed by other wheats of the Turkey Red type. Because of this alleged quality a planting rate of only 2 pecks per acre was rec - ommended, and it came to be known as "Half Bushel" wheat. In a 5-year comparison, 1916-1920 with Turkey Red at the rate of 2 and 5 pecks per acre, the 5-peck rate surpassed the two-peck rate 4.5 bushels in case of the Marvelous, and 3.1 bushels in case of the Turkey (4) 5.0 4.4 4.1 3.8 (5) 4.3 3.2 2.6 2.5 I (6) 58 58 58 58 CO I I I (7) 13.1 13.1 13.1 13.2 I I I (8) 28.6 30.4 30.5 31.5 o/\ rr </seg>

In these tests the Turkey Red stooled 10 per cent more than the Marvelous. Broadcasting vs. Drilling. Comparative yields were determined during the five-year period, 1919-1923, for broadcasted and drilled Turkey Red wheat. The average yield (table 49) from broadcasting was 24.4 bushels, while drilling in rows spaced eight and four inches apart respectively gave yields of 29.7 and 29.8 bushels per acre. Broadcasting wheat was at a disadvantage during three of the five years in which seed bed conditions were rela - tively dry and unfavorable at planting time. Narrow spacing of rows had no advantage over the eight inch spacing. Most farm drills space the rows seven inches apart, which is regarded as a very desirable width. Spring Cultivation of Winter Wheat. In a four-year test, 1919-1922, rolling winter wheat in the spring at the time growth is resumed failed to affect the yield appreciably. On the other hand, spring harrowing reduced the yield 1.2 bushels per acre. Earlier data 1902-1906, by Montgomery had suggested an increase of five bushels per acre from rolling, and a reduction of one bushel from har - rowing. Spring rolling has been regarded as beneficial in case of very loose soil and in years of severe cracking and drying of the soil. Pasturing Winter Wheat. Fall pasturing may benefit wheat through compacting the soil by the tramping of the stock. In severe winters wheat winterkills less on firm seed beds. Fields which are compact due to the methods of tillage or rains would therefore not be particularly benefitted by fall pasturing and unless the plants have become well established, damage may result. </seg>

Under normal conditions at the Experi - ment Station some of the heads are about 2 inches above ground by April 20 and may be eaten off by stock. Stems thus injured cannot bear grain. Cattle should be removed from wheat fields before the damage through loss of heads is likely to more than offest the probable good in case of lodging. Time of Ripening and Development of the Kernel. The average length of time required for wheat to ripen after com - ing into full head has been 31 days during the 21-year period, 1903-1923. This varies considerably according to weather conditions from year to year. The progressive increase in kernel weight after fertilization is shown for two-day intervals in table 7. The time of ripening is vari - able, being June 20 in 1921 and July 17 in 1917. Effect of Harvesting Grain Immature. Harvesting wheat before ripe may result in a material reduction of grain yield. This is illustrated by a 4-year test (table 8) in which wheat was harvested at 3 different stages of maturity. Wheat har - vested in the early dough, late dough, and mature stages yielded respectively 23.7, 28.8, and 30.9 bushels per acre.

Winterkilling of Wheat. It is a rather common belief that the chief or sole causes of winter - killing are rupture of the plant root by heaving of the soil, and smother - ing by sleet or ice. It appears however that these are only minor causes of infrequent occurrence in Nebraska. The chief causes for failure to survive the winter are (1) freezing to death by extreme cold, and (2) drying up as a result of moisture shortage. The recuperation of wheat following severe winter damage is often remarkable. With favorable weather in the spring, wheat which was severely but rather uniformly winterkilled to the extent of 80 per cent in the year 1918 still produced 32 bushels per acre. It is enabled to do this by heavy spring stooling under favorable conditions. In years when the soil is loose or badly cracked in the spring when wheat resumes its growth, rolling with a corrugated roller aids in the revival of weakened plants by firming the soil in contact with the roots. Wheat growing on compact seed beds is much less subject to winter - killing than on loose seed beds. Prevention of Stinking Smut in Winter Wheat. Stinking smut has never been a serious problem in eastern Nebraska until very recent years. Except in special smut experiments, no winter wheat seeded at the Nebraska Experiment Station has ever been treated for smut. It is seldom that even a trace of smut has been observed in the crop. Few farmers in eastern Nebraska have found it desir - able to treat wheat for smut until recent years. Smut appears to have been more commonly prevalent since the extensive importations of Kan - red wheat seed which was somewhat infected in many cases. Field inspection on some eastern Nebraska farms has shown as high as 20% L « « £=3J5 </seg>

The only effective remedies are the substitution of seed from a smut-free field or seed treatment. Both the wet formalin and dry - copper carbonate dust treatments applied by standard methods have proved effective in smut prevention. Relation of Amount of Stinking Smut to Yield and Quality of Wheat. In the fall of 1923, six lots of untreated Kanred winter wheat known to differ in degree of smut infection were planted in comparative field plat tests. Determinations were made before harvest in 1924 of the percentage of smutted heads in the crops grown from this seed. The resulting crops (table 9) containing 0, 3, 8, 12, 42, and 63 per cent of smutted heads yielded respectfully 34.7, 31.8, 28.2, 26.5, 20.7 and 16.3 bushels per acre and tested 60.5, 59.5, 59.0, E8.0, arc! 55.0 pounds per bushel. The badly smutted samples produced threshed grain containing a large amount of smut, and having a very bad odor. Table 9. — Relation of degree of smut infection to yield of grain per acre.

            <seg id="p280">282 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Effect of Seed Treatments for Stinking Smut Upon the Yield and Quality of Wheat. Seed corresponding with the smut-free sample and with the two heaviest infected samples of wheat just described were planted in the fall of 1923 after being given the standard formalin treatment by the dipping method using a solution of one pint formalin (40% For - maldehyde Sol.) to 40 gallons of water. After immersing the seed for 10 minutes, it was piled on the floor and covered for 2 hours. It was then spread out to hasten drying. Similar wheat samples were treated dry with, copper carbonate containing 50 per cent copper, by revolving, in a barrel, 2 ounces of the dust with a bushel of wheat for a period of two minutes. These samples were planted in comparison with each other and with the untreated seed. (table 10). The crops grown from the untreated seed of these three samples contained .5, 38, and 63&lt;# smutted heads and yielded 35.1, 27.5, and 20.6 bushels of grain per acre which tested 59.8, 55.0, and 52.8 pounds per bushel respectively. The corresponding yields from the formalin treat - ed plats were 36, 33.1, and 34.7 bushels which tested 59.3, 59.0, and 58.5 pounds per bushel respectively. Corresponding yields from the seed treated with copper carbonate were 36.0, 34.0, and 34.3 bushels per acre with respective test weights of 59.3, 59.0, and 58.0 pounds per bushel. This dry method has the very marked advantage over the old wet method in that there is no danger whatever to the germination of the seed. The wet method requires immediate seeding or rapid drying out in order to retain the viability of the seed. Too strong a solution may also destroy it. On the other hand there is no danger whatever of too strong a dosage with the copper carbonate. More of this pow - der may be applied without harm, but it will be of no benefit since 2 ounces per bushel is all that may be made to adhere to the grain. A commercial copper carbonate product containing 20 per cent copper has proved effective and is less expensive than the 50 per cent strength used in these tests. In farm practice some device should be used in applying the cop - per carbonate to hold the dust and prevent its inhalation by the oper - ator. Although machines for this purpose are now on the market, suitable apparatus may be very cheaply devised on the farm. A barrel concrete mixer serves the purpose very well by having a cloth tied over the open end of the container. A strong barrel suspended on a frame at each end by means of an axle with crank attached makes a good home-made machine. A trap door with cover should be cut into the side of the barrel for inserting and removing the grain and copper carbonate powder. A revolving box with hinged cover suspended at diagonal corners, has also proved very satisfactory equipment. </seg>
            <seg id="p281">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 283 Preservation of Grain After Harvest The quality of grain is subject to deterioration when exposed long to weathering in the shock after harvest. The market grade is low - ered by the bleaching and sprouting which often results from delayed threshing or stacking. It is, therefore desirable to organize the farm operations as far as practicable to get the grain under cover either by early field threshing or by stacking. Grain which has been rained upon in the shock should be well dried before threshing. This may often be facilitated by resetting the shocks or by scattering the bundles. Grain threshed and binned wet may heat and mold and thereby lose materially in market value. Full co-oper - ation of the managers of threshing outfits to avoid too early threshing after rains would aid materially in avoiding such losses.

The yields obtained at the Nebraska Experiment Station for winter wheat, oats, and com, (table 11) during the 22-year period, 1902-1923, were 34, 52, and 53 bushels per acre respectively.

It is a matter of universal observation that the most profitable crops are grown on productive soil. In the older sections of the state where the land has been cropped for many years, such soil productivity s best brought about or maintained through a rational use of barnyard manure, rotation with legume crops, and through timely seed bed prep - aration and other cultural practices. Very heavy manure applications should commonly be avoided be - cause of their over-stimulation effects. Excessively high fertility re - sults in rank vegetative development with consequent drying up of the crops in unduly dry years. Manure applications of 8 tons per acre at 5-year intervals should not prove excessive in the eastern third of the state and may be expected to increase wheat yields several bushels »er acre annually as compared with unmanured land. Commercial 'ertilizers have been found to increase production somewhat in eastern Nebraska, but seldom sufficiently to be profitable.

            <seg id="p283">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 285 Fig. 10 — A rotation of corn, oats, wheat, and clover on the Experiment Station, farm. Legumes such as red clover, sweet clover, and alfalfa used in rotation do much to keep up the productivity of the soil. The use of alfalfa, sweet clover, and red clover in the crop rotation wherever these crops thrive, has been found profitable. These crops are valuable not only because of their high production of forage, but also because of their highly beneficial soil effects. The soil is bene - fited especially through increase in organic matter content, available soil nitrates, and through improvement in its physical condition. Best results are obtained from short time rotations in which, the land is cropped to a legume for relatively few years. Excessive depletion of subsoil moisture is thus reduced in the case of alfalfa. Early seed bed preparation for wheat is desirable. In most years more favorable conditions as to compactness, soil moisture, and avail - able fertility are thereby brought about. Where a large acreage is to be plowed, this may often be advantageously preceeded by discing as soon after harvest as possible. Such discing reduces weed growth and conserves moisture which makes plowing possible at a later date than would otherwise be the case in the event of dry weather. Much weed growth between plowing and seeding should be prevented by harrow - ing or discing when necessary. Plowing in July or early August com - monly results in materially increased yields over September plowing. A number of special practices have been developed through farm ex - perience in western Nebraska and should be used according to local experiences. This includes such treatments as the "stubbling in" of wheat, discing without plowing, early listing followed by cultivation to level the land, occasional summer fallow, arid drilling directly be - tween the rows of standing corn. </seg>
            <seg id="p284">286 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE r. 11 — Early plowing usually provides a more compact seed bcj containing more moisture and available fertility than does late plowing.

I believe it is rather out f keeping on my part to discuss this subject following Dr. Kiesselbach. might discuss the subject of Winter Wheat in Hamilton County as I utve seen it and have heard farmers discuss it in the last three years. Hamilton County represents the central South Platte territory. Since 922 our crops have been considerably changed. We grow more corn, alfalfa, oats, and sweet clover, and many farmers have cut out wheat ntirely and many more have cut down their acreage. We heard re - marks like these many times during 1922 and 1923, "I am down on wheat, there is nothing to it, and I am quitting it." Still there are many farmers who realize that wheat fits in the rotation and furnishes n early cash crop, and this was brought out especially this last year. Ve had a good wheat crop and it saved the day for many farmers, so believe it will continue to be one of the cash crops, although probably we will have more alfalfa and probably more corn and other crops to take the place of some of the wheat. The past year we had many ields of thirty bushels to the acre and a few about forty. Wheat is </seg>
            <seg id="p285">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 287 selling at a good price and farmers have somewhat changed their senti - ments in regard to it and there was some increase sown this fall. We have heard much discussion for the last three or four years on Kanred and Turkey Red wheat and there are followers of each one. In 1920 and 1921 the farm Bureaus and the College of Agriculture created quite a sentiment for Kanred wheat and several carloads of seed were shipped into the county. Almost every farmer got some of that and in 1921 and 1922 it gave satisfactory results and the farmers were loud in their praises of Kanred. But along in 1923 we had a wet period when the wheat was heading out. We had two days of very moist hot weather and wheat did not ripen with a rich color. It seemed to get the worst of it during those two hot days and as a result many fields of Kanred did not yield as well as the Turkey Red. Farmers would compare one piece of Kani-ad wheat with their neighbor's field of Turkey Red wheat and they were not satisfied. Personally I think most of. the farmers were looking for something to kick about on Kan - red wheat. As a result the sentiment immediately changed against Kanred wheat and a good share of the farmers turned to the old orig - inal Turkey Red that year, although many farmers stayed with tha Kanred and some sowed a portion of each. This last year we had a pretty good comparison and we didn't hear any criticism of Kanred wheat and many farmers said they were well pleased with it. I took special pains to ask the men with whom I came in contact and in al - most every case the very high yield was from Kanred wheat. So it looks as though Kanred might come back to its own. So many things enter into the yield in our demonstration tests that we put on with the farmers that we can't arrive at any conclusions and about the only tiling we can do is to carry on those experiments there for a number of years to act as sort of demonstrations along these lines. This year we had one very startling demonstration in early and late plowing. One man plowed a part of his field in August and didn't get in again until September. He sowed the two portions the same day. The August plowing made 39 bushels and the other made only 20, and I am satisfied that was all due to the time of the plowing. We have made a series of tests in the last two years on 3, 5 and 7 inch plow - ing and we have found that the deep plowing increased the yield per acre to a slight extent. So far as concerns manuring and strawing wheat we have done that and this year the strawed wheat yield was less than the other. Manuring gives the best results. As to these other things that have been mentioned here, once in a while a farmer may get a little off on a proposition. I went out to a farm last fall where the farmer was sowing wheat and asked him if he wanted to put in a test of Kanred, Turkey Red and Nebraska 60 wheat. He said "don't say Kanred wheat to me, I raised it two years ago and I don't want any more of it." But as a matter of fact it has been found that the gluten contained in these wheats is about the same. </seg>
            <seg id="p286">288 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I want to leave this one thought. It is not our purpose to try to perform a lot of experiments out in the county. But we do want to conduct simple tests and demonstrations on things worked out here at the Experimental Station — which will help to establish results locally and induce farmers to follow out certain practices which have been proven to be good. MR. DANLY: I think the time of plowing is an interesting thing. In Kearney county that has quite an effect on the wheat production, but it is interesting to know that the season of rainfall also has an in - fluence on it. If we plow early when there is plenty of moisture the wheat on our early plowing always yields better than that on the late plowing, but the later we plow the more necessary it seems to be to use what we call the corrugated packer. This is an old packer put out several years ago and in our part of the country is a very valuable tool. If we can get rain following deep plowing it makes a good yield. However, if there is no rain following the deep plowing to really settle the ground then the packer really shows its influence. It generally yields as much as five bushels more when we use the packer. I don't imagine that would be true in all sections of the state but it is true with us. MR. J. D. REAM: I feel that this gentleman in the experiments he has made has brought us something very valuable. I suggest that he be asked to tabulate these as best he can and give them to the Agri - cultural College for publication. I know of no better work, aside from the work of the Experiment Station, for the good of the Nebraska farmer than to make a report of such work as this which represents the different parts of the state. MR. STEWART: I would like to say that we have figures from everal different counties along these same lines just outlined by Mr. Camp. We have these all compiled in my office and hope sometime when we get enough of them to be reliable and fairly conclusive to publish them. Figures now available cover the work with wheat varieties, time of seeding, and seed bed preparation in Clay, Thayer, lamilton, Saunders and other counties. WINTER WHEAT VARIETIES J. H. Claybaugh, Clay County. The question "What do the farmers think of the different varieties of winter wheat" is one which has nearly as many different answers as there are farmers. In trying to collect opinions from farmers, I have concluded that one can hear whatever he wants to hear and believe whatever he wants to believe. Therefore, if you men decide to dis - agree with all I have to say it will not be anything more than what I shall expect. </seg>
            <seg id="p287">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRK'l'LTl'KK 289 The description I have heard regarding the different varieties of winter wheat reminds me of the descriptions of an elephant which were given by the three blind men. One man argued that an elephant resembled the handle of a black snake whip. He had felt of its tail. One argued that an elephant was like a blanket. He had handled an ear. The third blind man argued that an elephant resembled a tree trunk and the leg was all he had felt of the elephant. With full vision and full investigation each blind man could have easily learned the truth regarding the elephant. It seems to me than fuller vision and more study of the results of careful investigations are the things needed by the farmers regarding wheat varieties. For a fuller vision of wheat varieties farmers need to consider the results of the most careful, comparable tests run over a series of years at this Station as just given by Dr. Kiesselbach. By more people visiting these fields at heading or ripening time, and by more publicity of the results secured, more farmers will get a clearer vision of this problem. There are many who believe that results of the Experiment Station here at Lincoln or those at North Platte are not a safe guide as to the way these varieties may act in the different counties. There are argu - ments as to what variety produces the best flour and sells for the most money. We tried to settle some of these arguments this year in Clay County by conducting two wheat variety tests. C. D. Rader, near Trumbull had a level, uniform 60 acre field which had always been farmed alike, which was plowed and harrowed alike. On this he plant - ed three varieties of wheat, cut and threshed each 20 acres separately with the following results as to yields. The Nebraska 60 seed was not from certified field, so I can not vouch for its purity. Kanred 29.19 bu. 27.08 " 27.28 " Common T. R.

            <seg id="p288">290 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I regard this a very fair comparable test but I believe that what is needed is for the Crop Growers Association to find co-operators who will work out a number of such tests in different counties of the State with the county agents in charge. The information thus produced would be of value to every locality, where held as it would provide the answers to many of the arguments now afloat. Some of you may want me to get back to my subject and tell you le opinions of farmers. As there are not fixed opinions upon which armers agree, I will have to give you my personal opinions. My wn observations leads me to consider that Kanred and Nebraska 60 re our 2 best varieties. Kanred wheat grows a little wider leaf, of different shade of green. It seems most winter hardy where I have raerved two varieties growing in the same field. It resisted the rust f 1921 well but rusted this summer as badly as others. r. 12 — An oat variety test In Clay County. Carefully conducted county variety tests are valuable for localizing Experiment Station results. Kanred many times has a plumper berry, especially when it out - yields others. Under such conditions it also shatters easily and thresh - es more easily. Thresherman often report that Kanred threshes easier and bleaches quicker than other varieties. There seems to be a feel - ing that Kanred does not weigh as much per bushel nor test as high in protein content. While some tests might justify this belief, others do not. Personally, I am sure that soil fertility has something to do with protein content. Regarding Nebraska 60, the pure strain of Turkey Red, I regard it as the variety for farmers to grow where they are prejudiced against Kanred. Nebraska 60 is winter hardy and grows very long heads which creates many favorable impressions. There does not seem to be the argument as to the test weight, protein content, and milling qualities of Nebraska 60 as there is with Kanred. </seg>
            <seg id="p289">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BO-» RD OF AGKICl'LTTRK 291 Regarding the other varieties of wheat grown in my part of Ne - braska, I do not know of any that have any qualities that Kanred or Nebraska 60 do not have. We have Kharkov, Manifold, some beardless and some Black Hull wheat and have tried Nebraska 28 without suc - cess. I know of several cases where men changed back this year to Kanred, who last year had discarded Kanred for Common Turkey. I, personally, agree with Dr. Kiesselbach that Kanred and Nebraska 60 are the 2 best winter wheats for Nebraska. We need to keep pure strains of both because farmers who now have one will next year wish they had the other. It is for these reasons that we wish to recommend that, this organization continue to supplement the supply of pure seed which our Experiment Station has to offer by continuing its present policy of certifying the fields of pure strains grown by a few careful crop growers. BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB WORK IN FARM CROPS The Nebraska Crop Growers Association has always been a strong believer and booster for the Boys and Girls Club work. In contin - uation of this attitude the Association offered to pay the expenses of the winning Corn Club team in the crops judging contests at the Nebraska State Fair, to the Interstate Fair at Sioux City. The Wav - erly judging team won and was given this trip. As a part of the program at the winter meetings of the Association two club teams were invited to put on demonstrations. The Bushnell Potato team ranking as the champion demonstration team in the state put on their demonstration showing the proper selection and treatment of potatoes. This team was composed of Alice Forsling and Arnold Gadekin of Bushnell. The Eagle Corn Club also put on a very interesting demonstration. This team won a trip to the International Grain and Hay Show where they attracted considerable attention by their ability to demonstrate the technique of grain grading according to regulation methods. More crops club work is needed in Nebraska for its beneficial effect on the agriculture of the state. These club members will be the leaders in the agricultural development of Nebraska in a few years time. </seg>

REPORT OF THE 1924 (FIRST) CORN YIELD CONTEST of the NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS ASSOCIATION P. H. Stewart and D. L. Gross. The 1924 10-acre Corn Yield Contest of the Nebraska Crop Grow - ers' Association proved very successful. More than 80 farmers, well scattered over Nebraska, entered the contest, and 39 completed the contest. Unfavorable seasonal conditions caused many to drop out. In the 1924 contest not all the emphasis was placed on yield. Con - testants were scored on the basis of 65% for yield, 20% for cost per bushel, 10% for quality and 5% for reports. Thus the winner must mve not only a big yield, but is must have been produced cheaply and »e of good quality. This scoring in several instances resulted in the placing of a man down on account of high cost even though his yield was high. The following rules were used in conducting the contest: "The state shall be divided for this contest into three regions with goals of 50, 70 and 90 bushels in the western, central and eastern sec - tions of the state respectively . The goal for irrigated fields will be 20 bushels above that of unirrigated fields of each region. Any contestant who equals or exceeds the goal for his section shall be entitled to membership in the Nebraska Maximum Corn Yield Club. </seg>
            <seg id="p291">REPORT OF .NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 293 A "recognition of achievement" certificate will be conferred on all such successful contestants at the Annual Session of the Nebraska Crop Growers Association at Lincoln, in January. Each county may have its own contest directed by the County Agent and Farm Bureau, with contestants scored on the same basis as in the state contest. The highest scoring contestant in each county contest will be awarded a medal by the Nebraska Crop Growers Association. Other county premiums may also be awarded by local organizations. The contestants ranking highest in their respective regions shall be awarded medals by the Nebraska Crop Growers Association. Other state premiums will be awarded." Yields were carefully determined by husking out rows in different parts of the field. A 30-pound sample was shipped to the Agricul - tural College. This corn was dried and the shrinkage and shelling per cent determined. Quality was determined by grading a sample of shelled corn on the commercial basis. Rent was figured at 2-5 in the eastern region and at 1-3 in the central and western sections. Man labor was figured at 30c per hour, and horse labor at 16 cents — the latter cost also covering machinery cost. Husking was charged at 6 cents per bushel. Silver medals were given to the high man in each county contest. Gold medals were given to the high man in each section of the state contest. Cash prizes of $25, $15, and $10 were also given as premiums for first, second and third places, respectively, in each region. The Omaha Grain Exchange offered $75.00 in premiums, and the Nebraska Crop Growers Association offered the other premiums. A study of the summary for the eastern region, given on the fol - lowing pages, shows several interesting things. First, the importance of a legume crop preceding the corn crop, where one is after high yields, is strikingly shown in the third column. The five highest yields were grown as follows: first year after alfalfa; third year after alfalfa; sec - ond year after alfalfa; first year after clover; and the first year after alfalfa. It will be noticed that the low five men did not have a legume crop immediately preceding the corn. It will also be noticed that the high 10 men used 229 loads of manure where the low 10 men used 38 loads. This was in spite of the charge of 50 cents per ton for .manure plus labor which proved to be too high. It will also be noticed that of the five highest ranking men 4 drilled the corn and 1 checked it. This probably is not important, however. The effect of the cold, wet spring is indicated by the fact that of the 6 men who listed their corn 5 were in the low 10 places. Last spring </seg>
            <seg id="p292">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 294 being cold and wet made it more difficult to get a good stand of corn where listed and weeds also bothered worse. It will be interesting to see how this works in other years. The figures on the man hours spent in cultivating show the follow ing interesting comparisons: Av. Number of man hours spent on cultivating 10 acres by 5 highest men 35.1 Av. Number of man hours spent on cultivating 10 acres by 5 lowest men 23.0 Av. Number of man hours spent on cultivating 10 acres by 10 highest men 40.6 Av. Number of man hours spent on cultivating 10 acres by 10 lowest men . 27.6 This shows that time spent in cultivating the field apparently had an affect on the yield. However, the total man hours spent in culti- vation does not tell the whole story as some men used two row machin- ery which would show a low man hour total but still represents con- siderable work. To avoid this a similar table of the total horse hours up to husking time has been compiled which shows this interesting summary: Number of horse hours spent on 10 acres by 5 highest men 309 Number of horse hours spent on 10 acres by 5' lowest men 193 Number of horse hours spent on 10 acres by 10 highest men 301 Number of horse hours spent on 10 acres by 10 lowest men .__ 216 </seg>

            <seg id="p295">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 297 A summary of the yield, cost per bushel, and acre profit of the various contestants shows the great importance of yield in determin - ing profit. Without a good yield one cannot make a profit. This to - gether with the emphasis on rotations is the chief value of a yield contest. Summary Showing Relation of Yield to Profit. The high men in this contest favor smooth seed ears; the firm dimple dented type shown by the Nebraska Experiment Station to be the high yielding sort. Yellow varieties predominated. Emil Prusa living near Howells in Colfax County was high man with a yield of 72.0 bushels. The history of this place (rolling farm of Marshall silt loam — a loess soil) is interesting. It was homesteaded some 55 years ago. For 35 years it was rented, during which time the soil was badly depleted. Grain crops were raised and no livestock fed on the place. In 1919 Emil Prusa went on this farm and seeded a 30-acre field to alfalfa. In the fall of 1923 a portion of this alfalfa was broken out and in 1924 this was put in corn. A 10-acre portion was entered in the contest, although the whole 30 acres was equally good. This was double disced, harrowed, and drilled in surface plant - ed corn on May 21 and 22. An excellent stand of corn was secured, the corn being a little too thick if anything. The corn was cultivated first with an ordinary shovel cultivator and then twice with a disk cul - tivator. The only additional work was 5 hours spent in cutting out some of the larger weeds. A summary of the central and western regions is also given on the following pages. Similar comparisons as have been made for the eastern section might be made. In the central region, although W. H. Sundermeier of Phillips, Hamilton County, had the largest yield, 55.23 bushels, his cost was sufficiently high to give first place to Bert Mott of Hastings who had a yield of 54.05 bushels. In the western region W. C. Fitch of McCook easily led with a yield of 37.6 bushels raised at a bushel cost of 22.3 cents. County Contests. Washington County and Cheyenne County conducted county con - tests having 13 and 22 entries, respectively. In Washington County 7 completed the contest and in Cheyenne County 13 finished.

            <seg id="p298">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 300 It will be noticed that Entry No. 4 who has the highest yield is in the last place on account of a high per bushel cost. This is due to the fact that he put 110 loads of manure on the 10-acre field which according to the rules was charged at the rate of 50 cents per load plus the regular charge for horse and man labor. This made the cost of production very high. This year's experience has shown that the charge for manure is too high, and this will be corrected for the 1925 contest. In the Cheyenne County contest, the county was divided into north bench, valley and rough land, and south bench. S. B. Hopkins, Louis Olsen and Arno Thomas won in each district, respectively. Louis Olson was County Champion with a yield of 30.7 bushels raised at a cost of 32.4 cents per bushel. He ranked second in the western region. In General. This corn yield contest shows the importance of legumes in rotation systems on the eastern Nebraska farms. Alfalfa, red and sweet clover not only are profitable crops themselves but the crops that follow are greatly increased on the average farm. We need a higher legume acre - age in Nebraska. These records are not presented to the public with the idea that the profits are representative of average farms. The men who enter this contest are probably above the average and these figures can not be pointed to as representing average production. The results do however point out: (1) The importance of soil fertility. (2) The importance of good seed of the correct type and of high viability. (3) That a reasonable amount of extra labor in preparing the soil keeping the weeds out pays in increased yields. (4) That from the landlords viewpoint at least in the eastern sec - tion, a rotation of legumes and grain crops will bring in a greater income than a continual grain crop. 12 j 55.2 I 21.18 | 49.6 36.4 | 9.8 | 9 | 5 j 73.4 | 12 5 14 1 51.8 j 21.08 1 46.4 | 32.4 j 12.8 | 9 | 5 | 73.4 | 13 | 6 The following is a summ, iry of t as] lington 'ounty 'on I I i •a ©I * &lt;g e | 2£» oS°-§ S8S -os o S ca = £« 1-2! a ■ &gt; 3-g2 §8S S-S o |c§« % | % | % | 10 | 5 72.8 15 | 10 I 5 75.8 9 9 5 76.7 8 9 | 5 81.6 | 5 9 j 5 83.3 I 4 c CSC &lt;s o o BOO 4 7 8 10 11 Bu. $ % 63.8 19.52 57.5 58.0 21.57 52.2 57.1 22.63 j 51.3 56. 5 24.74 | 50.8 56.4 25.35 | 50.7 [4 |*j 49.0 f .4 38.0 8.6 34.0 11.4 27.2 16.8 24.7 18.6 7 4 3 2 1 </seg>

            <seg id="p303">305 RKPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE METHODS USED IN WINNING THE CORN YIELD CONTEST IN REGION 1. Emil I'rusa Howells. Nebraska My farm was homestead by Charles Stevens in 1872 and since that time has been in the hands of renters for thirty-six years. A few years ago it was not only run down- but was "sick" so far as crop pro - duction was concerned. About all that it could produce was sunflowers and cockleburs. I went on the place in 1919 and finished the work of seeding down to clover and alfalfa and that year had only hay. Then in 1920, thirty-five acres of clover and alfalfa sod which had been on the place when I moved there made close to eighty bushels of corn per acre. In 1921 these same thirty-five acres made fifty-five bushels and another twenty-five acres of clover sod, the whole of which was manured, made about seventy bushels of corn per acre. In 1922, fifty-five acres of corn produced an average of seventy - one bushels. Some twenty-five acres of this was corn after corn, and thirty acres were on the sod of the alfalfa I seeded in 1919. Alfalfa sod with a good stand of corn was the thing that made good corn for me. I have found that the alfalfa and clovers add nitrogen to the soil and make it much more loose and open. They also increase the water holding capacity of the soil by building up the vegetable matter, and all these things together made the high yield for me. My farm is on rolling loess soil in the northern part of Colfax County. This is the same sort of soil that extends east to the Missouri River. The main soil problem is keeping up the organic matter and nitrogen. In preparing this land I plowed it the last part of September and first part of October at a depth of about 4% inches. I double disked and harrowed this just before planting, and drilled in the corn 3% feet apart. The corn was a smooth, dimple dent of a yellow variety that for the past four years I have been selecting to suit my ideas to secure early maturity, smoothness and low down ears. The stand was prac - tically perfect, in fact, possibly a little too thick as the stalks were only about nine inches apart. The first cultivation about the middle of June was with an ordinary cultivator. The second and third cultivations were with a disc culti - vator. The ten acres entered in the contest were a part of a thirty - acre field all of which made right at seventy bushels per acre. </seg>

METHODS USED IN WINNING THE CORN YIELD CONTEST IN REGION II. Mr. Bert Mott, Hastings, Nebraska There are many things to take into consideration in the production of corn. In the first place the seed should be selected before freezing weather from high producing corn and germination should be at least 90 per cent, and 95 per cent would be much better. My experience has been that you cannot tell by the looks of seed corn weather it is high producing seed corn or not — it may be fine show corn and still would not be good seed. For this section of the state I prefer an early maturing variety, </seg>

The early varieties nearly always mature before frost and quality is preferable even at a sacrifice in quantity. Most farmers here prefer listing rather than plowing the ground and check- The principal crops grown in this section are corn, wheat, and oats, and by rotating these crops as much as possible increases the yield and keeps the crops more free from weeds and disease. My opinion is that one year's experience in the Contest is not suffi - cient so that I could advise others as to the best methods to use in the production of corn, but under the plan of the Agricultural College in a five-year period we should be able to secure some data that will prove to be very valuable. The field of corn which I entered in the contest has been cropped continuously for the past twenty-three years and the last two years has been in corn. This ground was given the same care as all of my other corn ground, namely, double disced early to conserve moisture, planted with a lister May 17 and 18, using the plate so as to drop the corn 10 inches apart, cultivated, twice with the go-dig, harrowed once, laying by with a six-shovel cultivator and cultivating very shallow. During the year we had about the average rainfall for this section. We started cribbing November 1, and weighed this corn over a neighbor's scale and found the yield to be 52.40 bushels per acre. A sample was sent to the Experiment Station at Lincoln, Nebraska, for a moisture test. The per cent of moisture was found to be low which is a very common characteristic of this corn, and which brought the yield up to 54 bushels per acre. PRESIDENT DANLY: W. C. Fitch who won first place in the Western Nebraska Region is here and will discuss his method of rais - ing corn. METHODS USED IN WINNING THE CORN YIELD CONTEST IN REGION III. Mr. W. C. Fitch, McCook. Out in our country, which is not considered a corn country, we are finding that we can grow corn. My corn was on ground that had been in corn for the last five years continuously. It was double disced and cultivated three times. What I gathered was not as good corn as a good many of my neighbors had. There are yields in my neighbor - hood that I am satisfied would make from 50 to 60 bushels and I had corn of my own in other fields that would make 50 bushels. But in </seg>
            <seg id="p306">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 308 the spring I picked out what I thought was my best piece of ground. But it was dry and, it being a little richer ground, was the first to burn. Alfalfa and clover are good to rotate with corn in the western part of the state the same as in other places. The first year it may burn if it is dry, but the second and third years you will get a good crop even if it is dry. We are glad to have this corn contest, and my neighbors would like to go in on it next year. We are finding that we can grow corn, and some have made as high as 70 or 80 bushels to the acre out there. Our soil will stand a continuous crop of corn for several years without other crops in rotation, but alfalfa is good to rotate with the corn, and sugar beets on the bottoms. Three times over the corn usually gives as good results as any, though this year the later cultivation would have benefited it. PRESIDENT DANLY: We are undertaking in this corn contest to do something that we have not done before, and that is to get farm - ers in here to tell us what they are doing. I can see from the figures that we have here that if this thing is carried out for 10 years we will have something very valuable. Of course one year's results do not mean so much, but next year we will carry this on and I am sure more men will enter the contest. We are planning to give them a little more time to explain their methods in our meeting here. ALFALFA SEED PRODUCTION Alfalfa is thought by many to be one of the oldest plants that is grown entirely as a forage crop. The original culture of alfalfa was F doubt in the vicinity of Persia or Media. According to Pling it ; introduced into Greece from Media or Persia about the year 1470 C. Alfalfa was cultivated rather extensively by the Greeks and the Romans. It was introduced into France and southern Germany and then to England about 1650. Although alfalfa was grown some by our early colonists on the Atlantic seaboard, it did not prove a suc - cessful crop. It was finally introduced from Chile, South America, into California in 1854, and then from California it spread eastward reaching Nebraska about 1875. According to Mr. S. C. Bassett's "His - tory of Buffalo County", alfalfa was first introduced into the south - western part of the state somewhere in the vicinity of Beaver City in Gradual Increase in Production, Seed Demand, and Supply. The spread of alfalfa over Nebraska and the United States has been gradual but rapid. In a period of 40 years the alfalfa acreage in F. D. Keim, College of Agriculture. </seg>
            <seg id="p307">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 309 Nebraska has grown to 1,125,000 acres, and according to the latest re - ports, Nebraska now ranks first in alfalfa production in the whole United States. The acreage of alfalfa in the United States has doubled about every 10 years since 1899. The present acreage in the United States is about 10,000,000 acres. It is estimated by the United States Department of Agriculture that about 1-7 of the acreage is re-seeded yearly. This means that about 1,400,000 acres of alfalfa is seeded every year, which if sown at the rate of 18 pounds per acre would re - quire more than 25,000,000 pounds or 420,000 bushels of seed annually. At the present time there is a very rapid increase in the alfalfa acreage in the states to our east. Wisconsin, Michigan, New York and the Corn Belt states are raising more and more alfalfa. These states have had to learn that alfalfa requires a sweet soil and that it is sometimes necessary to innoculate in order to get good results. They have also learned that even if alfalfa hay does get wet that it usually makes pretty fair feed and probably makes a much cheaper feed than if they have to ship it in from the west. These states are usually considered unsuited climatically for the production of alfalfa seed so that they should constitute a source of increasing demand for our western grown seed. Figures from the United States Department of Agriculture show that for the 12 years from 1911 to 1922, inclusive, we imported on the average 4,764,000 pounds or 79,405 bushels of alfalfa seed. In other words we are importing each year into the United States about 1-5 of our annual needs. It is interesting and important to know where this imported seed comes from. In the first place there is the effect of this seed on the price of our local seed, and second there is the question as to the value and adaptation of this imported seed. The following table will show the average yearly importations into the United States from 1919 to 1923: Total pounds 7,317,440 Italian seed, Turkestan, and Argentine seed especially is looked up - on with considerable suspicion from the standpoint of being adapted Country Exporting Argentina Canada Hhile England France Sermany italy South Africa Siberia furkey Jraguay )ther countries Pounds 3,426.400 19,240 49,920 364,320 400,420 49,400 1,953,240 87,880 744,500 34,740 32,900 154,480 </seg>

The United States imports a large amount of alfalfa seed annually, much of which is unsuitable for Nebraska. to our Nebraska conditions. At the present time it is somewhat a debatable question just how serious we should consider this importer! Ed, but there is little question but red. Mr. H. L.

For instance the most southern point at hich seed is grown has a latitude of New York City, but has the tem - erature of southern Texas. The ground rarely if ever freezes, and le climate on the whole is mild. And yet you will notice from the able that Argentina is one of the heaviest alfalfa seed exporting ountries into the United States. Recent reports show that importa - ons for the last few years from Argentina has been even greater than le figures in the table indicate. Varieties and Strains. It would seem from the present opinion of our Agricultural Exper - ment Stations that it is quite necessary to obtain seed that is adapted to the particular region in which it is to be grown. Montana, Idaho, lie Dakotas, Minnesota and the Dominion of Canada all are very em - hatic in their alfalfa publications that the Grimm and Baltic varieties r other hardy varieties are much to be preferred over the southern Town seed. Here in Nebraska I think J can say it is the general pinion that Common alfalfa will stand our winters in good shape, and 'will usually yield about the same as these northern varieties. It is possible that in some' of our northern counties it would pay us to grow these northern varieties. </seg>
            <seg id="p309">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 311 I think I can also say that there is comparatively little difference between irrigated and non-irrigated alfalfa seed providing they are grown in the same regions. In other words it is not serious to plant alfalfa seed in Nebraska on dry land that has been grown under light irrigation. Fig. 17 — Unadapte.l alfalfa steel has been the cause of much of our winter - killing troublf. Factors Affecting Seed Production MOISTURE Alfalfa intended for seed production should be supplied with the minimum amount of moisture that will insure a medium vegetative growth and still provide an adequate supply of water to insure the maturity of the seed. In other words it is not desirable to have ex - cessive moisture present in the soil or excessive rains during the growth periods because this condition stimulates vegetative growth and when we have large vegetative growth we do not get a very good set of alfalfa seed. It is necessary however to have enough moisture present to mature the seed in good shape so that it is not badly shriveled. TEMPERATURE There seems to be a very close relation between the effects of heat and light to the proper functioning of the processes of reproduction. It seems that direct sunshine adds much in tripping the flowers so that pollination can take place readily. You have often observed I am sure that the heaviest seed production on a plant is usually on the outer edges and many times on the lower branches. An interesting illustra - tion is given in the Colorado Bulletin No. 257 of where an irrigation ditch was made and ran very close to a row of alfalfa. Then for </seg>
            <seg id="p310">312 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE some reason or other there was no water run into this ditch but it re - mained dry throughout the summer. Where those alfalfa plants hung down over that hot, sandy soil there was almost a perfect seed set. So it seems that temperature and sunshine are really very important from the seed standpoint. SOIL LMany alfalfa seed growers prefer comparatively sandy to sandy m soil, and especially where the water table is not closer to the sur - face than 6 to 8 feet. It has been found where the water is too near the surface there is a large vegetative growth and this in turn is not good for seed production. Heavy clay soils usually produce good seed if the drainage is ample. In any case it would seem that moisture must not be excessive. Rich bottom lands are not good for seed production since usually that type of soil will give a very large vegetative growth. Of course this 'type of land usually makes splendid hay yields. Sloping fields especially those that slope to the south where the sun's rays strike more vertically are usually considered very good fields for seed production. I remem - ber once visiting in Scotts Bluff County and talking with a farmer who had raised what he thought was Grimm alfalfa seed for many years. He showed us his old original field. The stand was very thin and the land was rather sloping off toward the south. He claimed that he could raise alfalfa seed on this field when he could not raise it on any other land that he owned. Just at the higher edge of this field ran an old irrigation ditch. He said he found that it was some times neces - sary during an unusually dry year to irrigate lightly for his first crop of hay. Then he had found that it was better not to irrigate at all for his second seed crop unless it was unusually dry and even in this event he irrigated very lightly. This he could do very readily because his field was sloping and the water would not stay in one place very long. VARIETIES OR STRAINS There has been some little work done in the selection of strains within a variety for seed production. Blinn of the Colorado Station reports that he has selected out strains that are much better yielders than the original. From the literature I was able to review there seemed to be very little difference between our ordinary commercial varieties and their ability of setting seed. EFFECTS OF CULTIVATION Some Experiment Stations, Idaho for one, claims that weeds can be removed and the stand made thinner by cultivating the alfalfa fields and that this increases both the quality and quantity of seed produced. Colorado reports no results obtained along this line. It would seem from the theoretical standpoint that light applications of well rotted manure in which the weed seeds have been killed and light cultivation with spring toothed harrows to get rid of the weeds which are usually </seg>
            <seg id="p311">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 313 prevalent in very thin stands might give better yields, clean hay and weed-free seed. I can not back this statement by experimental evi - dence, but I have seen numerous instances where this practice has been adopted and where I have been convinced that it added to the farmer's success. UNIFORM THIN STAND Almost every man who has worked on this problem makes the statement that it is necessary to have a uniform thin stand for the best seed production. There is a lot of discussion of whether alfalfa should be planted in rows or whether it should be seeded with a drill or broadcasted for seed purposes. In general the opinion seems to be that if alfalfa is planted in rows the rows should not be too far apart, and one should plant from 2 to 5 pounds of seed per acre. One of the chief difficulties with the row method is keeping the fields free from weeds. Then again, alfalfa in rows spreads out in a decumbent fashion and this makes it difficult to mow especially in low places. It has also been the writer's experience that hay cut from alfalfa planted in rows is likely to be dirty. The ground not being well sodded over gives the rake an opportunity to pick up dust and dirt. I think usually rather thin broadcaster or drilled fields are considered better for seed production. At any rate whatever method is used it is neces - sary to have rather stout bushy plants for heavy seed setting. WIND It is usually considered that a reasonable amount of wind is good for alfalfa because it aids in tripping the flowers and thus aids in pol - lination. It is also of advantage to have a certain amount of wind in that it keeps the plant and soil drier at most times and this moisture question seems to be very important. BEES AND OTHER INSECTS It was thought some years back that it was absolutely necessary that we have bees or other insects present in order to have seed pro - duction from alfalfa or other common legumes. There is no clear evidence, however, at this time that bees or other insects are absolutely essential to alfalfa seed production. It is thought by many that they help, but it has been found that even where plants have been grown under screens they still have obtained fairly good setting of seed. CUTTING TO BE USE FOR SEED Ordinarily the second cutting of alfalfa is saved for seed. This varies however under different conditions. In the west where the rain - fall is from 15 to 18 inches and the alfalfa makes a rather slow short growth, it is sometimes best to leave the first cutting for seed. In central and most of eastern Nebraska it is usually considered best to use the second. In conditions a little father south and east it has been found that some years even the third cutting will make fairly good seed. </seg>
            <seg id="p312">314 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE HARVESTING THE SEED CROP It is thought best usually to harvest alfalfa for seed when the reater portion of the seeds have taken on a bright yellow color and re what one would call ripe. At this time over one-half of the seeds n the plants are hardened and ripe. Pods at the top of the plant sually ripen last. In low altitudes where no danger from frost exists ne might even wait a little bit longer. It is important not to cut the Ifalfa for seed when it is too green. If this is done the immature seed takes on a greenish color and the seeds are badly shriveled. The roper time of harvesting requires a lot of good judgment from the tandpoint of the grower. Ordinarily it is good practice to harvest for seed when it is somewhat damp so as to avoid shattering. MACHINERY USED Probably one of the best machines for harvesting alfalfa, sweet over, red clover, etc., is the old time self rake reaper. This machine s still used extensively in some places where they make the raising of gume seeds a business. The ordinary grain binder can be used if the alfalfa has made large enough growth. It is usually necessary to retch a canvas under the bundle packers so that any seed that is spat - ered off will be collected and saved. Mowers can be used and espec - lly those with windrower attachments. It is necessary to place the ut swath to one side so that the horses do not walk over it when mak - ng the next round. It is necessary to bunch and cock at once. Small ocks usually dry quicker and are handier because one is able to lift »em on the wagon with one try with a fork. Any method which lends tself to the smallest amount of handling is ordinarily preferred. One : course should never trample a load of alfalfa that has been harvested or seed. If it is stacked it should be stacked in rather narrow tall tacks and should be covered at once with some form of stack cover, "ight racks should be used. Why not use tight racks all the time or at east have "tarps" thrown over the rack. I have often thought of the normous number of shin bones that might have been saved a genuine tanging upif all the racks in use were tight bottomed racks. And then ; is surprising the amount of grain one of these types of racks will ave. I would venture to say that during a threshing season of 3 or weeks one would save enough wheat to feed his entire farm flock of lickens for a year. The alfalfa or clover huller is the best machine to use in threshing. Ordinary threshing machines are often used. It is usually necessary to add additional concaves and extra sieves and even then it is very diffi - cult to get all the seed. Many threshing machines are now equipped with huller attachments. Sometimes the huller or huller attachment will clean the seed in good shape but usually it is necessary to run the seed through regular cleaning machinery before it would be called No. 1 seed. </seg>
            <seg id="p313">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 315 Good Quality. Good quality is absolutely necessary in any type of seed production. Frost bitten, shriveled, or weedy seed should never be given preference over the better quality even though it is offered at a much lower figure. I remember climbing off a freight train up at Winnebago in the northern part of the state some years ago, and while walking around over the platform waiting for the old engine to do some switching, I ran across 6 or 8 two-bushel of alfalfa seed on the platform. One of these sacks was badly torn and this seed was scattered, of course, all around, I thought the seed looked unusually funny for good alfalfa seed and therefore took several handfuls, placed it in my pocket and brought it to Lincoln with me. After arriving here I tried to pick out the various weed seeds and other foreign material, but finding it would be an enormous job I sent it to our State Seed Analyst who is located in the Capitol building, and requested her to make a germination and purity test for me. When that sample came back I found that it contained 43,920 weed seeds per pound. Seeding this seed at the rate of 16 pounds per acre, 4392 weed seeds including 2781 dodder seeds would have been sown on each square rod. The alfalfa seed had a germination of about 60 r /&lt;-. Now some farmer planted this alfalfa seed on his land. It is not hard to imagine what that poor fellow was up against.. He not only paid good money for seed that was worse than worthless but he planted it on land that would have probably made him a good crop if he had planted good seed. And he had this terrible mass of weeds to fight for years 'to come. I cannot stress enough the importance of sending seed to the State Seed Analyst and finding out exactly what we are planting on our land. We usually consider that it is good practice to buy or exchange seed from farmer to farmer, and yet even here it is necessary for either the buyer and the seller to know exactly what he is buying or selling. This problem brings in a rather serious proposition to farmers who make it a business of growing small grass and legume seed. Or - dinarily the farm seed is sold directly to some seedsman who buys and cleans it before it is placed on the market. In case a large asso - ciation is formed it no doubt would be a paying proposition to have a centrally located cleaning plant in which all seed must be passed through before it is placed on the market. Hard seed, that is seed with a hard seed coat, sometimes presents a real problem. A germination test usually reveals the amount of hard seed. Seed companies and seed as - sociations usually run the alfalfa and sweet clover seed through a machine known as a scarifier which scratches the seed coat and makes it more permeable to water, and this increases the germination per cent. Marketing Growers should investigate markets. Many times excellent seed is grown on a farm and it is sold not to the highest bidder, but to the first fellow that comes along and wants it.

There is a good demand for Nebraska grown alfalfa seed. The grower should feel and realize that if his seed is of good quality he can demand the best of prices for it. SEED PRODUCTION SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN. IAt best in the corn belt alfalfa seed production is uncertain. It necessary nearly every year for a man to make a decision whether not he should allow this field to stand for seed or to cut it for hay. the ground is wet and the crop is making a rank vigorous growth at ssoming time the crop should be cut for hay. If there is extreme, ivy rainfall during the blossoming time even though the conditions ■ceding have been favorable for seed development, it is probably best cut for hay. Following heavy rains new growth usually starts ickly and this new growth coming up among the seeded plants is lally very bad from the seed standpoint, and this sort of situation mid usually be handled by cutting the crop for hay. It seems to the iter that there is little question that if the situation is watched sely a great deal more alfalfa seed could be produced in Nebraska. / I feel sure that we have a big chance of becoming one of the best alfalfa seed producing states in the Union. I thoroughly believe that raising a crop of alfalfa seed now and then will add appreciably to the farmers income. It seems to me that we can still increase our alfalfa acreage all over those parts of the state where it can be grown profit - ably to rather large extent. It is quite a well known fact that our al - falfa lands for years have been the best paying parts of the farm and I believe this will continue for some years to come. I It seems to me that there are two big things necessary in order to ike alfalfa seed production really of great importance to Nebraska, the first place we must have enough alfalfa acreage so that we do t need it all for hay. We cannot risk hay shortages even though we ow that money is to be made by growing alfalfa seed. In the second ice we must establish a reasonably certain supply of seed each year, hen we think of Valley county we usually think of pop corn. Now it sms to me that we must establish alfalfa seed communities or asso - itions so that buyers will know where to go. If these communities n furnish a fairly constant supply of fine quality seed these buyers 11 not only know where to go but will go and will pay good prices for MR. SASS: In Douglas county we have tried leaving alfalfa for seed and it doesn't pay. One year we did get a crop of seed.

KEIM: I am not advocating the growing of alfalfa seed in Eastern Nebraska, but I do believe that it can be raised in the western two-thirds of the state and that is the area I am talking about. MR. REAM: Our farm is on valley land and the only place we can raise seed successfully is on spots one and a half to two feet higher than the rest of the land, and there it will grow fairly well. MR. SASS: I sowed the first alfalfa patch in Douglas County in 1889. We had no frost until in November and the third crop matured for seed, and every time except that I have failed to grow alfalfa seed. Those who saved the second cutting that year had fine seed because it was a dry season, and grew a short stem which was absolutely full seed. MR. KEIM: Haven't some years gone by when you might have grown seed? MR. SASS: All of those dry years we might have had seed MR. KEIM: I know in Nuckolls County we have let many years go by when we could have raised good alfalfa seed, because we didn't want to lose the hay. MR. REAM: I would like to make one suggestion. I have reach - ed a point where I never leave the crop for seed except under one con - dition. If the crop is in full bloom and I have plenty of moisture in the sub-soil, then I am sorely tempted to leave it for seed, because those conditions I think are favorable. MR. SASS: Our vegetation is eo heavy in Douglas County and where you have a good stand of alfalfa in the field the growth is too dense to get a profitable seed crop. MR. HEINLE: My experience in raising alfalfa seed a little fur - ther west than the one hundredth meridian is that you must watch the season and if you don't get too much growth of foliage you can prob - ably get seed. I had a field one year that was so dry we didn't get much growth of foliage. There were different parts of the field where you could see that it was getting sub-irrigation and there it produced good seed. If the season is favorable you can get seed but if not you had better cut it for hay. Sometimes I have noticed that the frost seems to help ripen the seed and you might cut it only the second day before threshing, then take the hay buck and push it right up to the separator and feed it in evenly and get good results. That is for the region north of Valentine. A MEMBER: It is about an even break out in our country, the </seg>

CHAIRMAN AND BROTHER FARMERS: I have been asked o talk on the subject of sweet clover and that reminds me of a story. A circus came to town and like all other circuses they had their side lows and menageries and one thing or another. Si was walking up and down and taking in the various things and he heard some speaker say it only cost twenty-five cents for a man and his family to see the lippopotamus and as Si had only a wife and seventeen children he lought it was fair enough. So he went out and collected his family and went back and started into the side show to see the hippopotamus nd finally the spealer said "Hold on, is this all your family?" Si said, "it certainly it," and the spealer said "here, take back your quarter, t will do my hippopotamus as much good to see your family as it will o your family to see my hippopotamus. Now I feel that it is going o do me as much good to hear a discussion on this subject as it will ou for me to say something on it. I take it I am to hit the high laces. As I am not a public speaker I have taken the pains to write own what I wish to say. Madison County a Pioneer Sweet Clover Area. Some years ago, about the time the legislature put sweet clover in he class with noxious weeds, Val Kuska, then County Agent of Madison bounty, invited me over to talk to the farmers there on alfalfa. It was "Alfalfa Day" over there and a caravan of about 25 cars traveled rom one farm to another studying the old and new fields of alfalfa n that section. Sweet clover was a new crop in Madison County at hat time and some of us stopped to visit a farmer, whose name I do not now recall, who was giving sweet clover a trial. This farmer had 12 milk cows and about 25 head of hogs running on 6 acres of sweet clover and it was apparent that they could not keep it down. The farmer old us that the milk flow of his cows increased materially when he &gt;ut them on sweet clover, and expressed great confidence in the future of sweet clover. I was skeptical at the time like many others, but </seg>
            <seg id="p317">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 319 since seeing is believing, I became a convert and preached sweet clover, when I didn't have nerve enough to seed it on my own farm for fear of incurring the displeasure of some of my neighbors. In spite of the fact that we have now, as we had 25 years ago, farmers who know all about farming, and who look upon the Agricultural School, the Exper - iment Station, the Extension Service, and County Agent as an unneces - sary burden to the tax payer, we have thus far been able to keep these institutions going, and as a result, we are making some progress. A few years ago sweet clover was looked upon as a noxious weed; now it vies with alfalfa and other legume crops for popular favor. While I am enthusiastic about sweet clover, I am willing to concede that it has its limitations, and that under certain conditions, alfalfa as well as the other clovers may prove more desirable. How We Seed Sweet Clover. We use only the highest test scarified seed that we can buy. We seed with oats, as early as possible in the spring, at the rate of 14 to 16 pounds per acre. Some seed and disc it down with the oats but we generally seed after the oats has been seeded and harrowed in. It would seem that with all the rain we had this spring, that seeding after would be the better way, but the best sweet clover we had this year was disked in with the oats. There are probably other successful ways of seeding sweet clover but this is our way and it has been very success - ful. Our Uses- of Sweet Clover. We grow sweet clover as a soil builder and pasture crop, but some - times we cut it for hay. It also has value as a seed and silage crop, but our remarks will be confined largely to our experience with the crop. As a Soil Builder. We seed sweet clover with all our small grain. When it is our purpose to plow it under in the fall, we usually seed only 4 or 5 pounds per acre and haul what manure we can on the field before it is plowed. This year we had a fairly good stand and it was 18 inches high when we plowed it under. Some don't approve of fall plowing. They claim that the sweet clover will come up in the corn the following. How - ever if the plow lays are sharp and a good job of plowing is done, so that the crowns are destroyed, there will be no danger of sweet clover next year; at least, we have never had any trouble of that sort. In one field of oats, that we rented out this year, sweet clover came in as a volunteer crop. This field was in sweet clover pasture a few years ago. Last year it was in corn and this year in oats. The sweet clover came up thick and grew as vigorous as any we seeded. This makes excellent feed for horses, that are now running in the stalks. </seg>
            <seg id="p318">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 320 Next spring about the middle of May or perhaps later when there is about a ton per acre of growth on the field, we will plow it and plant a medium early variety of corn. This sort of treatment gives the soil tilth and is just as good as a coat of manure to enrich the soil. The roots are large and grow quite deep into the soil, making it porous, and building up the humus and mineral matter in the top soil. When sweet clover is seeded for the express purpose of soil improvement, that is to say where one wants to build up a particularly poor piece of ground, one can let it grow the second year until it gets rank in the fall. In this way, humus and doubtless more fertility, is added to the soil than in any other way. It is practically impossible to plow under a heavy growth, however, except with a tractor. As a Hay Crop. As a hay crop I do not consider sweet clover in a class with alfalfa, •"or, excepting the first cutting in the fall of the first year, it does not lave the quality, it seldom produces as much, and is by no means as ertain as alfalfa. It is better, I would say, to have some alfalfa and epend upon sweet clover to make up the deficiency, rather than to de - tend upon sweet clover entirely. In fact, if the crop is not needed or pasture and a substitute is wanted for alfalfa hay, I would recom - mend for our section, common red clover. Red clover is a good short rotation crop and produces a good quality of hay with a reasonable egree of certainty. A year ago last spring, we seeded 28 acres to sweet clover. We larvested 48 bushels per acre of oats, a full crop in other words, and n the fall we cut a ton and a half to two tons of hay per acre, that was the equal of any alfalfa hay. A full crop of oats and a ton and half of first quality hay per acre, made this land as valuable as any we had. The sweet 'clover grew almost as tall as the oats and where t was especially heavy, we cut two stacks of oats hay. For milk ows and growing stock, it is doubtful if one can get anything better. f one needs the hay more than the grain, this is the cheapest and best way to handle it. The threshed straw was mixed with sweet clover and the cattle were crazy about it. They ate it in preference to good wild hay. If properly handled one can make a cutting of hay in the pring of the second year, but we pasture the second year crop. There s much less danger of killing out the crop where it is pastured rather han mowed off even if cut rather high. Pasture. This spring we turned 65 head of cattle, mostly two-year old steers onto this 28 acres of sweet clover. They also had access to about 20 acres of blue grass and white clover pasture through which the creek runs, where they had to drink. I watched these cattle often; they laid in the shade all day and toward evening headed for the sweet </seg>
            <seg id="p319">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 321 clover where they stayed until the following noon when they came back for a drink. There was a lane 30 rods long connecting the two pastures, so the cattle had to go out of their way to get on the sweet clover, and yet we hear people say that cattle won't eat sweet clover. There is no trouble in getting stock to eat sweet clover pasture, un- ■ Fig. 18 — As a pasture plant and soil builder, sweet clover holds first place. less the growth is too big and tough when the stock is turned in on it for the first time. When we seed sweet clover for pasture, we use 12 pounds of sweet clover and 6 pounds of timothy. This makes excellent pasture and our cattle were at no time able to keep it down. In fact it grew up rank and went to seed, but the timothy still furnishes some pasture. We had other pasture but didn't need it. For permanent pasture I would add a little blue grass to the mixture, and I believe that is a mixture easy to start and hard to beat when once it is started. Sweet clover not only adds considerably to the quantity and quality of pasture, but the growth of other grasses will be improved by the addi - tion of humus and nitrogen to the soil. For best results stock should be turned onto sweet clover pasture as soon as it furnishes a good mouthful. At this time clover is very succulent and if cattle have access to a straw pile or can be fed some wild hay they will do much better than they otherwise would, besides this is a good way to utilize roughage that would othei-wise go to waste. When sweet clover is seeded each year, the second year growth can be pastured until the small grain is harvested and the stock can then be turned on spring seeding. When handled in this way one has good pasture all season and second year seeding can be cut for seed. When second year growth is pastured the plants send out many young shoots close to the ground making a larger number of plants to mature seed or to be plowed under than when cut for hay. Hog Pasture. For hog pasture we seeded four pounds of sweet clover to two to three pounds of rape and two bushels of oats. Ordinarily I would say that that proportion of seed should be doubled, but the season seemed </seg>
            <seg id="p320">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 322 to be especially favorable and I got an excellent stand. I believe this combination will furnish as much pasture as alfalfa and is as well relished by the hogs. Pasture of this sort will ordinarily carry twenty - five or more shoats per acre. If there is not sufficient stock to keep it down it should be clipped occasionally or cut for hay. Some years ago experiments at the Iowa Station showed that sweet clover carried more pigs per acre, produced cheaper gains and more net profit per acre than either red clover or rape. The New Jersey station found that a mixture of rape and sweet clover produced more pastureage than alfalfa and was preferred to alfalfa by the hogs. It was seeded at the rate of six pounds of Dwarf Essex Rape and ten pounds of sweet clover per acre. There are still many farmers who consider sweet clover a noxious weed but its merits have been proven on many farms and it is bound to come into popular favor. We often hear it said that cattle will not bloat on sweet clover but I found two or three head of dead steers on my sweet clover this sum - mer. I took the cattle off and thought they would have to quit dying after awhile; but in the meantime my neighbor had some cattle on nothing but sweet clover and they were perfectly all right; he had some cattle on blue grass and sweet clover pasture and he lost two calves on that and very nearly lost his herd bull from bloat. I find the best authorities are claiming that there is a chance of cattle bloat - ing on sweet clover in a wet season such as we have had the past year. QUESTION: Do I understand that these cattle that died had access to white clover and blue grass? MR. THOMPSON: Yes, there was white clover and blue grass in the pasture where a creek run through and the cattle went down there to drink but they spent most of the time on the sweet clover. QUESTION: Would you recommend sowing sweet clover in run - down pastures to build them up? ANSWER: Yes, I do QUESTION: Do you think that running cattle on it is a good way to get a good stand? ANSWER: I think it might help sometimes. QUESTION: Do you inoculate on new ground, when seeding clover ? ANSWER: No. I never have found any place where it needs inoculation. We have a sort of limestone soil, but it has never been necessary for us to inoculate to get a stand. QUESTION: I have found that alfalfa grows in some parts of a field and will not in others. Have you had any trouble in seeding a field to alfalfa after having grown sweet clover on it? </seg>
            <seg id="p321">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AORICTLTfKK 323 ANSWER: I have never had any such trouble. QUESTION: What about sowing sweet clover and rape together? Do you get good results? ANSWER: Yes, we do. But we generally get about all the rain we need. I seed mine with oats because it comes on earlier and fur - nishes earlier pasture, and the other crop comes on later. QUESTION: What about the pasturing capacity of sweet clover? ANSWER: I know many of you may doubt my statement, per - haps, but I pastured three hundred head of hogs on about six acres of clover during the better part of the growing season. QUESTION: Did you ever try sowing sweet clover on winter rye in the spring? ANSWER: I never have tried it QUESTION: Do you find any advantage from using the yellow sweet clover variety? ANSWER: I have had no experience with the yellow clover at all. QUESTION: How close do you cut your oats and sweet clover hay? MR. THOMPSON: If you cut it the first year it doesn't make any special difference, but it is the second year that you must be care - ful about cutting sweet clover. The first crop of the second year comes from buds just below the surface of the ground and after that the buds form on the stem. If the growth is very rank and thick the buds along the bottom of the stems will die off and if you cut the plants too low you have nothing for the second growth to start from. It is necessary to examine fields before you know how high to cut the stubble. You should leave at least one bud on each stalk and there should be an inch and a half or two inches above the bud because there is a chance for the stem to dry out and dry the bud out with it. The first year it makes no difference how short you cut it. In fact it is pretty hard to kill sweet clover the first year; even the hogs have a hard time killing it and they like sweet clover roots pretty well. QUESTION: Did you have success in getting sweet clover started in the blue grass pasture? MR. THOMPSON: I have never tried it out but we have had places where soil was washed in and sweet clover was spread consider - ably just from the cattle passing seed in the droppings. I imagine if the soil was so you could disk it and get the seed in the ground you could sow it in any land of that kind. DR. SKIDMORE: I would like to make an additional remark </seg>
            <seg id="p322">324 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE about animals on sweet clover. It was said a few years ago that there are certain oils that prevent animals from bloating on sweet clover. Perhaps they don't bloat as often as with some other plants but we occasionally receive letters from live stock owners who say they have lost cattle which bloated on sweet clover and they were surprised to know that such a thing could happen. So we must remember that cattle will bloat on sweet clover. QUESTION: Have you any grass will run out sweet clover? experience to know whether blue MR. THOMPSON: There is a possibility of that kind but I imagine that depends a good deal on where it is. I believe there is an instance of a case over in Iowa where it was seeded twenty years ago and there are indications now that the blue grass is going to run it out. QUESTION: Then is it fair to say that blue grass will not crowd out sweet clover? Sweet clover is a biennial and I suggest that your animals have eaten it so short no seed has been developed. MR. THOMPSON: I would say the way to pasture a field of that kind is to pasture it so that some will go to seed as that is the only way to keep it going. PRESIDENT DANLY: We certainly appreciate the information Mr. Thompson has given us on this subject. A question arose a moment ago in regard to the inoculation of alfalfa and sweet clover seed and if Mr. Crocker of Filley is here I wish he would answer on that question. MR. CROCKER: The experience we have had in the inoculation of sweet clover seed is where we tried it on poor soil. It would not grow a crop of corn very well nor a maximum crop of small grain. The corn that grew on this place made 36 bushels to the acre and in an adjoining field it made 70 bushels, as that field had been in alfalfa in previous years. When we sowed the oats, as Mr. Thompson has ex - plained, we sowed our sweet clover seed at the same time. We drilled the oats in and had our broadcasting seeder attachment on the front of the drill for the small seed. Then we followed the drill with the packer and got a good germination in that way. We started around this old field with our drill and went a certain number of rows seeding sweet clover seed that was not inoculated, and then we put in the inoculated seed. When the seed came up the sweet clover seemed to all come about the same time. Both the inoculated seed and that which was not inoculated grew for a number of weeks just the same, but at har - vest time the seed that was inoculated stood much higher than the other in the stubble. The weather was somewhat dry at the harvest season. Had it been a wet season it might have been different but </seg>
            <seg id="p323">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 325 the dry season continued and on the stubble where it had not been inoculated the small plants soon died, while on the inoculated area quite large plants continued to grow and next season we used it for early pasture and then expected to plow it. Before we got it plowed the County Agent came and took a picture of this field. Once in a while we could see a plant where we had not inoculated the seed. This proved that inoculation that season under those conditions was just the right thing. It might have been different under different con - ditions. We went around the field and wherever we went we could tell the difference between the inoculated area and that which was not inoculated. Our experiences in eastern Nebraska seem to have been the same as Mr. Thompson's on sweet clover. Further west and in a dry cli - mate it may show differently and maybe harvest differently — I don't know.&gt; I would like to tell one more experience. In one 36 acre lield we sowed sweet clover in the spring and had a good stand, as thick as blue grass sod. It came up very thick. We had 12 head of horses, 12 head of cattle, and 200 head of hogs on that field. We fed the hogs a little buttermilk with it and they all lived on that 36 acres. With the abund - ance of foliage and amount of stock that you can put on sweet clover, together with its soil building effects, there is nothing to compete with it in the way of a temporary pasture crop. While we have never had any trouble with bloat, I believe that cat - tle will occasionally die on sweet clover. With horses we never had any trouble of course and they like it as well as alfalfa. I don't want to take too much time, but I am crazy about sweet clover. It is the greatest thing we know anything about when it comes to pasture purposes. The first crop is all right for hay; we found the second crop a little coarse and hard to put up. Our experience is limited but it has gone far enough so that we think sweet clover is the greatest crop we know anything about. HANDLING OF SWEET CLOVER SEED IN EASTERN NEBRASKA. By Wayland Magee, Douglas County. Last Christmas my father ,who has a liberal turn of mind, made me a present of Mark Twain's Autobiography, and as I knew that standing on a platform is not exactly in my line, and fearing that I might be embarrassed, I thought I would start out by repeating an experience which Mark Twain recounts in that book, which might be of interest to you, and would serve the purpose of bringing me down to earth so that I might better talk on this subject of "Handling Sweet Clover Seed in Eastern Nebraska", which has been assigned to me. </seg>
            <seg id="p324">326 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE It appears that Mr. Clemens had a good many friends among the politicians, and one of these friends was representing his constituents in Washington, and was a personal friend of President Grant. It so hap - pened that when Mark Twain was in Washington as a cub reporter, he was asked by his friend if he would like to meet the president, to which, of course, he acceded. The interview was arranged and at the proper time they all went to the White House, and Mr. Clemens was presented to President Grant, whereupon there fell a great silence, and Mr. Clemens found himself unable to speak or do more than formally greet the presi - dent. Finally after some effort, Mark Twain blurted out, "I am embar - rased, Mr. President, are you?" At this time I find myself very much in the same situation that Mr. Clemens did, for I am much more at home out on the farm than I am on a platform even speaking to farmers. This subject of sweet clover seed and its handling in eastern Ne - braska goes to the very root of this question, for when seeding time ar - rives every farmer contemplating the growing of sweet clover seed must go into the selection of the variety which he is to grow, and in C&gt;nsidering this matter the location of his farm is one of the elements hich should be taken into account very seriously. We have a few well known subdivisions of this plant to deal with. There is the strain known as Grundy County Sweet Clover which has been offered for sale through many of the seed houses both in Nebraska and Iowa, and which is propagated to a great extent in Grundy County, Illinois. Here in Nebraska we have had some experience with Grundy County Sweet Clover, and I have found it of no special value over the common white blossom. Then there is the Hubam Clover which is related to the Nebraska weet clovers, but is an annual; that is, we sow it in the spring /with the idea of plowing it under in the fall, and it also is a plant good for pecial uses only. The experience which I want to bring out and place emphasis on is that the common brand of sweet clover that grows along he highways as a volunteer crop nearly all over Nebraska, is the best »lant for ordinary farm conditions, and I put no emphasis on whether r ou buy the yellow or the white strains. Use of Scarified Seed. Another question that must be considered by the farmer selecting us seed is whether or not he will use scarified seed, or seed which still las the hulls on it. This brings up the question as to when we want o seed. If our seeding is to be done under eastern Nebraska condi - ions, we ordinarily have had the best success by using the hulled seed n the fall, sowing it on winter wheat or rye. If we use the unscarified seed we have met with the best success in putting it on the sugar snows </seg>
            <seg id="p325">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 327 in March; and if we are seeding scarified seed we can put it on with oats early in the spring. Sweet Soil is Essential In the neighborhood from which I come we have one set of condi - tions; then about one hundred miles west from the river you will find an entirely different set of conditions; and in the sand hills they have problems which are foreign to the other two sections. In each of these sections the local problems have generally been worked out by some farmer who will furnish advice, but this point they all ha*ve in common — that no matter where you grow sweet clover you must be sure that the soil has a fair percentage of lime present, as that is one of the plant food elements that experience has shown to be absolutely necessary. This question of lime is not a very live one in most sections of Nebraska, for the lime is now present, but there are places whei-e our soil is be - ginning to get reactions which show a lack of lime. Innoculation Not Beneficial. We in Douglas county have had the same experience that Mr. Thompson recounts. We thought that insomuch as nature had inoculated the plants growing along the highways, inoculation in the fields would be necessary. It was with this fact in mind that I bought bacteria from four different sources, and applied the different cultures to parallel strips in a large field of sweet clover as a matter of local test for my own future guidance. These tests were carefully carried out under the guidance of the men who had the cultures for sale, who brought their product to the farm and prepared the seed in a careful manner, keeping it always under cover and away from the sun, and allowing it to dry just the right degree. In other words they got a scald on it, and I think the experiment was a very fair one, but in interpreting it I saw no results that would wan-ant the expenditure of time or money. In other words, in Douglas county I am of the opinion we do not need in - oculation to get good results. Clipping Second Year Sweet Clover. We now come to the care of the plants, and in this matter there are a lot of different kinds of equipment that are found on the ordinary farm, and can be used. To take up, first, the subject of clipping or pasturing the second year's growth of the clover which, of course, is necessary if you do not want the crop to get away from you and grow up over your head where it is practically impossible to handle it; this clipping can be done with the ordinary mowing machine, or with a self - binder. Where the mowing machine is used a shoe should be made to fit the outside of the sickle bar. There is also an attachment put out by the International Harvester Company for handling the weeds, which is a short arm with a wheel, which can be attached to the outside of the </seg>
            <seg id="p326">328 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE sickle bar and adjusted so as to raise the bar some eight or ten inches off the ground. The use of these tools in clipping back the second year growth is necessary, for if you go into the field and cut the plants off close to the ground, you will kill the stand as it is from the lower branches that the new shoots come, and it is necessary to leave a few of these lower branches or buds in order to let the plant continue to live. Fig. 19 — A sweet clover plant showing the origin of the second year's growth from buds just below the surface of the soil. Note the old first year stem in the center. The slogan that I had planned to use here at this meeting has </seg>
            <seg id="p327">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 329 been exploded by Prof. Stewart. When I came down to make this talk I was under the impression that this plant did not have a crown as is the case with alfalfa, and so I had planned to call sweet clover, "Ne - braska's Uncrowned King," the idea being to force home to you the fact that in order to let sweet clover grow you had to cut it high, and not in the same way you would cut a plant which has a crown from which the new shoots start when the old growth has been cut off. But Prof. Stewart says that it has what might be called a crown, or at least crown buds at the end of the first year, and that the second year's growth comes from these buds, and he recommends that the second year growth, when clipped back, be left six or eight inches above the ground as otherwise the plants will be killed and you will fail in the desired Handling the Seed Crop. In handling the seed crop the most important thing is to start gath - ering your equipment early so as to be in readiness when the seed is ripe to cut. We thought the best way to get a seed crop was to £ut it with a self-binder and attach to the binder seed pans, as we called them, which would catch the seed which shattered when the operation was going on. One of these pans we attached to the frame of the binder under the inside end of the platform where the seed which fell on the platform canvas would be dumped into it, and any seed which fell from the elevator canvas would also be caught. The other pan we placed under the packer deck and had it so arranged that all seed fall - ing on the deck would be diverted into it. This plan is recommended by the federal government, and a description of the method of making these pans is given in Farmers Bulletin No. 836. They are not ex - pensive and are worth very much to the man who is trying to save seed. Fig. 20 — In eastern Nebraska the common white blossom sweet clover unless clipped or pastured, gets so tall and coarse that the seed crop is very difficult to harvest. </seg>
            <seg id="p328">330 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE We were successful in clipping back part of the field, but the re - maining part did not catch the drum and was allowed to grow so tall and rank and thick that it was almost impossible to drive a horse through it. We attempted to cut this field with a tractor and self - binder, and found that the dividing board of the binder did not operate in this field, which was almost as thick as hazel-brush, so we devised a dividing board of our own made from a full length of one and one - half inch galvanized water pipe bent into a large bow and fastened to the dividing board. This served to break away a section of the clover which then fell on to the platform of the binder, and was punched into the elevator by a man who rode on an improvised platform trailed be - hind the binder. The growth proved so thick that we took off every other stick on the reel and this helped very much in handling the brush. Another method I found in use during August in one of the coun - ties some hundred miles west, was devised by a man who had put a self-binder on a low geared wagon, and propelled the wagon with horse power, using a Cushman engine to run the binder. This device had gone through a six or eight foot crop of sweet clover and bound the tops of the plant into very neat bundles, and it struck me that it was a very practical arrangement. r. 21 — Binder rigged up for sweet clover seed cutting. Note the boxes to catch the shattered seed, that every other slat in the reel is removed, and the cart on which an extra man might ride to assist the sweet clover in starting up the elevator. </seg>
            <seg id="p329">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 331 Fig. 22 — Cutting white blossom sweet clover on the farm of W. W". Magee, of Douglas County. The points to remember are that the seed shatters badly, and therefore should be harvested when the plants are damp, either after a rain or early in the morning. We found that we could get the bundles through a threshi: g nachine, but we were not very expert in setting the machine, and we found that lots of the seed that came through still had its hulls on. The suggestion has been made that these hulls could be removed by setting the feed grinder in such a way that the seed could go through the grinder and not be broken, yet the hulls would be torn off. I have not tried that experiment myself. A method to scarify the seed on a farm has been suggested by the use of the blower of a silo filler where the U shaped pipe which is used on the top of the siio, had been lined with emery cloth so that the seed, when fed into the blower, would be forced against this emery cloth and so be scratched and scarified, which is all that scarifying is. There are certain things which affect the yield, but these are truisms, and when talking to farmers it is unnecessary to mention the fertiliz - ing of the soil, the thickness of the stand, time and method of seeding, covering of the seed, and the care of the plants after you have them. It is, however, very necessary to cut the growth of the second year crop in some way if you intend to harvest a seed crop. I think that in this matter we have on the farm a good deal more stock than any of the men who have talked here have mentioned, and I am satisfied that we did not have one-half enough. Plowing Up Sweet Clover. One of the points to be remembered is that there will be a great </seg>
            <seg id="p330">332 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE eal of seed shattered which will be on the ground, and it may be poor in the grade of future crops unless it is taken into consideration when ou are planning your field work. The method which seems to be gen - rally used in eastern Nebraska is to wait until the sweet clover has arted in the spring, (as it does very early) and then when the plants re a foot or so high, go in with plows and make a clean job of turning lem under. The old roots from the dead plants will not bother, and ' you kill the plants which have started you will be able to put in corn without interference from the clover, but it is to be expected that if the round is used for small grain for a year or two afterwards, there will &gt;e a voluntary growth of sweet clover on the field in the small grain. Now let us bring out some of these points. Who has a question that will bring out something that should have emphasis ? How would you cut sweet clover if it has morning glories all ugh it? MR. MAGEE: That is a very important question. Fields that are nfested with morning glories make a good deal of trouble when you ome to cut the sweet clover for a seed crop. We have had some ex - (erience, and have noted this: that the stand of morning glories is very much weakened by the shade of the sweet clover, where the stand is lick, and that when attempting to cut with a binder we found it nec - ssary to tie a sharp corn knife on the face of the dividing board so as o cut the vines and allow them to be bound with the rest of the brush. MR. THOMPSON: Did you ever try a corn binder? MR. MAGEE: No, but I understand that it is a very good tool to use if you can rig up something to catch the shattered seed, and this element of seed shattering is very important. Of course, where the clover is planted in drill rows, a corn binder is the proper harvest tool. We are in our infancy in handling this situation, but it is one of the things that we have to work with, and the more experiences that are brought out, the more we will learn about how to handle it. Has any - body here used a corn binder? LQ. Would it be just as well to pasture the first crop back awhile to cut it back? MR. MAGEE: Exactly. I think that a little clearing out with the use of cattle as a pasture crop is a mighty good idea, as that will let in a lot of sunlight and your plants will set more seed. The only thing is that it will make a very irregular field to handle when you come to the harvest Q. Can you give your sweet clover an over-dose of inoculation? MAGEE: As to an over-dose, I cannot say, as I do not know ugh about that. We gave one field four different kinds of inocula- </seg>
            <seg id="p331">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 333 tion, and I don't think you can say that in eastern Nebraska any one of these experiments made the plants any more healthy than the run of the field. One matter which must be given attention in the buyinn or preparing of seed is to look out for the brand of poor seed that has been coming from Europe. In this respect if any of your fellows can come down on a representative, ycu should remember that this law which provides for the coloring of imported seed so that any of us who buy seed from Europe can tell it by the paint on it, is a thing which would protect our agriculture very materially from seeds which are not adapted to our conditions, and which even may be dead or adulterated. Q. What is the objection to Hubam ? MR. MAGEE: I don't think there is any objection to it for certain uses. It all depends on what you want it for, and whether or not you are looking for the best soil builder, or for an annual pasture crop. Q. As a seed proposition? MR. MAGEE: The expense of it would be the only objection. It is only in the last few years that it has been introduced, and the seed men are raking in the profit. The fact that it is an annual is the only other objection which occurs to me. Perhaps it is a very desirable crop for seed purposes. Q. To use it as a seed crop the first year and plant it to corn afterwards ? MR. MAGEE: It is possible to put on Hubam in the spring one year, and grow corn the following year, but as to that I cannot speak from experience. Q. Would you recommend pasturing sweet clover later than the first of June for seed? MR. MAGEE: Oh, I would clip it back. Yes, I think you could pasture it after the first of June, in fact you can make the seed crop and you won't cut it very much if you pasture the stand right along until it gets wocdy, providing the stand is heavy, for by that method you will let in a good deal more light and the blossoms will be fertilized better. It is just like letting light into the apple tree in order to get an increased yield of fruit. Which is preferable, white or yellow? MR. MAGEE: I don't know that you should put any particular stress on that. They apparently give very much the same results. Some farmers prefer one sort and some another. Either kind if prop - erly used should be entirely satisfactory. Q. Did you ever sow it on winter wheat ? </seg>
            <seg id="p332">334 RKPORT OF NEBRASKA STATK BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. MAGEE: Yes. I have sowed it on winter wheat, and I sowed it in the spring. About 100 miles back from the river, that is, west in Nebraska, they sowed it in the fall on wheat. In Douglas county we sowed it on the wheat in the spring, and covered it by using a roller. We did not drag it. Q. Does it do any harm to sow unscarified seed at this time? MR. MAGEE: From the experiences of some of the men that I have talked to, they tell me that they have sowed it in the fall by pref - erence when it is unscarified, and hold the scarified seed for use in the spring. We think we get better results from the use of scarified seed in the spring. Q. Have you had corn following this sweet clover? MR. MAGEE: We have, and we think it is thoroughly worth while. You get a very marked increase in the yields from these soils which have been treated to sweet clover, as the sweet clover puts back a great deal of nitrogen into the soil, and that is the element we need most in eastern Nebraska. Q. How do you determine the different strains? MR. MAGEE: I don't know. You are at the mercy of the seed men, and that is the reason I am urging fanners to grow their own stuff. If you grow your own stuff in Nebraska, you keep our money at home, and a lot of the stuff that is offered on the seed market is this imported seed, or seed which is grown from strains which make good seed, but are not the best strains of clover for our use. In other words, use a home-grown product from your neighbor's field where you have seen the plants, and know what you are getting. You cannot tell what is going to come from the seed you buy in the market. A MEMBER: I sowed sweet clover and winter wheat some miles west of Lincoln, and I wonder if you sow it in the winter wheat and fertilize it, wouldn't you have better success than just the ordinary sow - ing on wheat; that is, inoculated seed I sowed on this winter wheat. Would inoculation help to strengthen the plant so as to carry over? MR. MAGEE: I sowed inoculated seed on winter wheat this last spring, and the plants grew well until the wheat was taken off, and then we had quite a dry spell and the plants died. I figured that there was not enough strength in the plant to make an attachment after the cover had been taken off, and do not think that the inoculation or lack of inoculation had anything to do with it. Q. Would that carry over so that we would get the fertilizer effect that we want? </seg>
            <seg id="p333">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 335 MR. MAGEE: I think that the bacteria which grow on the roots of the clover probably die with the plant, but the nitrogen which they had absorbed would be left in the soil, though, of course, this development had not gone on to any marked degree, and there would be less nitrogen left in the soil than there would be if the plants had matured and de - veloped large root systems. Q. If you inoculated seed after you cut the winter wheat off, would the plants be stronger to withstand the drouth and grow? Frequently the ground is so dry it wouldn't grow. MR. MAGEE: The point is to get the bacteria on to the roots of the growing plants, and I think this probably can be best done by sticking the bacteria on to the seed with a sugar solution, or by mixing up inoculated soil with the seed, and sowing the seed and soil with a drill, being careful that the sunlight does not get a direct shot at the seed and soil so as to weaken the life of the bacteria. Sunlight will kill the bacteria. You can obtain this inoculated soil from any field where you find the nodules present on the roots of either alfalfa or clover plants. It is the same bacteria on both of these plants. MR. THOMPSON: In regard to sweet clover and winter wheat: after you have got winter wheat in the ground, I don't believe it best to start sweet clover. I think it is only where you have a poor thin field that it is worth while. Where you have a good, heavy crop, it is not worth while to try to start sweet clover as your chances of getting a stand are poor. SUMMER FEEDING OF CATTLE ON VARIOUS KINDS OF PASTURE. H. J. Gramlich, College of Agriculture. I think before taking up the special subject assigned to me I should mention the pasture problem that confronts us here at the Agricultural college. We are short of pasture and we found eight or ten years ago that the blue-grass pastures were nil, practically speaking, in the two months when we needed them the most. Our first move was to try sweet clover, and we have done so purely with one thought in mind, that of having it for pasture just as soon as possible the year it is seeded. Consequently we seed our sweet clover as early in March as we can get the land ready, sometimes on fall plowing, and occasionally on spring plowing or discing. When seeded without a nurse crop we clip high about the first of June to set back large weeds. It will ordinarily be. ready for use by June 10 to 15. We turn stock upon it when the clover is twelve to sixteen inches high. In this way we have had a tremendous amount of pasture off the land from that date until about Thanksgiving. </seg>
            <seg id="p334">RKPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 336 Our necessity was to get a maximum pasture from our ground. My ex - perience and observation has been that in this particular community we often lose our stand of grass in small grain during June or July. We get a dry spell for several weeks and our stand of grass is seriously injured. When we get a wet season we may get a nice crop of grain and a good stand of grass, but for early pasture I think we are wasting time in putting a nurse crop with it. We have not inoculated. We use the scarified seed and by not. being sparing with the seed we have se - cured splendid stands. Now another problem confronts us. We know that this soil which las been in sweet clover for two years is very high in fertility. But e have more manure here at the college than we can use and conse - uently the matter of building up the soil by legumes is not a factor. fe want the maximum pasturage and we have been a little disappoined n sweet clover. The second year sweet clover gets woody about the rst of August so we have been plowing the .ground and putting it to inter rye. Usually we don't get much fall pasture off the rye but we et an enormous amount of spring pasture, and then we plow the rye nder about the middle of June and put the ground to Sudan grass. Tius while we are boosters for sweet clover we don't care so much about milding up the soil and we have decided that in our own case the use f fall rye and Sudan grass will give us the maximum amount of pasture rom our ground. Sudan Grass Makes Good Pasture We have found that we get a wonderful amount of pasture from Sudan grass. When it comes to pasture purposes and having a plant that is comparatively safe we have found that in July and August noth - ing is better than Sudan grass. The forepart of June we plow the land that is in rye and put in the Sudan grass. Blue-Grass Pasture Unsatisfactory. From our experience here I question if there is any justification for leaving much blue-grass in the South Platte region of Nebraska. Al - most every farm has blue-grass pasture on rough land but it is doubt - ful if level land should be left in this grass. A man with a quarter section of land can get a great deal more pasture by raising sweet clover and Sudan grass, using these to supplement what permanent pas - ture he may have on rough land. Two Years Results on Summer Feeding, But the question that I am supposed to discuss very briefly is summer feeding of cattle on various kinds of pasture. For a number of years there have been inquiries as to the summer feeding of cattle and we have had no information to give out. Generally before the first of </seg>
            <seg id="p335">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 337 April about three-fourths of the corn fed cattle go to market but later in the year there is a scarcity. A year ago last spring we started a test and repeated the experiment again this year. We took three groups of ten steers each, keeping one group in a lry lot and feeding them on corn and alfalfa hay; another group we put on Sudan grass pasture giving them what hay they wished as well as the corn; and another group we put on the sweet clover pasture under the same conditions. In the first test we used the first year seeding of sweet clover and this year we used the second year crop of sweet clover. The cattle were fed 140 days in each of the two years. In a general way we found that the cattle in the dry lot made the highest gain. These cattle made a gain which compared very favorably with steers fed during winter months in spite of flies and hot weather. Apparently these con - ditions are not as had as blizzards and storms and cold wet rains such as we have during the winter. Regarding the cattle on sweet clover and Sudan grass pasture some comparisons may be drawn. Both gained almost as much as the dry lot cattle. These pasture experiments were started before the Sudan grass and sweet clover were ready and these lots were fed a little alfalfa hay at the beginning and end of the test. We found that in those two years we got about 100 days' use of the Sudan grass as pasture commencing about the 20th of June and continuing to about the 1st of OctobtaS While the sweet clover cattle gained well in the first year test they did not get so fat. When they went to the market they sold for fifty cents less than the Sudan grass cattle did. But this year they were about equally fat and sold for about the same price, the second year's sweet clover apparently resulted in a little better condition on the cattle than we got the first year. As regards returns from these two pastures, in a general way Sudan grass showed up a little more favorably per acre in the two years. We had approximately three acres in each patch and that took care of ten steers and an equal number of hogs throughout the experi - ment, with the exception that we had to wait for the pasture to be ready, and this fall when the second year sweet clover pasture season was over we had to feed a little alfalfa. We had to turn our Sudan grass lot of cattle into an adjacent piece of Sudan grass for a few days to let the other piece get a little better start. When they were turned into the pasture I think it was approximately eighteen inches high. The sweet clover this year with the acreage and rains that we had got away from the cattle and a part of it got about five feet high. We clipped a part of it high and turned other cattle in, in order to hold it down so it would not get too woody. We need to work more on this experimental proposition. We should have more land where we could cany on experiments as they should be carried, with a group of cattle on each kind of pasture, and we hope in the future to plan with the </seg>
            <seg id="p336">338 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Agronomy Department a cooperative test where we can keep all data ft should be kept on problems that should be covered. But in a ieral way our experiments have shown that the pasture fed cattle very nicely; they will finish in 140 or 150 days almost as well as the cattle in the dry lot. This year the dry lot cattle sold for very little more than the pasture fed cattle. QUESTION: Have you had any trouble with cattle bloating on sweet clover? MR. GRAMLICH: No, we have never had a case of bloat on sweet clover in the college herd. Part of our cattle are on sweet clover con - tinuously. They have free access to water and are on the sweet clover before, during and after rains. Sometimes we give a part of them hay once a day if we are short on pasture. I noticed last spring that prac - tically all of the bloat reports were from the section north of the Platte river. These letters were sent to the Veterinary Department to Dr. Van Ess and he says sweet clover coupled with excessive moisture is conductive to bloat. Sudan grass, of course, is not supposed to bloat cattle. It is not supposed to contain any material of a poisonous nature. PRESIDENT DANLY: We appreciate very highly the talk which Professor Gramlich has given us. We don't know all we want to yet about feeding cattle on pasture, whether Sudan grass or sweet clover. They are both new crops to us. Mr. Messinger has had some experience with sweet clover and I will ask him to tell us about it. MR. MESSINGER: I haven't much to add, only that we have had better success with yellow sweet clover seeded with a nurse crop. I find the yellow will stand more if the grain is taken off than will the white sweet clover. I thought it might be interesting to some of these people who live west of here. That is all I have to add to what has already been said. MEMBER: Isn't it true that the yellow sweet clover has a finer m and a denser foliage and has therefore a great advantage? MR. MESSINGER: It grows finer, I don't know how it will com - pare with regards to production of seed. My idea is that it would not &gt;roduce as much seed as the white. You may say what you please about ollowing out Mr. Gramlich's idea of seeding sweet clover alone, but most farmers will insist on sowing sweet clover with a nurse crop and say let them try the yellow sweet clover where they sow it with a urse crop. t PRESIDENT DANLY: I would say that sweet clover is very simi - to alfalfa plants and if you sow alfalfa with a nurse crop I think are safe in sowing your sweet clover with a nurse crop. </seg>
            <seg id="p337">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTL'KK 339 MR. STEWART: Professor Gramlich in discussing the results of feeding steers on sweet clover and Sudan pasture said that the Sudan seemed to put on a little more gain. Aside from the gains made by the cattle on these pastures I believe that we should also take into con - sideration the effects of Sudan and sweet clover on the soil and on crops that follow them. Here at the Agricultural College we have plenty of manure, and fertility is not a question with which we are much con - cerned. But on the average eastern Nebraska farm suppose we would put the Sudan and sweet clover pasture into corn the following season and consider the returns from this crop along with the returns from the pasturing experiment. In most all cases I think that sweet clover would come out ahead. The work of the Agronomy Department here at the College has shown that the rolling eastern Nebraska farm lands have lost from one - fourth to one-half of the organic matter that they contained when broken out. In other words such soils have lost about one per cent of the or - ganic matter and nitrogen for evei-y year that they have been farmed. This is a serious loss which is not only reducing crop yields, but is also causing more and more trouble in preventing soil washing and baking, and in getting stands of alfalfa and the clovers. Recently Ve sent a letter to a number of our pioneer Nebraska sweet clover growers. Some of these have been growing sweet clover for as long as eleven years. The main question asked them was as to the soil building effect of sweet clover. The question asked was this: If corn will make 25 bushels per acre what will 2 years of sweet clover do toward increasing this yield? Thirty-seven men replied to this question stating that 2 years of sweet clover would increase the yield 64 per cent or to 41 bushels per acre. A similar question indicated an in - creased yield of 56 per cent for oats, and 50 per cent for winter wheat. We certainly need to consider the soil building effect of sweet clover along with its pasture value. A MEMBER: There is a certain farm 12 miles north of Lincoln which is rolling upland soil. The man on this place has grown sweet clover more or less for 15 years. Right on top of a ridge where he has had sweet clover he has grown 55 bushels of corn to the acre and as high as 60 bushels of oats. To begin with this land was poor but sweet clover built it up. It yields more now than does the land on the bottom. That is what sweet clover will do as a soil builder. MR. ROGERS: How much will scarifying sweet clover seed in - crease the germination? MR. STEWART: That varies a great deal with the seed sample. You may have one sample of seed that has only 2 or 3 per cent of hard seed and of course scarifying such seed would increase the germination </seg>
            <seg id="p338">340 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE only by about that per cent. Again you might have a sample of seed with as much as 60 or 70 per cent hard seed which could be practically eliminated by scarifying. It will depend on the sample of seed and on the way in which the seed is scarified. NEBRASKA AT THE INTERNATIONAL GRAIN AND HAY SHOW D. L. Gross. Nebraska's third exhibit at the International Hay and Grain Show as well up to standard and attracted much interest both from farmers nd Experiment Station folks. It was a panorama of much of the work lat has been done at the Nebraska Experiment Station on the im - rovement of winter wheat, together with a lesser display of the results ! investigations with the spring grains. Among the more important ems brought out were the best cultural methods, the value of manure, le effect of time, rate and manner of seeding, the value of seed treat - ment, the effect of time of harvest, the value of the fanning mill, a com - arison of late vs. early varieties, the yields obtained from all the im - tortant varieties, and a comparison of the yields of hard and soft red inter wheats. A sheaf display of 49 varieties of winter wheat was town, which brought out the characteristics of each variety as regards opearance of head and length of straw. This exhibit was divided into rwo groups, one containing the hard red winter wheats and the other oft red winter wheats.

            <seg id="p339">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 341 Twenty-five enlarged pictures were used to show the methods by which data is obtained under experimental conditions. Two home-made devices for treating wheat with Copper Carbonate to control smut were shown and demonstrated. In the competitive exhibits Nebraska stood high, winning 39 pre- miums, mostly on corn. Particularly gratifying were the winnings made by the Corn club boys in the Junior division. In Region III in the Junior white 10-ear class the "Otoe County Rustlers" won the first four premiums. Second, Third, and fifth places were won in the Junior yellow 10-ear class. In Region VI which includes the western part of the state, the Senior Nebraska exhibitors won first, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh. The Senior eastern Nebraska exhibitors won 21 premiums on both white and yellow corn. The competition in the small grain classes has always been so keen that Nebraska has been left out of the winnings. A start was made this year, however, when Jack Graham succeeded in winning a place with his winter wheat. It was a very fine sample and was expected to place higher than it did.

            <seg id="p345">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 347 NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS ASSOCIATION RULES FOR SEED CERTIFICATION 1925 1. Requirements for Certification. Applicants for certification must be members of the Nebraska Crop Growers Association. The membership fee is $1.00 which entitles one to life membership, a copy of the printed Annual Report of the Asso - ciation ,aml other membership privileges. Applicants who are already members need not pay this fee. 2. Crops Eligible for Inspection. Fields of Kanred, Nebraska 6 and 60 Winter Wheat, Marquis Spring Wheat, Nebraska 21 Oats, Burt Oats, Trebi and Minnesota 184 Barley, Rosen Rye and such other crops and strains as may seem desirable will be eligible for certification. 3. Rules as to Seed, Fields, and Previous Crops. Fields to be eligible for certification must be sown to seed which can be definitely traced to known sources. Because of the danger of mix - ing through volunteer grain, only fields of fall wheat and rye on which other kinds of crops or certified fields of the same crop have been grown the previous season, will be eligible for inspection. Rosen Rye fields must be at least one-fourth mile from other rye fields, due to cross-pol - lination. 4. Disqualifications of Fields. When fields are unsatisfactory as to volunteer crops, identity of variety, mixing in cutting, purity, mixture of other grains, noxious weeds — such as the small-flowered morning glory — or smut, the Asso - ciation retains full right to refuse certification. Final decisions on these matters will rest with a Seed Certification Committee of three appointed by the president of the Nebraska Crop Growers Association. 5. Nature of Inspections in Field. The field inspection will be made so far as possible just before har - vest. The purpose of this inspection is to check up on purity, disease, mixtures, noxious weeds, and to get acquainted with the grower, at which time methods for handling, cleaning, and selling the seed may be dis - cussed. 6. Threshed Sample Inspection. Each grower, before the seed is finally certified, must submit a rep - resentative threshed sample similar in quality and condition to what will be supplied to customers. This sample will be passed on by a Committee of three appointed by the president, and, if satisfactory as to quality, will be passed for final certification. </seg>
            <seg id="p346">348 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 7. Fees for Inspection. An inpection fee of $3.00 per individual will be charged regardless of te number of fields and varieties, provided that they are all on one farm. his is in addition to the $1.00 membership fee. Checks should accom - »ny applications. In case of hail storms, drought, or other unfavorable rop conditions, the application may be withdrawn and the fee returned, roviding the inspector has not yet left the Secretary's office for your ounty. All fees will be used to pay certification costs such as printing seed lists, tags, certificates, and for postage for advertising matter. No art is to be used for salaries. 8. Applications. It is preferred that all applications be in by June 1, and none will be accepted after June 15. All applications must be written on the of - ficial blank furnished by the Association and giving detailed information as to the field or fields. See your County Agricultural Agent for blanks and plans for certification in your county. FIELD INSPECTED SEED OF THE NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS ASSOCIATION 1925 This list contains the names of Nebraska farmers whose fields of E proved small grains have passed the field inspection for purity, ality and fitness for seed stock purposes. These growers must, ? ore their seed is approved, submit for final inspection a peck sample threshed grain which must be of certain standards. They will then given a certificate showing the quality, name, purity and other iracteristics of the grain. In order to get this list into the hands prospective buyers of fall-seeded grain, it must be printed following i field inspection and before the threshed samples are available as sse are often delayed by late threshing. Farmers who want new iall grain seed will make no mistake in buying field inspected seed. WHAT IS INSPECTED SEED AND WHY IS IT INSPECTED? The Nebraska Agricultural College spends considerable time and effort in developing new and testing old strains and varieties of crops. Vhen a particularly promising strain or variety has been developed, some of the seed is distributed to a few careful farmers for further trial out in the state and for increasing for seed purposes. Unless this seed is traced and kept pure it is soon mixed and lost for further dis - tribution to the public. Inspected seed is from fields of such tried and improved crops which have been inspected in the field of purity, smut, pernicious weeds </seg>
            <seg id="p347">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 349 and mixtures. Strict requirements as to the source of seed must be met by the grower. Volunteer crops, cross pollination, and mixing are re - duced to a minimum by the strict rules under which the seed must be grown. WHAT CROPS ARE INSPECTED? Nebraska 60 and Nebraska 6 winter wheats are improved selec - tions from common Turkey Red winter wheat, both having continuously out-yielded ordinary Turkey Red winter wheat in trials covering a number of years. In general appearance they are similar to ordinary Turkey Red. These strains are very popular wherever grown in the state. Kanred wheat, developed at the Kansas Agricultural College, is the product of a single head selected in 1906 from a hard w|nte|r variety introduced from Russia. The yield of Kanred is also superior to ordinary Turkey Red. Kanred is a day or two earlier than Turkey Red and is somewhat more rust resistant. There seems to be no appreciable difference in the baking and milling qualities of Kanred, Nebraska 6 and 60, and ordinary Turkey Red. Soil and climatic conditions must be taken into consideration in making comparisons in yield, protein content, milling, and in baking value. Results at the Nebraska Experiment Station show Kanred to be a high yielding, sat - isfactory variety. In some communities one finds a strong prejudice against Kanred wheat. While it is believed that this discrimination is not always based on facts, the Nebraska Agricultural College and the Nebraska Crop Growers Association suggest that in such instances farmers grow the Nebraska 60 selection. This wheat has been found entirely satisfactory wherever grown in the winter wheat sections of Nebraska. Nebraska 21 oats is a white selection made from the ordinary yellow Kherson variety. It has outyielded the ordinary Kherson oats from 8 to 10 per cent, yielding 50.6 bushels as companred to 47.6 bushels for ordinary Kherson in a 6-year test at the Nebraska Experiment Station. Fulghum oats (Kanota) is a variety which has become popular in Kansas. The indications are that this variety will do best along the south line of Nebraska. The yield is good but not so high as Nebraska 21 oats at the Experiment Station at Lincoln. Rosen Rye, a Michigan product has been grown over the state for several seasons with excellent results. It has a heavier straw, larger head and kernel than common rye and has given increased yields of 2 to 3 bushels. Trebi barley is especially promising under irrigation. It is a six - rowed bearded barley. </seg>
            <seg id="p348">350 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE All other crops inspected show special adaptation and promise for Nebraska conditions. A few extra cents per bushel paid for inspected seed should prove to be a good investment. Buy the seed . sacked and tagged with the Nebraska Crop Growers Association tags. If a carload is bought insist that the grain be scooped into the car as it is apt to be mixed if run through an elevator. The seed list gives the amount of smut and mixtures present. IT IS ALWAYS A WISE PRECAUTION TO TREAT THE SEED FOR SMUT. See the back page of this circular for directions, or call on your county agent for a demonstration. Prospective buyers are urged to secure a sample of grain from the different growers before buying. 1925— GROWERS OF INSPECTED SEED— 1925 Nebraska 60 Wheat— W. H.

Be sure to get a thorough mixture. To do this when using a small barrel machine, it is best to treat only one-half bushel at a time. If this is done the mixer need be turned only one-half minute for each half bushel, thus allowing for the treating of 30 to 40 bushels an hour. Details for the construction of a treating machine may be obtained from your county agent or from the College of Agriculture. The copper carbonate may be obtained from your druggist or through your county agent, or the names of the firms who handle this material can be obtained by writing to the Agronomy Department of the College of Agriculture. Copper carbonate treatment will cost from three to five cents a bushel. Treated seed is poisonous and should not be fed to livestock. Treating should be done in the open air where the breeze will carry away the escaping powder as this will cause illness to the operators if much of it is inhaled.

Cover the grain after treatment for two or three hours and either sow at once or spread it out to dry. The rate of seeding should be increased sufficiently to com - pensate for the swelling of the kernels. Formaldehyde should be pur - chased in sealed bottles as otherwise it may have lost its strength. This treatment is also effective for the kernel smut in sorghums.

            <seg id="p373">PROCEEDINGS of the Fortieth Annual Convention of the NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION Held at Agricultural College, Lincoln, Nebraska January 7-9, 1925 </seg>
            <seg id="p374">376 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE WEDNESDAY MORNING SESSION January 7, 1925 THE PRESIDENT We will start our Convention with an address of welcome by DEAN E. A. BURNETT: From the number present I suppose many members of the Associa - tion are milking the cows and are a little slow getting in. But we are very happy to see all of those who are here. We are always glad to see the Dairymen. Just as we are the other men who are trying to get a living out of the soil. I think there never was a better time to go into the dairy business. I say that, even in the face of the increasing supply of butter in cold storage. In the end the success of the Dairy busi - ness is going to depend on the cost of production, and the skill of the man who takes care of the cows. Now one of the first things that happens when the price of butter fat goes down is that we eat more butter. Some of you folks who don't have to buy the butter you consume would be surprised at the diffi - culties the man who lives in the city, with only a moderate income has in getting good butter at a price he can afford to pay. When you take into consideration the cost of feed, which enters into the production of butter in Nebraska compared with the costs of feed in New York, and Eastern States which ship in alfalfa and grain it should not be very difficult for us to determine which is making the profit. If we are putting as much ability and skill into the caring for our Dairy cattle and production of butter fat as is done in the old sections, we can make a good profit out of dairying. There is no animal on the farm that gives us a better return than does our Dairy cows. Now of course we have all sorts of Dairy cattle and some cows have never done us any good because we have never given them any oppor - tunity. Some of them don't have the capacity. We will never be able to separate one class from the other until we give them a chance. I have some figures which were given to me this morning from our North 'latte Experimental Farm giving the average production per day per cow for that herd for eight or nine years, beginning with 3916 and losing with 1924. For a number of years we have had a very excellent lerd. Cows which have been milked in 1923 and 1924 have all been mrebred cows. The number of cows was reduced 25 per cent when the grade cows were sold. The amount of milk was reduced only 2 per cent. "hat is we milked only three-fourths as many cows and only lost 2 per ent on the supply. The better cows were retained and given better care. Most Nebraska Dairymen would sell one-fourth of their herd and &gt;y better care produce as much butter fat as now. </seg>
            <seg id="p375">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 377 Now all of you are sufficiently familiar with the poultry industry to kno.w what has been going on there in the last two or three years when somebody goes out into a farm flock and takes one quarter of the flock and sends them to market. They cull the flock and then get just as many eggs as before. That is what happened here with this herd. When we have given the cows on the farm a better opportunity it is up to us to determine whether or not they are paying us for the expense, trouble and labor, that we are placing on them. That question has often been discussed and will be with us as long as we are in the Dairy business. That is the way we are trying to reduce the cost of butter fat. If we eliminate these cows and put the herd on a higher production basis this will give a profit from butter fat with the present market price. If you study the history of any industry you will find the sup - ply and the demand is the real determining factor in the price of dairy products. Whenever prices go down we just feel that they are never coming up. On the other hand, whenever prices trend upward we feel that they are never going to come down and people make investments on that basis. A year ago we studied this question of farm turn-over. Compared with the turn-over in business, I am told that a clothing merchant tries to turn-over his operating capital four times a year. If they don't do that they don't feel as if they had a very good year. I believe they make a little margin every time they do it. In some study of farm turn - overs it has been found the best a farm could do would be to turn its capital over once in three years. On some farms with large investments the turn-over has been found to be once in every ten years. If you can increase the gross sales to a point where you have made your turn-over very much more rapidly you have progressed. You are never going to get down to where you can turn-over your capital four times a year but you can do the very thing these merchants undertake to do, that is turn-over the capital more rapidly than you have done in the past. That is one way at least by which we can increase the profit in the business. THE PRESIDENT I want to introduce to you now a representative of the Lincoln Cham - ber of Commerce who is Chairman of the Agricultural Committee of that organization. MR. G. H. BRYANT: I am exceedingly glad to come here and extend the privilege of the Chamber of Commerce at 11th and P streets, and to invite you to enjoy those privileges while you are here. We would like to have you come and get acquainted with the Secretary and other aides and make yourselves at home in any way that you desire. We have committee meetings there every day. It is a convenient place for you to have any committee </seg>
            <seg id="p376">378 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE meetings if you desire to have them down-town and you may use these rooms if you wish to do so. Now you may meet your friends up there you desire and make business appointments. We will issue temporary embership cards which will extend the privileges of the club for the alance of the month. We have a luncheon room open every noon and achinery there that can help the agricultural spirit, we will be glad to extend that help. We are not trying to nose into the fanning business. fe are not going to make two blades of grass grow where one grew be - ore. We have a transportation committee that is at the service of the usiness interest of the agricultural interest, and the facilities of our raffic bureau are open to you. If you have any transportation problems r commercial, such as shortage of freight cars or problems of any sort ou will only have to appeal to the Lincoln Chamber of Commerce and we lall be very glad to place our facilities at your disposal. THE PRESIDENT I will now appoint two committees. One COMMITTEE ON RES - OLUTIONS. Professor H. P. Davis, F. C. Haeger and Professor k. L. Haecker. The other the COMMITTEE ON NOMINATIONS. W. H. Peterson, O. H. Liebers and W. P. Snyder. They will report for a busi - ness meeting at 1 o'clock. PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS By President Swartsley My name appears next on the program. After our worthy Secre - tary, Mr. Lawritson, notified me that I would be placed on the profjram le did not allot me any subject. I feel a little bit at a loss to Know what to talk about. Dean Burnett made part of my talk so that I will ust have to talk at random and give you the best I can in the way of xperiences. I happened to live in the central part of the alfalfa country that le professor spoke about as being the greatest feed we have for dairy cattle. I believe I realized the fact that we do live in the heart of the airy country which if it was properly put to work Nebraska's industry will not rank as low as people think it would in the aggregate, of todays airy work. We probably have the cheapest and best feed that can be secured for dairy cattle. We can produce it most economically. I be - ieve that Nebraska should do better than it has in dairy cattle and pro - uce better. But there is only one way to do that and that is the proper hing that should be done on the dairy farms and that is to breed in a more systematic way. My idea is there are only two ways to start a good dairy herd. One is through a good purebred sire and the other is hrough purebred foundation cows. If we handle all of our dairy breeds in the proper way we cannot help but be successful in producing better ■tock, and I know what that means. But our greatest trouble is that we </seg>
            <seg id="p377">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AORKTl/n'KE 379 don't have dairymen. That brings us up to the subject of educating the class of dairymen. We haven't done that. Our good dairymen are very few. We better start to figure out how we are going to produce these people and hold them to the farms instead of having them leave the farms and go into the automobile or radio game or some kind of busi - ness other than the farm. The only one way that a farmer can get ahead is to understand how tc handle the livestock end of the business, marketing, and producing at a profit out of his herd. I believe it is the purchasing price in dollars that affects us. When you go out to buy you pay about twice what you should for what you get. But so far as dairying the price is set at about normal when you consider the recent period. Feed is the same, corn is higher price so I believe the only sys - tem now is to get busy and line up something that will hold the young people to the farm and keep them where they belong. I know that in our community it is mighty hard even to get a man to work on the farm and to take care of stock. They say that it is slavery. Possibly it is a little more slavish than some other things. The Railroad man, the man in the bank and the man in all of the commercial lines have to hew to a line to meet their ends. They are working harder than we work on the farm and they take things more serious in their process, and it takes more serious thoughts for them to figure out how to make both ends meet and to make the best of it. I think we might figure out some incentive in some way, such as club work or some branch of dairying that will benefit us if we will get together and stick together. Agricultural people do not work together enough. We agricultural men have just one aim in view whether we are engaged in dairying, or beef livestock, grains or poultry and that is to work together and combine all efforts. The Chamber of Commerce are getting out to assist us without telling us how to do the thing but telling us what really would help us. So far as dairying is concerned I have given it considerable thought. We should make a study of it. The best people are not just the ones who would take to a certain breed. It is not a matter of chance but we should de - ckle positively what breed we want and stick by that breed. The man who jumps from one breed to another never knows exactly what he wants and I don't think he will succeed in dairying any more than in any other part of agriculture. The cow is probably the greatest friend of the human race of any living animal. The outstanding thing is the feeling toward the cow should be more deeply appreciated than it is. If we understand that the cow is the foster Mother of about 37 per cent of our people we will begin to understand the greater value of the cow. Her food has brought us up to manhood and womanhood and we should give her great credit. 1 think this relationship should exist between the farmer and the true cow-loving dairyman so that he can feed and care for the cow and make her respond to a disposition so she will help work and give us more </seg>
            <seg id="p378">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 380 profit. I feel that a man who can go into his corral and call a cow by her name and have her walk up for her feed has a much better chance of suc - cess, while a man who goes out with a club and a dog will very likely be a failure. Such love should exist between a dairyman and the animal as a means of profit. If you haven't that love you don't belong in the dairy business. The cow has made more good farms than any other one a\imal. She consumes roughage that would be an absolute waste and also fertilizes the farm and brings it back to a productive standpoint. She utilizes the grasses that would go to waste and brings the poorer land into a high state of production. One thing I can't just understand. When I was a boy back in Illinois I remember a herd of cattle on the big prairies. There were all kinds of cows out together and they were driv - on all over the country mile after mile. No one furnished any particular feed but they simply took the different kind of grasses but there seemed to be more nutrients in those grasses than in some of the feeds we have today. I remember an instance that I am going to relate here. A man came from one of the Eastern States and another party rented a place, the landlord said, "You might take this farm for ten years and pay me twenty bushels an acre for ten years and I will make the deed to you." He accepted the offer. The old man came in there with a family of nine children. They were very poor. He just bought one cow and it is largely in relation to that cow that I am speaking. That cow was re - lated to the cow that kicked the lantern over in the Chicago fire. She was a very peculiar looking cow, not a Guernsey and not a Holstein, but just a common high grade cow. She was turned out and given an opportunity to make her own living on this place. But she was milked quite regularly and faithful. There was something out of the ordinary in the way this woman milked that cow, regularly when the clock struck six in the morning and as regular as it struck six in the evening. She fed and clothed the entire family from this cow's production, but of course she didn't pay the same prices then that we do today. The pur - chasing price or purchasing power of a dollar was entirely different. This cow gave about 60 pounds of milk per day I would say, and kept it up for 10 months out of the year. Gentlemen as we have several other prominent speakers to hear and our time is. limited I will close my remarks by saying that I wish to ex - tend our sincere thanks to all our speakers for their good advise, the facts and figures that show Nebraska must wake up and the future of the Nebraska Dairymen's Association, as well as the: other agricultural organizations depend largely upon their officers, and the interests of the producers of the several different kinds of livestock, gTains, legumes, etc. must all co-operate. In closing I thank you for the honor conferred on me as Peesident and extend my best wishes to our incoming officers for 1925. Mr. Frank B. Astroth of the American Jersey Cattle Club will speak on "What a Good Sire Can Do." </seg>
            <seg id="p379">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 381 WHAT A GOOD SIRE CAN DO By Mr. Frank B. Astroth Ladies and Gentlemen: The talks by Mr Swartsley and the other speakers remind me of the little boy whose mother had taught him a long list of prayers to be repeated each night before he jumped under the covers. He thought they were too much in detail so secured a blank card, wrote them out in detail and posted them at the head of his bed, and then each night as he was ready to jump under the covers, he would point to the card and say, "Lord, them's my sentiments." These men ha\e exactly expressed by sentiments in regards to agriculture and par - ticularly in regards to the Dairy industry. The Dairy Industry is the greatest of all Agricultural Industries, and the profitable dairy cow has done a great deal in bringing prosper - ity to those who have faith in her, and has been a great factor in plac - ing civilization upon the plane she stands today. Just a few brief words as to the immensity of the dairy buiness and you can easily see why the former speakers have so stressed the impor - tance of Dairying and Agricultural Week. The matter I am going to talk on particularly today is Sires, and what a good s. : re can do. I know that the State of Nebraska is ir.ter - ested in good sires. I only recently have had the pleasure of making a trip throughout the State of Nebraska on a Burlington Better Bull Special. In seventeen days time that I was with the train we talked to over 31,000 persons who were interested in dairying as well as more particularly in Pure Bred Sires. The majority of them expressed great pleasure. I only wish this morning that the seats w6re filled with farm - ers so that I could tell them somewhat of the thingV^hat had been ac - complished with pure bred sires. Daring the past year or more a great deal has been said, and still more written, as to the condition of the farmer in this district and that district, and how the other district has been hurt, and in general a lot of agitation created that certain forms of legislation should be perfected that would supposedly bring prosperity. These efforts remind me of a nigger boy in a small Ozark town. It seems that every Saturday night Sam would draw his pay and shortly afterwards stroll uptown. Before long he got into a crap game and in a short while lost everything he had but his voice and he had that badly strained. The next morning being Sunday he decided to attend church. He took a seat in the far corner for fear somebody might recog - nize him. Afterward he plucked up courage to look over the audience, when his eyes rested upon the pulpit, he was surprised to find that the </seg>
            <seg id="p380">382 RKPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AC.RICI'LTIRR parson was none other than the man who had won all his money in the crap game the night before. About the same time the parson spied him and knew there was trouble ahead. He stepped forward, said, "Brudders and Sisters, dis mornin we will dispense with all preliminaries, and my text for today will be taken from the Fourteenth Chapter of Timothy. Blessed is he who looseth and maketh no outcry, for he shall be blessed with restitution". I am afraid too many good farmers have a habit of just sitting around and awaiting for prosperity to come to them, without getting a firm hold on the plow handle or the milk pail and going out and taking care of a good dairy cow. The farrrers who have been will - ing to face the situation and evolve some constructive plan to belter themselves realize that we can never hope to prefect legislation that will legislate a farmer into prosperity. In talking to you today I am going to use examples of various com - munities that have developed from ordinary communities to outstanding Agricultural Communities due to the fact that great sires from a long line of profit producing ancestors had been used in developing their foundation animals. Are you going to be an ordinary community or are you going to be an outstanding community in agriculture? It is just a matter of going to the countries of Europe and making comparitive analysis. Holland, Denmark and Switzerland have all made great pro - gress.When we study their production and note the high average per cow, we also find that their figures on pure bred sires in service are high in comparison. It makes us think that there must be some correlation and we will no longer wonder why we are here to discuss pure bred sires today. I know there has been a great increase in production in Nebraska in the past year due to the fact that a larger number of farmers are milking cows than ever before and still greater increases can be made. It is safe to say that the average farmer can increase his production 50 per cent by feeding his cows properly, and that will still leave a great deal of room for improvement through the use of good sires. Take Holland at the present time, it enjoys a production of about 7500 pounds of milk per cow and something over 300 pounds of butter fat, with 70 per cent of sires in service being pure bred. Now take Denmark which has a production of 5700 pounds of milk with 55 per cent of the sires in service being pure bred. In Switzerland the production is somewhere around 6950 pounds of milk with 63 per cent of the sires in service being pure bred. Now there must be some relation between these facts, the good production and the number of sires in service. We can very easily then turn to this country and find an aver - age in the United States at the present time of 3500 poun-'s of milk with only 29 per cent of the sires in service being pure bred. We have only eight states in the United States that show greater than 4000 </seg>
            <seg id="p381">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICITI.TIRK 383 pounds of milk average and then only 7 of these have better than 40 per cent of pure bred sires in service. Those figures should tell us a won - derful story and should give us an indication as to what percentage of this rate we must work for in order to expect to accomplish the improve - ment we desire, and impress upon us the co-operation we can give the farmer in breeding and developing a better cow. A lot of men think the only way to develop a community is to go out and bring in a lot of cows. It is true we have to have something to work on, and in communities where greater numbers are necessary, careful selection of a limited number of cows would prove satisfactory. After they have been placed with the farmers, those in charge should assure themselves that these cows are being bred to good pure bred sires in order to assure their hav - ing progeny equally as profitable. Otherwise they will be bred to scrub sires and the succeeding generations will be inferior to native cattle in every respect. Take in the State of Wisconsin. Going into the history of that State you will find it is not such a great number of years ago that they made their initial ventures into the Dairy Industry. At that time there was hardly a district in the United States where one could purchase dairy cattle in any great quantities. Fortunately, Wisconsin had a number of Agricultural Leaders at that time who had a keen vision, and knew that if the Dairy Industry in Wisconsin had the proper foundation, it would bring unthought of wealth and prosperty to the state. They saw that the initial step was to bring in sires of the right kind in order to breed more profitable cows and stimulate production. They made a brief survey, then traveled to known Dairy Centers and purchas - ed a large number of good sires of the various breeds, always being care - ful to see that the animals were not merely pure breds, but that they were direct descendants of a long line of profit producing ancestors. This meant greater expense as there was no Official Testing of dependable na - ture in progress at that time. They then placed these bulls around the state in various communities that were anxious to take it up, and where they would have the maximum of service and where the move would be properly advertised. As a result of this today, Wisconsin is the greatest dairy state in the Union. At present they have 170 Cow Test Associa - tions in Wisconsin with an average of 28 herds to the Association, and an average production of €882 pounds of milk, 270 pounds of butter fat per cow, and it is their proud boast that every herd is using a pure bred sire. There must be something definite in that figure of high production and the number of pure bred sires in service, for if we compare that fig - ure with the average for the rest of the state we find a difference of 90 pounds of butter fat per cow. </seg>
            <seg id="p382">384 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In the State of Nebraska about 40 percent of the cows could be elim - inated without any injury to your production to any great extent. The men who are milking those cows are supposed to be dairying at the present time. The men who have eliminated those cows are the ones who are receiving the greatest profit per cow at the present time. That means just another step toward more profit for the men milking the cow. It is to the greater interest for others to be able to make that step. Along about 1910 the Federal Government took up the work of study - ing the gospel of better bulls. They decided to develop some organiza - tion for placing better sires around the country and they evolved a plan known as bull clubs, or bull associations. This is a plan of co-oper - ative ownership of a good sire and it gives a number of farmers or dairymen an opportunity to own an interest in a sire so outstanding Eit no one of them alone would be able to purchase him. Wonderful rk has been accomplished along this line through the co-operative 1 associations. I think one of the most outstanding organizations has been developed in the vicinity of Grove City, Pennsylvania. At the pres - ent time I think there are 18 pure bred sires in service in the bull associ - ations in that district immediately surrounding Grove City, Pennsylvan - a. That district is not just around in one county, it doe ft not cross into any other states but takes up a part in several counties. The foundation or this work was started in Grove City. At the start the average ow produced 136 pounds of butterfat. Cow Test Associations were rganized at the time the bulls were purchased, and after the daughters of these great sires began to produce a great increase of butterfat was noted. In 1923 after having used these bulls ten years the average cow produced 273 pounds fat. That progress from 136 to 273 pounds n just a period of eight years actual milking of the cows throughout this district shows what can be accomplished. That shows the profit that can come to a farmer from increased production alone. 750 dollars was the average farmer's deposit in and around the Grove City commun - ity prior to the establishment of these bull associations. Now the average farmer's deposit is $1600.00 and the growth in a few years time from $750 to $1600 for the use of these good sires show the results that should be of interest to every community. When you consider that agriculture it - self is of two parts, one, that system of farming or agriculture which de - pletes the fertility of the soil is also the system which impoverishes the farmer. Two, that system of farming which restores fertility to the soil is also the system which brings prosperity to the farmer. So you see, the work at Grove City, Pennsylvania, shows a development in one com - munity and it is a work that will spread all over the United States. I have given it just as a concrete example of what can be expected of better sires. </seg>
            <seg id="p383">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 385 Now I am not from Pennsylvania or from Wisconsin, but I am from Missouri, and we have had some wonderful examples of what can be ac - complished along this line in the State of Missouri. I will never forget one of the first opportunities I had to travel throughout the Ozark Moun - tains. At that time the stock quotations ran something like this, Cows $5.00, Horses $7.00, Hound Dogs $40.00, and they had some wonderful Hound Dogs. Their cows were more or less of a Mongrel brand. They used to be described as Poland China cows. That means that the man milking the cow had to be very careful to prop her up against a pole while he was milking her and a china cup would hold all the milk she could possibly give at one time. Three carloads of those cows of the Ozarks were taken up to Northern Iowa to the Ames Station. They were given strictly farm feed of the same type that they would receive on an Iowa farm. That was done to see what would be the increase in produc - tion, and they found that the same cows had an average production of 149 pounds of butter fat to the cow after they had been on the farm for two years and were fed strictly on farm feed such as any Ozark farmer could have raised and fed to them. Those cows were bred to good sires, not of just one breed, but they were tried out with Jersey, Guernsey and Holstein and found the net results were approximately the same for all breeds and that the first cross brought a certain percentage of increase and the second and third cross brought a still greater percentage of in - ci-ease. In three generations time they had an increase of 99 psr cent in milk and 94 per cent in butter fat and that was due to the use of those good sires and feeding for three generations. The daughters of one Jersey bull produced 6138 pounds of milk and 349 pounds butter fat for the first cross from the old aerubs. In 1913 this information was carried back to Webster county, Mis - souri, and as a result a number of bull associations were organized and a real interest developed in dairying. That same year cream shipments from Marshfield amounted to $3500 whereas in 1924 butter, cream and milk shipments totalled $1,850,000.00. Now, do Pure Bred Sires pay? Now when we go studying pure bred sires we lay great stress on the ped - igree as well as on the individuality of the animal, for if they are to ac - complish anything in the breeding world, individuality is not sufficient. As you well know there are certain factors in the makeup of each animal that are not visible to the eye and that we can only determine through the pedigree and by a study of the dams, so as to have some knowledge of what we can expect from the animal in question, and just how much of a chance he will have to become a great sire. This was clearly demonstrated with the Mongrel cow and the pure bred 6ires in Webster county. Our various breeds of Dairy Cattle have not been existant a great number of years, and it has not been such a long time as time goes </seg>
            <seg id="p384">386 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE since the day they had the same ancestors written into their pedigrees that are embodied in the scrub bull today. They traveled along different ines to reach the present day. The scrub bull traveled down the line of no feed, no care and no breeding. The good bull of today traveled lown the lino of proper feed, proper care, and careful selection of sires and dams, and has developed the wonderful breeding ani.r.al of today. Now in Indiana that organization known as the Scott County Jersey Bull Association was organized seven years ago. In this community in Scott county they had been successful in their co-operation for six years before the organization began to weaken and finally broke up, due to the lack of proper follow-up work. About this time they secured a county agent and one of his first cff'dal acts was to oiganize two cow test associations. It so happened that a gi eater share of the men in the Bull Association had cows entered in testing association. There we found that the heifers sired by the six bull associations' sires produced an average of 90 pounds butterfat more than their dams, on the same farms working side by side. In a count in that county we found 227 heifers sired by co-operatively owned bulls, and while it is hardly pos - sible that the entire number would average 90 pounds fat more than their dams, it certainly is probable that they would average 50 pounds butterfat more than the dams, which would mean an increase of 11,350 pounds fat, or over $5000 in cash to be distributed among the farmers of that community; and where could these men have gone to purchase 227 cows free from disease and that they were assured would be better than their native stuff at an average cost of less than $10 per head. kThat increase in production could possibly mean only one thing, and it is the Scott County Jersey Bull Association, while no longer func - ning had definitely proven a success. There are many community examples that could be brought up of hat has been accomplished by good, breeding. There are so many that lere »:an be no question about the great benefits that come from not nly good breeding but for good feeding, or I might say from close ap - lication of the four words, feed, weed, bi-eed and advertise. Those arc le four things that ycu can't neglect on the farm. But of all of them would say that breeding is one of the biggest. There will be another benefit from this. You will have such herds that young fellows will be - ome interested and they will stay in the business of raising and milking le cows. If he has something to work for besides just getting a yield and profitable return, then a young man will stay on the farm. Men leave le farm at the present time because they are dissatisfied, and because ley do not receive any definite returns. If we are going to make the ling go so that we can keep our boys -and girls on the farm we must give lem prosperous communities, with better roads, better schools, better * </seg>

In closing I just want to relate an incident that occuratl not long 1 ago. Some time ago a woman wrote in to one of our great educational institu - tions and said that every time her husband went to drive a nail he would hit his thumb with the hammer, and what should she do about it. The answer came back, "Tell your husband to get both hands on the handle." Now that is what we want to do today. Let's get both hands on the handle and get the scrub bulls out of the way, swat them squarely be - tween the eyes and it will be the best thing Nebraska has ever accomp - lished for better agriculture. THE PRESIDENT We will now receive the report of the secretary, Mr. M. N. Lawritson. SECRETARY'S REPORT Mr. President and Members of the Nebraska Dairymen's Association: During the past year dairying has made a very i-ub-tantial growth in the state, and farmers generally are beginning to realize more and more the value of good dairy cattle. They can see that in order to make farming more profitable they must get away from the one crop system of farming and milk a few good cows. Statistics show that there is an average of 4 cows per farm in Nebraska. Of this number at least one - third of them do not pay for their feed. The milk produced by these "boarder" cows is being produced at a loss and is helping to create an overproduction of dairy products. The Nebraska Dairymen's Association can help remedy this condi - tion by impressing upon the minds of the farmers of the state the neces - sity of weeding out these unprofitable cows. Better c ws better cared for, rather than more cows is what Nebraska need? at the present time. In addition a still greater effort should be made to improve our herds by using more good bulls. There is no reason why Nebraska shculd not become one of the leading dairy states. We can produce an abun Irnce of roughage and feeds, which along with a favorable climate ma':e k'erl conditions for profitable milk production, that is, providing we have the proper kind of cows to work with. However in spite of the natural adaptability of the state to dairying, and the advancement made during the Past years, there is still room for improvement. We need to improve the quality of the dairy farmers in the state. There is no use putting good cows in the hands of scrub dairy - men. We as an association can do a great deal to develop dairying by </seg>
            <seg id="p386">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 388 assisting farmers in the state in getting started with good cows and teach them how to properly feed and care for them to obtain best results. The future of dairying in Nebraska will depend to a large extent upon the success or failure of those now engaged in it. Your association has been doing everything possible to bring about improvement in the dairy industry in the state. This fall a Pure Bred Sire Special was run through the state to sell the pure bred sire idea to the farmers of Nebraska. The C. B. &amp; Q. railroad in co-operation with the Nebraska Dairymen's Association, The Nebraska Dairy Development Society, the State College of Agriculture, various breed associations, and local committees in 31 towns and communities, exchanged thirty-one high class pure bred dairy sires for thirty-one of the scrubbiest bulls ever as - sembled in the state. These pure bred bulls were placed in the hands of farmers who were interested in dairying and who could be depended upon to take good care of the animal, and who would serve as a good demon - strator in his community showing the value of using a good pure bred sire in building up a herd.

            <seg id="p388">390 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The Nebraska Dairymen's Association furnished the exhibits for the xhibit cars on this special train. These exhibits showed the value of (roper methods of feeding and caring for dairy cattle, emphasizing the importance of a balanced ration, proper shelter and the "weeding out" of oarder cows by the means of the milk scale and Babcock test. The im - ortance of a good sire in building up a herd of dairy cattle was brought ut by an exhibit showing that the scrub sire would never improve a lerd, but a pure bred sire might in many cases improve a herd as much s fifty per cent in the first generation. Another project sponsored by the Nebraska Dairymen's Association which gave a great deal of publicity to the dairy industry of Nebraska in a national way was the sending of a State Dairy Herd to the Dairy Cattle Congress, Waterloo, Iowa, and to the National Dairy Show, Mil - waukee, Wisconsin, last fall. The herd was made up of animals selected from various herds throughout the state. The showing made was an excellent one, considering the fact that it was the first time such a venture had ever been made by Nebraska. It is believed that a very much better showing tan be made this year and an effort will be made to arrange for sending such a herd to the Nation - al Dairy Show. Your association has also been conducting educational work along airy lines throughout the state by preparing and sending out thirty - ight picture panels showing the advantage of proper feeding and man - agement of dairy cows, weeding out the unprofitable cows, breeding up he herd through the use of a good pure bred, suggesting methods of mproving the quality of dairy products and increasing the consumption f these products. Professor H. P. Davis and Professor E. 0. Anderson eserve a great deal of credit for their splendid work in preparing these panels. In addition to these panels, the "Mechanical Cow" exhibit which hows the various ways of using milk; the "Wheel of Health" and the Health Builders" exhibits showing the value of dairy products as a ood were sent out over the state. We feel that these exhibits have been a great factor in improving dairy conditions and creating a demand for more dairy products. There is still a great deal of work to be done along these lines and we need the assistance of every person in the state who is interested in the levelopment of the dairy industry. One way in which you can all help s to use more dairy products. I should like to have each member of his association consider himself a committee of one to see that his neigh - tors, as well as himself, use butter and not any of the so-called substi - utes; butter contains vitamines that are essential to health, vigor and rrowth. Eat only butter. Accept no substitutes. In this way we can »enefit every dairyman. </seg>
            <seg id="p389">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 391 The manufacturers of the various margarines are spending millions of dollars to put their products before the people and we must concede that they are having fair success. The records of the Federal Internal Revenue office show a total of 41 wholesale and 2,362 retail stores in Nebraska licensed to sell imitations in competition with butter. A re - cent investigation shows that Nebraska retailers are selling about 200 pounds each, per month or 5,668,800 pounds in a single year. This means that we are consuming imitations that replace the production of &amp;6.000 average Nebraska dairy cows, or the dairying on 14,000 Nebraska farms. But if everyone of you will start a campaign to use only butter you will be surprised what an effect it will have in the way of adding years to your life and dollars to your pockets. There is, however, one thing we must keep in mind and that is im - proving the quality of our dairy products. If we are going to try to create a demand for more dairy products we must place a good quality product upon the market. This can best be brought about by the unit - ed efforts of dairymen and creamerymen to put out a product of sup - ior quality. The dairymen should co-operate by delivering a good qual - ity product to the treamerymen who in turn should make every effort to place a high class product on the market. With improvement in quality comes an increased demand which in turn brings an increase of prices. When the time comes that we can all co-operate in this way we will not only be producing the most butter of any state in the Union, but we wil] also on account of the superior quality of our product, be receiving the most money of any dairy state for our products. Our association had its usual display at the State Fair, and it was even bigger and better than the year before. The exhibits consisted of panels and pictures which showed the importance of having better cows, better cared for, and mated with high class pure bred sires, the import - ance of producing a good clean product, the food value of dairy products, etc. all of which are factors in making dairying more profitable. A great deal of credit is due Professor E. O. Anderson and Professor H. P. Davis who planned and arranged the exhibit. Your association is doing as much as possible to encourage Dairy Calf Club work among the boys and girls in the state. This year we pre - sented medals to the boy or girl in each county who was the champion in Dairy Calf Club work in that county. During the past year a great deal of improvement has been made along dairy lines, but this coming year we want to do even more; and we want the co-operation and help of everyone who is interested in dairying, for without your help and support it is difficult to accomplish as much as we should.

Oldham, Field Representative of the Holstein-Friesian Associations of America We think in Wisconsin that we have got a pretty nice state. But in coming out here I did not expect to find these California conditions of climate here in January. Of course, from what little I hear, if I had come "here in December I would not have probably found such, (conditions, but yet my friend, Archie Haecker, who met me said, "This is some thing we always have." A philosopher in his wanderings strayed into a stone quarry where a number of laborers were at work. Passing among them, he nodded pleasantly to the men as they worked. Some responded indifferently, some merely scowled, the friendliness of the philosopher was not wholly appreciated, yet all of the workmen looked more or less alike in their rough garb of clothing. Stopping at the side of one husky fellow, the philosopher ventured the question, "What are you doing?" The answer came bluntly, "I'm cutting stone." As if tempted to add, "What do you suppose I'm doing?" Approaching the next workman with the same question, the philosopher was favored with a sarcastic grin and a rather sneering reply, "I'm working for $5.00 a day." The next workman was a youthful earnest looking chap, who responded as he wiped the sweat from his brow, "I'm helping to build a cathedral." And as he pointed the philosopher turned and saw in the distance, the outer walls of a beauti - ful building in the process of construction. A cathedral is a symbol of an ideal. This young man had the vision of the completed structure and he apparently was justly proud of his contribution thereto — his part in the job. He was enjoying his job even though it was humble work and this enjoyment was reflected in the workmanship evident in the work he was doing. The architect may de - sign the structure but every man on the job down to the humblest work - man may be proud of his part in the work of building. A cathedral to justify the name must be a building of surpassing beauty, and devoted to the highest ideals. Cathedrals are not built in a day or even a few weeks or months. Some of them have taken a lifetime in effort to fin - ance, planning and construction. Real success is in the joy of working and in the satisfaction of helping to build. Dairying and the conduction of a real dairy, with its cows and ita business operation when successful is invariably the outgrowth of an ideal exemplified in the joy of building — in the task of doing. Taken in - dividually, it is perhaps the dream of a single individual — taken collect - lively dairying must have attached to it — the everyday life efforts of all </seg>

Who love their chosen job and who are willing to put into practical attempt, any and all ideals connectable to the industry. Faith and the pursuance of the ideal make business sound and suc - cessful. Dairying is one of the great businesses of modern agriculture. Eh in the dairy cow and in her ability together with reasonable tical application of business judgment in building to an ideal, is d to bring success in dairying. However, we have far too few builders in the Dairy Industry. I'm re - minded of the small boy who was asked by his teacher in physiology class, "What is the function of the stomach?". He replied, "The func - tion of the stomach is to hold up the petticoat." We have too many dairymen who have one thought and that is that their job is to hold up the milk supply. Many of them are losing money and they don't know it. They are producers of a marketable commodity which is a food ne - cessity in the human diet, yet they go on producing without profit be - cause they are content to guess rather then to know the particulars re - garding their production costs or the facts concerning the efficiency of the machines in their factory plant. Dairy cows are machines and the barn is a factory. tion in dairy products in this country. I prefer to say that we seemingly LSome will say that we have already reached the point of over produc - ve reached the point of saturation. We are far from the height of consumption possibilities. Whatever the statement, the fact is that this holding up of the milk supply to the saturation point with resultant unsatisfactory prices accruing to producers everywhere, is a charge of incompetency which must be laid at the door of those dairymen who simply milk cows. Those thousands of haphazard unbusinesslike lab - orers who day after day in an indifferent way milk cows that do not make a profit and whose product is glutting an undeveloped market with the result that we have reached a point where there is question as to t&gt;~ future of dairying in the mind of the alarmist and his following. Civilization is not going out of existance. The Dairy Industry is not going out of business. Agriculture is not ruined. Ameria is the great - est country on earth. We in the United States have an interesting pop - ulation to feed, right now it is 110,000,000 mouths. Europe is also look - ing to us. The per capita consumption of dairy products is increasing encouragingly and there are wonderful possibilities ahead. Dr. C. W. Larson, chief of the Dairy Division of the U. S. Department of Agricul - ture, is authority for the statement that during the past five years the consumption of whole milk has increased 17 per cent. The consumption of butter which was greatly decreased during the war is again showing a </seg>
            <seg id="p395">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 397 return to normal, condensed milk and ice cream shows a decided increase and cheese is holding its own. To date dairymen of the United States have done very little to cause an increase in consumption. However, dairymen are organizing and developing merchandising plans. Co-oper - ative marketing is being stimulated. Farming is again evidencing cour - age'. The grain grower is not bankrupt. The dairyman is not suffering. Agriculture is facing prosperity and the corner stone of agricultural prosperity is good livestock. There is not a better kind of good livestock than good dairy cattle and personally I am of the opinion the good pure bred registered Holstein-Friesian cattle are the very best of all good kinds of livestock. We have 24,675,000 cows on the farms of the United States. Less than 6 to a farm. Less than 1,000,000 or about 3 per cent of all the cows are pure bred. The great majority are Holsteins. The average production per cow in the U. S. is about 4,000 pounds of milk and 160 pounds butter fat. Records from the advanced registry officers of the various breed as - sociations and from our agricultural colleges indicate that the production of the pure bred is far above this average. Wisconsin cows average nearly 5,000 pounds of milk and 190 pounds of butter fat. Nebraska cows av - erage less than 2,750 pounds of milk and approximately 100 pounds of butter fat. It has taken Wisconsin fifty years to ge.t this production point. Improvement in building the dairy industry is at its best a slow job. It takes years to breed a dairy cow and a lifetime to make a dairy - man. Wisconsin, great dairy state that she is, the greatest possibly in America, is just realizing the importance of improvized business meth - ods in the dairy field. The hard times of recent years in my opinion are a blessing in disguise. Dairymen have been brought face to face with the truth that inferior animals are not through the dignity of a pedi - gree or the grace of an indifferent dairyman, elevated to the point of desirability. The whole truth is not spoken in the statement that "the bull is more than half the herd". The female of the species may be more desirable than the male in breeding operations for sincerely no good son ever had other than a good mother and for this reason we turn to the dam for the inherent character that we like to see in our bulls and in the daughters that they produce. Like begets the like or the likeness of an ancestor is an axiom that cannot be denied even in this generation^ One cannot get something for nothing even in the livestock game. In the dairy business we must know we cannot guess. Do we keep our cows or do our cows keep us becomes a question of importance. Mating the right bull on the right type cow of rugged constitution with proven ancestors and capable of highly yearly production is a reasonable guar - antee of success. Any other kind of practice is expensive guesswork. It ain't good business to do otherwise and we disregard the ideals in dairying when we go contrary to good business practices. </seg>
            <seg id="p396">RE.PORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 398 Take Wisconsin for example. I refer to the Badger State because I mow more about Wisconsin. Then too, Wisconsin dairymen have gone arther in the direction of better dairying than have most other states. In 1870, Wisconsin had 308,000 just cows. Today we have two and a uarter million largely special purpose dairy animals, mainly Holsteins nd producing 9,000,000,000 pounds of milk worth two hundred million ollars. Fifty years has Wisconsin been at the dairy business and today we have but 175 cow testing associations. Yet this number is one - 'ourth of all the cow testing associations in the U. S. A total of 5,000 airymen owning 80,000 cows are in Cow Testing Association work at his time. A lot you say, but only 3% per cent of all the cows and only "&gt;4 per cent of the dairymen in the greatest dairy state in America. Yet lis small percentage of men and animals in constructive building has raised the average production per cow in Wisconsin to the point where exceeds the annual production per cow of the United States by ap - roximately 1,000 pounds of milk and 30 pounds of butter fat. The verage Wisconsin cow produces 4,975 pounds of milk and 190 pounds f fat, the equivalent of 237.5 pounds of butter, while our cow testing association cows in Wisconsin average 7,106 pounds of milk and 273.5 tounds of fat or the equivalent of 341.8 pounds of butter. In other ords. Cow Testing Association cows average 2,131 pounds of milk and 3 pounds more of butter fat than the average Wisconsin cow. It is worth while, you say, but we have been too long getting to it. ' In 1906 our first Cow Testing Association was organized. In 1909 we had ten such associations; in 1913, 17; in 1915, 39; in 1923, 151; and ow 175. In the 18 years over 500,000 cows have been put on record by 3,000 dairymen. 15 cows to a herd on the average. 175 Cow Testing Associations in a state with more than two million cows. Is it enough ? 'ou tell. Fifty out of seventy-one counties have one or more associa - ions in operation. One county has a dozen. Twenty-one counties have one. Note the improvement in Cow Testing Association herds. In the &gt;,000 herds in Cow Testing Association work, we find less than one-half f one per cent using scrub bulls. 63 per cent of the pure bred bulls in use are Holstein; less than 20 per cent Guernseys; 4 per cent Jerseys; and the remaining 13 per cent are all other breeds combined. Thus Hol - teins outnumber all the other breeds combined by a considerable margin. 2 per cent of the 175 Cow Testing Associations m our state are entirely ree from the scrub bull, yet outside of the Cow Testing Association herds, we find nearly 60 per cent of our Wisconsin dairymen still use the scrub bull. In other states that contribute to our dairy production, we find an appalling situation. Pure bred dairy bulls in use on only ten to twenty per cent of the farms. In Nebraska we find nine per cent of the bulls in use pure bred; in Iowa, twelve per cent; in Minnesota, sixteen per cent; in Illinois, nineteen per cent; in Indiana, twenty-one per cent; </seg>
            <seg id="p397">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 399 in Ohio, thirty-two per cent; in Wisconsin, forty-three per cent; in Ver - mont, fifty-two per cent; and in Massachusetts, fifty-seven per cent. Just think of it, only two states in the Union with more than fifty per cent pure bred bulls in use on the farms. How about improvement? Isn't the opportunity tremendous? Of course it is. Where then are these better sort of bulls to come from ? Out of the pure bred cows carefully on test. Wisconsin has one Cu\v Testing Association where each cow of 350 averaged 9,849 pounds of milk and 34i uounds of butter fat. Twenty - five associations report one or more herds averaging over 10,000 pounds of milk and more than 400 pounds of butter fat. Seventeen associations had one or more cows average 600 pounds of fat and nearly 15,000 pounds of milk. Eighteen associations report an average yearly produc - tion per cow of 7,500 pounds of milk and 300 pounds of fat. 535 herds in sixty-o"ie associations averaged more than this amount of milk and butter fa.., while 4,185 cows in 105 associations are entered in the pouna a day list producers. Mr. P. E. McNall of our Wisconsin College of Agriculture gives some interesting data gleaned from a survey conduct - ed in co-operation with the U. S. Dairy Division in Walworth County, Wisconsin. I was County Agent there five years. I know the county. It is one of the best counties in Wisconsin. Yet all dairymen there are not business men or they would change the conditions. Herds having cows producing more than 7,000 pounds of milk per cow were able to produce milk $1.19 per hundred cheaper than those producing less than 5,000 pounds per cow. Cows yielding less than 5,000 lbs. per cow were not profitable. 100 farms where the herds averaged less than 5,000 lbs. per cow showed a farm income of only $476.00. 129 farms where the production per cow averaged 6,220 showed a farm income of $1,087. While 33 farms averaging 8,138 pounds of milk per cow showed an income of $1,205. It was also found that the high producing cows were far more economical and efficient, and this argues strongly in the cost per hun - dred weight of milk. In the herds averaging less than 5,000 pounds per cow it required 38.3 pounds of concentrates to produce 100 pounds of milk. In the herds producing between 5,000 and 7,000 pounds of milk per cow 31.3 pounds of concentrates were consumed per hundred pounds of milk produced; and those herds producing more than 7,000 pounds per cow annually received 27.3 pounds of concentrates for each hundred pounds of milk produced. The result was the same with other feeds. As pro - duction increased from 4,625 pounds per cow to 8,138 pounds, the pounds of silage and soiling crops required to produce one hundred pounds of niiik decreased from 139 to 119 pounds per hundred weight; dry rough - age decreased from 75 pounds to 44 pounds, and the pasture required to produce 100 pounds of milk decreased from 3.1 to 1.6 days. It also re- </seg>
            <seg id="p398">400 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE quired one hour man labor less per hundred weight of milk produced in the highest producing herds than in the low producing- ones. When the feed and labor requirements are expressed in dollars and cents, it was found that the herds averaging more than 7,000 pounds of milk per cow produced their product at a cost of 40 cents per hundred weight less than did the herds whose production was between five and seven thous - and pounds and $1.19 less than those herds whose production did not ex ceed 5,000 pounds per cow. One conclusion stands out most strikingly, high producers generally cost more per cow but much less per hundred weight of milk produced. In other words, it is very much easier to make good with cows which produce seven thousand or more pounds of milk annually than with cows which yield but four or five thousand pounds and it is still easier if the production average per animal can be boosted above the ten thousand figure. I am very happy to say that the high cow in Wisconsin's 175 Cow Testing Associations is a pure bred registered Holstein — Pauline Canary De Kol Homestead. She produced 22,914 pounds of milk and 839 pounds of fat, the equivalent of 1048 pounds of butter. She made a net profit of $353.00 for her own in one year. Twelve stable mates, all pure bred Holsteins from the same herd constitute the high herd in the Cow Testing Association work in Wisconsin this year. They averaged 15,118 pounds of milk and 534.8 pounds of fat, the equivalent of 668 pounds of butter during the year 1924. This is a record that strikes pride into the heart of every loyal owner of the black and white breed. It is proof of the supremacy of the registered Holstein. It is the strongest kind of an argument that blood will tell, and that testing, not guessing, is the only real way to know what is going on in the dairy herd. Beginning with native cows, then improving them with year after year breeding them to a pure bred sire whose ancestors were high producers and finally selling off the high grades and replacing them with registered animals, all the while in a Cow Testing Association. Leo Kuhl and Sons, of Hazel Green, have out produced and I dare say out profited all other compar - able dairymen in America's greatest dairy state and the Cow Testing association and the pure bred bull along with sane businesslike manage - ment are responsible. Another field of record making is that of advanced registry record making that is being done by the pure bred owners. Wisconsin has been making strides here too, but as with the Cow Testing Association, the work has not progressed as rapidly as it should.

In 1912-13 791 cows were on semi-official test, In 1922-23 2284 cows were on semi-official test There are approximately 100,000 pure bred females in Wisconsin, so the number on test is a relative small percentage of the total. To be sure, records are better as time passes. Up to 1903 the highest seven day record in Wisconsin was that of Alcartra Polkadot, daughter of Al - cartra Polkadot Corrector, the sire of Tilly Alcartra. She made 20.22 pounds of fat and 494.2 pounds of milk. In 1913 Grace Fayne 2nd's Homestead made 28.44 pounds of fat and 524.5 pounds of milk. In 1923 Sadie Gerben Hengerveld De Kol made 32.03 pounds of fat and 782 pounds of milk. Ten years ago that great cow champion, Dora Korn - dyke made 29,395.7 pounds of milk and 1052.75 pounds of fat. A year ago one of John Erickson's great cows, Wisconsin Pride 2nd, made 29,562.9 pounds of milk and 1062.35 pounds of fat as a three-year-old. In these days cows have a much better chance. Feeding, management and housing are improvements that have come along with better dairy - ing. Then too, there is the improvement in pure breds that is day by day being made in the better breeding establishments who made a busi - ness of furnishing the rank and file with seed stock of the foundation kind — the only kind. Yet in spite of all improvements and chances to do better, some cows, even on test continue to produce as poorly as the poor ones twenty years ago. How about those not on test, isn't it presumable that they, too, are not keeping pace with the increased costs of dairying ? I could go on for hours telling you specifically the merits of the Cow Testing Association. Likewise could I extoll the pure bred sire. Both of these subjects are closely knit with improvement in dairy cows and the dairy industry generally. However, doubtless they will be cov - ered in great detail at some future time, either on this program or else - where as you men get together from time to time. Yet I cannot refrain from a parting exclamation — they are all important to success in dairy - ing unless you realize the wisdom of my statement in this connection. In conclusion I want to say a word or two about your pure bred own - ing dairymen generally. I believe we stand indicted on three counts. First; we have not proven the worth of the pure bred in competition with grades on the average farm under general farm, conditions. Pure bred owners have steared clear of the Cow Testing Associations. You have been content to stand pat on assumption of superiority in produc- </seg>
            <seg id="p400">402 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I tion under forced feeding conditions and on the worth of a pedigree while the grade owner has used the Cow Testing Association and his neighbor's milk weights at the creamery as his guide to his breeding and culling operations. Secondly; the pure bred breeder has too long closed his eyes to the importance of type, size and individuality gener - ally. You have neglected the importance of fitting for the sale ring. You lave failed to market the undesirables over the block, many times they lave been passed on to some unsuspecting beginner and he has found oat their worth to his disgust and promptly has he gone back to the grade ranks counting his cost as misplaced confidence and not willing to be stung or burned again. Thirdly; you have failed to support your pro - ducts on the market. Maybe, I might say, you have failed to produce a product that was one hundred per cent right. Then we had best think well to our products. ■ With them right, then we must merchandise and advertise. This is no job for the individual. It must be done collectively. Dairymen must dig into their pockets and help finance those projects that can be co-operatively carried on through their organizations. Dairy products are indispensible to the human diet. Here is a great ar - gument in their sale. We have failed to tell the public about it. I can - not conceive of a body of business men overlooking such a bet, yet dairymen have not done it that's all. The Nebraska dairyman, let me say in concluding, has many natural advantages. He has unlimited cheap and nutritious foods that can and are being converted into food for livestock. No state that I know produces roughage, silage and alfalfa like you do. You also have the grains for con - centrates. You may be short of pasture yet you can grow sweet clover and perhaps you have other possibilities through soiling crops. How - ever, you must discard the idea of big herds with many just cows. Rath - er would I see you have a small yet good herd of real profit making an - imals to fit in with your scheme of diversified agriculture. Your hogs, your steers, your (cash crops of grain, corn and alfalfa always will have a place in Nebraska farming. The dairy herd can take its place and pay the current monthly bills, but I doubt if you want to become outstand - ing as is Wisconsin in the dairy industry. We have to do it, whereas you can best use dairying as a means of greater general purpose farms in bolstering the weakness in a system of farm operation that involves too great a hazard in one crop or one kind of livestock as the basis of farm income. Rid yourselves of the scrub bull. Get the idea of more bred for pro - duction cows. Use the Cow Testing Association. Use your College, your county agents, your extension workers, your testers, your bulletins, your press. Those who would get ahead must have knowledge for knowl - edge is power. Take advantage of meetings. You must appreciate bet - ter breeding, better feeding, better care and management. You must </seg>
            <seg id="p401">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 403 understand that a cow is a great machine and that the barn is a factory. Efficiency, economy, cost of operation and production become more than mere words to you. I am reminded of a story that Hugh Chalmers tells. At one time he was the highest paid sales manager in the world. Receiving $75,000 from the National Cash Register Company. He quit this job to go into th automobile game. That's how big he is. Each year the company held a salesman convention and at this convention they offered a hand - some prize to the man who had made the greatest possible selling percent - age during the year. Three straight years was this prize won by the same man, a fellow by the name of Schultz who had Germany for his territory. When asked how it was that he always won the prize year after year, h€' replied that he attributed his success to faith in his product, persever - ance of the ideal that he had set cut to outsell the other fellows and last but not least to the thought that no one could ask him a question about his job that he could not answer. Not all of you will be so efficient that you will always be ahead of the answers to questions of importance in dairying, but all of you can at least have faith in superior performance, perseverance in pushing your ideals, you can sharpen your appetites for desirable needy information and this satisfied desire will make you well informed on a subject that is all absorbing and that is seemingly unlim - ited in its greater possibilities. Who will say that we have reached the limit -for the production with a dairy cow of any one breed? Who will say that we are past the age of scientific discovery in dairying ? Who will say that the very best balanced rations have already been figured for the dairy cow ? Who will attempt to say that any ,one of the many possibil - ities in science or instruction has been fully expounded ? Dairying is not a cure-all. It is a confining job. It is a close student of business and science of industry who gets to the top. Dairying has and will continue to reward those who persevere, those who have faith and those who believe in ideals. In the past few years in common with all other industries and forms of farming has suffered hard times. There is this to be said however, those sections of our country which have been most largely devoted to dairying have suffered less during these diffi - cult times and have survived better than those devoted to any other branch of the great agricultural industry. This has had one very desir - able effect; it has revealed to the business world, and particularly to the banking interests, the safe and substantial character of the dairy in - dustry. Officers of the Reserve Banks of America have discovered and have published to the world the fact that the only country banks during the past two and one-half years which have remained in anything like normal condition and which are able to take care of the needs of their communities are those banks which are situated in the dairy districts. </seg>
            <seg id="p402">404 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The result is that the dairy business has found it easier perhaps, to ob - tain credit for its needs than any other kind of farming. I would like to say to you that all of the clouds in the business sky have rolled away but I am unable to do so. I do, however, feel that ag - ricultural prosperity of a sane but conservative kind is in the making. It will take time to get the farmer's selling price back in equilibrium with the purchase price of the manufactured article that he has to buy. How - ever, business generally recognizes the variance and business is suffer - ing. This condition cannot last indefinitely and already are we seeing signs of improvement that wield power and influence in business. Having survived the hard times and now facing improved agricultural prosper - ity, the dairy industry is in good condition to move forward. We are not receiving what we should for our milk, that is the rank and file. The av - erage produced with his average production per cow is not profiting as he would like. Yet more people are buying cows than ever before. There seems to be a steady demand for dairy products. Consumption of dairy products is increasing at an encouraging rate so that we all can feel hopeful regarding the future of the dairy business. I do not hesi - tate for a moment to say, there never was a better time for the young man or for he who is dairying, inclined to start a pure bred herd than today. I care not the breed. Let him choose the one he likes best. He will do best with it. However study the breeds. Holsteins appear to me as best fitting Nebraska conditions. Grow into the business — don't simply go into it. like the baby — crawl, creep, walk and then travel at man speed. But get started now. You never will be able to buy high class dairy cattle more cheaply than you can buy them now. By the time you have builded your herd in a comparatively cheap foundation, market conditions will have greatly improved and you will have a very valuable investment. If Nebraska is to be a great dairy state, a power in the dairy world, or even a great state among agricultural states; if my state of Wiscon - sin is to continue to keep abreast of the times and to be a leader in the field of dairying; if any state aspires to a front rank position in dairying or to a leadership with cows, records and farmers, then such remarks as I have left behind with you today, must be given a place in your thots. You may change the wording but the ideas will remain much as I have stated them in talking to you. Dairymen of Nebraska, I am pleased to have had a chance to appear on this program and to talk to you. I hope you have enjoyed my thots in (somewhat near the enjoyment that I have had in giving them to you. If it is not too late, may I refresh the Holiday Spirit you have enjoyed, in wishing you again a bright happy and very prosperous New Year of 1925. </seg>

We will now be addressed by a man who needs no introduction upon this program or to this body. WHAT PLACE HAS THE DAIRY COW ON NEBRASKA FARMS? Hon. S. R. McKelvie, Former Governor of Nebraska and Publisher of the Nebraska Farmer I am very glad Mr. Oldham preceded me. He speaks with authority. He holds a responsible position in his line. He has said very much that I had in mind to say, so I must have been right in what I thought was important to say here. He is in the dairy profession and has a re - sponsible place in that business. In discussing this subject, let us keep in mind that every cow that gives milk is not necessarily a dairy cow. The term "dairy cow" should be used in its proper sense, that is, a cow worthy of the name. Thus viewed, there is no doubt that the dairy cow has a very important place on Nebraska farms. Government records indicate that the production of creamery butter in Nebraska has increased gradually from 60,500,000 in 1919 to approx - imately 84,000,000 pounds in 1924. As a side line to general farming, and that is what dairying is mostly in Nebraska, this is an item that cannot be ignored. For 1924 it represented and average of 850 pounds of butter fat for each producer who patronized the creameries, or an average gross income to each producer of $350 for one year. This does not take into account the value of dairy products «onsumed on the farm. The aggregate of which is a very considerable item. But the actual place for the dairy cow is not proven by aggregate values. Undoubtedly, a very large number of the producers made little, if any, money on their investment last year. This is indicated by the fact that the average gross income for producers was only '$350, which means, of course, that many farmers had a total income from butter fat of much less than that. Taking into account the investment in dairy stock, labor and feed, it is evident that many of these producers worked for nothing and boarded themselves and their cows beside. The determining factor is the cost of production based upon the investment, including la - bor and feed. Unless the dairy cow will pay on this basis there cer - tainly is no place for her on the farm. Broadly speaking, a cow should produce 150 pounds of butter fat a year in order te make a profit. In times like the present when the cost </seg>
            <seg id="p404">406 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE of feed is high, and the price of butter fat is relatively low, the produc - tion per cow should be greater than that. I believe I am safe in saying that not one-half of the so-called dairy cows in Nebraska are reaching that point. Let us consider a project that was carried on last year by the Thayer County Testing Association. In that project the ten best cows averaged 268 pounds of butter fat per year, while the ten poorest cows averaged only 149 pounds. Reduced to values, the ten best cows gave their owners a net return of $82.33 per cow, after deducting the freight bill. The ten poorest cows gave an average net return of $24.19. These figures taken at a time when butter fat was much higher and the cost of feed lower than it is now. This project proved conclusively the importance of weeding out the boarder cows. It took no more for the feed for the cows that produced the best returns, and no more time to care for them, than it did for the poorest. Also, it is indicated the vast possibilities for improvement. Fifty per cent of the cows in the project produced less than 200 pounds in the year. They were better than average farm cows. But using them as a basis, if the 3500 cows in Thayer County had done as well as the first ten in the test, that county would have been richer $175,000 from the 1923 cream checks alone. This, I believe, indicates clearly one of the first things to be done if practical dairying is to find a permanent place in the scheme of Nebras - ka farming. Accurate tests must be made, and the unprofitable producers eliminated. Guess work will not do. The farmer must know which cows are paying their way and which are not. Aside from the loss that is sustained by the individual farmer when boarder cows are kept, there is still an added reason why these unprofit - able producers must be eliminated. The United States had a surplus of butter over and above the five year average for December of something like 50,000,000 pounds. This surplus came from cows that actually lost money for their owners. If these were sent to the shambles, the surplus would be removed, and a much larger return would be realized upon the cows that have proven profitable, even under adverse conditions. So the disposition of the poorer cows becomes a community question, and the dairyman is interested whether these cows are in his herd or in the herd of his neighbor. Dairy testing associations is the legal logical process by which the weeding out can be done. Of course, if all farmers should turn their attention especially to dairying, the business would be overdone, but I do not believe that gen - erally this ought to be, especially in a state like Nebraska. We are richly blessed by conditions that enable us to engage successfully in di- </seg>
            <seg id="p405">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 407 versified farming or mixed husbandry. This relieves us of the necessity for putting all of our eggs in one basket. The average farmer can keep a few cows as a side line, and if they are the right kind, properly cared for, they will prove profitable. The successful pursuit of dairying as a side line does not necessitate a large investment. Good grade cows, well cared for will do. In the Thayer County test the most profitable cow, a grade Jersey, had an in - come of $100 above the cost of feed and was valued by her owner at $60.00. The next two most profitable cows gave almost as large a net return and were relatively a grade Holstein and a grade Shorthorn. With this kind of a beginning, and the use of good sires, any farmer can grow into the dairy business without too great an initial outlay. I regard individuality and breeding oi first importance, but the value of these will be lost unless followed with proper feed and handling. Fortunately, we have in Nebraska the foods for which eastern pro - ducers are obliged to pay from $8.00 to $10.00 per ton more than the Nebraska farmer. These feeds are grown on our farms, and can be utilized most economically. It is true we do not have as good pastures as some dairy regions. Alfalfa is not very satisfactory as a forage crop, while blue grass and tame pastures dry up in the latter part of the sum - mer. Sweet clover is supplying the want for pastures in some localities. In view of our pasture shortage, it is better to depend not too much on summer dairying. Cows that freshen in the Fall may be carried through the Winter on our ordinary grain crops with alfalfa or silage, or both. Then the extra work incident to dairying may be done at a time of the year when attention to other branches of farming is not so pressing. This kind of dairying requires better buildings, and more thoughful regard for handling, but it makes farming an "all-the-year" business, and utilizes labor as well as some products that would be lost. There is the ever arising question of whether the dairy business may not be overdone. The present surplus of butter would seem to indicate it. But there are other indications that indicate the contrary. The United States has turned from an importing nation to an exporting nation. Practically no butter is coming into this country now. The domestic con - sumption of butter has increased one-half pound per capita or 50,000,000 pounds for the nation during the past year. Production is about five per cent less for the nation than it was at the same time a year ago. It appears now that the present butter surplus will be absorbed by early spring. Prices then should strengthen. The domestic consumption of butter is not as great as it ought to be on account of the use of substitutes. It is a surprising and alarming fact that enough butter substitutes are used in Nebraska to replace the </seg>
            <seg id="p406">408 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE production of 56,000 average Nebraska dairy cows, or the dairying of 4,000 Nebraska farms or twelve counties. These substitutes are made rom cocoanut oil, soy bean oil, cottonseed oil and peanut oil. None of whith are produced in Nebraska or the corn belt. Oleomargarine is an - other substitute some of the constituents of which are produced on Neb - raska farms. There are so many arguments against the use of these sub - stitutes that it seems unnecessary to more than call the facts to the atten - ion of the consuming public. No Nebraskan should use a substitute for &gt;utter, even though the prize is lower. Usually we think of monkeys in connection with cocoanuts and the association becomes real when we Jebraskans use cocoanut oil for butter. There is no surer way of mak - ng monkeys of ourselves. Manufacture and distribution have much to do with determining the profit that may be had from dairying. Ultimately, the time will come, as it has in many other states, when we shall have cheeseries, conden - series and more creameries. This development must bide the establish - ment of substantial herds and correct methods of dairying, to insure an adequate and a well sustained supply of raw product throughout the year. To hasten the movement without taking these preliminary steps is to invite disaster. Finally, I do not believe that all farmers should go into the dairy business, even as a side line. Dairying is rather a more technical busi - ness than general farming. It requires a knowledge of the business, a love for it, and close application to the task of milking and feeding at regular intervals. It cannot be done successfully by those who do not like to work, or have no inherent love for animals. The cow that is booted about, turned to a tank of ice-cold water in the winter, and left to stand on the sunny side of a barbed wire fence when the weather is below zero, will exact heavy toll for her owner for such treatment. Un - less you are willing to forego a pleasure jaunt at milking and feeding time, and can provide the ordinary conveniences and comforts for con - ducting the business properly, it is far better to stay out of dairying and save a loss for yourself, while leaving the field to those who are willing to do the job right. The times demand that every line of business and every branch of in - dustry shall serve the community by producing the necessities of life at the lowest possible cost. This means in farming as well as in every - thing else, that surplus overhead and labor must be employed in side lines that will fit in harmoniously with the main avenues of effort, thus eliminating waste and lost motion. On the average Nebraska farm, there is nothing that fills this bill better than a few good dairy cows, well </seg>
            <seg id="p407">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 409 BY PRESIDENT SWARTSLEY We will now be favored with an address by J. B. Fitch " BIGGER PROFITS BY BETTER FEEDING" J. B. Fitch, Professor Dairy Husbandry, Kansas State Agricultural College I was scheduled to appear on the program of the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association last year but in coming from Kansas City I was delayed in a snow drift forty miles out of Lincoln until after the meeting of this Association had adjourned. I was very sorry to disappoint those who had the program in charge, but it could not be helped. The subject assigned to me last year has been carried over until this year and I am to talk to you today on the subject, "Bigger Profits by Better Feeding." During the lapse of this year many things have happened which will not only make it more difficult to deliver to you something worth while on this subject, but also, the demand for information on this subject is more acute than it was a year ago due to a reduction in the margin be - tween the cost of production and the price received for dairy products. On January 2, 1924, the Kansas City price for No. 2 corn was 68c. On the same date this year the price was $1.20 per bushel. Wheat, No. 1 hard, was quoted at $1.20 as compared with $1.82 per bushel this year. Bran was quoted at $1.25 per hundred, now it is quoted at $1.55 per hundred in carload lot. Kafir was quoted at $1.27 per hundred and $1.82 now. Cotton Seed Meal $47.50 a year ago, now $46.10. Linseed oil meal $50.30, now $51.80. Standard alfalfa hay $21.00, now $20.50. Butter fat a year ago was selling at 53c per pound and on January 2, 1925, was selling at 40c. While some of the feeds commonly used in the production of milk are at the same price level as last year, the price of bran, corn, kafir and oth - er feeds comparable with corn have increased in price at the same time that the price of butterfat was working lower than a year ago. It has also seemed to me that at the dairy cattle sales I have attended, dairy cattle have sold somewhat lower than a year ago and with less demand. This, in view of our past experience in Kansas, is to be expected due to the fact that we had both a good corn crop and a good wheat crop and we are getting good money for both. Our greatest demand for dairy cattle has come in short crop or adverse years with a corresponding let up in good years. The conditions mentioned above and the fact that on January first there was a surplus of forty million pounds of butter over the amount in </seg>
            <seg id="p408">410 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE storage a year ago, is causing our dairy farmer to ask two questions: First; have we an over production of dairy products? Second; does it pay to feed grain to dairy cows at the present price of butterfat? My mission here is to discuss the second question asked above, but I want to dwell briefly on some ideas I have in connection with the first question before passing to the second. I have thought of this question in connection with my own state and since the conditions in Kansas and Nebraska are so similar they might not be out of place here. Any commodity that for any period of time holds a price higher than that of other commodities will stimulate the production of this product. Dairy products are somewhat different than most other products due to the fact that it takes a long time to really increase production, it is confining work and any surplus that causes a reduction in price automatically causes less cows to be milked and less at - tention given to production. In comparison with other years there seems to be a surplus of butter and a surplus of condensed milk in storage. The cheese market, while well stocked, is apparently in good condition. Some localities report a surplus of fluid milk and a price under cost of production. Whether this is a temporary surplus or the beginning of a period of depression, time alone can tell. Whatever the outcome we should adjust our operations to meet this change by the elimination of poor cows and better systems of marketing products. In general our farmers interested in dairying are divided into three classes: 1. General farmer. 2. General farmer with dairy tendencies. 3. Dairy farmer. 1. General farmer. This man may milk a few fresh cows during the year and sell some butterfat, but he is not interested in building up his herd, but milks just as a means of getting a little more out of his cows. This class of farmer will produce a large proportion of our dairy products. 2. General farmer with dairy tendencies. This man is also a general farmer but has become dissatisfied with keeping ordinary cows and with slip shod methods and is interested in building up an efficient herd of dairy cows. He may not want more than eight or ten cows but he wants them grod and he may be interested in pure bred dairy cattle. 3. Dairy farmer. The third class -is the man that is putting all his energy in dairying, marketing dairy animals and dairy products. This man may be specialized to the extent of being a one crop farmer. He </seg>
            <seg id="p409">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 411 represents a small proportion of those who produce our dairy products. He may be a commercial dairyman or a breeder of dairy cattle. When prices of dairy products drop he is hit hardest as is the case with the one crop farmer. As mentioned above the strictly dairy farmer is hit hardest during the period of low prices for dairy cattle and for dairy products and such a farmer should safeguard himself by having some other source of income. To my mind there never will be a time when six to eight cows will not be good property on our farms. A great portion of the states of Kansas and Nebraska produce wheat abundantly, perhaps the greatest wheat producing country in the world. Our farmers should continue to produce wheat but they should protect themselves with some system of farming that will make wheat farming less hazardous. To me this means a sys - tem of diversified farming around some kind of livestock. For the wheat farmer, Winter dairying fits in very well. A small herd of cows will not only convert waste feed and waste labor into cream checks but will also enable the farmer to maintain soil fertility. It is possible that some of our well established -dairy states will have to give way to other states where natural advantages favor cheaper production of dairy products. In years past dairy production was, through necessity, close to the seat of consumption. Modern methods of handling dairy products have elimin - ated this need. Those of you who attended the dairy show at Milwaukee perhaps recall seeing a truck load of milk that had come overland from Philadelphia to Milwaukee in sixty hours. This milk was six days old when dispensed at the show and had increased in temperature from thirty-six degrees to forty-four degrees during the trip. To me this is very interesting because it means that in the future Nebraska and Kan - sas can furnish milk to Chicago or any of the other Eastern cities with very little difficulty. We already have feed advantages over many of our dairy states and the advent of the whole milk market will attract some to dairying who might not be interested otherwise. In case Kansas and Nebraska ever have a surplus of dairy cattle they will have an advantage in the sale of livestock over the states to the north and west. By bringing to the attention of consumers the food value of high quality dairy products and by eliminating both cows and men not fitted for dairy work, I believe we can avoid any very serious slump in the market of our dairy products. It may be true that some districts have too many dairy cattle now, but I am sure Kansas and Nebraska can use to advantage more dairy cattle than we now have. In answer to the question whether it pays to feed grain to cows at present prices of dairy products, I can only say that it depends first of </seg>
            <seg id="p410">412 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE all upon the cows, the price of the grain fed, and the price received for the product. In discussing the feeding of dairy cows the age old ques - tion comes up in regard to which is of the greater importance, the feed - ing of the cows or the breeding. Both factors are of equal importance, and success is impossible unless you have good cows well fed. I have seen so many cases of good cows poorly fed and good cows made ordin - ary cows by poor feeding that I have concluded that no matter which is of the greatest importance the fact remains that the feeder had the greatest responsibility because he can by good feeding and care find out whether his cows are good or poor and then use his judgment in keeping them. If the feeder does his part there is no difficulty in placing the re - sponsibility. I have often said that the production of our Kansas cows could be doubled by better feeding methods. This is borne out by a com - parison of the production of the so-called average Kansas cow which is 125 pounds of butter fat with the average of Kansas cows in cow testing associations are just ordinary cows that have been given a chance. I recall a story I heard some years ago about a dairy farmer after years of experience decided that cows were divided into three kinds; cows that ate a large amount of feed and produced a large amount of milk, cows that ate a large amount of feed and produced a large amount of beef, and cows that ate a large amount of feed and Lord only knows . what they do with it. This condition seems to be true in some herds but by means of scales and milk sheets this condition can be remedied. A man who is dairy minded and stays with the game can build up a high pro - ducing herd of cows. Being a dairy minded man means much and in fact I believe success depends upon this fact. Many of our feeders of dairy cattle are too stingy to get the best re - turns from their cows. The feeding of a cow can be likened to any retail business. As the column of business increases the overhead expenses are reduced and the goods can be sold at a lower price. This is true with a cow. The larger the amount of milk she produces the less the cost of feed per hundred pounds or the cost of a pound of butter fat. If, then, by reducing the amount of feed we restrict production we are going to increase the feed cost per unit of this product. To secure In - creased profits for any commodity we have two methods we can follow: 1. Increase the selling price. 2. Lower the cost of production. The first factor is not always within the power of the producer whereas the producer has control over the second factor. That this ap - plies to the production of dairy cows is shown in the following table: </seg>

Any desire to increase the efficiency of a herd of cows must be follow - ed by the use of milk scales and the milk sheet, if they are not already in use. In our state we furnish milk sheets free of charge to dairymen who will use them, and in most cases where the milk sheet is put into use the report will come back that they not only increased the amount of milk, but feed was also saved. This is logical as it means that the grain was fed where it was needed. It is not impossible to feed in proportion to production without weighing the milk. Many could perhaps do it by using some other method of estimating the production, but after all the time used would be the same and the results less accurate. The use of milk sheets in our herd is valuable for the following reasons: 1. As a feeding guide. 2. Stimulates interest among milkers. 3. Detects difference in cows. 4. Check on milkers. 5. Indicates sick cows 6. Complete record of production for each cow. !305 1310 i I 150 200 1748 I 250 E385 300 .635 350 652 400 332 I 450 l.*±*± *.o&lt;± .44 L44 1.44 1.44 1.44 1.44 1.44 1.44 t I I $.40 $.46 $.52 $.58 $.64 $.70 $.76 $.52 I I I $ 26 $ 42 $ 58 $ 74 $ 90 $106 $122 $ 57 </seg>
            <seg id="p412">414 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The time element is one of the most common objections to the weigh - ing of milk,. This, however, is not warranted. It takes about six min - utes per day for each ten cows, and I know of no operation on the farm that will pay such big returns for the time spent. At the end of the month it will take six or seven minutes per cow to add up the total pro - duction and you can use the sheet as a permanent record. If you can take two or three day composite samples of the milk during the month and have it tested for butterfat this will also be valuable, but do not give up the keeping of records because you cannot test for butterfat. While the per cent of fat in the milk is valuable, it is quite constant and the amount of milk varies widely. A cow testing association with a good tester in charge is the greatest help toward profitable production. You can measure the degree of dairy efficiency of any county or any state by the number of cow testing associations in operation. In Denmark twenty-five per cent of all cows are in cow testing assoc - iations. In Australia fourteen per cent, in Wisconsin three and one-half per cent and in the United States less than one per cent. Our systems of advanced registry have been developed to considerable extent but they are used for obtaining maximum production rather than economical pro - duction, and from a business standpoint the average breeder at the pres - ent time can not justify the cost of advanced registry work unless he conducts these tests in keeping with economic herd practices. The cow testing association record gives a more valuable record to use in estab - lishing economical production and as a basis for future breeding opera - tions than does the advanced registry test made under high pressuite methods. We should give more attention to economical production and to herd averages made under practical dairy conditions. With the milk sheet as a guide the grain ration can be fed in propor - tion to the milk produced. The general plan which has worked out well in practice is to feed the cows all the silage and the legume hay they will eat in addition to the grain. Where silage and legume hay is fed, they will generally eat three pounds of silage and one pound of hay per hun - dred pounds of live weight. This amount of roughage will more than maintain their body weight; in fact for cows giving less than a gallon and a half or milk or one-half pound of fat daily the silage and legume hay will be sufficient. As a grain ration any of the following will do: </seg>

In faet we have also got good results in using ground cane seed with bran and linseed oil meal in feeding dairy cows. Where corn and cob meal is used 500 pounds of the meal should be used instead of 400 pounds of ground corn. The same would apply to the use of ground kafir heads. In the absence of silage when feeding alfalfa hay some stover can be substituted. Alfalfa hay and corn chop can be used but they are not as satisfactory as when silage is used. A ration sufficient for a 1000 pound cow producing 25 pounds of 4 per cent milk can be made by feed - ing 18 pounds of alfalfa hay and 8 pounds of corn and cob meal or some similar carbohydrate grain. For cows testing under 4 t&gt;er cent the grain mixtures can be fed in the proportion of 1 pound of the grain to each 4 pounds of milk daily. For cows testing about 4 per cent they should be fed in the proportion of 1 pound of grain to each 3 pounds of milk. This will supply the proper amount of nutrient in the right propor - tion" to produce milk. With bran at $1.25 or higher I have suggested that, where alfalfa was fed abundantly, the bran be eliminated from the grain ration for cows in moderate production. As a sounce of protein with bran at $1.25 per hundred we could afford to pay $4.30 cwt., for cottonseed meal or $1.20 for alfalfa. Where alfalfa or any legume hay is available the feeding problem is simplified. In the sections of the state where a legume hay is not available some protein supplement must be supplied. This fact will, I believe, limit dairying to a great extent to the sections of the state where legume hays can be produced. </seg>

Without Silage With Silage Sorghum fodder 15 pound Corn, cane or kafir silage 30 pounds I mentioned above that corn, cane or kafir silage could be used. In more than half of the counties in Kansas cane or kafir is a more cer - ;ain crop for the silo than is corn. We are suggesting to our farmers that they raise the crop that will give them the greatest yield with the most certainty. We have found that pound for pound corn silage is better than cane or kafir for dairy cows but when you figure the milk or beef that can be produced per acre it will generally be in favor of cane silage with kafir and corn following. In some sections of Nebraska the use of the grain sorghums is quite well established and you might be interested in some results we have obtained in the use of cane ( sorgo) and kafir grain for dairy cows. There has been a very general idea that cane hay and cane seed (sorgo) were not good for cows in milk. In feeding trials covering three years wA,have found very little differenfce in production when ground Kansas orange cane seed was substituted for corn chop in a ration made up of 400 pounds of corn chop, 200 pounds of wheat bran and 100 pounds of linseed oil meal.

The grain fed per hundred pounds of milk, however, was nearly the same, the amount being 33 pounds for the corn ration and 32 pounds for the sorgo seed ration. While on the different grain rations there was a dif - ference in the average live weight of only nine pounds or less than 1 per cent. The milk produced while on sorgo seed was 20.4 pounds or 4 pe* 1 cent less than on the corn ration. The total butterfat production was greater when on the sorgo seed ration than when on corn, a difference of 8.77 pounds or 4.7 per cent. We have also got very favorable results in feeding ground kafir to dairy cows. This work is still in progress but the following is a sum - mary of two feeding trials: Gxound Kafir Seed for Dairy Cows Summary of Two Year's Feeding Trials % Total feed consumed Total production Ration lAv.livej Grain lAlfalfal Silage j Milk Fat I Av. per Wt.

The same feeds were used as in the trial with sorgo. We are hearing quite a bit nowadays about minerals for dairy cows and the last few years have brought forth many important findings with reference to the feeding of animals. We know for example that a high producing cow may give off in ner milk several times as much minerals as she is getting in her feed. This means that she has to draw on some source other than her feed to make up her requirements. The supply comes from her skeleton and of course is not inexhaustible. This means that eventually her production is reduced to an amount that nan be sup - ported by her feed. Feeders of dairy cattle are now interested in a feed that will furnish in an available form the mineral element for milk pro - duction.

            <seg id="p416">418 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE This has caused many mixtures to be offered for sale with more or ess exaggerated claims for them. It is quite generally believed that when alfalfa hay is fed in abundance along with a grain mixture, addi - onal minerals are not necessary to profitable production and regular reproduction. Where alfalfa hay or other legume hays are not available . might be advisable to feed 3 or 4 pounds of pure ground limestone, .earned bone meal, wood ashes or air slaked lime to each 100 pounds of le grain mixture. Even in cases when alfalfa is scarce and high in &gt;rice I believe it wise to feed dairy cattle a few pounds each day if for o other reason than as a source of minerals. As I have said above, with our present knowledge of minerals for milk production I believe the alfalfa hay provides sufficient assurance for taking care of the mineral needs for our dairy cows. We know, too, that the quality of the alfalfa has a bearing on this point as the Wisconsin Station has found that al - falfa cured in the direct sunlight caused less calcium to be retained in the animal's body than did alfalfa from the same field cured under hay Iln Nebraska we are more fortunate than we are in Kansas in that i have some blue grass pasture. In Kansas our native pasture crops rather uncertain but we have got very good results from the use to«f Ian and sweet clover as pasture crops for dairy cows, and I see no rea - why they could not be used under Nebraska conditions. Sudan grass he best annual pasture crop we have. In a pasture experiment using Ian grass we were able to keep six big Holstein cows on 5.4 acres for ee months. In addition to this 7.3 tons cf field cured hay were har - ted. On the acre basis one acre was able to support one cow for 100 s. With grain at $35 per ton and butter fat at 40 cents per pound h acre returned $31 worth of butterfat above the cost of grain. In a dlar experiment with sweet clover pasture 3.8 acres supported four Istein cows for a period of 154 days. One acre kept a cow for 5.3 nths. The sweet clover pastures returned $40 per acre in butterfat »ve the cost of feed. kThe pasture crops mentioned above are being widely used in Kansas to their ability to produce well in a dry climate and with heavy pas - ing. Two factors in management that have an important bearing upon the success of good feeding methods are: 1. Time of calving. 2. Dry period previous to calving. The time of the year that a cow freshens has an important bearing upon the production of the cow and also the profit of the cow. The U. S. </seg>
            <seg id="p417">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 419 D. A. in summarizing 11,120 yearly records of cow testing on cows find the records to be influenced by the season of freshening as follows: It will be noted that there is a difference of 25 pounds of butterfat in favor of the cows freshening in the autumn and winter months over the spring and summer calving. The difference in the butterfat produc - tion! is not the only advantage of Fall calving. Even if the cow calfing in the Fall did not produce a single pound more butterfat than the cow calving in the Spring the Fall calving cow would be from $8 to $12 the more profitable cow for the reason that dairy products are higher in the fall than in the spring. A fall calving cow produces more milk and fat for the reason that she is fed during the fall and winter on dry feeds and as her production declines she can be turned on to pasture in the spring and her production is kept up due to the stimulating effect of the grass and she can be dry during the period of dry pasture, hot weather and flies. A cow calving in the Spring generally is required to give her maximum on pasture with flies, hot weather and scant pasture. Even with good pasture a cow has difficulty in supporting very high produc - tion because she can not eat enough pasture grass to supply nutrients for large production. Too many of our cows are underfed when on pas - ture. The Spring freshening cow must be milked during the summer time when the farmer has his busiest season and will be dry during the winter when the farmer has his slack time. The dairy farmer likes to have his calf come in the Fall so that it can be fed by hand during the winter and when pasture comes can be turned out with but little additional attention. A Spring calf fed skim - med milk while on grass frequently gives trouble. From the standpoint of the cow and her production and the profit from this production, from the standpoint of the calf, from the stand - point of the farmer and his convenience it pays to have the cows freshen in the Fall of the year. In addition to the above facts winter dairying will mean the utiliza - tion of waste feed on some farms and on a great many farms it will turn waste labor into cream checks. As mentioned above a second factor of great importance in profitable production of dairy cows is to give the cow a rest of from six weeks to two months before freshening and to feed her during this time so that Calving 1 rime Milk Fat Spring 5,775 5,863 6,591 6,338 236 Summer 234 267 Autumn Winter 254 </seg>

A cow given a rest before freshening and lowed to calve in good condition will produce 20 pounds to 30 pounds more butterfat in the year than a cow milked up to calving time. I have ever yet seen a cow that could not be dried up but I have seen some ows that persisted in giving milk as- long as they received a good ra - on. By reducing the feed and skipping milkings a cow can be dried up safely. After milk secretion has stopped the feeding can start again, "he amount of feed given the cow will depend on her condition and the ength of time till freshening. Practically the same ration can be used or feeding the cow when dry as for milk production. Generally 4 to 6 ounds of grain mixture such as those mentioned above in addition to al - alfa hay and silage will put a cow in good condition in two months. A ew days before freshening the grain can be replaced with bran or bran mash until three or four days after freshening. Grain feeding can start jout the fourth or fifth day after calving if the cow and her udder are n good condition Three or four pounds of grain per day is enough to art with, increasing the grain by hi pound per day until she is on all feed about the third week after freshening. During this time the ow should have what silage and hay she will eat. In case the cow's ud - er is hard and inflamed it may take her longer to get to her maximum ow and the grain fed should not be increased too rapidly until the ud - er is normal. In case the cow goes off feed the grain should be re - uced and again increased as the cow's appetite recovers. To reduce the chances of milk fever do not milk the cow out dry until about the fourth or fifth day. Do not be afraid if the cow's udder has becomes large. Rubbing with the hands and bathing with warm water and rubbing dry will keep down the hardness. Rarely ever is it advis - able to milk out a cow before freshening. If the cow comes through freshening all right she will generally hit her high production from three to four weeks after calving and she should not be on full feed until this Time does not permit the discussion of fitting cows for advanced Reg - stry tests. This is a subject in itself and every feeder has his own pet schemes of putting the cows in condition and getting the maximum pro - uction from them. I'll say, however, that no one man has a corner on be feeding system for making good records. Some men have had more pportunities in the way of feeds and cows but success counts essentially n knowing your cow and using good judgment in handling her. Many ten hesitate to put cows on test on account of their lack of experience, "he way to get experience in testing cows for the advanced Registry is o put some cows on test. You will learn more about feeding by test - ng cows than, in any other way. </seg>
            <seg id="p419">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 421 To be successful in handling cattle one must be able to know the conditions under which cattle produce well and then be willing to do the things necessary to bring about these conditions and at the same time be mindful of the limits of economical production.

AGRI - CULTURAL CAMPUS, LINCOLN, NEBRASKA BY PRESIDENT CARL R. GRAY: This is the first Annual meet - ing of the Nebraska Dairy Development Society. The rules and by - laws were adopted rather hastily and some inequalities perhaps thrust in, in the matter of election. The stipulation and the by-laws that the ballots shall be enclosed in a blank envelope and endorsed has seem - ingly been misunderstood by a number of members. No doubt many of those on hand are some illegal ballots cast by members of this society who have not carried out the provisions of the by-laws by en - closing the ballots in an envelope and having the envelope addressed by the name of the voter. This annual meeting of course has a right to amend the by-laws or waive the conditions of the by-laws. What is your pleasure with respect to the 33 ballots. The number is so large I am rather embarrassed that I don't want to see any one deprived of their right to vote. BY MR. A. L. HAECKER: I move that the ballots be allowed, Seconded. Motion seconded, put to vote. Motion carried. BY THE PRESIDENT: Now we want to have the election moved incidentally with our program. I will now suggest that two tellers would be enough. We will leave the ballot box open so the ballots can be deposited for say the next fifteen minutes then we will turn it over to the tellers to get busy. There are 76 nominees and 25 to be elected.

GRAY: I want to introduce what I have to say &gt;y first digressing just a moment to say the Executive Committee have layed this part splendid. A number had changed their minds. At rst they thought it was highly essential that the budget should be ntirely provided for so that it would protect all the assured mainten - ance of a field man and not only the payment to them of salaries onnected with the effort we would expect from men of their experience &gt;ut the maintenance being highly essential for the upkeep of an office and circulation of statistics. It did not seem possible to raise this amount of money at this time so we were confronted with a decision &gt;etween continuing the campaign to raise the budget and cutting off the establishment of any activities or going in with a crippled wing, as it *rere and conducting such activities as the limited budget would permit. ! There was a great deal of dissatisfaction through cause of no ivities being carried on. Inquiries were being made and there was ot to be done. Some of those came from men who never considered and from some people who seemingly had no intention of supporting ? society and had not supported it in any way. But there was an erest over the State and a demand something should be done and ire was a surprising share of interest from so many quarters that the ecutive Committee finally decided reluctantly that we would com - mce activities and depend on the future trusting that enough interest uld be shown by the work throughout the State that we would get ( proper support. I haven't had the hardihood to ask the people of Omaha for larger support. I believe that it would be forthcoming if the proper interest was shown out through the State at the same time. I don't believe there would be any trouble in netting dollar for dollar notwithstanding the discrepancy now existing in the amount subscribed throughout the State. PRESIDENT'S ANNUAL REPORT TO THE NEBRASKA DAIRY DE - VELOPMENT SOCIETY, LINCOLN, NEBRASKA, JANUARY, 1925 INTRODUCTION Resolution adopted at the first meeting of the Nebraska Dairy De - velopment Society, February 20, 1924: "The Nebraska Dairy Development Society is \o be devoted to the best interests of the farmer in this State and to encour- </seg>
            <seg id="p423">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 425 aging and aiding him in any present dairy activities and to the development of the business as a whole along constructive and practical lines, having in mind continually that to be successful it must be compensatory." When the Nebraska Dairy Development Society was first conceiv - ed, and throughout the initial stages of its organization, it was the con - viction of every one, that to be effective to the extent anticipated by its founders, the Society should be financed for a period of five years, and that it should have available over this period, and equally divided, an aggregate of $100,000, or $20,000 per annum; that this amount would permit the maintenance of a proper office, the collection and distribu - tion of the essential statistics affecting the dairy industry, not only in Nebraska but from all other available sources throughout the nation. It was expected on account of the enthusiasm shown that there would be state-wide response to a movement so admittedly in its in - terest. Instead of $100,000 the subscriptions to date aggregate $53, - 950.00 of which $43,500.00 was subscribed by Omaha commercial inter - ests and business and professional men, and only $10,450 by the bal - ance of the State. ■The Executive Committee decided at its meeting in Omaha on May 26, 1924, to begin activities notwithstanding the disappointing nature of the budget, and Mr. O. H. Liebers was elected manager, and Mr. M. N. Lawritson, Assistant Manager. Mr. Liebers began service June 12, 192^, and Mr. Lawritson, on account of engagements with the Extension Ser - vice of the College of Agriculture, began service September 1st, 1924. Due to limited finances the Society was compelled to forego the es - tablishment of such an office as had been contemplated and the pro - vision of the highly essential statistics of the dairy industry. The manager will report in some detail as to the operations of the Society in the field. Naturally, on account of the limited time, many re - quests for assistance from different parts of the state could not be reached, but from one to three definite requests for service have been received and compiled within 83 counties in the state, as will be shown by a chart of the State submitted with this report. NEBRASKA DAIRY SPECIAL TO WISCONSIN AND THE NATION - AL DAIRY SHOW During the last three days in September and the first three days in October the Society sponsored and conducted a tour of 100 Nebraska dairymen from 38 counties in the state through three of the best dairy counties in Wisconsin, and the National Dairy Show. The tour was emin - ently successful judging from the interest shown by the delegation it - self and the good which has been accomplished, judging from the re- </seg>

BETTER DAIRY SIRE SPECIAL tThe Society cooperated fully in the Better Dairy Sire Special op - ted over the Burlington Railroad in Nebraska; helped select 21 of the pure bred bulls which were distributed; helped select 18 of the 31 men receive the pure bred bulls and to act as demonstrators of the value pure bred stock in their respective communities; assisted 14 local imunities in arranging their program for the Better Sire Special. ACTIVITIES OF THE FIELD FORCE In addition the Field Force has: (1) Addressed 60 meetings with an attendance of 82,991. (2) Visited 144 breeders on their farms. (3) Received 1,050 letters and written 7,100. (4) Selected 160 cows and 12 pure bred dairy sires for 31 indi vidual farmers. (5) Used every means to discourage the importation of inferior dairy cattle into the state. (6) Assisted eight local breeders in disposing of their surplus cattle. b(7) Helped organize one calf club at Holdrege, Nebr., with 12 mem - and selected the calves. Have several other Calf Clubs in the ;ss of organization. (8) Cooperated with the Extension Department of the College of Agriculture in organizing the Lancaster-Seward County Cow Testing Association, and in reorganizing the Tri-County Cow Testing Association at Fremont. (9) Started a number of farmers in keeping an individual record of their cows. (10) Arranged for 50 two-day feeding schools in that many com - munities in the State, to be held during the first three months in the year. I believe before leaving, that it should be remembered that Mr. Liebers did not commence work until practically in July and Mr. Lawritgon in September. </seg>
            <seg id="p425">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 427 COW TESTING ASSOCIATIONS Among the most important of the opportunities for the Society i» the elimination of inferior animals by Cow Testing Associations. It is the opinion of our experts that one-third of the milch cows in Nebraska are unremunerative, that one-third break even, and that one-third are profitable. The United States Department of Agriculture found, from records on 18,000 cows, that the profit is in direct relation to the production: that, when the production is doubled, the profit is increased three times, and, when the production is increased three times, the profit is increas - ed seven times. The average production per cow in cow testing associa - tions in the United States is 6,200 pounds of milk, and 248 pounds of fat. Nebraska ranks 34th in the average production per cow. In these circumstances the value of current records to determine the unprofitable animal is of prime importance. At the present time there are the fol - lowing Cow Testing Associations: Tri-County at Fremont. Douglas County at Omaha. Lancaster and Seward Counties, Lincoln and one being organized at Kearney. To secure the full value, a cow testing association should be a permanent institution. Seemingly the point is never reached where there is lack of opportunity for improvement in the herds, and consequently in the production per animal through these current comparisons and individual records. This results in better sires being used by members of the association, the calves raised from the best cows, use of better equipment, and greater discrimination in feeding. Competent authori - ties have stated that with the dairy industry properly handled, there should never be an over production, simply because such proper handling would inevitably carry with it the elimination of those animals which serve only to enhance the aggregate production, without return, and their withdrawal from the business, which should be automatic, would preserve the proper balance. IMPROVEMENT OF HERDS BY BETTER SIRES; BULL ASSOCIATIONS There should be four blocks or groups to make a standard Bull Ring, or Association, one bull for each block, which would serve from 20 to 40 cows. A complete Association of 4 blocks would take care of 80 to 160 cows. </seg>
            <seg id="p426">428 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Generally, a production record standard is used in selecting the bull, and, ordinarily, one is wanted out of a dam that has not less than 600 tounds a year butter production record. This makes it possible for a community to get the service of an unusually well bred sire at a very ominal cost. These bulls are transferred at the end of two years from one block to another within the Association, so as to prevent their use on offspring, and this insures eight years of beneficial use, which is the average effective life of the animal. The following resume is given of the Bull Associations One each in Saunders and Hamilton counties, with four blocks respectively, have been in operation two years and are working out very satisfactorily. One each in Buffalo and Dawson Counties were organized about a E,r ago with only two blocks completed. The plan now is to add the er two blocks and to make each a full four block association. The Thayer County Bull Association was organized last spring with three blocks completed. The Boys' and Girls' Club Bull Association, consisting of the Calf Club members at Holdrege, Minden and Hastings, was organized during the Better Sires Special campaign last fall, with three splendid bulls placed in those communities, completing the Association, as they only intend to use three blocks. There are three Associations in the process of organization which it is hoped will be completed by early spring. CHEESE FACTORIES There are four cheese factories in the state at the present time, located at: 2 at Lincoln and one each at Obert and Scottsbluff. Three more are in contemplation. GENERAL The Society has endeavored to so conduct its activities as to be of a practical, and not a theoretical benefit to the dairy industry in Nebras - ka. Extreme care has been exercised in encouraging an increase in the dairy herd, and this has not been done at all unless in the opinion of our experienced field men the individual involved had proper equip - ment and ability to make a success of his enterprise. We have rather directed our attention to the improvement of methods and the detec - tion and correction of improper practices and in encouragment to im - prove the herds and increase the production per animal through the </seg>
            <seg id="p427">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 429 elimination of the inferior producer, and to the improvement of the herd through breeding to pure-bred sires. It is a matter of deep regret to the management of this Society that its limited budget will not permit the keeping of the essential statistics which are of tremendous importance. Jf the hoped for support can be secured and the proper office of record and statistics maintained as was originally contemplated, it will round out the activities of the Society and enable it to give a very much improved service. It can be fairly stated that progress in business has been attained because of the system of statistics which has been worked out through experience to fit each particular line of activity. Nowhere has this been so important and effective as in agriculture, where used. Analyz - ed and interpreted, these statistics will detect uneconomic practice and leaks, and measure progress. The very keeping of them stimulates and suggests improvements in the ordinary farm practice. Unfortunately, detailed statistics for the dairy industry are lacking. Too many state - ments depend entirely upon opinion, and not upon fact. Essential sta - tistics, currently secured and collated, distributed for purposes of com - parison and information among the dairymen in Nebraska, would un - questionably result in a vast improvement in the handling of their work. It can be fairly stated that approximately two thirds of the feed given to dairy cows in Nebraska is an economic waste. Certainly the detection of these sources of waste, and their correction, is of the highest importance. One of the drawbacks in conducting the work of the Society is the difficulty in securing attendance at meetings of the Trustees and of the Executive Committee. It calls for a great deal of sacrifice of time and, to those who have to travel, and expense for hotel and railway fare. Notwithstanding this, the assistance and cooperation of the Trustees and members of the Executive Committee has been a real inspiration. The College of Agriculture and the Extension Department have cooperated in a whole-hearted and effective way, and the thanks of the Society should by resolution be expressed for this invaluable assistance. Professor H. P. Davis, Secretary and Treasurer, Mr. O. H. Liebers, Manager and Mr. M. N. Lawritson, Assistant Manager have labored most zealously and effectively, and the President wishes to put on record his sincere appreciation of their work and effectiveness. It should be remembered that the amount collected there indicates one-fifth of a five year period. The entire year's expenses will be for - merly a period of approximately something like four and a half months. Of course there were certain organization expenses and expenses for a </seg>
            <seg id="p428">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 430 purpose that will not occur again. I think it is very evident to any - one that within the limits of the budget as provided we have quite a noticeable limitation upon the activities of the society. The Board of Trustees when elected will no doubt arrange for an audit of the account. We will now have the report from the manager, Mr. O. H. Liebers. BY MR. O. H. LIEBERS, Manager: The Nebraska Dairy De - velopment Society has been active seven months during which time it has become a factor in dairy development work in Nebraska. Some definite results have been obtained during this short period and a great deal of work has been started on which it will be impossible to show results for some time. At the outset the Nebraska Dairy De - velopment Society realized that to be a beneficial factor in the con - structive development of dairying in the state it was essential to have a carefully planned program extending over a period of five years which if carried to it's logical conclusion will be of lasting benefit to the State and cannot possibly injure any other line of agriculture. Your Board of Directors, Manager and Assistant Manager worked out the following program; In making up this program we took into consideration the needs of the Dairy Industry based on the information available. Program of Work 1. Obtain complete statistics of the Nebraska Dairy Industry. 2. Organize cow testing associations. 3. Encourage the use of more good sires. 4. Organize boys' and girls' calf clubs. 5. Assist in building strong statewide breed organizations, Marketing. 7. Annual Nebraska Excursion to Wisconsin and the National Dairy Show. 8. General Service. This program is of such nature that it will take several years to be able to show tangible results on many of the projects. At the present time we have a number of communities interested in cow test - ing, organization of bull associations and calf clubs and through our feeding and management schools are creating an interest in better practices which will all aid the industry but are of such a nature that at this time are unable to show concrete results. Results obtained during the first seven months showing progress of the work are as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p429">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 431 STATISTICS OF THE NEBRASKA DAIRY INDUSTRY Complete statistics properly analyzed and accurately interpreted show the trend of the industry and form a basis for action toward the proper development of the industry. At the present time very few sta - tistics of the dairy industry are available. Our President, Mr. Gray, has mentioned in his address the need for the statistics and also of the financial handicap we are laboring under on account of our limited budget. However we have started building up statistics that will aid the producer and particularly the breeder of pure bred dairy cattle. We are getting the names of all the breeders of pure bred dairy cattle in the State, and the number of cattle each breeder has. This will make it possible to utilize all our home grown cattle first before going out of the State to buy cattle to supply the demand. A number of instances have come to our attention where local breeders had difficulty in selling their surplus when hundreds of cattle were being shipped in from outside the State and often those shipped in were not as good. as those available at home. This information will also be of value to all of the breed organizations. It has already made it possible to assist some local breeders in disposing of their surplus and others in securing foundation stock to add to their herds. We are being called upon by a number of communities to assist in the organization of new manufacturing enterprises such as cheese fac - tories and creameries. We have given assistance on the basis of in - formation available but in many cases could have rendered more efficient service with the complete statistics available. COW TESTING ASSOCIATION WORK We have at a number of meetings discussed the need of more cow testing association work. When the Society became active there were only two cow testing associations in the State. Now there are three with the possibility of another one being completed in the near future. We have approximately 500,000 dairy cows in Nebraska. It is esti - mated that 1-3 or 170,000 of our cows produce only about 60 pounds of butter fat per year and are being kept at a loss. 1-3 produce approxi - mately 100 pounds of butter fat per year which pays for itheir feed and labor but leaves no profit for their owner, and the other 1-3 pro - duce about 150 pounds of butter fat per year and are making a profit for their owners. Government statistics show that the 24,000,000 dairy cows in the United States are classified in a similar proportion as to their production, namely, 1-3 or 8,000,000 being unprofitable. 1-3 breaking even and the other 1-3 being profitable. The feed and labor expended upon this large number of unprofitable cows represents an enormous waste. These "boarder" cows offer unfair competition to the good cows and to the careful dairymen. The product they pro- </seg>
            <seg id="p430">REPORT OF XfcBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 432 duce at a loss often creates a temporary surplus which depresses the price for the entire production. The present is a very opportune time for the fanner to test their cows and eliminate the boaider cows so as to be able to produce at a lower cost. If the farmer will constantly eliminate the unprofitable cows we never need to fear an overproduction of dairy products. To illustrate this point we And that in Nebraska's two largest whole milk markets, namely, Omaha and Lincoln, there is at the present time a surplus which naturally causes the price to go down. If all the dairy - men in these two districts would sell the unprofitable cows in their herds there would be a shortage inside of 24 hours and every dairy - man would not only be producing his milk at a lower cost from the remaining cows that are profitable but would also receive a higher price for his product. We have available the results for last year of only one cow test - ing association in Nebraska and which is located in Douglas Count} In this association 256 cows completed the year's work and out of this number 41 or 16 per cent were found unprofitable and were sold to the stock yards during the year. It should be taken into consideration that this association is our oldest dairy community in the State and had enrolled the herds of some of our very best dairymen who have been for years selecting and culling out their herds. Recognizing the great need for more cow testing associations in the state we have given a great deal of attention to this work. During the short time that we have been active we have in cooperation with the College Extension Department completed the organization of the Lancaster County Cow testing association with 475 cows enrolled. The reorganization of the Tri-County Association with 410 cows and have assisted extension agencies in getting individual farmers to keep records on 500 cows or a total of 1435 cows being now under test in addition to the Douglas County Association that has been in operation for several years with an enrollment of 495 cows. BETTER SIRES Of the 500,000 dairy cows in Nebraska only about 200,000 are of dairy breeding and 1.1 per cent are purebred. Only 9 per cent of our dairy sires are purebred. This means that we have only one pure - bred dairy sire for every 225 cows and only one purebred dairy sire for every 354 farms. A careful survey shows that the states and com - munities having the higher annual production per cow also have a cor - responding higher percentage of purebred cows and bulls. The dairy sire special operated by the Burlington Railroad during the month of October did a lasting service to the dairy industry in the </seg>
            <seg id="p431">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 433 state. We were identified with this movement, your manager devoting six weeks and your Assistant Manager four weeks to this campaign. We helped select 21 of the 31 purebred bulls that were necessary to make the campaign a success. We helped select 18 of the 31 men to receive the purebred bulls and who acted as demonstrators in their community. Assisted 14 local communities in arranging their program for the sire special day. Gave demonstrations at 26 of the 31 com - munities visited. The sire special stopped one half day in 31 com - munities. At each stop a purebred sire was traded for a scrub. A demonstration was given on a good dairy cow and a comparison made between the purebred sire given and the scrub sire received. Following the demonstration the crowds were given an opportunity to pass through the exhibit cars which the train carried. By actual count 71,000 people passed through the exhibit cars and it is estimated that over 100,000 people saw the demonstrations. We believe that the best way to improve our dairy cattle is by the use of better sires, weeding out the poor cows and raising the calves from the good cows. We are following up the work of the sire special by encouraging the organization of bull associations which our presi - dent, Mr. Gray, has discussed in his address. We now have several of them in the process of organization. CALF CLUB WORK The Society is encouraging boys' and girls' dairy calf club work at every opportunity realizing that it is a fundamental factor in the per - manent development of the dairy industry. We cooperated with the County Agent in Phelps County in organizing the Holdrege Calf Club. The local committee delegated us to select and purchase the calves for this club. This club held a demonstration on the day that the dairy sires special was in Holdrege. All the calves were exhibited and practically all gave evidence of excellent care and their owners demonstrated considerable training in the handling of the calves. Dur - ing the two hours of the judging and demonstration of those calves a crowd estimated at 1500 people gave the closest attention. BREED ORGANIZATIONS We believe that strong state-wide breed organizations can be of great assistance in building up the dairy industry by supplying the breeders, especially the beginners, with the right information and there - by help them avoid many difficulties. We cannot represent any particu - lar breed but stand willing to be of assistance to all the breed organiza - tions to the extent of our ability. </seg>

In this connection we recognize that a quality product and stimulation of consumption are essential for a better (NEBRASKA DAIRY SPECIAL TO WISCONSIN AND THE NATIONAL DAIRY SHOW During the last three days in September and the first three days in October we conducted a tour of 100 Nebraska dairymen from 38 counties in the state through three of the best dairy counties in Wis - consin and then spent two days at the National Dairy Show at Mil - waukee. The trip was made by special pullman train. The tours of one day each in the three Wisconsin counties namely, Waukesha^Jeffer - son annd Outagami had been carefully planned before hand. We selected for our visit a number of typical dairy farms that demonstrated the results of the best dairy practices such as cow testing work, the use of purebred sires, proper feeding and management of the cows and the possibility of building up the fertility of the soil by dairying. We left Omaha September 27th, over the Burlington, arriving at Waukesha, Wisconsin at noon the 28th. In this county we were the guests of the Waukesha County Breeders Association who took us on a tour through the county led by the County Agent who gave a thorough explanation at each farm stop of the particular lessons that the farm demonstrated. That evening our special train moved us from Waukesha to Fort Atkinson in Jefferson County. The next morning at 7:45 we were met by a large delegation of Jefferson county breeders who after taking us through the Hoards Dairy plant took us on a tour through Jefferson county where we observed a number of typical dairy farms. The point of unusual interest on this day was Ex-Governor Hoard's dairy farm where Mr. A. J. Glover, Editor of Hoard's Dairyman, gave us a splendid talk of what had been accomplished on that farm in the last 86 years, also what dairying had accomplished in the community. Mr. Glover pointed out fields that 35 years ago after continuous cropping would only produce from five to seven bushels of grain per acre and that now after being built up by dairy farming produce 35 bushels per acre. That evening our special train moved us to Appleton, Wisconsin, located' in the heart of the Fox River Valley. The next morning the members of the Greenville Grange, a local farmers organization that has been in active operation 51 years, met us at Appleton and after taking us on a sight seeing tour up the Fox River Valley took us to a </seg>
            <seg id="p433">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 435 number of typical dairy farms in that community and to a cooperative farmers cheese factory. At noon we were royally entertained at the Grange Hall by the local Grangers and their wives. That evening we were moved to the fair grounds near Milwaukee, where our delegation spent the next two days visiting the National Dairy Show. We have heard from about one-half of the people that made this tour and they are all unanimous in expressing appreciation for the op - portunity in being able to make this trip and urging us to make it an annual event. Five men who were on this trip have since then re - ported buying a good purebred sire. Two men have reported that they are weighing the milk of each of their cows and are feeding them ac - cording to production. Two County Agents have reported to us that the tour did the mem - bers of the delegation from their community a great deal of good in that they were now using many of the better dairy practices observed on this trip. The Dairy Development Society hopes to devote more time in organizing the next excursion so that at least 200 can be taken and every county in the State represented in the delegation. GENERAL SERVICE 1. Addressed 60 meetings with an attendance of 82,991. 2. Visited 144 breeders on their farms. 3. Received 1050 letters. 4. Have written 7100 letters. 5. Have received definite requests for service from 82 counties in the state. 6. Selected 160 cows and 12 purebred dairy sires for 31 farmers. Have used every means to discourage the importation of inferior dairy cattle into the state. 7 Have assisted 8 local breeders in disposing of their surplus cattle. 8. Helped organize one calf club at Holdrege, Nebraska with 12 members. Many extravagant and misleading statements have been made re - garding the policy of the Nebraska Dairy Development Society relative to the expansion of the dairy industry. We wish to take this opportunity in stating our position. The Nebraska Dairy Development Society maintains that five or six good milk cows are an asset on every farm. By good cows we mean </seg>
            <seg id="p434">436 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE cows producing 300 pounds or more of butter per year. Five or six rd cows on every farm return a cash income every week in the year pay the current expenses so that the receipts from live stock sales and cash crops can be used for equipment, improvements and invest - ments. Those who like dairying will naturally increase their herds if they find it profitable. We are not urging everyone to go into specialized dairying. Many are not dairy minded nor equipped to make a success of dairying and we feel it would react unfavorably to the individual and to the industry in general to urge these farmers into specialized dairying. We have in a few cases even advised farmers into specialized dairying. We have in a few cases even advised farmers against going into the dairy busi - ness on a large scale, because they were not equipped nor had the tend - ency to make good dairymen. We also discourage the practice of crossing good beef cattle with airy sires. Better results can be obtained by purchasing a few good airy cows and continuing to raise beef calves from their beef bred cows, t present we have only four cows per farm in Nebraska and 1-3 of lese are unprofitable producers or boarders so there is a need for more ood cows. We feel that the best and cheapest way to improve our airy cattle is by weeding out the culls, using better sires and raising calves from the good cows but this takes time. Good cows can be ob - tained in limited numbers from the older dairy states by careful selec - on, but this is getting more difficult each year. Our state will be &gt;enefitted by the importation of good cows to replace the boarder cows and build up our cow population to at least five high producing cows on very farm. We are exerting every means to discourage the importation of poor dairy cows which merely offer an opportunity for individual speculation. We wish to caution against the buying of cows that are shipped in for re-sale that have not been carefully selected as profitable producers by competent and reliable parties from clean dairy herds. During the past year there have been many cattle sold in Nebraska for dairy purposes that were picked up at stock yards for two cents per pound. Several thousand head of such cows costing from $15 to $50 per head on southern markets were sold in Nebraska for as high as $100 per head and in a few cases, even higher. Farmers buying such cows are doomed to disappointment. This is not only a financial loss to the in - dividual purchaser, but reacts adversely to the proper development of the dairy industry in the state. kTo impress you with the seriousness of the situation we wish to te from the State Veterinarian's records on importation of dairy ;le into Nebraska during 1924. These statistics were checked both </seg>

We ask the cooperation of the various breed organizations in the state to help improve this condition. The Nebraska Dairy Development Society has conducted an active campaign against the importation of inferior dairy cattle into Nebraska. We have obtained reliable information and statistics and have presented the situation to the various breed associations for cooperative action. Our experience has been that legislation has not been effective in stop - ping this practice due to lack of enforcement. Resolutions and recom - mendations do little good. The solution lies with the farmers them - selves in recognizing that there is a difference in cows. BY MR. GRAY: Mr. Liebers has covered the matter so thoroughly that Mr. Lawritson, Assistant Manager need not make a report.

Bur - lingham, a former dairy extension speaker and worker in Nebraska. BY MR. BURLINGHAM: Gentlemen — I want to confess to you that I approach this discussion with considerable modesty. Nebraska has shown, particularly during the last few months, a very rapidly growing appreciation of dairying and any thought that I may bring to you will probably be repetition. You have given evidence of abundant talent and determination for carrying through the policies you have laid down. I have nowhere else seen as definite, as practicable or as thorough a plan for dairy extension set forth as I have heard this morning in the reports of your President and your Managers. I congratulate you heartily upon getting down to sound bedrock in the things you are pro - posing to do. Your recent dairy train was most successful. I have read of its results in the farm press from all sections of the country. In Hoard's Dairyman I have seen the poetical slogan which has been used on this train as follows: "Old Scrub Sire your pedigree is lacking, Old Scrub Sire there is nothing left for you. Old Scrub Sire you certainly have no backing We'll lead you to the stock yards where you will get your due." I understand that these lines were used in the last rites of some thirty-one scrubs. I sincerely trust the precedent set will lead to the early demise of many more and I would very much like to be on hand when the last thirty-one pass out of Nebraska. This industry of dairying to which Nebraska is now turning so strongly is not a new one. The cow which you are selling is the re - sult of many generations of constructive breeding work. The original dairy animal was very different from the one we have now. She produc - ed so little milk that her young were forced to take care of themselves at a very early time. She was misshapen, small, unproductive and al - together unqualified to meet the very strenuous requirements laid down oy all successful dairy farmers. From the original wild cattle of Europe five main dairy breeds have been developed. The oldest of these is the Brown-Swiss used for centuries in Switzerland, more or less as a triple purpose breed, the milk and butterfat being very important, the meat being the chief beef of the country and also the cattle were used as draft animals. The next oldest breed is the Holstein-Friesian with which all Nebraska dairymen are very familiar. The Channel Island breeds, the Jersey and Guernsey, were developed on the Islands of these names between England and France and have been kept pure for approxi - mately one hundred and fifty years. The youngest of the breeds is the </seg>
            <seg id="p437">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 439 Ayrshire which is fostered in this country by The Ayrshire Breeders' Association. In the beginning there was no need of herd books, the permanent records of breeding. These cattle were developed by communities in the several countries in which they originated. Families were acquaint - ed with the progress made in other herds and each community to a great degree availed itself of the best breeding animals which could be found. It was not until these cattle were exported to countries which required definite records of breeding that herd books were established. In the Ayshire breed the establishment of the herd book is so recent an event that the father of one of the present prominent breeders in this country made the first selections in Scotland to determine which animals were available for recording in the first herd book of the breed. The pure bred dairy cattle which you are selling in Nebraska there - fore represent the work of many generations of live stock men. While much further improvement will likely be brought about your Society has a right to feel that it is selling a very highly improved product in Nebr - aska, one which has been developed at great sacrifice and at great time and expense, which has definitely and finally proved itself a profitable investment wherever intensive agriculture becomes necessary. You have possibly wondered at the strict requirements Mr. Liebers lays down when he selects cattle in this State. To men engaged in other businesses it is not apparent why he demands a long level rump on the animals which he purchases or a deep heart girth and a straight strong back. These points and many others have been very thoroughly studied and correlated with the highest productive capacity. A long level rump usually goes with a long udder attached far in front and be - hind and level on the sole. A large heart girth is needed if ttie very strenuous work of the dairy cow is to be continued year after year. Such points as straightness in top lines are indicative of general strength throughout. In founding herds in this State you do well to insist that only first class cattle come in and the many points on the score cards adopted by the various record associations are possibly your best guides in determining the sort of individuals which shall be used as foundation animals here. It is not easy to maintain the high level of productiveness of the modern dairy cow. Men beginning with dairy herds in the State now must be cautioned that they are buying highly developed animals and that it will require their very best attention and effort to maintain the average quality of their herds. There is a constant pull back toward the original type of dairy cow. The very heavy milk flow made by our best animals is very unnatural to them. This special quality has been developed to so great an extent that men must be highly expert to con - tinue to plan matings which will enable them to keep up the average productive qualities of their cattle. </seg>
            <seg id="p438">440 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE So highly developed have the better animals in the several breeds become that it is conceivable that a single animal of the right sort brought into this State and given the largest possible opportunity may more than pay back all of the expense incurred by this Society. I have known of many individual animals which have made more dollars in in - creased profits through their production and the production of their descendants than will be paid out by this Society in many years of work. A good bull sold a Nebraska farmer will increase the production of his herd even twenty-five pounds of butterfat per cow per year may return directly through his get hundreds of dollars in profit above that which would be netted by the get of another bull. If this high level of pro - duction can be maintained through several generations of the descedants of such an animal you will readily see that the bull's value runs into thousands. Many beginners with dairy cattle will question the wisdom of pur - chasing specially bred dairy animals. There are men in Nebraska who are not qualified to become good dairymen. There are sections in the State where dairying is not suited to making the largest returns. But wherever a man has equipment for dairying and determines to milk cows for a living he needs the very best which can be secured. Such a man should not ask why pure breds are recommended to him. He ought to be able to see in pure breds or grades, if he has given this subject the study which it deserves, a very great opportunity for in - creasing his net profits. It would be as wise to return to the flail for threshing our grain and to discard our present harvesting machines £to turn back to cattle not well equipped for the making of milk and t if we are to run dairies. It is as easy for a man to turn money into his pockets by plowing his land with the old fashioned wood plow rather than by using the present model as to net a profit in these times by dairying with anything but the very best cattle available. If you would found the industry in Nebraska in such a way that your work will continue to be creditable to you and in a manner which will make this Society a blessing to the State you will do your best to see to it that only the very best of breeding animals are brought into the State. There are no dairy cattle too good for your dairy farmers. The quicker they conceive the idea that the most efficient producers are in the long run the most profitable even though they may cost more money the quicker will your whole dairy industry be on a profitable basis. Yon do well to employ experts in the management of your work. Their full talent is needed if Nebraska is to be protected from the ill results certain to follow the purchase of inferior cattle. These un - fortunately are the ones which are the most readily offered for sale and </seg>
            <seg id="p439">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 441 the ones which the beginner is more inclined to purchase since he can secure them at relatively low prices. I would be glad indeed if the record associations of the several dairy breeds could .guarantee to you that registry certificates are sure indications of high productive capacity. Unfortunately they are not. These record societies which have been formed to carefully identify all animals which have been recorded are not able to inspect animals offered for registry and to make certain that they are representative of the best qualities of the breed or even capable of making profitable returns. It is necessary that you go into this question in a very thorough manner. While pure breds of any kind are certainly very much safer purchase than those animals which do not have these many generations of good breeding back of them you will do well if you will make certain that the pure breds which come in here are representative of the best qualities in their breeds. This is to say that Nebraska beginning now in her dairy promotion work should require more than that an animal be pure bred and regis - tered. Your foundation animals must be correct individually. They must not only be of the type which readily identifies them as wholly acceptable in the breeds which they represent but this type must be strongly indicative of milk and fat production. It is not enough either that your foundation animals shall be backed by Advanced Registry breeding. Unfortunately we have gone into a system of testing in this country which is not productive of the sort of facts which you need to know. In purchasing a bull you must dis - cover not alone that his dam has made a high record but you must know the conditions under which this production was recorded and you should discover the capacity of her sisters and other females close in her pedigree. Too many of the records advertised to your beginners have been made under conditions which cannot be approached economically under practical farm conditions. These are deceptive and fall short of being a safe basis for selections. You are seeking plans for stimulating the best methods of dairying here in the State. You will do well to emphasize strongly the two cooperative associations which have been discussed here, namely the cow testing association and the cooperative bull association. I know of no two plans which offer safer guarantee of success in any dairy commun - ity than the adoption of these two systems of dairy improvement. So strongly is the Ayshire breed persuaded that it is necessary to test every cow in the herd rather than to pay the largest attention on a few in - dividuals to the neglect of the major portion of the herd that a strong movement is under way to initiate "Herd Tests" to supplement if not substitute the present Advanced Registry system of testing. I recom- </seg>
            <seg id="p440">442 RKPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE mend to you most strongly that you encourage this type of testing in Nebraska to the end that the extra good cows which you will develop shall be given the prominence their worth deserves and to the end also that these inferior, loss-making individuals which some way seem to creep into the very best of herds may be promptly discarded. If you will do your best to see that the cattle brought into the State are good ones and that they are tested regularly after coming in and the poor ones discarded you will go a long way toward guaranteeing a more successful and more prosperous Nebraska. If prizes for production are to be offered I urge you strongly that these be awarded on the basis of herd averages rather than on the basis of any individual production. The "three hundred pound clubs" being instituted in Wisconsin and en - couraged nationally by the National Dairy Association seem to me to offer a splendid basis for promotion work here in the State. I assure you that in your endeavors you have the best wishes of every purebred record organization. The services of these record so - cieties are yours for the asking and every assistance will be gladly given in helping you in the very commendable work which you have under - taken. BY THE PRESIDENT: We are still waiting for the tellers to finish their work. In the meantime we will call upon a man who is always informed and ready to give us some light on the subject. Mr. A. L. Haecker. "WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HAVE IN STORE? BY MR. HAECKER: We must admit the dairy industry has been somewhat depressed during the past few months, but we can at least say that it was the last of the great departments of agriculture to feel the depression. One of the causes which led to this state of affairs was the unusually favorable weather, for 1924 will go down in agricultural history as a season of good pasture and correspondingly high milk pro - duction. The very fact that the dairy industry has been profitable for several years, had a tendency to encourage more men to milk cows; and with encouragement through societies and press we found our - selves with a large surplus of dairy products in storage early in Nov - ember. As between 35 and 40 percent of all milk produced is made into butter, and here in the west a much higher per cent, we will consider the butter situation first of all. During the months of November and December our excess butter in cold storage over and above the 5 year average ran from 50,000,000 to 60,000,000 pounds. Naturally it varied </seg>
            <seg id="p441">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 443 from week to week as butter was brought in and out of storage. Early in December indications began to turn to a more favorable situation with an unusually cold December in the producing regions, production was materially cut down. This decrease amounted to considerable at times, but for the whole month undoubtedly it was close to 10 percent. On the other hand consumption increased as it always does during cold weather. Butter is a fat and heat giving food, and people naturally will eat more butter when it is cold. There may be something in the spreading, for we know that cold butter will not spread easily, as the economical housewife knows. Most of us recall the time when butter was carefully put into the oven to redupe it's viscousity and increase its spreading surface. We now find conditions greatly improved. Using the government figures for December 27 which might be classed as January 1, cold storage butter in 26 of our leading cities amounted to 71,000,000 pounds. A year ago at this time it was 31,600,000. Thus we have about 39 million pounds over last year's holdings. On December 1, the surplus was 50,000,000 so we have reduced in one month our cold storage holdings 11,000,000 pounds, and butter is coming out of storage today much faster than it did a year ago. If the present rate of increase is kept up, we should have the excess fairly well out of the way by May 1. As for production, the unusually cold winter, the lower price in market and the big price of grain are causing a lessening of production from a year ago. It is difficult to determine the amount of this re - duction but it is close to 5 or 6 percent over the country at large. There is an increase in some states such as Minnesota, South Dakota and Nebraska while Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio show from 5 to 10 percent decrease. We are as a people using more dairy production of all kinds, unless it be cheese than we have in the past. The figures for 1924 are not yet available, but undoubtedly they will show close to 1-2 pound of butter per capita which would be in the neighborhood of 50,000,000 or 60,000,000 pounds. The government places this increase of 1924 over 1923 at 50,000,000 pounds. With normal business conditions that are favorable for the future, may believe that the increase will be quite as large this year as last. With such an increase ad. led to the amount necessary to balance increase in population, prob - ably 25,000,000 to 30,000,000 pounds per year, we will need from 75,000, - 000 to 100,000,000 pounds more butter than we used last year. The use of butter substitutes is a pretty safe barometer of our con - sumption of butter. When butter substitutes fall off in manufacture it generally reflects an increasing consumption of butter. The figures for November show that there were manufactured in this country G,7GO,000 pounds less oleomargarine than November 1923. </seg>
            <seg id="p442">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 444 The cheese situation is greatly improved, and the last figures show that we have only about one-half million pounds more than a year ago. In condensed and evaporated milk we have quite an excess, but we are rapidly reducing this over-supply, and with normal weather conditions, we should come out pretty well by spring. The ice cream situation looks very- favorable, for with the im - provement in business we can expect a larger consumption of ice cream. Last summer was a Jonah for the ice cream makers for the temperature was considerable below normal in all sections of the country and the consumption of ice cream is largely a matter of temperature. The ice cream people, therefore, feel that they have passed through a very un- Eil season and naturally have a right to expect a normal season, cream as a food and beverage is largely on the increase, and we have ■y reason to expect this business to grow during 1925. As a keynote or slogan for the dairy industry in 1925 I would sug - gest the word QUALITY. Quality in cow, quality in feeding and care, and quality in product. Could we bring about quality in these de - partments we would have no worry for the future. We would be assured of a good market, a large consumption and a fair price. The solution of this over-production can at once be answered by the word QUALITY. Without doubt we have in this state 200,000 cows that are unprofitable. Could we remove half of them or one fourth, we would at once greatly increase our profit and relieve the market of over-supply. This is true in every state. It is the unprofitable poor cow that is causing the over-supply and the resulting low price. This is the time to cull the herd. Keep one good cow that will produce as much as three poor ones and your profit will be many fold. I never saw a herd that could not be culled. We can safely say that this is a task for every cow keeper; first to know your cows and second to rid your herd of the unprofitable ones. The quality of the production will largely determine its demand and consumption, and we cannot urge too strongly the necessity of producing a better product in order to solve the ques - tion of per capita consumption. I sincerely think that the future looks very bright for the dairy farmer. Never was there a better demand for good dairy stock, and this demand will increase as our producers discover the secret of profit - able production. It is the large producing cow that gives a profitable return, and the dairy bred stock will be in demand just as long as this truth is recognized. Dairy products are the largest item of our diet. It is figured that the American people consume two and a half billion dollars worth of dairy products annually, and we are rapidly increasing our consumption to cater to this great demand. I expect to see the </seg>

THURSDAY EVENING, JANUARY 8, 6 P. M- PROGRAM 8 P. M. Hon. S. R. McKelvie, Toast Master. Hon. H. J. McLaughlin, President of Live Stock Breeders Associa - tion, Presiding. BY MR. McLAUGHLIN : If you will just be quiet a moment I am requested to announce that after the adjournment of this meeting there will be a meeting of the State Poultry Association at the Lindell Hotel and in this room there will be a business meeting of /the Improved Live - stock Breeders Association. You should all stay here through this pro - gram. No one should be allowed to leave. Now we are going to have a few sober thoughts, a few thoughts not quite so sober and some that may not even be upon a speaking acquaintance with sober thoughts. Now pursuant to the program I will introduce the Toast Master and for that function I am going to introduce Hon. S. R. McKelvie, Ex-Governor of Nebraska. BY EX-GOVERNOR McKELVIE: Mr. President, Ladies and Gen - tlemen, I am really sorry that the next proceeding is to be a poultry meeting. I would like to have these doors closed and barred because there are some single gentlemen in the room to whom a chicken show may have too much attraction. And especially when the legislature is just convening it is very proper to say that it is in order to have a very short and snappy session. That is now in the minds of all of us. As the hours roll on perhaps we will change our minds but that is the way we feel about it now. In the course of the proceedings I wish to have the pleasure of introducing you to a lot of old friends, and who will be able to tell that they are old friends yet some of you that haven't been around such a long time, some of you younger folks may never have met them at all. If you can date your birth back about the time of the Civil War you will recognize some of the stories that will be told here tonight, but that doesn't mean that they are not all good stories or that they are out of place here for a good story is not spoiled by age. It is always a good story. Yet I see we do have a lot of young folks here too who may have been exempt by their youth so many haven't heard some of these stories at all. When the program was given to me yesterday for tonight's meeting I proceeded to arrange what I was going to say. But I see that circumstances have brought about some changes. I had in mind, as Mr. Barnum always said, that it was wise to put across the small elephant first and then later on to bring out the </seg>
            <seg id="p445">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 447 elephant Jumbo. But I am out of luck because we have already had the elephant Jumbo presented. But this Jumbo is not only of good size in it's physical proportions but I am pleased to note that he is our new Secretary of Agriculture and he is Jumbo of no mean proportion and he will do the job in a big way I know. There is another Jumbo that we will call upon a little later. I will not just simply say there will be a Jumbo called upon and stop at that or there are some of you all over the room who will be pulling out your pencils and making notes and ex - pecting later to be called upon. So in the course of this night I am going to have to depart from the arranged program, and I will have to re-arrange the speakers. That does not apply to the first one. We are going to start out with something light. I am assured of that not be - cause I know the gentleman nor because I have heard him speak, though I have heard him speak. I heard him speak today. He is a dairyman. I believe he is in the dairy business now. I sat there before him today and in his splendid suave manner and his delightful diction he carried me along from the beginning of the dairy cow. He pictured in my mind the scene of old Abram with his herd and his flock and caring for his herd as it seemed to me I could see him even there separating the cows from the goats; and then later brought down the improved dairy breed as it has been established. Then he came further down along the line and I followed him the while and I saw the continuing growth of the cow and her calf through the thousands of years. As he went along I was gaining momentum all the time, in my constant belief in the dairy cow and trying to understand the better of the beginnings and her tre - mendous rise to her present position of importance when all of a sudden he gave me a wallop. He began to speak of this cow as being the most important factor in the community and finally he said, "When I think of this cow, Katie Gerbin. Katie Gerbin the wonderful cow who started on the road to fame about 17 years ago in Nebraska." He said, "As I said before that I believe that she has done more service to the state of Nebraska than any Governor of the state ever had. "I came out of my fiesta with a thud. I said that is not so bad after all. I am perfectly willing to be compared with Katie Gerbin, I really consider it is better than a lot of people have ever done. But later this evening I have found myself in a position to wonder if he did not reckon without the records. As I think Katie Gerbin's worth I don't believe she ever was worth as much as twenty-two million dollars per two years. The next speaker believes in the dairy cow. He is able to talk about her. The speaker that I now am about to introduce to you is "Blue Milk and Spotted Cows," and I daresay that he is going to refer to that kind of cows. He says that the only bad thing about these cows is that you don't dare to feed them after the baby because if you do the milk will just turn into butter and make the baby sick. I will now introduce to you, Mr. C. L. Burlingham, of Vermont. </seg>
            <seg id="p446">448 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE BY MR. McKELVIE: By the way, someone else comes from Ver - (ont, I believe, that is Cal. Anyway Mr. Burlingham today said he ime from Vermont and a lot of the fellows came from Vermont. Now will leave you with Mr. Burlingham and Blue Milk and Spotted Cows. BY MR- BURLINGHAM: Ladies and Gentlemen until a few minutes ago I sat in the back of the room with some of those gentlemen to whom the Toast Master previously referred, some young men and we were indulging in some talk, I was wondering how I would undertake such a great task as that of Howard Gramlich upon this list. These gentlemen were telling me stories and testing my personal ability in trying to supply me with some sort ef material to make any kind of an answer. I don't believe anyone ever went through a deeper anguish than I naveV The history of a fellow who made a horse trade with an old colorechpreacher down in Vermont and the one the old fellow traded to the preacher was not very good and after the trade was over his conscience hurt him so he went to the preacher and said, "Mr. Preacher, the horse that I have sold you has two faults." The old preacher said, "Well that is all right if he only has two, but what are they " The old fellow then remarked, "If you turn him loose you are going to have an awful hard time catching him," to which the preacher replied, "Not so bad I probably will catch him." And then the fellow continued, "And the other fault is that if you do catch him, that he isn't worth a Gol Darn." So the stories given to me must be classified in the same way and the age extended be classified in the same way, for it is not worth very much to me right now. When I made that remark today which has been referred to me &gt;y the Toast Master I had no sooner made it that I realized what terrible blunder I had committed. When I looked down and saw le Governor there then I realized that the Governor was chairman r Toast Master of this program and I was to be a part of it, and might then expect what was coming. As an old fellow in our state ho when he was plowing tied the lines around his body. One day le horses got frightened and ran away, tightened up the lines and irew him down and were dragging him around. The old man no soon - r got started than he began to realize that he should not be there and o sooner had gone five rods than he realized that. Just so I haven't one more than a few words before I realized it today. The next time take such a liberty with the Governor present I will ascertain first whether he is in charge of the program that night. Anyway I came to realize that I would have an opportunity to come back later. Like the man who went fishing, a very ardent fisherman and he caught a very »ig fish so he rushed to the telegraph office and sent this telegraph to lis wife, "I've got one beauty weighing 7 pounds." But imagine his sui - rise when he got a telegram back, "So have I, 10 pounds, not a beauty, </seg>
            <seg id="p447">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 449 come home." Now come around to my subject "Blue Milk and Spotted Cows," but I don't believe I will stay close to that because for a dairy - man to speak on that subject might incriminate him and I don't like to give that sort of evidence against myself. My friend, Mr. Oldham of the Holstein Association, claims that is his speech here anyway. We don't take shots at each others' breeds any more, we just admit that each of us have breeds that are very good. There was an old friend of mine, there was an old fellow in our state, who lived up near the bootlegging line this side of Montreal. He had lost a fine dairy heifer and he put an advertisement in the paper to find it. In order to be sure and get his heifer back he put in the advertisement that he would give some old Scotch whiskey for her return. The next morning he found 13 men out in front of his house holding Holstein-Friesian heifers. Now, this has been a very happy day indeed for anyone who is interested in dairying in the state of Nebraska. I know it is true that we have had a good time. I know that we have come to the point in the registry associations where we help each other out of difficulties. We have finally come to a plan which is going to get us out of our difficulties, that is we are going to pull ourselves out by our own boot straps in the state of Ne - braska. I believe the situation will be more happy even in the future as we come to this period of progress in dairying. I will tell of a little fellow who climbed up on the barn against his mother's wishes. He knew what he was up against when suddenly he fell off. He knew what he was going to get if she found him up there, then as he climbed up one day he got along pretty nicely until he suddenly slipped. As it was apparent that he was going to tear his clothes he knew what was coming to him but as he went on down he said, "Oh Lord, save me. Oh Lord, save me." Then suddenly he exclaimed, "Never mind, Lord, I have caught myself on a nail." I heard an outline today on a thorough go - ing business organization that you have in Nebraska. This coopeiative organization in which men engaged in various businesses besides dairy - ing have joined hands with those men who are engaged in dairying and are trying hard in Nebraska in a common practical organization, which I believe guarantees suuccess in this state to handle some of the prob - lems of dairying in Nebraska. I really think there is coming a time when we will all work together to the advancement of our dairy in - dustry in Nebraska. I cannot but also hope that all agriculture in the state may come to just such an organization with such a carefully work - ed out plan as I have heard outlined today and it can certainly be recom - mended to all agricultural organizations of the state. BY TOAST MASTER McKELVIE: After hearing the last speak - er we will now be entertained, what I meant to say was, we will be entertained by Mrs. Altinus Tullis, who is one of our splendid singers in this city. </seg>
            <seg id="p448">450 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Mrs. Tullis sang a number of songs starting on a very "heavy" number, a humorous little ditty and working through a cycle of about five songs. BY THE TO ASTM ASTER: My friends, you have reason. to ob - serve why I like Mrs. Tullis' singing and in fact you can tell just how I feel about Mrs. Tullis. Now I might take up a further reason why this program had to be re-arranged. We are now going to have another of the larger elephants, who is about to appear. In introducing him, in order to do the best I can, I think I will tell a story that he told me about a month ago. The story related by him as being told by President Roose - velt. The president had been out on an early morning walk. As he came by the home of Secretary Root, who was then in his cabinet, he thought he would make a morning call and pick up some important matter of his secretary. He strode up to the door and rang the bell then the colored porter came to the door and he said, "I would like to see Mr. Root." The porter said, "The secretary am engaged." He says, "You all got a card?" Then he says, "Oh, just tell him the president is here." The porter replied, "President of what?" Well we have the president here with us tonight. You say presi - ent of what and I say president of many things. He is president of le Nebraska Dairy Development Society. He is President of the nion Pacific railroad, but I won't say that he is president of his house - lold because I heard a story today. Fred Nelson came into the meeting oday and he said, "I came in today here in this meeting to hear Carl Jray," and he was very much disappointed when told that Mr. Gray lad already spoken, and remarked, "I never heard Carl Gray, but if he can speak like Mrs. Gray can talk over the radio I would say he is a real peaker." So I might introduce you to Mr. Carl Gray, primarily the of the Nebraska Development Society and secondarily predi - ent of the Union Pacific railroad. BY MR, GRAY: Mr. Toastmaster, ladies and gentlemen: There is a good deal of forebearance necessary in one's attitude toward the Toastmaster. One of our old switchmen was telling me the other day about a Toastmaster and said that one always reminded him of a yard engine; it does a lot of puffing and blowing, but never gets out of the yard. My attitude toward him is something like that of an old dairy woman I knew down south when I was a boy. The baptizing place in those days was in the White river. This happened to be at a time when the White river was frozen over. Mandy got converted, and she got converted hard. The old minister wanted to cut a hole in the ice and baptize her, but she said, no, she would not do that. He was disgusted with her and said, "What is the matter with you, don't you believe in </seg>
            <seg id="p449">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTIRK 451 the Lord?" She said, "Yes, I certainly do, but I never monkey with Him." Now if you want to have a position of entire subordination, you want to be Mrs. Gray's husband in Omaha and "Howdy" Gray's father at Princeton. I am glad the toastmaster did not pronounce the speaker's subject more in detail, because I have been racking my mind trying to under - stand what this subject means. It is something about a foot on the rail; I don't know whether that refers to a railroad rail or a pre-Volstead rail. I do want to say something to you tonight in the midst of the im - portant week we are having here, upon what interest business men ought to take, and what interest business men are taking in agriculture. If there is any one thing that is usually resented by farmers, or at least by certain farmers of my acquaintance, it is unsolicited advice, particu - larly from people who do not know anything about farming. I do not believe a business man could do worse than try to give ad - vice upon a subject which is wholly out of his element. It does so hap - pen, however, that some of the principles which govern in the railroad business apply equally as well to farming or any other business. So the business man can be of assistance in helping work out the business side of fanning; and to that extent is he not only justified in taking an in - terest in these matters, but he would be derelict in his duty to the country if he did not do so. Now if the business men can not offer advice, they can certainly very properly support organizations such as these which give out advice by experts. The field of agricultural and dairy statistics has hardly been touched. Statistics are vital to business generally in this country; they measure the possibilities of business, evidence its mistakes, point out uneconomic situations, and insure progress. For some years I was associated with Mr. James J. Hill, on the Great Northern Railroad; and no man ever did more in any territory to help and encourage agriculture than Mr. Hill did in the great North - west. All through this country there are associations and organizations of business men who probably have no more knowledge of agriculture than any ordinary business man, and yet who have been of great assist - ance to certain lines of agriculture, through organization and through a program of support of men who do know the game and who are quali - fied to give expert advice. We founded the Nebraska Dairy Development. Society solely with that aim in view. The financial support was given largely by business men. The Society was officered largely by business men, and the thought was that we would be able to provide what we thought some day the </seg>
            <seg id="p450">452 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE state of Nebraska would provide, that is, service to individual fanners and groups of farmers, supplementary to the activities of the Extension Division of the College of Agriculture. It has been my fortune to have lived and to have contaminated in various degrees many parts of this country. I have been an executive officer of railroads in 33 out of the 48 states. I merely mention this to show my acquaintance in the different sections of the country. It was not only a grateful surprise to me when I came here, but it has been a continuing grateful surprise, to see what an inspiration we have in our agricultural executives in Nebraska. I do not know that I can quite express it, but what I want to say is that this college with its extension department is one of the leading and outstanding institutions in this country. We have every reason to be proud of it, and we ought to carry away with us — each of us who have been here this week — a determina - tion to stand back of and support this college to the best of our ability. And if the men interested in agriculture will likewise stand behind the Dairy Society, we can probably go a little farther than the college is in a position to go at this time, particularly in the way of furnishing information and statistics. It is our thought that this information service, supplemented by experts in the field, will permit of making analyses and comparisons which will stimulate every individual dairy - man in the state. There has never been any thought that the Dairy Society would in - terfere with or displace any other activity. It was our thought that the establishment of such a society would bring about a better under - standing of the dairy situation and promote tests, the keeping of records, and continual improvement of the herds, and bring dairying in Nebraska op to the standards which have been attained in other and older dairy states. One thing has made a profound impression on me as a business man in looking into the dairy industry. It has been stated on very good authority that one third of the milk cows in Nebraska are un - profitable, one third of them just pay for their keep, and only one third return a profit to the farmer. Now if that is true, it is a stupendous thing that the labor and effort and use of equipment in maintaining two thirds of the cows in the state, or approximately 340,000 cows, are be - ing expended without any net return. Our goal is the reduction of this waste and the elimination of the unprofitable animals. Some of this can be done without going outside the state of Nebraska. If it is necessary to go outside to buy animals that can be brought in in the proper way and surrounded with the ressary safeguards, this is something in which the business men can of assistance, even though they have no technical knowledge. </seg>
            <seg id="p451">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 453 The business man has, I am sure, a sincere desire to be of some constructive help to agriculture; certainly he does not want to be a hindrance. Nebraska is one of the most important and distinctively agricultural states if not the most important and distinctively agricul - tural state in the union; and certainly somewhere, somehow, the busi - ness man can be of assistance in bringing the state to its proper place in the dairy world. There is in a way an analogy between the dairy business and the railroad business. In the latter we have had for some years a declining scale of average rates. We have had to meet that situation, and the only way we could meet it was by a reduction of expenses. That reduc - tion of expenses was brought about largely by increasing the tons per train — what we call the train load. It costs approximately the same to run a train a mile whether it is heavily loaded or lightly loaded. And since the expense per train mile is relatively fixed, the revenue per mile measures the success or non-success of the railroad. To take another example: Suppose you were buying apples for so much a barrel and selling them for so much apiece. The more apples there were in each barrel the more money you would make. That il - lustrates the railroad business; the greater the train load at a fixed cost of handling, the greater the profit. Now that is true in the case of the dairyman: The more he can produce from each cow, the greater return he can get for the same ex - pense. Thereby he may be able to keep up with a declining market. He cannot control the market; we can not even help him control it. All we can help him is through expert advice as to how to increase his train load, that is, his production per cow. That is the answer we must have in this state. Nebraska ranks high in her agricultural averages. No state around Nebraska ap - proaches, or at least none equals her for production of wheat per acre. But Nebraska ranks very low in the average production per cow. 34 out of 48 states show better production. So here is the great opportunity that lies before us in Nebraska today; that is the direction our progress and development must take. The Nebraska Dairy Development Society, which has really had only about six months of executive service, is destined to play an im - portant part in bringing about this progress; and I think every business man who has been associated with it or with whom we have been associated, will feel proud of his connection with it in doing the con - structive things for this state that it is doing and will do.

BY TOAST MASTER McKELVIE: I wish very much that we ould keep right on and be further entertained by Mr. and Mrs. Leonard. *ut we have with us a gentleman from Missouri whom we must hear rom for a few minutes and he wants to get away on the 9:30 train. I lave had some dealings with folks from Missouri, in thought I annexed wirt of the state once so I know what it means to come from that state. ow we have with us Professor Gromer and we will now hear from •rofessor S. D. Gromer, Rural Economics of the State Agricultural College at Columbia. BY PROFESSOR GROMER: Ladies and Gentlemen, as I stated this morning about thirty years ago I was a citizen of this great state. I was afraid I never was going to get back. King Alexander of Scotland who had conquered all of the people except a few tribes around Scotland, and then he thought he had conquered the entire world. He sent a band of men out to find some kingdoms that had never been conquered. These gentlemen went out and finally they came across a mission where an exposition was being made of the Kingdom of God. He asked where that was and he was informed that it was with us al - ways. They were told that all they needed to do was just to come and occupy a Kingdom of God. They went back and told the King who was very much impressed but at the same time was in such an attitude affected by foreign potentates so that he forbid any man to go into that Kingdom. So I never thought that I would be able to get back into the Kingdom of Nebraska, but I am back. t I want to make this statement in all seriousness. There has been deep feelings that agriculture has not been getting quite a square deal. When people feel that they are not getting quite a square deal they are sometimes inclined to take radical measures. Then there was an under - supply of wages whether it is in Nebraska or in England labor gets what it wants by the extra size of a certain sort of force. It gets a quicker force than it does by the slow economic processes of law. But you take Russia, a land with a very few capitalists, they get away with what they want to by force in a very short time. That has been em - phasized. There has been that feeling upon the part of the farmer that he isn't getting quite a square deal and so he likewise at times follows a tendency to do uneconomic things. I think we have one of the most democratic governments in the world but if we would stop still tonight not in a hundred years from, now would Russia ever give us very much </seg>
            <seg id="p453">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTt'RE 455 of anything to compare unless she would do very much better between now and then than she has in the past. Our government is based pri - marily on the freedom of each individual to determine what he is going to do and who can own property. It is not determined by a matter of force who can own property. Anyone knows that it would be mighty foolish for the farmer to undertake to attain the ends he might have in view by domestic difficulty, it would be an uneconomic situation for us produced by too great an extension of .government. I believe that there are good things in the reach of the farmer without taking any unsafe measures. It is all unnecessary because in recent years we have tele - phone, light, we hava our good roads, we have our schools and things of that kind and all the present discoveries in science and the discoveries that are being made in the agricultural college that go toward the elim - ination of waste. All of these things the farmer has yet some he doesn't feel quite able to purchase. I think that we are going to be able to purchase them. My notion is that the thing to do in the coming years is to develop in America to keep close with our agricultural organizations, our schools, our roads and things of that kind so as to give the farmer a greater advantage. A farmer has labor and capital to spread over a larger area than businesses concentrated in the industry region. You cannot have a great agricultural plant without having a large area. You can have a great business concentrated in a small area. You can put in great factories with a large production on a small area and have a big population involved but that is not so with the farm. We may ask if the children on the farms are getting a square deal today. There are children in Nebraska and Minnesota in the country who are not getting the benefit of high school. The capital and labor of the farm is spread so thinly over the territory that they cannot afford. Our modern system of taxation as spread over Nebraska and Missouri is such that it cannot raise enough that these children can have even the ordinary advantages of education. The farmer has a school system that needs the help of the state as much as it is able to give, with his thinly scat - tered labor and capital over a large area. In many places they strll have nothing but the primary school then you jump to the great common West in Nebraska and Missouri they have a great industry centered there and capital and labor so concentrated that they can furnish relatively much greater facilities without as much burden as the farm. Now in Missouri we have a gasoline tax, automobiles taxed separately and when we are going to pay all of these taxes we ought to have schools both for the centers and for the children in the country so that they may all have the benefit of a high school education. So up and down the line. The farmer may have a few points of advantage. But he is like the business man. He wants automobiles, he wants machinery, the women want washing machines and other household conveniences, they want a furnace and all of those sort of things. If the farmer cannot have all of these things he becomes prey for these </seg>
            <seg id="p454">456 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE quite political sharks with remedies to offer. If the farmers of Missouri and Nebraska will play their part as they should play it in these modern times and secure the advantages, secure the education and so on, I be - lieve, until they do that, the boys and girls would be justified in not staying on the farm, but if they will do these things they will not need to worry about that. I thank you. BY THE TOAST MASTER: We will now hear from Mr. C. E. Olmstead, Lincoln. (At this point Mr. Olmstead recited, "By Gum, I Am Ready For a Full Days Work •") BY THE TO ASTM ASTER: I know that that poem didn't apply to Charley Olmstead himself nor the way he conducted his affairs. Now our next speaker is a banker. He would tell you that he was a armer if he was to introduce himself but nevertheless he is a banker. a ordinary citizen looks upon a banker as exemplifying the thing that was done by the old colored fellow who rented a piece of land and agreed to give one-fourth rent. Finally when the time came around the owner of the land discovered that he had marketed all of the crop and he said o him, "Why Mose, where is my &lt;share?" Mose says, "There wasn't no ourth, there was only three loads." Now Mr. Head is president of the Omaha National Bank, has been president of the American Banker's Association, and he has been president of so many things that I can't tegin to recount them. All of those things, each one of those honors, as been conferred upon him, but those are not the things that disturb im. He says that if I had my life to live over again I would probably pend it in being a grand-father, for he has recently become a grand - ather. I now want to introduce you to Mr. Walter W. Head of Omaha, who will speak not probably on the title that is shown on the program where it says "Always A " 'Head' " but probably "Finance as it Effects Agriculture in the Middlewest." BY MR. HEAD: Mr. Toast Master, Ladies and Gentlemen, seriously lie Toast Master about sized it up when he said that I was prouder of being a grandfather than of all the rest of the things mentioned. I tand as a living example of the fact that you don't have to be 125 years old to be a grandfather. The governor refers to the fact that I was president of the American Banker's Association and of a few other rganizations. I am reminded of an incident of American life abroad. Recently when I was visiting in France, I was in Paris and stopped at a French hotel. There we saw a very excited group standing around one man who seemed to be the center of interest. I thought being such a center of interest that he was probably one of the prominent citizens. I went </seg>
            <seg id="p455">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 457 up to find out what it was about and asked another man who from his appearance or importance looked like he would be prominent there and I asked him to tell me what it was. He says, "I don't know I haven't been here such a very long time." He said there were so many things going on at various places that week that he did not know. He said he couldn't keep track of everything that was going on. He didn't know what it was about. Then I spoke to him again and he said it would be necessary to go and ask the man so I went over and asked, "Who is this man I see standing in the middle of the group of a lot of people?" And he pointed to another whom he said "is one of the prominent French citizens, perhaps he can give you the information." So I went over and approached the apparently prominent citizens and asked him if he would please tell me what it was and he thought I had better ask the man him - self, so then I went over and approached the man and said, "Would you please tell me why you have got all of those badges that you wear, how you came into possession of them?" The man looked at me and said, "You appear to be a very sensible fellow, you look like the inquiry you have made was in good faith so I am going to respond in the same way." "You see that badge was given to me about twenty years ago and it was given to me by mistake. Then all of the others came to me as a result of receiving the first one." So I might tell the Toast Master and you folks that some of my honors came about the same way. The Toast Master may remember another occasion when he and I both appeared upon the same program except upon that occasion I was Toast Master and he was one of the guests who was to respond at the proper time. I had a few things I wanted to say so in introducing him I said them and in due time he came along and he had something to say back to me. Then being the Toast Master I had the last chance, so I was glad to respond to what he had already said. Then on another oc - casion I happened to be advised that he was to act as he is doing to - night, as Toast Master. I said to him that I am about to speak tonight and when he got ready to introduce me he said that I would travel all the way from Omaha to the Pacific Coast if I just had an opportunity to make a speech. He said I would rather make a speech than to do anything else. Then he went on to sa y that if anyone wanted me to talk all they had to do was to just drop a dinner in the slot and up comes a speech. Then I said about the Toast Master when I next had an opportunity that I had known him for some years and that we were both willing to travel from Omaha to the Pacific Coast for a chance to make a speech but there was just this difference, that you may have to drop a dinner in the slot and up will come a speech on my part, but with him you drop a speech on his part and up comes your dinner. After that occasion, ladies and gentlemen, he simply promised me that we would enter into an agreement that hereafter when we appear on the same program that we will treat each other as gently as possible. So </seg>
            <seg id="p456">458 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE in view of that I don't care to refer to certain other things tonight that I could tell you about the Toast Master. This all reminds me of a story and I believe it would be safe to tell this now even if it does effect some people who have lived in Missouri. There are a few people that have come from Missouri that I can vouch for but I am going to say this now since Professor Gromer has gone. Twenty-six years ago I went to school to Professor Gromer and I haven't seen him since. Now you might say, "How do you know this is the same man you went to school with when you haven't seen him since?" He asked me that question and then I said, "Well he has got the same little shrug and twist of the shoulders." Another thing you noticed about him too, is that he had something to say when he got started to talk. He is the same now as he was then. I was going to tell a story about a North Carolina friend down there who ran for office on the Republican ticket. He says, "Well you have known me all my life. I ran for governor down there on the Republi - can ticket." I said, "Of course you didn't have a chance of being elect - ed in North Carolina." He says, "No, but I made a very fine and won - derful race. I had 115 white votes." I said, "How many?" He said, "I received 115 white votes." Well I says, "How many votes of your own people did you Teceive?" He still insisted, "I received 115 white votes." I said, "Now for the last time Mr. Scott, why do you always refer to it as receiving 115 white votes?" "Because I know that North Carolina is about equally divided between the white men and the black." "Well you see we don't allow negroes in North Carolina to vote that leads up to the question of how they handle that." "Well,"I said, "How do you?" He said, "Well, we have an educational test. Every man down in North Carolina that has a black face must pass an educational test. He must answer just so many things. The judge of the election then can tell just how he will come out. They always come up in half dozen lots, then they always pick out one pretty smart looking fellow to take the test. One morning I stood by where they were receiving the votes and the darkey man came in with a bunch of others and said, "We would like to cast our votes too.' " Judge Cox said, "Well you know that you will have to pass the educational test." The other responded, "Well Judge, we all knows that, and we all knows that down here you don't have to ask any questions." What does you all knows about the constitution of the states of North Carolina?" The judge said to the darkey. He agreed that, "We all knows about the constitu - tion of North Carolina you don't need to ask me no questions about that nohow. We would like to go on about it and vote." But the judge insisted, "What do you all know about the constitution of the United States?" The darkey answered, "Yes judge, we all know what - ever you want to know about the constitution of the United States." Then the judge asked, "What does it mean by habeas corpus proceed - ing?" The darkey looked kind of stumped and repeated, "What does it mean by habeas corpus proceedings?" The judge urged, "Come on </seg>
            <seg id="p457">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 459 answer my question." The old darkey, he was just rather stuck and ho looked a little startled and tamed and the rest of the darkies began to look scared when they saw their leader was stuck and entirely unable to answer the question. The judge repeated the question and the darkey answered, "Oh yes, oh yes." But the judge insisted. "Now you said that you could answer any of these questions readily. Now you have your opportunity. Come on now, give us the answer to the ques - tion." The old darkey again looked startled and the judge again in - sisted and finally he looked at him squarely and said, "You all know judge, you know I ain't ,got nothing on you- Habeas corpus proceeding means that we negroes in North Carolina don't vote." Though I might just as well say to you that since the Toast Master has the last say that I shall not attempt to say anything that I may have in mind or that I know about the Toast Master. Now I am going to talk just a few minutes on the matter, not so much on "Finance" as it effects agriculture in the central United States as that reminds me of an old friend of mine when I was running a bank down in Missouri He came in to see me and said, "I am tired of staying on the farm and I am going in the banking business. I have watched you run a bank here for a year or more and now I have decided I am going in the bank - ing business. I am going out in Kansas and get me a bank. I have been watching you folks as I go in and out of here. You come down late in the morning and you leave early in the afternoon." He didn't know that I was getting to the bank early every morning and staying until about six thirty or seven o'clock every night. Well, you have to do that in any business, ladies and gentlemen, if you are going to succeed. Well even though I told him that probably he didn't know the banking business and he had better save what he had and stay on the farm he did go on over to a little town in Kansas, Jailbelow and get a 10,000 dollar deposit bank. But he had gone ahead and bought it without ask - ing me to go over and look at it. He had bought it cheap. Three years later he came back, when he had gotten out of the bank, to buy another farm. I says, "Have you got enough of the banking business?" He says, "Yes I have." The banking business is a little bit different looking. It certainly looks a lot different, looking from the inside than it does from the outside. I have my experience and I am through. Now if I am to talk on this subject I think I would reverse it and say, "Finance as it Effects Agriculture." Still better you might say, "Agriculture as it Effects Finance in the Central West." There isn't any question about that. I really don't say it in a jocular way. I say it in the light of the experience of the last five years as the question in this part in the agricultural center of the United States. I might say that I am really glad to have this opportunity of talking to men and women of Nebraska. I am not just talking this way to you people who </seg>
            <seg id="p458">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 460 are interested in agriculture. I make these very same statements to business men in Nebraska and out of Nebraska. We are right in the great Central West in an agricultural region. I won't say that finance effects agriculture so much as agriculture effects finance. There would be no banks in Nebraska today were it not for the facts that we have agricul - ture as a basic industry. We have had, it is quite true, an intense period of suffering during the last five years. All industry has suffered during the last five years. We are not saying whether agriculture has suffered more than any other industry or not, but it has suffered. We will not say that it has suffered less than other industries. But one thing we will all agree upon is that we have suffered in this section of the United States. Five years is a long time as you measure time, particularly is it a long time for the American people to remain in the same identical position. While there were times during that five years that we thought we were not going to make progress, many times we felt like the wheels were blocked and we were going to stop, particularly in 1922, there was not a single time during that five year period that we were not really making progress. When that period came upon us we were overloaded. We had merchandise, we had lines, we had livestock, and while it was true they all declined in value, we had nobody to blame for it but our - selves. I made the statement a moment ago that the American people were very resourceful during the five year period of deflation then started to be the same period of liquidation, ladies and gentlemen a liquidation of values. First there was a liquidation of inflated values. That pertained at that time to merchandise, to land and to real estate in cities and to almost every commodity which the American people dealt in, so dur - ing the first period of depression there was a period of liquidation at these inflated values. Merchandise, livestock and every commodity that we had in our possession at that time not only went down in value which caused us to sustain serious losses but the necessity in many in - stances was sufficient enough to warrant the prices which were being paid at all but it was taking price out of our control. The next period of depression which the American people sustained was in 1922 and 1923. Then we began to see that things we had been doing prior to 1920 had to a more or less extent necessitated our condition which we were in at the time. Then we had to put our feet on the ground and recognize that the prices we had dealt in and received for our commodity at that time were really more than our commodities were worth, we had to recognize the prices that we received for commodities at that time, in 1922 and 1923 were just as much less than they were worth than the prices that we had been receiving were an overpayment. As to actual values when that con - dition came about not only was it through Nebraska but all through the Central West and for that matter practically all sections of the country it was evident that in 1922 and 1923 we were not receiving what the commodities were worth. We were not so much recognizing it at the time as we are now. This liquidation is stDl going on. In 1924 we pass- </seg>
            <seg id="p459">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 461 ed into a new period of liquidation, due to a better period of selling products. If in some instances we have made progress while we have been very slow in 1924, yet it was perhaps 100 percent profit in 1924 as compared to what we had actually done in 1921 and 1922. The increase in prices we have received for agricultural products during the last few months are, or you might say, during the last year, has not only helped the agricultural industry materially but has helped all industries, banks, mortgage holders, merchandisers, regardless of whether they have been in villages or in Metropolitan cities. I think this change of conditions has had a very large effect upon the increase of prices received in all of the agricultural land. We are coming into 1225, it is true, in a more optomistic frame of mind than we have been in for five years, past. But let us keep in mind the present condition of the market for Nebraska might not always pre - vail. Although it was to offer what we produced, hay, corn and wheat are selling for better prices now than they may be later. There is a short supply there and consequently some of our products are selling at the prices we are receiving now, and we are readily selling them at those prices. If there is an over-production we must face the fact that com - petition will bring prices down. This would be the competition not only of American farmers but of farmers all over the world so if we will look into the future we will find that we may not be able to expect to always receive the prices that we are getting now. The only way that we can measure the future is to take what has happened in the past and measure it accordingly. Last summer I was over in Italy. I was riding along on an Italian train and looking out of the window I looked over at another man and thought I must make use of the two or three Italian words that I had at my command. He recognized the fact I was not using Italian very well so he spoke in English. He said, "You are an American, and live in Chicago?" I said, "No, I am an American but I live in Omaha." He says, "Well I lived in Chicago twelve years myself." I said, "What was your business in Chicago?" He said, "Well I was in the packing busi - ness with Armours, and I am the manager of Armour &amp; Company for Italy." So I began to ask him questions especially as to the meat that was consumed in Italy. He said, "Well, our trade is constantly increas - ing, and the sales in beef has readily been climbing in an amount over what they were during any preceding period. I asked him particularly in what character and he said more so in bacon. The Italians want more bacon. I was glad to get this bit of information. But I wondered why he didn't sell more beef in Italy from the farms of Nebraska or from the farms of Illinois. He said, "Weil it was a stiff competition with South America. All through Argentine and the countries of South America they could raise beef and ship it to Italy cheaper than it could </seg>
            <seg id="p460">462 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE be raised in Nebraska or Illinois." That is one thing I found first hand, adies and gentlemen, and a fact that we should open our eyes to in this agricultural region, and that is our inability to market our products broad. This inability was costing us large sums before the war and ince the war we faced the fact that those people are very largely not m a position to buy the things that they actually need. Yes, we could ell it at good prices today if they were in a position to buy. If we ould sell it and get back the cost of production and have any profit rom our labor we could keep in mind in my judgment that it would be worth while. One primary reason that we have suffered more in the ears preceding 1924 has been our inability to sell our corn and wheat : cost. While people in other countries have been hungry they could ot trade with us because they had nothing to pay us for what we ould have to sell them. Beef values in America, and Nebraska or all ver America have been regulated by that. America has the gold and today is holding more than the entire world supply. If we are ever oing to help Europe get back on her feet again we must put her in osition to buy our wheat and corn. The only way to do that is to per - mit them to manufacture goods and ship them over here in order that le men and women over there might go to work. Then they might ex - lange those commodities for the things of which we have a surplus, nd there is nothing of which America should have a greater surplus lan the products upon the farm. Everything on the farm today is (ringing a fair price except cattle. I am very sorry for the cattle men. lut there are two outstanding features that enter into the production of cattle, the first cost of the production of cattle, and second the low irice at which cattle are selling at the present time. You immediately ask me what is your remedy. I haven't any remedy to offer, and I am ot offering any. I think cattle men anywhere will agree with me that n the period of the previous high prices they went out and brought up leir herds to the production of the present and now they are operating not at a profit but at an actual loss. I am not going to take up your me, ladies and gentlemen, to discuss further conditions that you know perhaps as well if not better than I do. You know from actual ex - erience. Is I said agriculture affects finance to a much greater extent than finance affects agriculture. We are all interested in this subject, am not so much interested because I am a land owner or because I am elling farm produce but because everything is dependent on the state of agriculture. I am not so much interested from the fact that I am head f a banking institution or because I happen to be associated with those ependent entirely on the source of agriculture. Located as it is in the leart of the great agricultural section of the United States. But I am interested in the farms by reason of the fact that I am living here just like any number of my fellow citizens. So I say that the farmer and the business man regardless of where the farm may be located or where </seg>
            <seg id="p461">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 463 the business man may be located or in what business he may be engaged have problems to work out together and to become better understood, to reach a quicker understanding of each other and to help each other. We have them not only in Nebraska but they have them all over the west, and all over the United States. That condition presents itself to us in Nebraska to a certain extent applies to the rest of the world. I have found in my travels over the world that people are much the same no matter whether you are in France, Great Britain, Germany or else - where. There are problems to solve exactly as we have here, except some of them have the problems to a greater extent than we have ours. Now in closing, I want you to keep in mind that while the deposits in the bank are greater now than at any time for the last five years, while in business we can borrow money easier and at a less rate of interest provided you have the security to offer yet the processes of liquidation have been very severe and a large number living on the farm as well as those living in the city have complained a great deal of loss on land as we leave that period and come into a different period those who are actually interested not only from a dollar and cent standpoint, but from a humanitarian standpoint, ladies and gentlemen, should keep in mind the viewpoint in which you should approach these problems. BY THE TOAST MASTER: Mr. Head is another of our business men who has given very liberally his time and thought to the problems of agriculture and we recognize the force of what he has said, an eloquent manner in which he has presented his thoughts. Of course I have been somewhat disappointed because I expected him to offer a remedy for whatever ills agriculture has. I know that he has a remedy. I am just told that he has 42 millions of deposits in his bank. Now if he will just place that at our disposal wouldn't we be resting easy. Now we have two more numbers. You wouldn't want to miss the distinguished, not extinguished sons of Nebraska. I believe those who carry the name of this State to the four winds of the earth are those boys we have with us tonight. First we have a leader with us tonight and I want to present to you Bill Derrick and his undefeated judging team. BY MR. DERRICK: Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know that there is much left for me to tell, particularly if you have watched what the Daily Press has been saying regarding the judging team that represented Nebraska in the recent International Livestock Judging Contest. I will say that in a letter received from a friend out in Wyoming he says, "We are prouder than hell of that group." I was going to say some - thing about Nebraska's judging team. I am very proud to say some - thing about them. Really there is not much left for me to tell to the world but I do want to say something about the judging team of the </seg>
            <seg id="p462">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 464 Nebraska University, the state of Nebraska as to the International this last year. I don't think I have had an opportunity or pleasure of work - ing with a more diligent bunch of young men than I have worked with this year. The boys have been a great success in the one subject and in the one industry of agriculture and livestock. Considering those two things you will see I did not have much trouble in training this judging team. I will admit that when we left for Chicago we did not worry about the championship. We were going to o our best and let the championship take care of itself. But we did know that we had a good record behind us. This team had competed le year before at Denver when they were juniors in the College of griculture. Then they were good enough to compete with teams from ansas, Colorado and Wyoming in a very important competition. Then ley have gone to Peoria to the National Swine Show and been judging in competition with some teams representing some of the greatest schools in the United States. They have met teams in competition from owa, Kentucky, Ohio and other corn belt states. Then later on we representing the great agricultural colleges of the United States and here they were good enough to capture second place. I was very much contented with that. In fact I instructed the boys before we went that they could do that well, that was just exactly what I wanted them to o. You may say that you were foolish to say anything like that. But remembered what had happened there before. Teams that had won second there had usually gone to Chicago and won first. I didn't want tern to get first there. I was afraid I would have to knock them around little bit in order to tame them down, so I had my thumb on them when we went to Chicago and when we finished we had a lead of 150 points defeating 23 other teams representing schools of the United States and Canada that were competing at Chicago that is a great contest. Every man goes into it under a strain never experienced in any other line of work. He is there for one purpose, not for in - dividual honors and credit for himself, but he is there to win honor and credit for the school he represents, and for the state that is supporting the school. It was with that spirit that these boys went into the Chicago contest and won. It really gives me a great deal of pleasure to present these boys to you for they are the boys who are going to have to replace the active men who drop out of agriculture. In fact all of these boys are returning to the farm with one exception. He is going into business with his father and brother. They are going to continue in agricultural work, livestock work and they will all make a mark for themselves later on. Professor Derrick then presented the boys of the team: Messrs. Hugh McLaughlin, son of our new Secretary of Agri - culture, of Doniphan. Mi. Heperly of Norfolk, the third </seg>

BY TO ASTM ASTER McKELVIE: Ladies and gentlemen, I sub - mit that our University has not gone entirely to sport and even though we may lose a football game or two when it comes to making a show - ing like that then we have something we can be proud of and a record of such a bunch of young men as that is something to take note of. We would also like to take note tonight that there is one representative here who was in the Boys and Girls Club Contest. He is from Seward county. (Mr. Wilson then introduced Mr. Arthur Everspecher one of the contestants and winners in the Boys and Girls Club Contest.) BY THE TOAST MASTER: We should not overlook those boys and girls. I think the most important work that is being carried on today in the state is the Boys and Girls Club Work. I am very glad in closing our program that I can present to you a man who has rendered specially notable service not only in agriculture and not only in his own state but to education in general. I am now going to introduce Dean Davenport of the College of Agriculture of Illinois. BY DEAN DAVENPORT: Mr. Toast Master, Ladies and Gentle - men. It is my pleasure to greet you from Illinois. I can say heartily that I am glad to be with you in the middle-west. I think it is a section where the people know more about the United States than in any other part of this great country of ours. It reminds me of a story of a young couple who were at Illinois for some time, and these young people were married and went East. Three or four years ago they were living in a small city in New York. I knew them pretty well and I know that they spent a lot of their time talking much about Illinois. In that town there was a little college, a real little school, awfully little, in fact a young lady told me that it had one hundred and twenty-five students with a possibility of one more. They hadn't heard of Illinois down there. I think some of them had heard about Chicago and no one around there would know much about it, in fact they wouldn't be sure whether it was a stock yards, a barn yard or just what it was and as to Nebraska they wouldn't have known it from any other western state. It chanced at that time that Nebraska had sent </seg>
            <seg id="p464">466 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE a football team down to Syracuse which was about 40 miles away. This young college couple attended the game and rooted for that school. I don't know just what spirit had gotten them whether they had talk - ed to Dean Burnett here or some other scholar but anyhow in some way they got the Nebraska yell and they went right up there rooting for Nebraska all the time. They didn't quite win the game but they let them know that there were some rooters there from the west. Now Mr. Toast Master got me kind of flabergasted tonight it seems to be McLaughlin, McKelvie Me this and that. We ought to have a Me Adam but when this young man began talking about the judging teams I began to know it wouldn't all be Mc's. Well it kind of reminded me about a story about Thomas — a young offshoot who went back to Scotland after he had been over here a long time and interviewed Thomas the old family servant and he noticed that Thomas was not wearing the caps that he had always seen him wear. He wanted to know what had happened, "Was it an accident?" Thomas said, "An accident, no it wasn't an accident." It was this way. He had had a cap that fit down so tight over his head that when he had been offered a drink he did not hear and since then he had not worn the cap. There was a Scotchman who wanted to go up in a flying machine. But the pilot wanted so much for the trip that the Scotchman could not pay it and finally the pilot said that he would make it this way, if the Scotchman and his wife would not utter a single remark during the trip he would make it to him free, if they did the price would be double. So while he was up he thought he had them pretty well cornered. So he turned a flip-flop and the nose dive and about everything else that he could think of. Finally he thought they had- enough and he landed; when he got down he says, "Andy you won, you never said a word." Andy said, "Yes alright but it was pretty hard to keep from speaking when the wife fell out. / Speaking of your University, I picked up an Omaha Bee I don't Kow what kind of a bee that is, a honey bee or a bumble bee. it it said in there that someone in the state of Nebraska was go - ing to cut down the appropriations for the University in a large sum of dollars. Now I do not believe that the state of Nebraska has gone bankrupt. I never heard anything about it. But unless it had certainly ; is not going to do anything of that kind. We have now reached a &gt;oint where we cannot do anything like that. I never heard any talk bout any such thing as that. I want to say that I have known Dwight )albey for about 50 years. I know that the governor here has picked ut some big men. As I say I have known Dwight Dalby for about 50 years and he is all right. I can tell from looking at your man Mc - .aughlin that he is all right. Now any talk about cutting the University ppropriations will never do. If you do that it will be the first time it has ever happened in all of the 48 states in fifty years. You could not </seg>
            <seg id="p465">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 467 and would not think of going- on record as doing any such thing as that. I remember Mr. Markam when he was made president of the Illinois Central Railroad went out on the line to study conditions. Mr. Markham went right along the line and he didn't put on airs. That is a peculiar railroad, on the west end it is agricultural and on the south end it passes through a mineral and very poor agricultural territory. When he got down there he met an old friend who was telling about an old negro who has been renting and working a crop on shares. He was just ready to go and settle up with Negro Jim. Negro had never done business of that kind and this figured up to about $800.00. He remarked, "$800.00, that will never do to let Negro Jim have as much as $800.00." And the other man said, "Why yes that's right, half of that would be $400.00." So the counter got it figured out and he says $400.00, now half of that is $200.00 and that will never do. I am not going to let him have $200, so he got all of the money in silver dollars and sent for Negro Jim and gave him the money all in silver dollars amounting to $200.00. Then he says, "Jim we have done sold all of your share and you get half of that and that is all of this money." Negro Jim says "What, all of this money is mine?" And the counter says, "Well no, half of it is yours." Now that may be the way they do in the South to hold the darkies down. But that isn't truly representative of the attitude of business toward the farmer in this section of the country. It will never do for the fanner to separate himself from the general bunch or allow anybody else to separate him. To do that would just be to create a lot of peasantry if it was that way. I want to say that the American farmer cannot permit himself to be separated but he must discuss all kinds of business matters with all kinds of people. I remember one time in Illinois at the University we were discussing a feeling that had arisen among the farmers against the railroads. There was turmoil of situation arose and President Markham went down and asked all the farmers to come in and bring their troubles in their old kit bag then asked the railroad people to come in also and everybody would put up their grievances and they would discuss it. Then the railroad people told their grievances to the farmers. Then the farmers told theirs. The railroad people put up that in Southern Illinois about every orchard that got beyond the bearing stage would somehow get afire from the railroad. Of course that would not happen in Nebraska, Then the farmers told their grievances to the railroad. They had some very good cases to fight and when they all got through everybody thought that they each understood the other a little bit better. Now every business that amounts to a hill of beans watches its turnover. Now agriculture is not a year by year business. It never has had such a speedy turn-over as some other lines of business especially merchandise. A farmer can't make a quick turn-over, he may have a pretty good crop one year and not so good another- He will </seg>
            <seg id="p466">468 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE run short one year and then he has a pretty good business the next but he must run through a long period of years. Now about the farmer, he must take his average for a long time. He isn't going to get roped on just what he does on the farm. I don't know as I have ever known a farmer to get his stuff on the farm without the use of desirable business methods or no doubt that wouldn't happen in Nebraska that we would be caught up without using such methods but I know it did happen other places. Anyway that is not going to happen here. Of course one mistake we all made, the banks, the newspaper, the merchandise people, the farmers and all of us when we were in trouble we had to whistle about it. When we had things coming nice then we ran wild about getting into debt and sometimes think if the bankers had simply told us that we had gone far enough and could not have anything more, that if we kept on at such a pace that we were going to wreck the banks and ourselves that it would have been better for us. But when the depress - ion period came we stood it ascertained in Union there is strength so we get together and work out the problems together. I know some good bankers and I know some awfully poor bankers. The bankers feel the same way. They know some good farmers and some awfully poor farmers. Each one feels that the other conducts his business better and if he was in the other business he could do it better. Both the farmer and the banker succeeds best when they understand each other in uni - form and stable conditions and not in a period of invasion or depression either but when things are about as even as possible and everything is at a moderate and not a speculative price. So the two classes of people can well afford to get together and stand together. (Mr. F. D. Tomson of Lincoln was called upon for a few closing re - marks, wherein he paid a tribute to Dean Davenport's remarks.) </seg>
            <seg id="p467">Nebraska Home Economics Association OFFICERS Mrs. C. B. Noyes, Waterloo, President; Mrs. Carl W. Jones, Sec'y Report of the Home Economics Section of Organized Agriculture January 6, 7, 8, 1925 The twentieth annual meeting of the Home Economics Section of Organized Agriculture, (formerly known as the Home Economics Asso - ciation, opened Tuesday morning, January 6th. Mrs. Carrie B. Ray - mond, Director of Music at the State University, was in charge of the music for the meetings. In her "Greetings", Mrs. C. B. Noyes, president of the organization used as her theme the leading thought of the program, "Making the Most of the Farm Home". "To do this means,' 'she said, "That one must love this home with a devotion which brings to it the best of everything. It necessitates a love of nature, a love of strength that comes to the little ones from open air. The ultimate product of the home are citizens and that they may be of very best help is necessary and just such meetings as these provide a great deal of assistance." Miss Margaret Fedde, Chairman of the Home Economics Depart - ment, followed with a few remarks which emphasized the responsibility of the home makers. She commented on the growth of the meetings in the past twenty years, due of course to the cooperation of the home makers and the college faculty. She emphasized that each of these groups was mutually inspiring and helpful to the other. She closed with the quotation, "He who makes the home makes the world." Mrs. Lawrence Lindgren discussed the subject assigned by the pro - gram committe to Miss Bradt, "Furnishing the Home". She warned against the danger of making purchases without regard to the finished product as a whole. The necessity of developing a concept of the whole house as well as each room was explained. Color schemes, furnishings, backgrounds, drapes and curtains were discussed and illus - trated. The discussion of color and the placing of furniture was left largely to Extension circulars 1157 and 1158 which were distributed. The importance of elimination and "not blocking traffic with acces - sories" was emphasized. Ornaments decrease in value as their num - ber increase. </seg>
            <seg id="p468">470 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE "The place of Music in the Home" was the subject of Miss Fannie R. Buchanan's first discussion. As an educational director of the vic - tor Company of Camden, N. J., she had much of value to give and was prepared to illustrate and emphasize her points with the use of excellent records and a reproducing machine. She brought out the facts that music was artistically stimulating and spiritually inspiring, also that its subtle physical effect and moral influence was well known. This quotation from Theodore Roosevelt was given, "Let the love of art, sculpture, beautiful architecture and above all music, enter into and make a part of your life". Suggestions of music suitable for var - ious ages, sex, and occasions are given on an attached bulletin. In the demonstration "Can We Appeal to the Appetite of a Con - valescent Child", Mrs. George Endres and Mrs. R. J. Phelps of Johnson county proved that there were many ways by which we could reach this desired end. Tuesday Afternoon A nominating committee was appointed consisting of Miss Mary- Ellen Brown, Mrs. Snocker of ScottsblufF county and Mrs. Donahue of Clay county. The resolution committee included Mrs. Endres of John - son county, Mrs. Yates of Hall county and Florence Atwood, Lincoln. In her discussion of "A Nation's Measure of a Home", Miss Bess M. Rowe, Field Editor of the FARMER'S WIFE, brought out the im - portance of good homes to the nation, .giving President Coolidge's words, "Look well to the hearthstone, there lies the hope of the nation". She pointed out that home was very conservative in changing conditions and its responsibility was to adapt itself. The nation considers a home successful to the degree that it turns out good citizens. They must have strong bodies, mental alertness, economic competence, social con - sciousness, and spiritual development. All these requisites can be provided by the home. Methods of leading stimulating community singing were demon - strated by Miss Buchanan for a short period. Ivan D. Wood of the Nebraska Extension Service gave some inter - esting information concerning the "Planning of the Farmstead". A well planned home he rated invaluable and gave women credit for being of assistance in this planning. The chief aim of any farmstead is to save steps. "The Developing of the Farmstead" was further elaborated by C. H. Diggs of Ames, la. Landscape gardening was credited with being slipshod in many cases and wind breaks being allowed to become unsightly. Some time and money should be spent on desirable trees. Unused machinery left lying around is unsightly. The landscape set - ting can be made somewhat practical. Plantings should be considered </seg>

A plan can be worked out with pencil, paper and thought though hard to make fool proof. He warned against trouble making tramp nursery men, and urged dealing only with reliable parties. He recommended the making of a definite plan and adhering to it. Wednesday Forenoon The first half of the morning session was given over to the reports on community activities by the Farm Bureau Delegates. These re - ports were limited to three minutes each. The following delegates responded : Cass — Miss Jessie Baldwin, Weeping Water. Clay — Mrs. E. E. Fry and Mrs. J. J. Donahue Colfax — Mrs. Henry Jonas, Schuyler. Custer — Mrs. George Dewey, Ansley.

Selection of music for the home is of course the mother's responsibility. She must remember that the hearing musician must be as carefully trained as the creative and performing musician. Lullabies are a child's heritage. Doing things to music has a great attraction and rythmic value. Many games develop from </seg>
            <seg id="p470">472 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE E However, sometimes children should be given music to which may just quietly listen. This might have to be motivated by ning for a story. I Miss Roberta Spain of the University of Nebraska gave a splen - discussion of "Stories and Handwork of the Pre-school Child in the le". She made the point that the occupied child is a happy child, ef ore a good child. This child enjoys things that bring noise and &gt;n and development. Blocks for building appeal to constructive it of the older child. A blackboard can be made from an old win - blind and drawing appeals greatly. Paper sack dolls colored with ola are inexpensive and enjoyable. This age includes the imita - age so children enjoy doing as father or mother does. Crayolas paints are popular. Calcimine paints do not soil clothing. Scis - should be blunt type and the child should be taught how to use, to carry and what he can and can not cut- Stories are for the quiet times in a child's life, before nap or bed - time. At this a,ge they are interested in lyrics or those with a great deal of repetition. Stories that concern things he knows about are of the most interest. Best literature is that built around old Mother Goose Rhymes. A story in pictures is loved by these tots. First books should be linen books, not easily torn. No child should be al - lowed to handle a books roughly. tThis noon a box luncheon was held in room 213, Home Economics ding, with Mrs. D. A. Benson of Silver Creek and Mrs. C. A. Cum - js of Tecumseh, presiding. Wednesday Afternoon Professor F. M. Gregg of the Nebraska Wesleyan University dis - cussed "The Adolescent in the Home". He sighted instances of youth gone wrong which are problems in psychology. The adolescent in - cludes those between 14 and 24 years of age. Their behavior is the sum of inherited qualities, habits, contacts, and acquired impressions. Between the twelfth and fifteenth year growth is very rapid and great changes are going on tho the adolescent should not be made conscious of it. The closing address of the afternoon "Understanding the Child's Inheritance" was given by Miss Alma Binzel of Milwaukee. A summarization of this is as follow: 1. Children are all born to be somewhat alike. 2. No two children, except identical twins, are exactly alike. 3. The common likenesses are such as: general bodily structure, its needs and functions; general emotional tendencies and mental activities, their natures and functions. </seg>
            <seg id="p471">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 473 4. The differences are such as: size, weight, coloring, proportions of body; stronger feelings of one kind or another; marked ability in some mental capacities and marked disability in others. 5. The unborn child cannot be marked for good or ill by parental, especially maternal influence. 6. Parental influence affects the child soon after birth and is ex - tremely important during the first years of life. 7. The likenesses properly invested bring returns that should char- acterize all citizens of a democracy; physical health and inde - pendence; courteous and just habits of speech and action; in dustry, initiative. 8. The differences should be invested so as to develop the special talent of each individual as a basis of his life work and of the recreation of his leisure hours. Thurday Forenoon The program was opened by Miss Buchanan who discussed ways and means of making the home concert popular. Some music has a story back of it, knowing this will help to hold interest. Descriptive pieces or ballads are popular with the growing girl. A solo instru - ment is inspirational to a child's own performance. listening for "in - side voices" is another help. A growing boy likes a rythmic piece while young people favor romance music and serenades. Study the audience and adapt the program to it. Miss Mary Borreson of the Extension Service had charge of the next number, "The more 4-H Clubs the More Better Farm Homes". Four ex-club young men and women now in the University gave a dis - cussion of club work and what it had meant for them. Mr. Robert Bushnell spoke of the inspiration it gave, Miss Leona Davis of the history of the work, Miss Lois Jackman spoke of the opportunity of a local leader to develop better home makers and farmers. Mr. Peter Pratt emphasized the importance of the finishing up of the work and Achievement Days. Miss Borreson gave the concluding summary with an appeal for more local leadership. "Pictures to Live With" was ably discussed by Miss Edna Benson of the Home Economics faculty. Such pictures she said are inspira - tional, give pleasure, suggest association, have literary significance or convey a religious idea. Fundamental lines of a picture were explain - ed, also the framing, hanging and arranging of them. A discussion of what made a picture good or poor helped those present to classify a number which was shown them for the purpose. "Bare walk", she said, "are better than poor pictures." </seg>
            <seg id="p472">474 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE A summary of the next lecture, "Habit Formation in Relation to Rewards and Punishments" by Miss Binzel is as follows: 1. 2. Behavior patterns are either inherited or learned. For both kinds bonds are established between situations and responses through the nervous system. 3. Children's nervous systems vary in case and quickness of establishing such bonds. 4. They vary also in the strength, hence length of the time the bonds will be held. 5. When the bonds are well established so that the response comes readily, the habit may be said to be formed or learned. 6. The way of learning is chiefly by trial and error or fumble, and success in the satisfaction of desires felt by the child. This learning or habit forming takes place in environments made up of family, school and neighborhood groups - life. 7. 8, The examples — healthy and unhealthy, fine or crude — set within these groups are copy which influence the child's learn - ing. 9. Learning takes place according to laws, the chief ones of which are: (a) The child's neur-muscular system must be ready for the new bonds that will make the desired habit. (b) Repetition strengthens, whereas lack of it weakens the connections that underlie the new way of doing, fooling, thinking. (c) Repetition that brings satisfaction (rewards) leads the child to continue the exercise; repetition that brings no satisfaction or brings an annoyance (punishment) leads him to stop the exercise. 10. The trend today is the education of children into good habits is away from annoyances (punishments) to satisfactions (hot necessarily to the artificial reward) kind. Mrs. C. B. Noyes, Waterloo, President. Mr. E. P. Wilson, State Representative, of Dawes county gave a short explanation of the Child Labor Law and its meaning to Nebraska. He felt that the antagonism toward it was not without some grounds. </seg>
            <seg id="p473">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 475 Friday Afternoon Miss Binzel's last message, "Democracy's Obligation to Parent - hood" was given at this time, the summary of which talk is as follows: 1. Democracy's need is for worthwhile citizens who satisfy their own desires in ways that are wholesome for the individual and his various groups. 2. The fundamental ways-habits of satisfying desires are formed during the early years. The habits of these early years are formed under the guidance of parents whose intentions are usually good but whose methods are sometimes mistaken. 3. In consequence there is more unhappiness, illness, inefficiency and delinquency among children and young people than is necessary. 4. Some of these bad results are today being corrected by pre - school, habit child guidance clinics. 5. 6. In such clinics parents are taught what they should have done to prevent and what may still be done to correct the results of their mistakes. 7, Such delayed instruction is costly to child, parents and Democracy. 8 Democracy must offer them its schools, the education that will prevent mistakes. 9 Only when it does so can Democracy expect increases in happi - ness, health, efficiency and law-abidingness from its oncoming' citizens. Democracy owes to parents education for their important work before it holds them responsible for the product of the home: fine children. 10. </seg>

The courtesy committee submitted the following: "Inasmuch as the Twentieth Annual meeting of the Nebraska Home Economics Association has been such a joy and inspiration, we wish to assure our loyalty to the efficient officers who have shouldered the responsibilities of the Association and provided for us this helpful program. We are most grateful to the competent speakers and musicians who have been so liberal with their time and talent; to the State Board of Agriculture who have been so generous in financing our Association; to the College of Agriculture which has made possible for us a comfortable and home like meeting place ;_ to the Chamber of Commerce of Lincoln who have opened their doors to welcome us; to the women of Lincoln who have made us feel as one of them and for the cordial friendship which has prevailed thruout the entire session. Submitted by the courtesy committee: Mrs. C. L. Witte, Mrs. W. L. Yates, Miss Florence J. Atwood. The chairman of the nominating committee made the following recommendations for officers for the ensuing year: Mrs. C. B. Noyes, Waterloo, President. Mrs. A. L. Brandhorst, Milford, Vice-president. Mrs. Carl W. Jones, Lincoln, Secretary-Treasurei-. Cition was made and seconded that the recommendations of the minating committee be accepted. Motion carried. Following the business session, Mrs. Herbert Brownell of Lincoln gave a very inspirational talk on "The Spirit of the Home". She be - lieves that better homes in the physical sense have been over estimated, that better homes can be produced by better spiritual life. Good homes are achievements, not accidents and are brought about by sacrifice and effort. Five attributes that greatly affect the spirit of the home are confidence, kindness, cooperation, truthfulness and companionship. Religion, no particular brand, is to the spiritual life as a heating plant is to a house. In closing Mrs. Noyes gave a short inspirational talk using as her theme, "As the twig is bent". The total registration was announced as 360. Mrs. Carl W. Jones, Lincoln Secretary. </seg>

The only thing I will bring out at this time is that point which is always coming up in regard to the Agricultural Extension Service, as to whether we are doing the work of a nurseryman or of the landscape architect, or giving the public a service it wants. I should like to have you ask questions in that regard so that you will become familiar with what we are doing in Iowa, and know we are having hearty co-operation over there among the nurserymen and landscape architects and the public. We have four projects to which we are trying to give consideration. We feel the most important project — the one to which we are giving maj - or attention — is farmstead development. If time would permit. I think you would find it interesting if I would outline how we handle that pro - ject and how it is being received by the farming interests in the state. Our second project is state parks. It may seem strange we should handle that as an extension project. If you stop to analyze the situa - tion, you will find the state park problem in every state is one of the finest opportunities to teach people to keep those things Nature has giv - en us — a matter of conservation. All that is necessary is to educate the people along right lines in that regard. We have 28,000 acres in state parks is Iowa, and there is considerable work for the landscape architects in that connection. People interested in state park projects become in - terested in improving their home grounds. They realize things do grow if given a little attention, and so they become enthusiasts along that line ******* Our third project is the consolidated school grounds. That gives an opportunity to meet our future land owners. That has proved to be a very interesting project, handled entirely differently from the other two. Our fourth project is civic improvement. The idea is the essential </seg>
            <seg id="p481">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 483 thing in developing civic pride through the civic organizations. That of course is done through various channels: garden clubs, garden contests, through Rotary and Lions' clubs, chambers of commerce, and other or - ganizations of that sort. All this work is handled through the county agent to centralize the thing so that proper credit is given where this work originates. Later on I shall be glad to discuss this more in detail. I will outline our farmstead development project in Iowa. That work is handled through the county agent, the extension agent in Landscape work spending three days in a county. The various people who have asked for this service have been listed, and he gives considerable consid - erating to distributing these different demonstrations over the county so that they will not all be in one place. We can make eight or ten visits a day during the daytime. At those places from six to thirty people are generally present. After looking over that particular farm, we deter - mine what the greatest need is, whether the planting of shrubs and trees, or the setting out a wind break or something else, and give information along tthat line, and of course answer questions that might come up. The idea is not to give too much information at one time, but to return to that place, or have the county agent keep track by follow-up methods to see that directions are being carried out. If a new farm is to be developed, we prepare plans. Those plans we are anxious to see followed in every detail — the general landscape plan and the planting plan. We do not mean we expect that farm to be developed the follow - ing year. If a few trees are to be planted, or a granary built, it goes up according to the plan. If the farmer wants to make some change, it is suggested that he write in to our office about the particular change he wants to make. Discussion. Of course in the evening we give lectures before the Farm Bureau or what ever club may be available at that time. Q. I do not want to get over on something too foreign. You have the public parks run along that line ? A. The state parks. Q. Have you a fund and a plan for developing the natural places — the watering places and parks that should be taken care of in a prairie state — even to spend some money to fix them up? A. Every state has natural park areas that should be preserved. The way to start is by a lot of publicity in the newspapers. Call people's attention to it. Look at the work of the Izaak Walton League. If you are not a member, find out and become a member, because some day yon will be glad you are connected with a good thing like that. By having </seg>
            <seg id="p482">484 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE propaganda started and getting people of Iowa interested, it went ahead without any trouble. The local community first interests the Board of Conservation to look over its proposition. The board generally enters into a fifty-fifty arrangement whereby the state furnishes one-half the funds by spot cash, and the local community furnishes the other half as it can collect it. The development of a state park is the difficulty we have just now. People have the idea that we want landscape architects to start new parks. Our idea is the conservation of what we have, not development of new parks. If you turn people loose they will cut down a live tree and do a lot of other vandalistic things. The idea is to control that situation, to preserve our parks for the next generation as well as for this. It has worked out very well. Q. ''Your law is such you have power to get the money ? A. Yes; $100,000 a year in the State of Iowa. Q. To be used in any way they think best — in the development or preserving of ponds, etc.? A. Yes, sir; that has been done on this fifty-fifty basis. Remember one-half that amount must go for maintenance of these parks — having a custodian in charge, and necessary roads and bridges and camp sites. Q. When the state takes this over, from then on there must be a caretaker? Is that true of any sized area? . They have an honary custodian in charge — a nature enthusiast who will act without pay where the area would be too small to hire a man all the time. Q. We think we have no suitable places for parks in Nebraska. That is the way we look at it. But we have some places that could be made beautiful. If we would spend the money we would have some of the nicest watering places you ever saw in the Platte and Elhorn and the Niobrara valleys, and the same thing in other river valleys. Here they «an take an old bayou and put a little dyke around it It is fed from be - low, and the water would become perfectly clear. We are going to have lots better water than we dreamed we could have. All we have to do is to take the mud out. The Platte valley has sand pits covering a great many acres of ground. A. I hope you people when you get into this thing will come over to Iowa and take the benefit of our mistakes. Naturally you do make mis - takes in starting a thing of this sort. At Eldora they put a dam across a creek and made a beautiful little lake in a valley. They bought a strip of </seg>
            <seg id="p483">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 485 land around this lake for park purposes. Some local man saw the possi - bility and laid out the land privately owned into cottage sites, so the state furnished the front door to those cottages. In another place we profited by that mistake. We are laying out the cottages according to a definite landscape plan; so it will not happen the second time. Q. You really need quite a number of acres. On the Elkhorn, for in - stance, it would cost some money for dredging. I remember forty years ago when the water was clear. The soil has washed in and it has appar - ently filled up, and that slit would make the water riley. We find it can be dredged out and the water will come back clear. A. We have been able to take care of this problem without buying the land by along-time agreement with the owner who keeps the ground seeded down. The thing to dor is to get people interested along this line so you do not have to put laws on your books. People are interested enough to observe regulations. Park regulations are not laws. They are rules that are adhered to. "THE USE AND ARRANGEMENT OF FLOWERS IN THE HOME" (Demonstration) Miss Edna Benson, Agricultural College, Lincoln I hope you are interested in flowers. Perhaps you are not quite as enthusiastic as Mohammed was. You probably remember that he said: "If I had two loaves of bread, I would sell one and buy hyacinths to feed my hungry soul." Most of us do not have to sell our next-to-the-last loaf of bread in order to get flowers. They are plentiful, and many times may be had for the mere trouble of plucking. These are not quite that kind because this is not the right season to pluck flowers, but they are the best we could get for this demonstration at this time. The chief interest in flowers, arranged in vases, may come in either one of two ways: either the interest may be chifly in the line or form of the flower, or it may be in the brilliancy and lovely color; and the way you arrange the flowers and the receptacle you choose to place them in will depend, to a great extent, on which one of these points of interest you wish to stress. I have made two or three sketches illustrating different types of flower arrangement, because I could not demonstrate all "kinds in the short time I had. The first one is a lily stalk with several flowers growing on a single </seg>
            <seg id="p484">486 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE stem. I put it in a straight-sided vase that will preserve the natural character of the growth of that flower. The next one is an enlarged copy of sketch I made from an arrange - ment of pussy-willows made by a little Japanese woman with whom I had some work in flower arrangement in New York City. The tall slender stems are pussy willows, and the tiny flowers are jonquils to give a bril - liant note of color at the base. The result was very charming-. It took her about an hour and a quarter to make that arrangement. I shall at - tempt to make three in thirty minutes! I am sure you recognize in the next chart an arrangement that is poor in proportion. The flowers should always dominate the receptacle in which they are placed. Here the proportion is almost half and half. I have massed' them down close in this vase, which is a poor way. Then too, the horizonal dimension is too nearly that of the vertical. The next chart shows the same flowers pulled out loosely so that they more close - ly (Conform to their natural line of growth, and the receptacle is well proportioned and better adapted to the flowers. In this sketch I have attempted to show how flowers may be placed in such a way that they become an integral part of the furnishings in the home. I have a little table with a picture or mirror above it. If a mirror, it could be placed a little lower so that the flowers would be re - flected in the mirror,. If a picture, the flowers may well come just to the edge of the picture. You often wish to place flowers on the idining table. In this case you do not want them too large, — a huge mass that will make the people on the opposite sides of the table begin to play peek-a-boo with each other in order to converse, — an arrangement that is not too high is desirable. I have chosen jonquils for this demonstration. I do not want too many. The natural growth is straight up and simple. Then I will put with them for variety some of these white flowers — fresias. In combining flowers, or combining foliage with flowers, take into ac - count the general character of the flower with which you are dealing. The jonquil is a delicate, fragile appearing flower, so I will combine it with these which are also delicate and fragile. I will let some of them come up into the cluster of jonquils to carry the color on through the center. I have a flower holder into which I am sticking the stems. It is eas - ier to arrange a few flowers well if you have such a holder. I think where many people err is that they try to put too many flowers into the same vase. (It is very much easier to arrange these when no one is looking.) </seg>
            <seg id="p485">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 487 I can spread them by coaxing the stems. Sometimes it is necessary to bruise them a tiny bit with a knife in order to make them take the line you want. That is particularly true of woody stems like the pussy willow. I want to keep an uneven contour having some of the stems longer than others. Now we have a suitable arrangement for a table. Notice I chose a grey vase which has a little blue at the top. The leaves of the jonquil are a bluish-green and harmonize with that vase. When you are buying a vase, think about the use to which it will be put If you are not going to have a great many, do not buy one "which can, be used for only a few things like this purple one, but buy one which com - bines soft greens that -will harmonize with the foliage of most plants, or with a little bluish green. For the next arrangement I have chosen a black vase. It is a neutral color and, when you see what I am going to put into it, I think you will agree that we should be able to make an effective bouquet. The flowers I have here are calendulas, a variety of marigold. I will choose the long er ones for the center. Again I have a flower holder with large holes |in it, (when you buy a flower holder, get one with big holes.) In this case it is well to emphasize this loose, natural growth, preserving the natural line of the flower and not attempting to make an artificial arrangement such as there is in the combination of the pussy willows and jonquils^ I want to have some tall ones at the edges that will droop over the side. If you are putting flowers in a vase that is opaque, the leaves that come below the edge within the vase should be trimmed off, for the reas - on that they decay and cause the flowers to wither more rapidly as the water is polluted. When putting them in a glass vase where the leaves are a part of the arrangement, Ido not take off too much foliage. Now I want to show what can be done with a very few flowers. Here I have four roses. I want to use these in a simple group. Roses may* be used in several ways. One rose in a bud vase make an effective ar - rangement. Its beauty lies in in the color and line. Or you may use two or three. But you may also use roses in a mass as they are often used for the decoration of stages and churches. I am putting these four roses in a black vase, using a flower holder to keep them in place. I should have preferred a green one. The arrangement is simple, yet it shows the flowers off very well. When you get flowers at a florists he will usually give you some fern leaves. You are immediately tempted to do this. (Put ferns in with roses.) I am sure you agree with me that that there is an entire lack of harmony between the delicate line of the rose and the coarse type of this foliage. Now I am going to try to make an arrangement of this bittersweet. </seg>
            <seg id="p486">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 488 I have chosen a soft, grey-green vase which will be in sharp contrast to the orange of the bitter-sweet. These are complementary colors and are effective together. When you pick bitter-sweet, allow some of the leaves to remain on as they add attractiveness. I want an uneven line — a rag - ged line — some taller than the others. You might like to arrange bit - ter-sweet so that it would trail down over the edge of the mantle. In this case I have an upright arrangement. In order to make the stems more flexible the shoots were placed in water. If your material for a winter bouquet that has become hard and dry, put it in warm, water for ten minutes. It will freshen up wonderfully and you will be able to make a much better arrangement. I will take green tissue paper to wrap around these stems so they will fit closely in the neck of the vase. I often use wrapping paper when the top of the vase will not show. I am sure that you will agree that the orange of these berries is lovely with the grey-green of this vase. I am trying as much as possible to preserve the natural growth of the £ inches of berries. I am trying also to bring out the contrast in or between the berries and the vase. Ordinarily the aim in arrangement is to preserve the natural line of Ewth of the flower, except in the case of such flowers as violets and let peas, where the interest lies mainly in the mass of color. In se - ing a vase, choose one that has good line, beauty of form, and is suit - able to the arrangement you desire to produce. A low type of vase will serve as a foundation from which the sprays may spring. In this case a flower holder is very essential. The taller vases will preserve the natural line of growth of such flowers as lilies, iris or delphinium. Discussion. Q. Can Bitter-sweet be used as a centerpiece in decorating a table ? A. Yes, if the trailing type of shoots are used. I am not sure I would use bitter-sweet for a table decoration. If you can find some - thing else that is not so stiff, you will have a better table decoration. I thank you. THE CHAIRMAN— Next we will hear from Mr. Sass. Mr. Sass is a farmer living in Douglas County, but his hobby is the growing of flowers and perennials. That is his play. He will tell you some of his experiences in growing the iris. "GROWING AND DEVELOPING THE ISIS" Mr. Jacob Sass, Bennington, Nebraska. When you talk about iris, people say, "There isn't much to that flow- </seg>
            <seg id="p487">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 489 er." That was true years ago, but not so today. Among the different varieties are some of the finest flowers you nave ever seen. These new kinds are just as fine as an orchid, and they are fragrant, too. You can transplant the iris at any time of the year as long as the ground is not frozen. I prefer spring planting because they are in better shape for next year. The seedlings however, should be transplanted early in July. If you do, you will have a perfect flower stem. You tan transplant later, but the flower stem will be shorter. They should be covered for winter. Thawing and freezing will force the sap through the iris and the flower stem will freeze. That causes rot and your plants will not all die. Two or three inches of straw or other litter will insure against such injury. The iris is divided into two classes: the beardless, "Apagon," and the bearded, "Pogon" iris. Among the Apagon irises we have a good many species and groups. For instance, the Siberian blooms on a stem three feet high. The color ranges from pale blue to dark purple. They are very hardy. Of these we have more than five different varieties. They are very distinct, al - though I have not been able to grow the yellows ones. The iris spuria blooms on a stem three to four feet high. Other var - ieties are creamy white, with a yellow blotch in the fall. Monspure and Lord Wolsey are blue purple. These are also very hardy. Iris Missour - ianisis is about twenty inches high. The flowers are pale blue. It grows wild from Arizona to Montana and in the Rocky Mountains. The Japanese irises are the largest and finest of the beardless. They grow on stems thirty-six to forty inches high. The flowers are held hor - izontally, and are from four to six inches across, in all colors — light and dark blue, purple, and white with a yellow blotch. They like plenty of water in blooming time and do best in half shade. Iris Pseudecorus and Versicolor are the wild water irises and grow in water. The first named is yellow, and Versicolor is a purple bi-color. They grow without water and bloom in any garden. There are many species of white iris, but we have only a few in our garden. The Boulbous Iris are used for forcing only. Iris Onclocyclus and Eegelias are difficult to handle. They must have a warm place to grow and be kept dry from July to September. The Pogan or bearded iris do a little better here. They may be left in the ground, and they bloom from year to year. These are very fine. Tarvar is almost black. The flower stem is from nine to twelve inches high. </seg>
            <seg id="p488">490 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The tall bearded or German iris is divided into three groups: Pumil - as, or early; intermediate, and late, or tall bearded. The Iris Pumila are the first to bloom in the spring. The flower stem is from two to fourteen inches high. There are all colors — white, yellow, light and dark blue purple, and blackish red purple. They bloom for about three weeks. The intermediate irises are hybrids of the Pumilas. The tall bearded variety also are of all colors — white, light and dark yellow, light and dark purple, royal purple, and blackish red purple. The flower stem is from fifteen to thirty inches high. It seems that there are not many growers producing these intermediates. We have about a thousand of them. The tall or late flowering kinds are the last to bloom and are the most advertised. There are all colors to be found in this iris. The Autumn King is a fall blooming iris which we originated about 5 years ago. It bloomed in 1920 the first time with one stem; the second year it had six stems; the third year, sixteen; the fourth year, forty-five; and in 1924 it had over one hundred flowering stems. The color is dark blue purple. The flowers are large and fine. We have sent it to eighi or ten other growers, and from five we received letters last fall that Au - tumn King was in bloom. It is a good seed bearer and we have quite a lot of seedlings. Of these, fifteen bloomed last fall, and now we have an assortment of more colors, among them, a white one. If this proves to be a real bloomer, then it is a nice companion to Autumn King. In growing seed is where the fun starts. We have been growing seedling iris for seventeen years, and have grown something like forty thousand seedlings. We use only hand-pollinated seed, except if we have a very rare one which will not respond to hand-pollinating. Of this we keep a careful record. If some do not produce good enough flowers, we discontinue using them. The seed is gathered as soon as ripe and kept until October, when it is sown in rows one inch deep. Most of the seed will grow and be up early in spring. These seedlings are transplanted in the middle of May, when about two inches high, in rows three feejt apart, and ten inches apart in the row. All weeds must be kept out. The next year 80 per cent will bloom. Then we transplant the best into a trial bed. Of these, the very best are kept, and may be given a name and introduced. That means one out of five hundred. Discussion. Q. When will your fall blooming iris be on the market at a reason - able price — selling the roots ? A. We sold twenty-five roots of it this fall. Q. That would not be at a price people in general could buy? </seg>
            <seg id="p489">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 491 A. It will probably be a little high in price, as a good many people will look at it. We get about one out of five-hundred. That is why these new ones are high priced. It took us twelve years to grow this iris, and we are charging $7.50 per root. We could sell all we had if we advertised a little more. Q. What color is it? A. A very dark blue purple. Q. How do you use iris for ornamental purposes around a house in a city lot — in rows or in clumps? How would you advise planting it for ornamental purposes? A. You can use them along the edges in the corner right in front of the shrubs or right among the plants. They could also be arranged along your sidewalk in a row very nicely. Q. How about growing them in the shade ? Do they grow as well ? A. Not so well. The color is not as perfect as it should be. Say they get shade in the afternoon about two o'clock, they do nicely. Q. The patch gets thick and matted. Do you keep it growing that way? A. You can grow them three or four years. Then they ought to be taken up and divided. Sometimes they get too matted. As a result they heave out of the ground and some will die, producing' an unsightly appearance. Q. What colors predominate when you make crosses — light or dark? A. That depends on what you are using. In crossing these inter - mediates, it is a dirty white, call Josephine. Crossing it with a large blue purple iris, we find the blue is dominant. We will have something like eight or ten blue to six or seven white. Mind you in this particular cross we had only purple or clear white — large flowers all of them — altt intermediates. Q. Have you crossed your second generation? A. I have the fifth generation of my own seedling. These will bloom this spring. It seems we were going on the right track. Q. Are all the seedlings fall blooming? A. Just one of them. I think a good many will revert to spring blooming. We have had more flowers in spring. Q. What color is this new flower? </seg>
            <seg id="p490">492 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE A. Wistaria blue. It is one of the German irises. Q. Is it superior in height and size of flower? A. As soon as you get a distinct color — a real break in color to solid red or blue or white — you lose the size. You get a smaller flower. Then you must wait two years before you can cross these again to get larger flowers. Some of the best blues I do not intend to name at present. We will use them for our own breeding until we have one that is really worth while. Q. The more hybrid they are as far as color is concerned, the larg - er the blooms and the stronger the plant? A. Not always; for instance, the Iris Ambassador grows four feet tall, and it is a robust grower. Q. Is it a pure color? A. It is a very nice color. We do not use an except robust grow - ers. We do not bother with any other kind, because we were never in the market and we are not known. We just became known to the Omaha Garden Club. People come out to us. Q. You mentioned a four-foot iris. Are these produced in ordinary soil or do you fertilize them? A. It is virgin Nebraska soil. We have some fifty-two inches tall. Q. Have you had trouble with iris rot? A. We would have a plant here and there affected, but this is the first year it has amounted to anything. The rot started early this sum - mer. If you dig them up and dry them in the sun and transplant them, you will save your plant, but it will not bloom the next year. You will lose some of them, but you can save 75 per cent of them. Q. I pulled mine up and scraped them off and put them back and they grew. Q. Have you tried dipping? A. Not yet; but we will next spring. Q. So many people have had a total loss on iris from that disease. A. Along that line I might say I do not know so very much about it, and it does not seem anybody knows much about it. They have found no real remedy for it. Dykes, in England, recommends superphosphate. Nobody here seems to know what that is. The President of the Amer - ican Iris Society writes he cannot find it. They are trying to get it from England, and perhaps in a year I can tell you more about it </seg>
            <seg id="p491">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 493 It is unfortunate I did not know last summer in blooming time that I had to make a talk. I just got the notice lately, and it is hard to talk to you gentlemen, because I have never made a speech in my life before. In closing, I will say we grow all kinds of flowers besides iris, in the line of perenials and shrubs. We have not planned to be in the commer - cial business, but the Omaha Garden Society members have known of us and almost pushed that business onto us, so we have sold some. My brother has some very fine peonies of his originating. I thank you. MR. GEORGE MARSHALL, (Arlington) : Before leaving this sub - ject, I should like to ask this audience to demand of next year's Program Committee that they notify Mr. Sass he is to be on the program for this subject next year. This is a fertile field that has been opened up. I think what he says is only too true. He did not have a chance. He ought to have it in mind during the summer. He could give us infor - mation in detail and it would be worth more to us if he knew now he was to give us a talk next year. That is what I would like to see done. When it comes to my subject, I would like a little information from the committee as to just how they wanted me to talk about that. I did not quite understand what phase of the nursery business the pro - gram committee wanted discussed. PROFESSOR WIGGANS, (Agricultural College, Lincoln): I am afraid Mr. Marshall may find himself in the same position Mr. Sass did. MR. MARSHALL: I am a dandy at starting a discussion. I can do that when I am not prepared. That is the only thing I love to do. PROFESSOR WIGGANS: The idea I had in mind was this: I would like to know for my own information — and I am sure a lot of these other people would — a little something about the problems which the nurseryman must meet in getting shrubbery and ornamental plants gen - erally in a condition in which he is willing to turn them to a customer — something about the method which he must follow, the number of times they must be transplanted and the particular things which must be done in order to have the plants of marketable size and shape. That is the idea I have. MR. MARSHALL: That is all right. I will be glad to talk from that standpoint. We can not much more than skip around. </seg>
            <seg id="p492">494 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE "ORNAMENTAL TREES, SHRUBS, AND FLOWERS FROM THE NURSERYMAN'S STANDPOINT" Mr. George Marshall, Arlington, Nebraska To start with, I will say there is no use for any one to try to be a nurseryman if he is not a lover of trees and plants. Look the United States over and you won't find any who are not. There are fellows who just love the work, but could not handle the financial end of it. One time in Nebraska there were three firms that did not fail, but 1 rather believe there were only three firms left in Nebraska in 1894. The rest absolutely went under, and those of us who were not busted did not have anything to bust. (Laughter.) We lived on a ten-cent meal and a five-cent necktie if anybody in the world ever did. I know the nurserymen in the United States pretty well. Those who have succeeded are of a thrifty make-up. They had to be or tlysy could not continue. No one ever got to be a millionaire in the nursery business. No matter how much business they do, they don't get rich at it. The fellows who worked at it and practised thrift and economy and used all the common sense they had and used their hands as well as their heads when necessary, have succeeded, and really should have no complaint. They have done very well. We belong to this great army of the intermediate class of people, and that is just where I would want to belong if I had all the millions in the world. I would want to get back in that class, because it is the only class that builds the world and is worth while. So we are proud we are in with the farmers and merchants and factory people and stock feeders. The nursery business and the farming business are essential. We need them. You must be an optimist and you must have a world of courage. You must fail with a good clear conscience and good feeling, and pick up and go on. That is what makes good citizens. If the nurseryman does not love the tree and plant and flower and love to see them grow, there is no use for him to continue in business. There is no real nurseryman in the United States who has not all those qualities. I have seen tree dealers — fellows who were in the nursery business a short time — who I thought did not have enough of it. I have seen tree dealers in the old school who were in the business commer - cially. They commercialized it and did not know one tree from another. They learned how to sell it and went out. They were a disgrace to the business and did not stay at it. That is my explanation of what kind of a make-up a nurseryman must have. Nobody else will be a good nurseryman. You do not need </seg>
            <seg id="p493">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 495 to go into the business expecting to get rich or pay the government very big dividends. You won't pay much excess profits tax; but you will get along very well. Now we will take up the tree. We will take a common elm tree. From a nurseryman's standpoint, if he is a lover of trees, he wants the elm to be grown just about right. He does not want a tree that grows in the woods. It is not fit to transplant. To grow a tree he is proud to show to his friends and deliver to his friends and customers, he must grow it from the seed the first year. He must transplant it in rows about as wide as corn rows, and a foot or two apart in the row, the exact distance depending upon how large he will grow it before he delivers it; if only to be a ten-foot tree, he does not need to put them over a foot apart. If larger, he must put them farther apart. He must plant those seedlings, and he grows them one summer prob - ably with from ten to twenty cultivations with a cultivator and a team of horses. Then he will have to hoe and weed them several times. It depends upon how good a workman the man who runs the cultivator is as to how many times he must hoe them. The first year the tree has grown probably two feet, or maybe more than that. The body is inclined to be a little like a rainbow. You cut them off at the ground the following spring and take the brush off. They will sprout up. They are full of life by that time. They are established and will grow rapidly. They will start four or five buds from each stalk, only one of which is allowed to grow. If you are in a real windy place, it might be safer to stake those little fellows and tie them to the stake to keep them from breaking off or getting crooked. If you have picked a protected place, you can grow them without this. Often times we have an off season and must be ready with our sprayer and spray material for rust and for chewing insects. If you take care of that, and give the amount of cultivation you gave the year before and see that nothing bothers the tree, you will have a tree as much as five or six feet high at the end of the second year. What we call a good growth of elm the second year would stand that high. You have a better body because it is from a rapid growth and stands up well. It is not inclined to be scrubby. It is trying to make a tree instead of a bush. Next spring you train it up. The nurseryman who grows this tree in a good, workmanlike way will have to visit that tree — some of the nurserymen are looking at me as if they did not agree with me — you must trim a tree three of four times the second season. You must stay with that tree with the pruning knife two or three times a season. Stop every trunk that starts. Pick out the one which imposes on the other </seg>
            <seg id="p494">496 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE one and take it off. If there are not enough leaves, leave a few inches of stub with the leaves. That helps your tree to create calibre and helps it to make a heavier tree. Keep this up until it is six or seven feet high, and from that time on it is ready to sell any spring you choose to sell it and you find a customer who wants to buy that size of tree. You can dig that tree with the spade if you have patience enough and a sharp enough spade. The proper way is to hitch ten horses on a tree digger. Run under every root. You will get better results than by hand digging, and you save a lot of backache. The customer is bet - ter satisfied with it. You see the roots of the tree have never been exposed until it gets into the hands of the customer. Caution the cus - tomer, because some of them might think a tree's roots would stand more exposure than they will. That is the way the nurseryman looks at the tree, I will tell you another thing. Every time he walks out where the tree is planted, he looks at it in a fatherly way. If he sees the tree is suffering, he is just a little indignant. You grow the maple tree the same way Take the linden tree. You can go down in the woods and get a linden tree anywhere. You say, "They should be grown cheaply." How - ever, it will cost more to grow a linden than an elm because you have to stake that tree sometimes seven feet high to hold it until it learns to stand up. I think one of the most practical ways is to plant them be - tween elms — a row of elms and then a row of lindens. If planted with maples, the maples will outgrow them. They must hustle to keep up with the elm, and they will do it. They learn to stand up quicker with You must bear in mind when you want to grow from seed, you have a job on your hands. Some of these fellows can tell you more about it than I can. The ordinary way, it takes two years to get them germinated; therefore if you get a good American broad-leafed linden twelve feet high and the nurseryman asks five dollars for it, don't think he is trying to hold you up. He is just going to get even. Really, de - sirable linden trees should be sold at a higher price than an elm or maple. When it comes to shrubs, they are grown easier, but there are no two shrubs handled in the same way. The best nurserymen are the ones who started so young that they just absorbed it. They do not know how they learned. They are like the little boy who was lost. He tried to explain what kind of a looking fellow his father was. He gave it up. He said, "I can't tell you how he looks, but I would know him if I would see him." (Laughter.) </seg>
            <seg id="p495">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 497 So these boys who have grown up in the business know there is something wrong and know the plant needs something. There are very few fellows who can see very far into the wishes of a plant. That is the reason a fellow must love plants to be worth anything at the busi - ness of working with them. Take the hydrangea, which is one of the common shrubs here. The ordinary nurseryman with the ordinary field-growing methods can hardly root it. Some of the younger fellows are beginning to graft it. When you get it into the nursery row it is easy. Prune it and cultivate it and cut it and you have a good hydrangea; but the starting is the trouble. The growing of this little stuff is coming west faster than we thought it would. We have good growers near us now, and they will supply the nurserymen with it ready to put out. This is a wonderful shrubbery country. The nurserymen will do well here. We are going to make homes out of houses right along. We have had places to stay. Now these places are fast developing into homes. The old nurseryman's slogan is, "A home is not a home until it is planted;" and they are being planted by the thousands. There are different ways to propagate roses in large quantities. They are rather hard to handle — rather uncertain. I have been in the best rose nurseries in the country and they are having bad luck with them this year. In the east they use some kind of stock to bud on. When they put this stock out they set it in rows and bud it to desired varieties. They spend two years in growing this rose from the time the stock is planted until they deliver it. Often you are stung with budded plants. They are now beginning to grow roses on their own roots. The difficulty with the budded rose is the average person does not watch it closely enough and is not well enough acquainted with the differences in the leaf of this rose and the variety budded on it. The first is full of sap and striving to get ahead. The other will bloom nicely the first year. Something happens to it, and the first one will force up its growth. The customers say, "That rose you sold me is a wild rose." "How is that?" "The first year it was all right. The next year it had one or two little roses, and that is the last I ever saw. From then on it was a wild rose." In this climate we must look rather favorably to the rose grown on its own root, and it is hard to root the rose. It, takes an expert to do it. We are looking forward to the time when we will have all our roses on their own roots so as to do away with this diificulty. I will say the budded rose possibly will give a bigger bloom than the other the first year. But when it comes to a number of years, the own rooted plants are better. It costs quite a little to get that, but we must have it. </seg>
            <seg id="p496">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 498 One of the troubles the nurseryman has is to get people to treat the rose plant right after it is planted. Generally we give the buyer planting directions like this: "Plant this rose two inches deep in the nursery and then throw a little mound of dirt around it and cut it oft at the top of the dirt. When you see it has any notion of growing, rake this dirt down. It will not dry up by the stem sticking into the dry air before time to grow, and it will have more life and will make a better growth the first season." Coming to the evergreen: You speak to the average nurseryman about an evergreen and he wilMook down his nose. Why? I tell you there is the worst trouble the nurseryman has. Inasmuch as it is a valuable tree and there are varieties that grow all over this state, it is in demand; but the transplanting of it is a treacherous operation. There is more loss in transplanting evergreens than any other one plant we put out. We love evergreens but this love costs us money every year because of the heavy losses. We will consider the Colorado blue spruce. We plant the seed of the Colorado Blue spruce and grow them several years in beds that are shaded. Then they are transplanted several times before they can be sold. Out of 100 seedlings probably 8 or ten turn out to be blue. The rest are all green, or a bluish cast of green. It takes five years to get them a foot and a half high, and three years to get them in good shape to sell. They have just commenced to grow. By that time you have picked out the blue ones. When you have to pay ten or twenty-five dollars — I have seen them selling as high as one hundred dollars around Detroit — do not say it is too much, because the rest have been handled all this time in order to grow these few for you. Blue Spruces are also grafted. Kosters Blue spruce is an example. In this country spruce grafting has been unsuc - cessful so far. The wind-break evergreens are a bit uncertain about getting started, but they are so satisfactory afterward that we nurserymen must stay with them and take our losses; if we get one in three to succeed we are happy, — I mean trees like the Norway spruce and pine, and the Aus - trian and Scotch pine, they are the wind break of years. The Horticultural Session then adjourned to meet in joint session with the Home Economics Session at its meeting in Agricultural Hall, with Mrs. C. B. Noyes, of Waterloo, president of the Home Economics Section, in the chair.

            <seg id="p497">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 499 "DEVELOPING THE FARMSTEAD" Professor C. H. Diggs, Ames, Iowa Friends, I feel just as much at home here as in Iowa. I feel I am among friends. I will not read a paper, so you do not need to be worried. I know the group meeting over here has had an interesting session. They never fail to have such, no matter where they go. Sometimes the "Hort" Society does not have such good success. I listened to three talks in the other building that were certainly worth coming from Iowa to hear. I will take back something with me, you may be sure. I am sorry I can not stay longer to take in the rest of your meetings. We believe the welfare of our country depends upon a profitable and permanent type of agriculture. I believe everybody in this room will subscribe to that statement. So often we think of landscape develop - ment as something to do with the planting of a round flower bed of geraniums in the middle of the lawn; or a few shrubs, in our enthusiasm in the spring, around the front door; or the planting of some poor little evergreen tree that never receives any further attention after it has been put in the ground, and we call that our landscape work. As long as that situation exists in regard to developing our farm homes, we are going to have the type of farm homes we see so often today. Therefore I will try to bring to your attention a few thoughts in the development of our farmsteads, and I hope that I may arouse a little curiosity in you to ask some questions when I get through speak - ing, and I hope that you will ask them as I stand here so that we may all receive the benefit of the discussions. To obtain a proper background for the consideration of this subject, let us look back to 1890 — about thirty-five years ago. Along in the spring of the year the average farm owner, remembering those cold north winds, looked about in regard to a windbreak, which he did not have. He goes to the barn and jumps on a horse and goes to the nearest tree, cuts off some three-foot switches, sticks them in the ground, and a few years hence he has a windbreak. That is what we have today — those wind - breaks developed and planted in such fashion. Very often the tree he went to get these switches from was a cottonwood, box elder, willow, or soft maple. Just about those four trees form the average windbreak of the farms coming into existence thirty-five years ago. I do not mean to criticise or poke fun at his good intentions. It is a fine thing to plant a tree, and it is a fair question whether we are doing as much now as then to improve our farms. But what I do think is important is that we have that same energy and same enthusiasm, coupled with all the information that is available now. At the present time when we go out on a farm, we find the wind- </seg>
            <seg id="p498">500 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE break has reached maturity, becoming; split up — poor, unsightly trees. I can take you to some places where there is work for two men for six months cleaning up a windbreak so that it is fit to look at. We have that condition on a great many of our farms. I have visited, in the past K% farm after farm that had just such a type of windbreak. We know tiling may strike a set of farm buildings and burn them down, and you can build those buildings in six months. This is not true of a wind - break. You set a tree out, and it must live and thrive for many years before it becomes of any use. Over on the Mississippi between Clinton and Dubuque is an Ameri - can elm that is one hundred years old. That community may feel proud that it has nurtured and taken care of this tree until it has reached this fine stage of maturity. It is good for a number of years to come. What are we to expect in the next thirty-five years? When we go back to the farm we are on thirty-five years from now, the buildings may have changed, and the method of farming may have changed; but there will be one thing still evident on that farm we can remember, and that really lends tradition to that farm, and that is the tree growth ex - isting there. For that reason, it seems to me, we should plant a more permanent type of tree. White pine or Norway spruce are often planted for wind- Iiaks or shade purposes to lend interest to our winter landscape. In nting that type of tree, we sometimes expect it will have slow growth, 1 very often we give up in despair and say we do not want to spend arge amount of money for a tree that will grow so slowly. The past son I measured white pines that grew three feet within the past year, seems to me we could hardly class that as slow growth. That was : average for a large number of trees. (I admit last season was a her good growing season for trees.) If you measure the growth of ne of these trees, you will be surprised how much growth they will ; on each year. It seems to me if we believe in a permanent and valuable type of friculture, it would be well for us to spend a little money on a few trees, order to have them for a long time to come. There is a need of or - rly arrangement of the buildings, and the tree growth on every farm, person can not be expected to be proud of a place when the first thing a notice upon going on a farm is the old rusty machinery in an ill kept &gt;ve near the house. One of the projects which I have charge of in our extension service is the schoolground work. I met with the directors of this particular consolidated school and finished the work a little bit sooner than ex - pected. One of the farmers asked me if I would look at bis place and give him some suggestions. I was very glad to do that. He said, "It Is just about a mile around the corner." As we went down the road, we </seg>
            <seg id="p499">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 501 were talking about farmstead development and I was telling him about some of the things I found. I said, "Take for instance, this farm we are coming to. That machinery has been lying there for ten years. It is not of any particular use. I can not talk to the owner about landscape improvement when he has not enough pride to go out and pick up the machinery." He said, "You speak very frankly. That is my farm." (Laughter.) I was very sorry, of course. I did not mean to speak so plainly to the man's face, but I think it had some effect. After we went in, there was not much more said. I went by that place a little while later and the machinery was picked up. Now he is ready for something else. I want to consider three main things in farmstead development. One is the entrance. If you will stop to think about it, often we come onto a place and are brought to the back door. That is all very well. One receives a hearty welcome and knows it is the place to find the folks. I enjoy that informality. But at the same time most farm owners are anxious to have a little better arrangement for the main driveway. I was on one farm this fall. We had talked about location of build - ings and the orchard and windbreak and garden plot, and had finished up the work. The owner was in the front yard with me. (Sketches bird's eye view of this farm on board.) A quarter of a mile back was the house. He had a drive that went up to the barn coming on toward the house. I said, "I have a suggestion I want to leave with you as to what I would do on this farm if it were mine. You might not care for it. Sometime you will have an orchard here somewhere. If this were my place I would put some apple trees along this drive and put two rows on this side." He had a brand new house. "Then I would fence it off and use it for a calf or sheep pasture. You would not have to run a lawn mower over so much ground. You would have an orchard, and a fine landscape setting to your house." "That's what I have been wanting. Why didn't you tell me that to begin with?" "I thought perhaps it was not quite practical enough." "That'a just what I want. I will have it fixed by the next time you come by here." That is the point I want to make in regard to our farm develop - ment. Very often we have the buildings, we have trees, lawns, shrubs and flowers; but sometimes we do not use them in a landscape way, so that we can be proud of the arrangement and grouping. No one could be more practical than I am in regard to this work. So often you think of a landscape architect as being an individual who is odd, peculiar, and going to tell you a lot of funny things. I am so </seg>
            <seg id="p500">502 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE fearful of that point, I do not often give suggestions of that nature when I should. Then the second thing in regard to developing a farmstead is the arrangement of buildings. I think we will have a talk later on in re - gard to this matter so that I will not go into it much, except to say that we are trying to get those buildings arranged around a court so that when the farmer wants to do the chores, he won't have to open two gates every time he goes from one place to another. There is a whole lot of study necessary for the arrangement of those buildings. It is ridiculous to think a plan can be sent out from the college that will fill every situation. What is necessary is to study the layout, become familiar with it, and apply this experience to the development of each individual home. The third important project, and really the most important thing in the development of the farmstead, is the windbreak, because it takes longer to materialize. When planting a windbreak, the trees should be located at least one hundred twenty feet away from the buildings so that it will properly function. So often we get it too close, or we allow too much ground for the feed lots and farm court and the buildings. Trees should be fifteen feet apart in the row, and the rows should be twenty feet apart so that some snow will lodge between them. White pine and Norway spruce form the best quick windbreak, but I am not familiar with their adaptation here, so it is necessary to inves - tigate and see what tree is thriving in the particular place you live, and use that tree. Of course an evergreen windbreak is more desirable than a tree that loses its leaves in winter time, and it is more permanent. Now in considering the development of these various parts of the farmstead, there are other details that come up, such as watering troughs, the water tanks, the location of the vegetable garden, etc. The fences should be designed neatly and should be easy to maintain. The buildings should be fireproof if possible, and if not, they should be placed far enough apart so that there will not be too much of a fire hazard. There are a number of things like that to consider. When you finally get right down to what is back of the whole thing, you will find it is the development of a definite plan. If you could see my desk next month, or preferably in March, you would find it stacked high with correspondence, questions, inquiries, wanting to know where to buy certain stock, and how many trees to plant here — all sorts of questions being asked. It is too late then to ask questions. The best time to consider this is in November and De - cember. As soon as you have some evenings at home, if the radio does not occupy too much of your time, sit down with pencil and paper at the dining room table and figure it out. Then you will get somewhere. I can show you a lot of farms in my state that have been developed. No </seg>
            <seg id="p501">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 503 landscape architect ever saw them; no extension worker was ever on the place. They are mighty well laid out. The reason is because that man sat down and figured it out, and decided this should be located here and that over there, for some reason. I often find a man is going to build a granary. He has decided to put it in a certain place. Before he gets through planning he finds that its location has a good deal to do with the location of his whole farm lay-out. It is not to be expected that the farm development will be perfect, but we ought to make an attempt to make it so. That is what we are trying to do in this extension work — to get one or two well planned farmsteads in each county to serve as an illustration for others to follow. We feel if this goes forward long enough, we will have a different type of farmstead than we have now. I should like to tell you a little bit of Iowa's plan of extension work in farmstead development. In the past year we have prepared ten plans to be followed on farms located in different counties of the state. These plans follow a drawing such as I have here. They are not sketches, but well drawn plans which we send out to be followed out in the de - velopment of the particular farm. We have the promise of that farmer — it has been successful in every case — that he will follow this plan. But if he wants to make a change, he writes and tells us about it so that we know what is happening on that place. No plans are prepared for these places unless the farms have been seen. I have known of some very peculiar situations that have happened where a farmstead plan has been developed, without first becoming familiar with the lay of the ground. So often farmers are misinformed in regard to the nursery-men. I wish we could all become familiar with the nursery practices, and that we might have heard the talk given us this afternoon in that connection by Mr. George Marshall of Arlington. We need to know what it costs the nurserymen to produce the trees. Last spring one of our county agents sent in a list of plants and prices quoted to a farmer in his county. He wanted to know if he was not paying too much for these plants, and if they, were the proper selections. The selections were very good. I went over the prices very carefully. I know that particular in - dividual felt it was a good deal of money to put into trees and shrubs. After going over the list, I wrote back I felt it was not a matter of investing $700 in trees and shrubs this year, but to take twenty-five and plant them and see if they could be taken care of properly; but I believed the nurseryman had given proper advice in regard to the cost, and type of plants to be used. (I believe I could give pretty accurate judgment of that thing, as I have been handling plant lists for twelve years.) I think too often we judge all nurserymen by some of the quacks. We can not very well do that in other types of business, you know. </seg>
            <seg id="p502">504 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE There are honest nurserymen — nine-tenths of them are. The other one - tenth is going from door to door and taking your order, and then you know not what becomes of him. That is what is spoiling 1 the nursery business. I do not want to bring any of our family quarrels from Iowa, but I think you can very well receive the results of some things that have happened over there. We do feel the man who canvasses from door to door is doing a harm he does not intend. He takes an order and that order is cashed in by him, and he is not interested any further. There - fore we have a dissatisfied customer, and a transaction not to the credit of the nursery business. Do not confuse this canvasser with the man who represents a reputable nursery in your community — a man you know — a man who lives there. He has your interests at heart. If you buy from him and it does not turn out right, he is anxious to have it made good. I wish we could understand the nursery practice and give good nurserymen more support, because they have a pretty hard row to hoe. I have a group of people in my state who seem to have the idea that all we need to do is to go into the woods and choose wild flowers in the development of our grounds. That may sound all right, but at the same time we ought to leave those plants where they belong and use those which have been carefully propagated and pruned and taken care of in a nursery. There was a talk before mine in regard to "Planning the Farm - stead." I do not want to repeat what has been said there. I am willing to answer questions of whatever sort you care to ask. It is by that method we bring out what is really wanted. Discussion Q. Having your farm established, you find you would like to put out some trees or shrubs or flowers or something of the kind, or per - haps rearrange the farmstead to some extent, how do you go at such a program? A. You will find I always hark back to the plan. You really ought to have a plan to work to which is applicable to your own situation. That can be figured out, of course, by reference to books, lectures, etc., so that you will have some definite scheme to work to. Unless you do that, you will be buying trees and planting them, and later on wishing they were some place else. Your neighbor will say, "If this was my place, I would put them over there." Q. How will you make that plan when you have perhaps three - fourths of what you want already established and you can not re - arrange it? </seg>
            <seg id="p503">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 505 A. Suppose you want only to plant a few shrubs around the front yard, still you need a plan to work to. I do not care if you are only going to buy five shrubs, this spring, it "would be fine if you sat down and figured out where they are going to go. I know of a case called to my attention recently. A lady thought she would like to have some bar - berry bushes in her front yard, so she bought some from an agent. When her husband heard about it he said, "Where will you put them?" "The man who sold me the barberry knew where he was going to put them." "When will he be back?" This lady had no definite scheme of development, The reason I like to put so much emphasis on the plan is this: We see a blue spruce in a person's lawn. We say, "That's a beautiful thing! I would like to get a tree like that." I have run across man after man, who says, "I have been trying five years to get a blue spruce, and I can't get one yet that suits me and is reasonable in price." I look at his place and wonder what he is going to do with it when he gets it. For that same amount of money he needed to buy the very plainest of shrubs. If we think of what we will do year after year, I think we will find we have more interest in our place. Q. If we have our plans drawn, then we can send them to the Extension Department for suggestion, can we? A. Yes. But this has not proved thoroughly satisfactory in my case, because I have not seen the grounds. There are some very obvious things on that plan that could be criticised or suggestions given. Q. An extension leader does not go to an individual farm if there is just one farmer who wants him, does he? A. When inquiries of this nature come to our office, we write back and say, "If you want a landscape architect to come to your place, men - tion it to your county agent." The county agent keeps a record of such requests and when there are three or four, he seeks the help of the State extension agent in Landscape work. Through that day's work and an evening lecture which reaches the people like we are doing today, we have started something worth while in that county. Q. They will go for a day's work? A. Yes. "I don't know." </seg>
            <seg id="p504">506 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE Q. What kind of trees would you put around the place shown there? (Referring to drawing on the platform.) A. That question comes up very often. We pick up a nursery cat - alogue and see two hundred varieties of plants. The nurseryman makes them read very nice. The salesman comes around and he increases your interest. The home owner does not know where to begin or where to stop. In order to meet just such inquiries I have prepared a list of just fifty plants adapted to Iowa conditions: five perennials like the iris; five vines like the Boston ivy; twenty-five shrubs arranged according to the height to which they grow; ten trees, leaving out the box elder, the cottonwood, the willow, and the soft maple. Those four are not on that list. I have also listed five evergreens. This idea has worked out very successfully this past year. If you will become familiar with those fifty plants and plant them only on your place, you will become interested in plant materials and you will find there is enough there to afford variety. This is the time of year when we want a pleasing winter effect. I have selected some of these twenty-five shrubs with that particular thing in mind to stop people from running off to California in winter time. Use green dogwood, and red dogwood and some barberry. Noth - ing is prettier than the high bushy cranberry. The berries will stay on all winter — a beautiful sight. By keeping to that list, you soon become interested in trees and shrubs, instead of spending so much time on the geranium plant in the middle of the lawn or in your blue spruce, which is so expensive. Q. What kind of evergreens do you recommend? A. I hesitate to name five evergreens for this locality because con - ditions here are different than in Iowa. However, I understand that Austrian pine and Scotch pine do well in the eastern part of your state where as in the western part Ponderosa or Bull pine and Jack pine are hardier. Black Hill spruce and Colorado Blue spruce do well all over the state as does also the Red Cedar. Q. What do you think of our common cedar tree as a windbreak? A. It is all right. There is one thing about a cedar tree I have had a little trouble with. If you will examine your cedar trees in May and June, you will usually find the cedar apple — a little round, brown apple. . If you have a windbreak of cedar trees and that apple gets started, your apple orchard suffers. There is very little printed or def - inite information about that thing. Virginia has so many cedar trees they passed a law the cedar could not be planted, and there was talk of it in Iowa. I believe we should use the cedar tree to a certain ex - tent. If you use it as a windbreak, your apple orchard might be harmed. </seg>
            <seg id="p505">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 507 Q. We have three rows of common cedar next to our apple orchard and a fine apple orchard. I sold $200 worth of apples off it this year. It is twenty years old.. A. We can always find some cases like this. Certain varieties of apples are not injured by cedar rust such as Winesap; but others like Wealthy and Jonathan are hurt badly. Fremont county, near the Ne - braska line has a great many cedar windbreaks, and if you observe the trees, you can see a fine illustration of what happens to the apple or - chard where the cedar trees have this growth. Q. How could you arrange a windbreak if your house is on the corner and the road on the north and west, without shutting off the view of the road? A. (Illustrates on blackboard.) The front door faces north. There could be a group of evergreens closer to the road and still keep an open - ing. Your entire view would not be broken. The same principle would be true for a north or west frontage. Plant your evergreens informally — scattered. Q. In planting a windbreak on a new farmstead, what trees would you recommend where you want a good windbreak on the north and west but do not want to wait half a century for the evergreens to get large enough to stop the wind? A. How about waiting twelve years? Q. In central Nebraska they would not get large enough in twelve years to do much good. A. I do not know your local situation. What is your trouble? Q. Lack of moisture. A. That can be taken care. of. In places where the soil is poor and you are anxious to get a windbreak, you can get a mulch that will hold moisture around the roots. I do not believe your location should prevent you from establishing a good, permanent windbreak. I have known a condition where the soil is very poor and where they have to water and mulch each tree once a year until it gets established. I think it is well worth while. Q. My experience has been the native elm is the best tree we have. A. I would not quite endorse that. I am anxious to see evergreen windbreaks because they brighten our winter landscape.

Porter, of Nebraska City, at 9:30 o'clock. THE PRESIDENT: I do not know why it is they always call on the President of the State Horticultural Society for an address. I tried to pass it off on our local Secretary, but he would not stand for it. ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT Mr. Grove M. Porter, Nebraska City, Nebr. Ladies and Gentlemen: Members and Guests of the State Horticultural Society — it gives me great pleasure to welcome you here at the 56th Annual Meeting of the Society. I will not attempt to make an address but will give you a review of the various activities of the Society for the year 1924. On the 8th of August, the Society sponsored a Horticultural tour visiting points of interest in Douglas and Sarpy counties. Members of the Society met at the Snyder orchard near Bellevue, and spent an lour or so inspecting the same. Mr. Snyder told of his cultural methods and bis plans for developing a roadside market that would handle the entire output of his 10-acre orchard. From the Snyder orchard we drove to Mandan park where an excellent picnic lunch was served. After lunch we visited small fruit farms in the Florence district. Many interesting places were visited and the members of the tour by asking questions received valuable information as to the growing and handling of grapes, raspberries, strawberries and cherries. I might add that everyone wanted to know about grapes and the varieties best suited for making grape juice. Our tour ended at the Smith fruit farm. Here we inspected the vineyard, orchard and apple storage cellars. Mr. Smith told of his operations and his methods of selling his crops. Then we enjoyed a fine program in which marketing, grape and cherry culture were discussed. The meeting then adjourned and every - one felt that the tour was well vrorth while. </seg>

            <seg id="p508">510 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Most of you attended the State Fair and know that the display of the Horticultural Society was the best thing at the. Fair. Our Secretary, Mr. E. H. Hoppert, and his able assistant; Mr. F. M. Coe, had complete charge of this exhibit and are to be congratulated for their fine work. No better method could be employed to show the people of the state what Nebraska can do in fruit growing. The apple, display at the State Fair was made up of late summer and fall varieties. A similar display was put on at Waterloo, Iowa, during the Mid-West Horticultural Exposition by the Nebraska State Horticultural Society. The following varieties were used in this dis - play: Jonathan, Grimes Golden, Winesap, York, Delicious, Ben Davis, Gano and Missouri Pippin apples. Our show at Waterloo was. the talk of the Mid-West Exposition. Eighteen states were represented at this meeting and Nebraska made them all sit up and take notice. Nebraska and Nebraska apples were certainly well advertised. I want to take this opportunity to thank Mr. E. R. Danielson and the members of the State Board of Agriculture in behalf of the Horti - cultural Society for their financial and moral support in the above pro - jects. Apple and small fruit culture are fast becoming important indus - tries in eastern and southeastern Nebraska. During the past ten years approximately 60,000 apple trees, 10,000 cherry trees, and thousands of grape vines have been planted. Many of these trees are just coming into bearing and the apples are attracting the attention of buyers of national reputation. The grape and berry industries are coming to the front rapidly. Trees and shrubbery are in great demand everywhere. Nurseries can hardly supply the demand. "Home beautiful" campaigns are being conducted — garden clubs have been organized — with the result that every town is more beautiful and a better place to live. "Plan to plant another tree" is a popular slogan and one that we should all follow. The Nebraska State Horticultural Society is in a position now to do great things for the state and I sincerely hope that it will have the hearty co-operation of everyone. THE PRESIDENT: In other years we have had a good many speak - ers and men more or less local to give these talks on our program. We generally all know just about what we are going to hear when we get here. The directors of the State Horticultural Society had a number of meetings and decided we wanted to have a program of real value — that we would get ideas that would differ from our own. By putting the two together, it would be a benefit to all of us. We started looking around for some one who could give us a good talk on "Pruning." We wanted a speaker who was both a scientific and a practical man. We of </seg>
            <seg id="p509">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 511 course have our own ideas here, and in other places they use different methods, but the main idea is about the same. After looking around a long time, we were in the east looking for a man of national reputation. We sent a representative back there and went back to see Professor Sears at Amherst. He said, "I do not know of anybody;" but finally he added, "We have a fellow out there in your country who I think would be just the man for that. He was a little hard-headed when he was here, but I think he has straightened up. See if you can't find Fred Merrill. He is a Vice President of the Central States Orchard Company, and now he is teaching the boys at Missouri." I am going to call on Fred Merrill for a short talk on "Pruning." ME. MERRILL: I know a lot of things about your President, but I am too much of a gentleman even to think them. (Laughter.) Some of the things I know about him, if I should think about them he could have me arrested. First I should like to compliment the Horticultural Society on the project Mr. Porter has mentioned, which was the exhibit made possible by the funds given to the Horticultural Society for this purpose. While I did not personally see the exhibit at Waterloo, I heard from three of the men who were present and they all agreed it was a remarkably fine exhibit, and surely the advertising value of that exhibit in the State of Nebraska will be repaid beyond the amount of money expended for the purchasing of the fruit. I am sure if your Board of Agriculture will continue to be liberal, you will get good returns on your investment PRUNING F. S. Merrill Pruning offers one of the most interesting problems to the fruit growers and one that can never be reduced to a scientific basis. Each tree presents a new problem and nearly every grower who pretends to carry on a constructive pruning program has his own ideas and ideals. There are, however, certain facts and factors that are generally accepted, for the time being, at least; and there are others that have been dis - continued since their use has not proved them to be successful. Many terms have been coined by authors, and their usage may have been clear to them; but to the layman they have been open to miscon - struction. "High headed" or "low headed," "open headed" or "centered" and many other terms are seen frequently in literature. Some, espec - ially such words as "open centered," have caused much misunderstanding, with resulting injury to the trees when put into practice wrongly. The word when taken literally would convey the impression that the inner portions of the tree should be kept open and many growers have done </seg>
            <seg id="p510">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 512 ust this. The result has been a radical reduction in the fruit bearing rea of mature and developing trees. This misunderstanding has also teen intensified in some cases in which more or less specific directions lave been given for pruning trees during the first three of four years of leir growth. All wood growing towards the center has been regarded s harmful or useless and its removal has been recommended. If the ame principles are applied continuously, the practice will result not only in a poorly formed specimen, but also in one that has neither the fruit roducing surface or the fruit producing tendencies that should exist in a profitable tree. But why should we prune? Some say to regulate the form of the tree; but in reality the average grower is interested in the form only so far as form has a direct bearing on (1) the productiveness of the tree, (2) the quality of the fruit produced and (3) upon the strength of the structure. We are, however, interested in the financial returns from each tree and here pruning shows its true value. The productiveness of the tree depends upon a proper balancing of the food elements, upon the size of the tree and upon the development of fruit buds. A study of recent literature shows quite clearly that the amount of wood growth and the area of leaf surface is reduced by severe pruning; and when carried on persistently, severe pruning may actually have a dwarfing effect upon tree growth. Though an unpruned tree may make a greater total growth than one pruned severely, an unpruned tree probably will not have as strong framework as one that has been pruned moderately. The amount of pruning has a rather definite effect upon the char - acter of growth and during the different stages of tree development the amount of pruning may be varied. The fruit grower's first object is to produce as quickly as possible a tree capable of producing fairly large crops of apples. During the first few years of the plant's development, one should be particularly in - terested in the size and strength of the plant. During this time, fruiting r the formation of fruiting spurs should be discouraged rather than en - ouraged. The production of fruit on very young trees may have a stunt - ng effect upon the growth. During this period of the tree's growth, the tendency toward moderately heavy pruning will probably secure the best ;ype of tree. A tree free from physical defects is an ideal that is never ound, but we should work towards such an end. The form and strength f the tree is going to depend largely upon this early pruning. After the tree has attained a fair size, the pruning operations should be directed toward the production of fruit bearing wood. It is here that the objection to heavy pruning is most manifest. Heavy pruning is usually followed by the production of an excessive number of laterals or watersprouts. The balance between the food elements may be dis- </seg>
            <seg id="p511">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 513 turbed and the character of growth may be such as to discourage or diminish the formation of fruiting wood. This is true for general condi - tions for the average variety. With trees characterized by an excessive growth, severe pruning in the early years might be beneficial if it produced a degree of stunting, since excessive wood growth and fruit production are scarcely coexis - tent. Under the average conditions, however, it is usually best to re - duce the amount of pruning when the trees are coming into bearing. For some, it may be even better to omit pruning entirely if growth is light and fruit bud formation delayed. After the trees have come into full bearing, the amount of pruning should be .gradually increased again. This tends to direct the tendency of growth and maintains a balance of conditions that are different from those that existed either during the early growth of the plant or during that critical time when the tree is coming into bearing. With extremely old trees, a heavier degree of pruning is possible and probably practic - able. With this type of tree, the pruning may act as a thinning factor and this directly aids in the size of the fruit produced. With old trees, however, a lack of soil fertility cannot be overcome by pruning; and in such a case, direct application of some fertilizer is called for. The quality of the fruit produced is a vital factor in production. Fruit is graded upon size and color; and conditions of growth must be maintained whereby fruit of good size and color can be produced. Sun - light is a governing factor and the trees should be pruned so that sun - light has access to all portions of the tree for at least a part of the day. The coloring process of the apple is due to the presence of pigments in the skin. These are probably some form of sugar and for their devel - opment direct sunlight is necessary. This is quite true of the "red" pigments as found in Winesaps and Jonathans. The presence of direct sunlight is not the only factor governing the change in pigment forma - tion, but it does play such a vital part in this matter that it must be considered. Leaves exposed to direct sunlight also manufacture a great - er amount of food, and fruit nourished by such leaves will attain a larger size than fruit fed by smaller leaves in indirect light. The conditions favorable for the formation of fruit and its proper development are also the ones that permit of better spraying and harvesting conditions. The strength of the tree structure is of great importance. A weak, spindling tree can neither produce nor support a large crop of fruit. The strength of the tree depends largely upon the selection of the scaf - fold limbs at the time of its earliest growth, together with the subse - quent care of their later growth. In forming the tree, three general types are followed: </seg>
            <seg id="p512">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 514 (1) Open headed type, (2) Modified Leader type, (3) Central Leader type. All three of these types have been used and a careful survey of the results secured from them has led observers to believe that the modified eader type of tree will produce a sturdier, stronger and better balanced ree than either of the others. In this type of tree the production of serious crotches has been greatly reduced, a factor that alone would arrant its use. In starting a tree with this method, the central or most upright growing shoot is suppressed only slightly. The scaffold &gt;ranches are selected for their distribution both as regards their height n the stem and also their direction of growth. Three scaffold limbs lould be sufficient. They should be as far apart on the main stem as ossible and each growing in a different direction. By cutting back the central shoot less severely, it will grow slightly faster than the laterals r scaffold limbs. The central leader is maintained until the tree has ttained a height of six to eight feet, when it may be removed. An evil often incident to the earliest pruning is a tendency to cut back too severely. Under certain conditions this will actually dwarf the size of the tree. It accounts for the fact that trees entirely unpruned in their early development, other conditions being equal, actually out - grow those severely pruned. Moderate pruning is essential in directing the growth that will produce a stronger and more satisfactory tree. SOME PRUNING PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES The following basic principles may well be followed:* * Courtesy of Professor T. J. Talbert. 1. That there is a definite relation between the leaf area of apple trees and the rate of growth of the tree as a whole appears to be fairly well established. Pruning in young orchards, whether light or heavy, generally has a tendency to reduce the leaf area and to that extent to be a dwarfing process. Pruning may seem to increase the vigor of growth, but this is generally due to the trees being made smaller by reducing the number of growing points. The stimulating effect of pruning is tem - porary, lasting only until the balance between the root and top of the tree is restored. 2. When two branches grow at the same rate from a common point, they tend to form a narrow, weak crotch. If allowed to continue to grow equally, they are apt to break when loaded with fruit. This condition can be easily corrected by unequal cutting. If one of the branches is kept pruned back rather severely it will develop into a side branch or </seg>
            <seg id="p513">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTIRK 515 lateral, while the unpruned branch will become the larger and the crotch between the branches is made stronger. 3. The same principle of unequal cutting to regulate the growth of branches may be applied to young trees which lean badly toward the northeast due to the prevailing winds from the southwest during the growing season. If the leaf surface is reduced by heavier pruning on the northeast sides of the leaving trees, the weight of the branches is reduced. The heavier pruning has a dwarfing effect upon the limbs. On the opposite side of the leaning trees the branches grow larger, with less pruning and their weight is increased. With such pruning, the ten - dency will be to produce a more upright tree. 4. To procure a general renewal of growth, pruning must be dis - tributed over the entire tree. When large limbs are removed, the growth response is in the region near the pruned end, and it is usually mani - fested by a heavy growth of water sprouts. 5. The removal of large limbs near small branches will generally result in the growth of many water sprouts, while the cutting of limbs or branches near laterals of about the same size or diameter results in little or no water sprout growth. 6. If heavy pruning is given two-year-old trees at planting time, but little if any gain in size over yearling trees results. 7. When it seems desirable to spread the tops of trees, the cuts on the lateral branches should be made to outside buds. In the case of horizontally growing branches it may be necessary to cut to inside in - stead of outside buds to keep the leader in the center of the tree top and to fill open spaces. 8. A common error in training trees toward the modified leader type is to leave the leader too much longer than the laterals. If this is done, two sets of branches, one above the other, may develop, giving rise to the so-called "two-story" type of tree. By proper attention to the suppression of the leader, and the arrangement of the main branches, a well balanced tree top may be formed and new branches produced in continuous succession and not in sets. 9. During the first five to six years after transplanting, to prune as little as possible should be the general rule. Heavy pruning at this period tends to make the trees smaller and to keep them in a vegetative condition. Heavy pruning also inclines to retard the beginning of the fruiting period. If it is necessary to prune rather heavily to secure the required scaffold branches and their proper spacing, it is much better to do the work during the first two or three years after transplanting. 10. When trees have reached an age of 5 or 6 years, pruning for form is usually finished. After the trees come into bearing, pruning is </seg>
            <seg id="p514">516 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE fen for the purpose of maintaining the trees in a profitable fruiting idition and should consist largely of thinning out the thicker parts the tree and cutting back rangy branches. Discussion Q. What would you do with the whorl of limbs on that tree? A. I would cuss 'em. (Laughter.) Q. That does not do any good. I A. Supposing we had to prune it, the only thing you can do is to t this off. Next spring you have the same thing to do all over again, henever you prune a tree, the effect of your pruning will be shown a comparatively limited area in the vicinity of the cut. It will have very limited effect on any other limb on the tree. If you hope for tvation in a tree like that, you must wait until it gets over lots of the )Iish characteristics of its early age. It wants to do lots of things u do not want it to, just like humans. You will get ahead if you take t the old shoots and reduce competition. If you keep heading the igs back, you will have three or four branches arising from the buds out the cut. If you have competition between the branches for sun - ;ht, it will increase the tendency toward high growth. The natural idency is to reach toward the sunlight. Reducing the central com - tition for sunlight by removing the old shoot, will probably be a tter way to modify it. Some of you fellows had that brought in. You ahead and prune it. (Laughter.) Summary As a tree comes into bearing, reduce heading back to a minimum. The tip of the growth from one-third of the distance from the end is where the fruit buds form. If we head back the growth, we cut off the portion that tends to produce the fruit. Heading back will produce more fruit, but it will reduce the actual number of fruit spurs. Thinning out, instead of tending toward producing new shoots, produces smaller ones. Because they are smaller, they finish their vegetative growth ear - lier in the season, and instead of being consumers, are producers earlier. As a tree comes into bearing, the removal of the entire shoots will, I believe, increase the tendency to fruit production. I would rather re - move lots of small limbs than to remove one big limb. The removal of a greater number of the smaller limbs will give you a better result than from the removal of one big one. THE PRESIDENT: I believe most of you would like to have this tree pruned. (Indicating the smaller of the trees brought in.) L PROFESSOR MERRILL: The first thing is to find those that are ded. This type of tree has been headed or stopped growing up there. It gives you a wealth of material to work on. In selecting your branches, </seg>
            <seg id="p515">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 517 you want to get them extended over a long space on the trunk. That will reduce any tendency to break at the crotches. Save one leader. If we have four limbs on a tree of this size, we have all we need. We could start with three branches, in which case each limb represents one - third of the productive part of the tree. I think theoretically we can make a better tree with fewer branches than with more, but we are taking greater chances. A windstorm or accident may remove one of the limbs, and the loss would be much greater. Therefore, we must hedge a little and leave four. I think that is one of the reasons four or five limbs are generally left. We do not want the very low limbs. We want to select branches distributed as far as possible along the trunk, and not so close to the ground that the rabbits can injure them. If there were no danger of rabbit injury, I would rather leave these lower ones. We also want the limbs distributed around the trunk. We like - wise have the laterals to consider. We want a certain branch to take priority in position and strength over others; to prevent the formation of weak crotches here, we must suppress these laterals. Q. When you find a tree of that age you thin out the main branches ? A. If you cut this whorl off, it will come back again. I think you will get more benefit by thinning than by severe heading. THE PRESIDENT: I am sure we have all enjoyed Mr. Merrill's talk. I feel the Central States Orchard Company, which operates eleven hundred acres of orchard, of which he is directly in charge, is fortunate in securing his services. I think he knows what he is talking about on this pruning proposition. I know it has been very instructive, and he has probably brought out some points we have not thought about. There is one thing I want to call attention to, and that is the dif - ference between thinning and cutting back. After a tree is seven or eight years old, it is not good policy to cut back. It is better to take off a limb close to the ground. Monday I was pruning off a lot of trees, but I did not have that distinction made to me. When I went to Iowa, I did not expect any scouts for Ames, because Nebraska is not playing Ames this year. There were a few who came over here. They wanted to see Arbor Lodge and came to where we were packing apples. I took them through the different plantings of different years. I did not say anything to him when he was at Nebraska City. But when I heard him talk to the Rotary club at Waterloo I knew I wanted him to come to these meetings to bring us a message from his exper - iences and observations in several of the states and Canada. At first we </seg>
            <seg id="p516">518 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE were at a loss to know just what to have Professor Pickett talk about. After talking it over with Mr. Hoppert and Mr. Pickett the subject as - signed him on the program was decided upon. I think Professor Pickett suggested it himself. At this time we will call on Professor Pickett, chairman of the Department of Horticulture at Ames, Iowa. His subject will be "The Outlook for Fruit Growing, particularly apples, in the Missouri River Section." I think we are very fortunate in having Professor Pickett here today, and I am sure we will appreciate his coming all the more when we have heard his message. </seg>

            <seg id="p518">520 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE rE OUTLOOK FOR FRUIT GROWING, PARTICULARLY APPLES, IN THE MISSOURI RIVER SECTION" Professor B. S. Pickett, Ames, Iowa Members of the Nebraska State Horticultural Society: It is rather a far-fetched idea that I would venture to suggest a subject of this kind. I must disclaim the credit — or otherwise — of having named the title of this address. My introduction to Nebraska came last fall rather auspiciously, so it seems to me. I did not come over to scout the Nebraska team, but Illinois, win one of the most neigh - seen in a long time. I do not know welcome on the part of one institu- I did come to see my alma mater, borly and pleasant victories I have when I have ever seen so kindly a tion to the team of another. The reason I think that was an auspicious introduction was it proves I college professor perfectly human when he will go to see a football me. As for visiting Nebraska City, we are not allowed in the course of ur regular business to wander over the edge of the state and stay all ight. It is all right to spend the' day out. I wanted to go to Nebraska 'ity, and being new to Iowa, it was convenient for me to lose my road as I was going to Hamburg, and after some time I found myself on a ridge across the river. It was too late to go back, so I got across the iver, and the next day had a nice visit with your President. The question of the outlook for fruit growing, and especially apple growing, in the Missouri valley, is one that calls for a certain amount of wophesy; and I can see how the gentlemen who arranged this program ound it convenient to get some one from out of the state to do that prophesying for them. I fell in for it, because I knew when we needed ome prophesying on the other side of the line, they would be all loaded with what we have told them to say, and they would say the same thing over there and get away with it. (Laughter.) </seg>
            <seg id="p519">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 521 The outlook for apple growing in any section is dependent on a number of factors which include favorable climatic conditions, suitable soils, available markets which will absorb all of the crop at profitable prices, and a labor supply competent to harvest and pack the crop at the correct time and within the amount of time available. Other factors which might influence the outlook for apple growing in any given region are the prevalance of insect and disease pests, the living conditions with - in the locality concerned with reference to churches, schools, entertain - ment and neighbors, and the presence of helpful co-operative enterprises. The best proof of the suitability of climatic and soil factors in the production of the apple crop is the success of existing orchards, partic - ularly if some of these have been cared for in a way that might be ex - pected to give reasonably good results. Continued cropping through considerable periods of years without serious losses from winter injury, spring frost, or drought is evidence of the general suitability of the cli - mate; and a vigorous growth of trees with satisfactory crops may be considered sufficient evidence of the adaptation of the soil. Moreover, the requirements as to soil for apples are well understood, and anyone conversant with soil types may make the applications of these require - ments to individual localities. The suitability of a region with regard to market conditions is less easily determined. It may be assumed, of course, that proximity to large populations is highly advantageous and that next to proximity good lines of transportation at reasonable rates are necessary. Generally, diseases and insects may be controlled by modern methods of spraying and orchard sanitation, but the difficulty or expense of con - trol may sometimes be so great as to make the insect and disease factor too serious to permit profitable orcharding. In regions where San Jose scale is extremely prevalent and deadly, the business is precarious and for certain varieties the prevalence of apple blotch, blister canker, fire blight or apple rust might be a limiting factor. The Missouri River region is, of course, extensive, so that climatic conditions vary considerably from northwest to southeast or from its head waters to its source and one would have to specify with some de - gree of accuracy definite localities within its basin or bordering its basin in considering the outlook for production within the region. Beginning, however, with a point somewhat above the Northern Nebraska line and running all the way to its confluence with the Mississippi, there are scattered apple orchards which are making fine records for productive - ness and quality of fruit. Frequently, these orchards tend to cluster about certain definite centers in such a way as to indicate some partic - ular, suitability or interest in the industry at these centers. These scat - tered centers doubtless are frequently the result of chance beginnings but their wide distribution indicates that in general, from the stand - point of maximum and minimum winter temperatures, prevalence of </seg>
            <seg id="p520">REPORT OF NKBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 522 spring frosts, rainfall and sunshine, the Missouri Valley possesses a type of climate fairly well adapted to apple growing. A study of the soils bordering the valley indicates unlimited areas highly adapted to the culture of this fruit. These areas lie within the typical Missouri loess types which are very deep and porous, and are generally supplied with the mineral elements of plant food in suitable proportions for a good growth and production of the apple. These soils vary with locality and degree of erosion in their content of nitrogen and to some extent in their content of other plant nutrients, but the varia - tion is within the limits which might be allowed in the selection of or - chard soils and the total area of land available is so large that the plant - er may avoid the less fertile areas in selecting his orchard sites. In the judgment of the speaker there are no soils in the apple growing regions of the entire country which possesses as many good qualities as media for the production of apples as the better Missouri loess soils. The climatic conditions prevalent through the year are generally favorable to the apple crop. There is an abundance of intense sunlight during the summer combined with enough rainfall in most seasons to mature the crop successfully. The winter climate is somewhat uncertain, but winter injury to buds and wood is confined to very tender varieties only, standard varieties of reasonable hardiness withstanding the most severe winters successfully. There is also some danger of root killing in bare soils during dry winters, particularly following dry autumns. Generally speaking, the diseases and insect factor is less serious from the Southern Nebraska line to the northern line in the Missouri valley than in most apple growing localities. There remains, therefore, to be considered as the principal factor which should determine the outlook for apple growing in this part of the Missouri Valley the question of markets and transportation to markets. There is an enormous general market in the United States for ap - ples. The center of population for the country is in the state of In - diana not far from the western edge of the state. The bulk of the popu - lation, therefore, lies considerably east of the Missouri Valley and from the standpoint of proximity is less favorably located than New York, the Virginias, Michigan, Indiana or Illinois. There have been developed, however, successful apple growing regions in the states of Washington, Oregon, California, Colorado and Idaho which have the disadvantage of locations considerably farther from the markets than those of the Miss - ouri Valley; and by comparison with these the Missouri Valley growers have a large advantage. The general markets are reached, of course, through the organized marketing agencies of the country, ehiefly the fruit and produce dealers </seg>
            <seg id="p521">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 523 in the large cities, and the business of marketing the apple crop profit - ably or otherwise is based primarily on the law of supply and demand. Any consideration of the outlook for apple growing must, therefore, in - volve a consideration of the possibility or probability of an overproduc - tion due to extensive planting, improved methods of culture and a greater saving from waste of that part of the crop which, in the past, has been lost by careless methods of handling. If the apple has been overplanted or if recently there have been raised crops of apples which clearly oversupplied the market demands, it behooves orchardists who propose to produce the fruit for the general market to avoid heavy planting and concentrate their efforts on small areas in such a way as to reduce overheads and increase acreage yields. If, on the other hand, there is unmistakable evidence of light planting and a strong demand with good prices, orchardists could reasonably hope to extend their plantings profitably. It is one thing, however, to lay down principles of the kind just stated as generalities and quite another thing to apply them to partic - ular cases. Moreover, it is not easy to analyze the whole orchard sit - uation and reduce it to simple factors of the kind above described. In 1923 the market failed to absorb the crop at profitable prices. In 1924, it used the crop readily and prices were satisfactory. In 1923 there was a comparatively heavy production. In 1924 the crop was much smaller. Therefore, at first glance, the low prices of 1923 might be attributed to overproduction, but many students of the subject think the low prices might have been avoided but for faulty methods of distribution and faulty and expensive retail marketing and they point to the fact that the potential consumption of apples for the country is many millions of bushels in excess of the total production in years of full crop. The writer believes that, for practical purposes, we may be said to have occasional years of overproduction, years when all the leading apple districts in the country produce crops at the same time, but that years of overproduction are and will continue for a long time to come to be rare. Except for these unusual years, production falls below the demand for apples of good quality, appearance, and market condition; and good orchard managers will not only be able to produce satisfactory crops in these years, but also be in a position to market them profitably. The writer further believes that a market for apples can be cultivated which will result in using twice as many as are now consumed and that this market will inevitably be cultivated successfully during the next decade to an extent that will considerably increase the consumption of this fruit. This cultivation of a larger demand for apples will come about through supplying the market with grades and varieties suitable for all of its demands, through co-operation between wholesalers and retailers along the lines now developed between the citrus fruit growers and the grocers of the entire country, through campaigns of national </seg>
            <seg id="p522">524 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE advertising, and through the expansion of co-operation in one form and another in marketing this fruit, this latter form of co-operation extend - ing beyond mere associations of orchardists banded together for greater unity of action to a personal co-operation with dealers and consumers. In addition to the general market there is always to be considered le local market, especially in regions like the Missouri Valley where »e orchards are generally scattered through localities where the major nterests are live stock and grain farming, or in the neighborhood of owns where most of the people are concerned in industrial life. There re very few orchards in Iowa and Nebraska or those parts of Missouri and Kansas in the neighborhood of the two Kansas Cities which do not lave a considerable local field for the sale of apples. There are 93 ounties in Nebraska. Assuming that cultural conditions were favorable in each county, how many counties in the state are there which could ot consume the fruit from one additional 40-acre apple orchard ? There re 99 counties in Iowa. There is no question that everyone of these ould consume all the apples which might be raised on an additional 0-acre orchard which might be located within its boundaries. In Ne - iraska this would allow for 3720 acres of additional orchard, the product f which could be consumed by the state itself. In Iowa it would allow or 4060 acres more good orchards than the state now possesses and r ould crowd no one now in the business. The commercial apple production of the United States varies from 60 to 90 million bushels per year with a general average of about 75 million bushels. The commercial crop is placed in the hands of perhaps ;wo-thirds to three-quarters of the population, so that the per capita onsumption of those to whom it is made available is about one bushel. "his demand will fluctuate slightly according to conditions of prosperity, &gt;ut it is sufficiently steady to be counted upon regularly. In the inter - sts of health, food value, correct diet, and enjoyment, this consumption </seg>

That this small increase per capita, meaning so much to the total bulk moved, can be affected by more intelligent dis - tribution and marketing is not to be questioned, and this fact with the fact that local distribution and consumption can be greatly increased leads the writer to be optomistic regarding the outlook for apple growing in the whole country and therefore, also in the Missouri Valley. Each orchardist, of course, must not only consider the general out - look for orcharding, but must also consider the outlook with reference to his own individual location and circumstances. The income from or - charding is likely to fluctuate more widely from year to year than that from many other lines of farming. For this reason it is risky for a man operating on a very small capital to plant larger areas than his means will permit him to care for through those seasons when he meets with crop failure. Failures in orcharding are more likely to occur through the inability of the operator to finance his operations during years following poor crops or poor prices than through any general un - soundness in the business itself and difficulties of this kind are necess - arily attached to any business where the overhead is heavy and the turnover is not more frequent than once a year. Orchardists with small capital should resist the temptation to expand their holdings beyond their probable ability to meet their difficulties either during the period when the orcharding is growing to maturity or in seasons of poor crop and low prices after it comes into bearing. Personal attention to and per - formance of most of the labor in the orchard by the owner up to har - vesting time and the sacrifice of individual comforts will balance capital to some extent and the outlook for final success may well be dependent on the way in which the individual meets his difficulties at this stage of his orchard career. From the standpoint of the individual the ultimate outlook in or - charding is often dependent on his interest in and love for the business. There are few states from Nebraska to Maine and from Wisconsin and Michigan to Georgia and Texas which do not claim to produce the best apples that can be grown anywhere in the world and each one backs these claims with considerable evidence to prove their cases. Very often this means that individual growers within these states, by their enter - prise, attention to details of the business and ability to take advantage of local condition of climate, soil or market are successful in spite of handicaps of one kind and another. When the last word is said and done, therefore, the outlook for a successful business in apple growing is as much dependent on the energy and character of the grower as upon his locality. In conclusion, the writer, believes that there are great numbers of </seg>
            <seg id="p524">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 526 ideal sites and soils in the Missouri Valley for the location of apple or - chards; that the climatic conditions are sufficiently favorable to permit the development of profitable apple orcharding throughout the Valley as far north as Omaha and Council Bluffs; that many suitable sites may be found; that from the vicinity beyond Omaha and Council Bluffs as far as the northern Nebraska boundary, of Kansas City northward the insect and disease factor is less serious than in many other apple sections; that market and transportation facilities are intermediate in desirability; that the fruit of the Valley from Kansas City northward generally has a superior finish as to brilliancy of color, and finally that, up to this time, local plantings do not seem to be overdone. Although the topic suggests a consideration of fruits other than pple, the writer is not in a position to offer authoritative advice as to leir futures. Cherries of the Montmorency and Richmond types appear o be well adapted to some localities within the Valley, but cherry plant - ng has probably more nearly reached the overproduction point for the ountry at large than has apple planting. There are, however, no im - ;ortant cherry raising centers within long distances of Missouri Valley oints, and excellent local demands for considerable amounts of this fruit lould not be difficult of development. It is probable too that a limited anning business for cherries could be developed at points where labor or picking and conditions for growing are favorable. The cherry has le advantage of coming into bearing young and giving returns early. !THE PRESIDENT: I assure you, Professor Pickett, we appreciate .ving you here.

SEED POTATO DEMONSTRATION By Alice Forsling and Arnold Gadeken, of Bushnell The youthful participants in this interesting feature of the pro - gram came equipped with a map of Nebraska, charts, and a variety of tubers to illustrate their points. It was a very clear-cut demonstration. They mentioned the diseases which affect Nebraska potatoes, and em - phasized the importance of proper seed selection. "In treating for rhizoctonia," said Miss Alice, "add four ounces cor - rosive sublimate to a gallon of hot water. Then add to this enough water to make thirty gallons of solution. Mix in a wooden or concrete pail. Dip the potatoes in this and let them remain from one to one anil one-half hours." As she was speaking, Arnold was giving an actual demonstration of the dipping process. Their work was roundly applauded. THE SECRETARY: This is one of the phases of the work we are emphasizing at the present time. I will ask Mr. Hunt, the county agent of Kimball, to rise. He is responsible in a large measure for the train - ing of this team, and Mrs. Forsling for a great share, also. tTHE PRESIDENT: Several times we in south eastern Nebraska ve tried to get certified seed and could not get it. How is the supply, a rule? MR. G. A. HUNT, (County Agent Kimball Co.) : That is a problem which I think it is well to discuss here. The buyers of seed potatoes in the south have been willing to pay higher prices for certified seed potatoes than the farmers of eastern Nebraska; and the farmers in our district who were certified seed potato growers have been growing Bliss Triumphs and shipping them south. Whenever the demand in eastern Nebraska is such that the farmers ere willing to pay for the quality which is found in our certified seed potatoes ,then western Nebraska can furnish the Early Ohio potatoes to you just as it is now furnishing the Triumphs to the southern growers. The Early Ohios are just as well adapted to our region. The trials made with western Nebraska-grown Ohio's have given higher results than northern or home-grown seed. The problem is to get the demand a little larger down here. That is one reason this team is going over eastern Nebraska to show some of the benefits of this seed. </seg>
            <seg id="p527">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 529 THE PRESIDENT: Your statement as to southern buyers paying more for seed is similar to the problem the apple growers have. The ■only Nebraska apples the people of this state see are the culls or second grade. Our No. 1 stuff goes to other markets. I do not believe a man can buy a barrel of No. 1 apples raised in Nebraska if he wanted to. He could buy No. l's and 2's packed together, but I do not know where he would go to get a barrel of No. 1 apples in'this state, that were grown here. I know a concern with 38 cars of Nebraska apples in Omaha, but not a car of No. l's among them. It seems as though we might arrange ■a little demonstration of our own on something of that nature. I sup - pose they could buy in the fall by going to the orchard. Two years ago in Kansas City at the Central States Horticultural Exposition, they were telling of the excellent qualities of Missouri Valley apples. Two men were picked to find them on the market. They hunted all morning and found one place with two baskets of Missouri-grown apples. They could find all the western apples they wanted to. The Missouri apples which they found were, you might say, culls. They said, "We have our doubts about these statements that you are growing such good apples in the Missouri valley, because we can't find them." That is a little exaggerated. It just happened they were not on the market that day. The reason people can not buy No. 1 Nebraska apples is the same reason Mr. Hunt gave on potatoes. Something should be done about it. The next talk is "Fertilizing the Apple Orchard," by Professor Pickett of Ames. We are rather imposing on Mr. Pickett and Mr. Mer - rill today, but they are so well posted on these things, Mr. Hoppert took it upon himself to put them down for as many talks as he could. It gives me pleasure to call on Professor Pickett. FERTILIZING THE APPLE ORCHARD B. S. Pickett, Chief in Horticulture, Iowa State College It is with a great deal of diffidence I appear before you again, and particularly to follow so remarkably well planned and staged a demon - stration as the one which your school girl and boy have just given.

It is a lesson to all of us in the preparation of our mater - ials when we are disposed to say something supposed to be worth while to those who come long distances to hear the talks. </seg>
            <seg id="p528">/ REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 530 It has been my fortune to give a good deal of attention to the ques - tion "of orchard fertilization, practically from the time I first got into college work and the general field of horticulture. In 1908 I went to the State of New Hampshire, where my prede - cessor had just been instrumental in securing an orchard to be used for a series of soil treatment experiments. It fell to my lot to inaugurate the work and carry it forward for a period of four years. Later it fell to my lot to take care of some experiments started by the University of Illinois on soil treatment in 1913 or '14, and see - those through to their conclusion in about 1916; also to inaugurate with - in the state some four or five sets of soil treatment experiments which had not been started at the time I went in 1912. For these reasons, it is a temptation to me to talk at too great length on the subject and take it up from entirely too many different angles. I have therefore committed most of the facts which I wanted to bring to your attention to writing, chiefly for the sake of brevity and in the hope I might touch the principal points and omit none of those which should be touched at some angle in such a talk. FERTILIZING THE APPLE ORCHARD B. S. Pickett, Chief in Horticulture, Iowa State College It has been amply demonstrated that mature apple orchards bearing profitable crops deplete the soil of plant nutrients including nitrogen, hosphorous, potassium and calcium more rapidly than wheat, corn or most forage crops. This fact has been somewhat obscured because apple trees continue to grow in the same soil and often without fertilization for ong periods of years. In fact, under conditions of entire neglect there are often found in New York and New England trees which are 75 or </seg>
            <seg id="p529">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 531 100 years old. The fact, however, that apple trees sometimes live to considerable ages in soils which are known to be comparatively poor has no particular bearing on the question of the need of fertilization or the potential demand for plant food by the apple. It merely indicates that the apple lives up to its opportunities rather than to its possibilities. In other words, by means of its deep root system and its hardiness, the tree will remain alive and exist in some sort of way through long per - iods of years under adverse conditions, but it certainly will not produce paying crops year after year under the same circumstances. All apple orchards require fertility. Not all apple orchards require the application of fertilizers. The orchardist must, therefore, study his own soils and the responses of his trees intelligently in order to deter - mine their fertilizer needs and to supply them economically. Some of the variable conditions which orchardists might expect to meet in determin - ing rational methods of supplying plant nutrients for their trees would include the age of the trees concerned, the possibilities of cultivating the soil, the potential "content of plant food already in the soil, the character of the intercrop, if an intercrop is being grown, the existing condition of health, vigor, and productiveness of the tree, previous treatment of the orchard, and often the financial position of the orchardist with refer - ence to his ability to buy fertilizers, supply cultivation or give other needed care and attention. Newly planted trees are never in a position to use plant food freely because of their limited root system and because considerable time is required during the early part of their first growing season to become established so that their roots may begin to function. It is highly ad - vantageous, however, that they have the advantage of a fertile soil in which to begin their growth in order to develop as rapidly as possible. There is considerable evidence to show that phosphorous fertilizers are stimulating to root development, and when one adds to this evidence the well-known fact that nitrogen fertilizers are stimulating to leaf growth it would seem advantageous to give newly planted trees an ap - plication of a combined phosphorous and nitrogen fertilizer. A good fer - tilizer for this is half a pound of acid phosphate and a quarter of a pound of sodium nitrate applied to a circle about two feet across and dug in around the tree about three weeks after planting. If the planting is done in the fall, fertilizer may be worked in as soon as convenient in the spring. The same quantities may be used in the same manner dur - ing the second year and the amount increased thereafter if the trees seem to be responding satisfactorily to the treatment. It would be quite easy, of course ,to overdo the fertilization of young trees particularly from the second year forward, as their root systems expand rapidly when once established and they already have the advantage of a wide range of soil from which to draw nourishment. Although potash is omitted from the above recommendation, it is </seg>
            <seg id="p530">532 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE kely to give some results on sandy soil and occasionally on other types as well. As a rule, it appears not to be needed, but the orchardist can determine whether or not this is the case by treating a few trees with muriate of potash as an addition to the other fertilizers referred o. A quarter of a pound should be enough for a newly planted tree or or a tree in its second season of growth and the amount might be in - reased thereafter at the rate of two ounces per year as long as it con - nued to show satisfactory results. Stable manure is a complete type of fertilizer and wonderfully ef - ective in stimulating growth in young trees. Unfortunately, it is not Iways available, and if it must be purchased or hauled long distances &gt;y freight, it is more expensive than the commercial fertilizers above escribed. When available it will be found most effective used as a top ressing applied in late fall or winter and distributed as far from the trunks of the trees as the spread of the branches. The effects of fer - lizing with stable manure are, of course, felt through a period of sev - ral years, an advantage which it enjoys over the nlore soluble com - mercial fertilizers whose principal effects may be observed the first season after application, though they are by no means confined to one eason only. Although it is possible to overstimulate the rate of growth of apple rees by heavy fertilization, this condition seldom prevails. Good ferti - ization attended by very moderate pruning after the trees are three or 'our years old is usually accompanied by a sufficient growth of branches &gt;oth as to size and number to give the right type of growth for the arly development of fruit buds. From the time that trees are five to fteen years of age they are developing their fruiting habits and the ecision to apply or withhold fertilizers must be based on the behavior of he trees during this period. If the trees fail to come into bearing at he age when the varieties concerned ordinarily begin to bear they have irobably been overstimulated or understimulated as to growth. This must be determined by considering their size with reference to their age. f the trees are smaller than well-grown trees of the varieties concerned hould be at that age, they require more plant nutrients than they have leen receiving. If they are larger than most trees of the same variety or their age, possess unusually large dark green leaves, and look sappy and immature in the fall, they are receiving too much water or too much timulation from plant nutrients in the soil. The correction for trees of the first type is, of course, an increased Mipply of plant food as a result of cultivation, irrigation, or the direct application of fertilizers, any one of which means might be sufficient in tself under certain circumstances. The problem of checking a super - uxuriant growth is rare, and it is more complicated than that of stimu - ating a weak growth. The means at the disposal of the orchardist are the withholding of water where irrigation is practiced, the withholding of </seg>
            <seg id="p531">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 533 fertilizers, though the effect of this may not be noticed for two or three years, and the use of an intercrop to use up the superabundant plant nutrients and water from the soil. During the period when the fruiting habit of the tree is forming the orchardist should study his trees carefully to encourage the bearing habit to become fixed as rapidly as possible. This is most likely to re - sult from moderate annual applications of fertilizer or their equivalent in green manures and cultivation. The trees are most likely to be thrown out of balance by spasmodic treatments. It must not be assumed that because one pound of fertilizer is beneficial to a tree two pounds will be more beneficial. It is quite possible that the excess amount may be detrimental. The mistake is frequently made in orcharding of trying - to make up three or four years of neglect by a season of intensive culti - vation accompanied frequently by heavy applications of stable manure or other fertilizers and the results are usually much less satisfactory than the orchardist hoped. What fertilizers are likely to be needed during the period when the trees are forming their fruiting habits, or approximately from the ages of five to fifteen years ? Bearing in mind the suggestions already made on ways to determine the probable plant food needs of the trees, the following general recommendations may be made: 1. For orchards under good tillage, very moderate applications of complete fertilizers preferably applied in years of crop. Beginning with a five year old tree this might be a half a pound of sodium nitrate or ammonium sulphate, half a pound of muriate of potash and a pound of acid phosphate. On the whole it would be worth while to experiment with a fertilizer without the muriate of potash, as potassium does not produce marked results as an apple fertilizer in a great many soils. 2. For orchards growing in grass, in unusually sterile soils, or where intercropping is intensively practiced, use the same fertilizers which are recommended for No. 1, but make the applications annually and increase the quantities if growth is slow. Stable manure may be substituted for commercial fertilizers throughout this period with good results where it is available at reason - able cost for transportation and application. In soils of average fertility only light applications should be made in any one year. It is better to apply lightly at frequent intervals than heavily at widely separated periods. During the period from five to fifteen years of age it must be re - membered that the trees have a wide soil area in which to forage and that, planted at standard orchard distances, they are widely enough separated from each other to insure each tree receiving the maximum effect of light. The trees are, therefore, in an advantageous position </seg>
            <seg id="p532">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 534 to grow rapidly and, bearing as yet only light to moderate crops, are less likely to need large supplies of plant food than at any other stage during their lives. The orchardist must, therefore, be cautioued to with - hold fertilizers or other treatments which liberate plant food superabund - antly if the trees show unmistakable evidences of overluxuriant growth. From the time that the apple orchard comes into full bearing till it reaches its period of maximum production the orchardist is confronted with the problem of maintaining a rather nice balance in the nutrition of the trees in order to encourage as nearly annual bearing as possible and a satisfactory production. Granting that the trees have sufficient light and sufficient moisture the condition of the balance may be de - termined in the following way: tl. If the trees are bearing heavily and with reasonable regularity s evident that the balance is already correct and that the treatment Effect through the years of satisfactory production should not be atly changed. 2. If the trees are growing luxuriantly but are not producing sat - isfactorily, the balance should be disturbed by withholding fertilizers and by intercropping to use up the superabundant plant food, exactly as in the case of trees of the younger group. 3. If the trees are growing slowly and show evident signs of lack of thrift and are bearing poorly, there is unmistakable evidence that the balance must be disturbed in favor of fertilization or conditions that furnish more plant food. Indeed, it is with trees in this condition that the highly satisfactory results which have been reported many times from applications of commercial fertilizers and stable manure have oc- bWhat fertilizers should be applied for trees which require more plant than they are receiving during this period when they should be ucing their best crops? There is much good experimental evidence to show that nitrogen is the plant nutrient most likely to give beneficial results at this time, but there is also evidence to show that profitable increases above those pro - duced by nitrogen sometimes result from the addition of phosphorous or potassium or even both phosphorous and potassium to the nitrogen ration. In sandy soils or soils known to be poor in plant food one might reasonably expect good results from the combined fertilizers. In ordin - arily fertile loams nitrogen alone is likely to give as good results as nitrogen in combination with the other fertilizers. In general practice, it has been found that four to six pounds of sodium nitrate per tree applied when the buds first begin to show green in the spring is very helpful in stimulating growth of a kind that leads to the formation of vigorous fruit buds. The orchardist may, however, experiment on small </seg>
            <seg id="p533">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 535 areas within his orchard at very low cost with the addition of acid phos - phate and muriate of potash to the nitrogen fertilizer. Acid phosphate may be applied at the same rate as the sodium nitrate of potash at about half the rate. The question is frequently asked whether, by methods of fertiliza - tion, trees can be made to bear annually. There is considerable evidence to show that regular fertilization tends to promote annual bearing, but there is equally good evidence to show that fertilization alone will seldom do more than produce a marked tendency in that direction. Correct prun - ing, and thinning superabundant crops early in the season, coupled with a well-considered scheme of fertilization will correct biennial bearing in the case of varieties like Winesap, Jonathan, Grimes, Ben Davis, Stay - man, and Mclntosh, which already have some tendency to bear annually, but they are unlikely to alter the biennial tendencies of such varieties as Duchess, Wealthy and York Imperial enough to be profitable to the orchardist. Most of the experimental work which has been performed with fertilization of apple orchards has involved annual applications of the fertilizers in equal amounts each year and there is little direct evi - dence to prove that varying the amount or character of the fertilization from year to year will affect the biennial bearing habit. It seems prob - able, however, that heavy fertilization in the years of large crop and moderate or light fertilization in years of light crop would tend to en - courage annual bearing. This would almost certainly be the case in or - chards where the trees were abundantly provided with light and mois - ture, but would not necessarily follow in overcrowded orchards or in dry seasons unless irrigation could be practiced. Heavy fertilization, partic - ularly with nitrogen fertilizers, produces large leaves and many of them. Consequently, the transportation of water will be greater from a heavily fertilized orchard than from one not so fertilized. If the supply of moisture runs low in mid-summer the foliage will be maintained at the expense of size of fruit and to some extent at the expense of vigor of fruit buds for the following season's crops. Generally, however, a heavy application of fertilizers during the bearing year and one perhaps half as heavy in the off year should help to steady production. When apple trees have passed the period of maximum bearing and have reached the period of decline, they are almost certain to require more plant food than they receive, but the conditions under which they are growing will influence the character of the treatment required so greatly that some special consideration must be given to the problem which they present before recommending specific fertilizer treatments. It must first be remembered that the principal weight of the dry matter in trees and fruit consists of carbon and this is taken from the air and not from the soil. It would be comparatively simple to apply enough fertilizers to the soil to supply the trees with all the plant nutrients they could use, but when trees become closely crowded or diseased the amount of foliage available for absorption of carbon dioxide from the </seg>
            <seg id="p534">536 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE !mosphere may be too small to balance the supply of mineral nutrients tning from the soil. Further, the leaves are the agents for transform - j inorganic plant food into organic forms useful for growth within e plant and the dynamic energy which brings about the transformation light. Crowded trees of large size are too shaded to make the most this energy and, therefore, are not in a position to utilize enough ant food required. Further, in many seasons and in locations where e summer rainfall is small, the moisture supply is insufficient to trans - rt the required plant nutrients for very large trees in crowded or - ards even though they are present in the soil in sufficient quantities. The facts above stated complicate the problem of fertilizing very d and crowded orchards and preclude the possibility of predicting as irofitable results from fertilization as occur in younger and less crowded rchards. However, moderately profitable results usually follow fertili - zation in such orchards, where, owing to long continued cropping, the oil is often deficient in plant nutrients. Under these conditions com - ete fertilizers may be more helpful than nitrogen fertilizer alone, al - lough nitrogen alone may be the only fertilizer needed. The rational eatment for neglected orchards of very large old trees is a thinning the trees by the removal of every other one, or a severe pruning of 1 the trees to reduce their size and admit light to the branches which remain. If the trees are pruned heavily no fertilizer should be applied or two or three years after the pruning is done because this form of ■uning will be followed by a vigorous growth of shoots from the buds hich are permitted to remain on the trees. Throughout the fertilization of apple orchards nitrogen stands out as le element most likely to be useful at all stages. There is considerable ifference of opinion as to the form in which it should be applied. Among commercial fertilizers it is usually applied as sodium nitrate or am - monium sulphate. There is much evidence to show that sodium nitrate is very satisfactory commercial form. Ammonium sulphate, although car - rying more nitrogen than sodium nitrate and although it has been used or a long time as a fertilizer for field crops, has been less used in ex - erimental work in orcharding and its value as compared with sodium nitrate is not yet definitely established. As it is a by-product from gas and coke manufacture, it is to be hoped that it will be found as effective s sodium nitrate in orchard fertilization. Among organic manures, stable manure and leguminous green man - ures are the outstanding conveyers of nitrogen. Indeed, in numerous experiments performed throughout the country there are decided proofs bat legumes plowed into the soil or even used as mulches may supply nough nitrogen to meet the needs of apple crops above those supplied rom the soil direct through long periods of years. </seg>

Yes, but I have not observed the results closely enough to feel I could say I knew whether they were especially helpful then or not. We know they are helpful put on three or four weeks before. I doubt if they are anything like as helpful applied at blooming time or any time later. Dr. Stuart, who made many experiments in Pennsylvania, claims in one year he had remarkable results from an application made in July for the crop for the following season; yet his brother horticulturists have wondered what the condition of affairs was to make that possible. That is long after the ordinary time for the formation of fruit buds. These little short spurs that are so freely distributed over this tree are germinated with rather large buds. These buds on the Jonathan fool us once in a while. We will suppose these big round buds are fruit buds. They will form next spring about the first of May, and there will grow from the sides of these spurs little short growths that will continue the growth of the spur in the next year. On the spur growths it is probable the new fruit growths are formed within a few days of blooming time, or almost simultaneously with blooming. If one is going to affect the formation of fruit buds, he must put this fertilizer on in time. As there are comparatively few leaves at that time, it is evident there can not be a great deal of chance to nutrients and carbon dioxide taken in by the leaves to make the raw materials from which new growth can occur un - less we put the fertilizer in early enough to take them up into the tree. We feel quite sure that early application of fertilizer in the spring is necessary. Q. What is the effect of putting crushed lime on an orchard. A. Usually none at all. Sometimes it is very valuable in making a soil fit to grow legumes on to turn under. For an occasional soil dis - tinctly wanting in lime, it might be beneficial, but the apple does well in many soils acid in reaction. Experiments in Illinois show no response by trees in the way of fruit produced by the application of lime. Q. Is sulphur of any benefit? A. Probably of none whatever. Trees require a certain amount of sulphur. It is a rare soil that does not have enough already. It is very dubious if sulphur is very beneficial. THE PRESIDENT: I am sure we appreciate Professor Pickett's second talk very much, and I know there are a number of men here who are very much interested in what he has told them. There has been a lot of talk in the state regarding orchard fertilizing for the past four </seg>

The next address was supposed to be given by Guy Shubert who has had some actual experience in the fertilization of orchards. As I under - stand it, this preliminary work was done on young orchards. Mr. Frank Shubert has kindly consented to talk on this subject for Guy, and tell his ■experiences in the use of it. Mr. Frank Shubert is probably one of the largest individual growers of apples in the state, and one of the most successful. We are pleased to call on Mr. Shubert. "OUR EXPERIENCE WITH SODIUM NITRATE" Mx. J. F. Shubert, Shubert, Nebraska [Mr. President, Members of the Nebraska State Horticultural Society, ulies and Gentlemen: In listening to Professor Pickett, I am fearing me of you might think I wrote his speech. (Laughter.) I want to sure you I did not. I am also glad I reduced to writing what little I id to say, because he has used up most of my ammunition. However, am mighty glad I was here to hear that, because I find it is right in le with our experience. We have had some little experience with sodium nitrate. We do not know much about any of the other fertilizers with the exception of stable manure. Some years ago we did use a little of the ammonium sulphate — just one year. We thought we had good results, but from that we went to the nitrate and find we have had the best success with that material. First I will give the results of experiments we did not make our - selves, and finish with some of the experiences we have actually had. That nitrogen is the limiting element of plant food in many apple orchards is indicated by the results of investigations on the fertilization of apple trees conducted for a number of years past at several state -agricultural experiment stations. Studies over a period of six years at the Pennsylvania Agricultural Experiment Station brought out the following conclusions: 1. Applications of nitrogen and phosphates and of manure were •very beneficial, while potash alone was of little value. 2. Nitrate of soda alone gave a large increase in yield over the -check plots, with a still greater increase when acid phosophate was ap - plied with the nitrate. The increase in one instance being as much as 100 bu. per acre. 3. The beneficial effects of nitrogenous fertilizers were evident by tbft middle of the second season. </seg>
            <seg id="p537">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 539 4. The gains from fertilizations have not been transient. In some experiments they were greater in the sixth and the last year of the experiment than at any other time. 5. Nitrogenous fertilizers when applied too late retarded somewhat the maturity of the fruit. For this reason, the apples too did not have as good a color as those on the check trees, when the latter were picked, but when left on the trees until the same degree of maturity was reached, the nitrate treated fruit showed a better color than the check plot. 6. The application of nitrate is recommended not later than the middle of July. 7. It is concluded that more nitrogen and less potash than com - monly recommended should be used on the average orchard in need of fertilization. 8. When the crop is light, smaller applications are required, be - cause of the natural tendency of the trees to develop a sufficient number of fruit buds in the off season. In the full years the applications should be rather liberal to pre - vent the total absence of a crop the following year. At the West Virginia station, investigations over a period of nine years had shown that while the lack of fertility is not generally the lim - iting factor in apple production in this state, nitrogenous fertilizers proved beneficial in some cases. Their conclusions are: 1. Old bearing trees on soil of low fertility, even though cultivated and sowed to cover crops, may respond profitably to the application of a desired nitrogen carrying fertilizer. 2. Young bearing apple trees on soil low in fertility will be bene fited by nitrate of soda. 3. Nitrogen applied in March or June is less beneficial than if ap - plied just as the fruit buds are breaking, usually the first of May. 4. Commercial fertilizers are of value as a tonic or quick restora - tive for starved or devitalized trees. 5. Trees making only a few inches terminal growth and with leaves turning yellow early in the season should be supplied with some quickly available form of nitrogen. Recent studies at the Missouri Agricultural Experiment Station show an interesting effect of nitrate upon spur growth: 1. Spring applications of nitrogenous fertilizers to help the bearing - trees gave an increase set of fruit associated with a greater nitrogen content in the spurs during the period of fruit setting. </seg>
            <seg id="p538">540 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 2. The rate of growth of non-bearing trees was increased. 3. Nitrate of soda stimulated leader growth on very young trees more than did dried blood. b4. The later in the season nitrogenous fertilizers are applied, the ter is the nitrogen content of the spurs the following spring im - iately before growth begins. At the Ohio Station large increases were procured from applica - tions of nitrate to neglected orchards in sod: tl. Nitrogen was the only element of fertility which was of direct fit to the apple trees themselves from the stand-point of fruitfulness vigor. 2. Applications of nitrate of soda alone (five pounds per tree) in - creased the average yield in some instances as much as 450 percent and in three experiments averaged a cash gain per acre of $125.75 per year for five years. bOhio experiments have also shown more profitable yields from a lizer mixture containing 5.6 percent available nitrogen than one of 3.5 percent available nitrogen. A nine year test in New Hampshire resulted in 26 per cent greater growth for the fertilized plot than for the check. In Oregon also the influence of fertilizers on devitalized trees was tested. The orchards were cultivated but had no cover crop. The starved trees responded to applications of nitrate of soda by out-yielding the check trees 11 to 1 in one orchard and 24 to 1 in another. Under most conditions nitrate should be applied early in the spring a week or ten days before the blossoms open when there is likely to be sufficient rain fall to wash the salts in to the ground where the roots can take it up. It is never advisable to apply nitrate in late summer or fall because there is usually so much rainfall that the salts would be dissolved and go so deeply in to the ground that most of it would be lost. Experiments at the Indiana Station begun in 1917 have shown re - markable increases in yield as a result of applications of nitrogeneous fertilizer, the fertilized trees in 1920 producing about three times as much as the check trees. Trees in sod in 1919 showed a greater response to nitrate of soda than those under clean cultivation. Recent reports indicate that the applications of nitrate of soda in late summer may have a very beneficial effect upon .growth the follow - ing spring; but sufficient data is not yet available to definitely establish this point. If this effect should be found to be general, applications of nitrate </seg>
            <seg id="p539">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 541 ■•of soda in late summer may prove to be very useful in promoting the spur growth in the spring, thus influencing the set of fruit especially on weak trees, which may be partially or wholly defoliated by spray in - jury or other cause. It would seem that on all but exceptional soils, some artificial ferti - lization will pay the apple grower. Of all the common plant food ele - ments, nitrogen appears to be the most important for apples. The requirements for different soils vary so widely that no general formula for fertilizer applications can be given. To get the best results, the grower needs to know his soil and study the growth of his trees; he can guage his fertilizer needs from their behavior. Stable manure applied at the rate of eight to ten tons per acre an - nually is a good fertilizer. Commercial fertilizers, however, have given equally good results, and their use is becoming more common. As a rule, for soils generally depleted in fertility, the following may be rec - ommended for mature trees as a basis, to be modified according to local needs. Nitrate of soda four hundred pounds to the acre when scattered over the entire surface of the ground, or five pounds per tree to be scat - tered evenly under the trees, to reach out about as far as the limbs go. Young trees planted on thin land where the leaves appear yellow and the trees are making slow growth should have one or two pounds of nitrate of soda early in the spring just before the leaves start. We find from our own experience that these trees will make a much better growth, that the leaves will be large and dark green and look vigorous, and no doubt trees that are about ready to bear will form fruit spurs and come in to bearing earlier by use of nitrate. We have been using nitrate in the orchards of Shubert Brothers at Shubert, Nebraska, in Richardson County since 1917 with good results. I wish to tell you especially about one of our forty acre blocks that had been bearing heavily for a number of years. It began to slow up on production and for three years or so the crops were light. Some years it bloomed well but did not set a good crop of fruit; along in the summer the leaves would look thin and be pale yellow in color and very few fruit buds would form. This meant a short crop the next year. In 191T\ we started using nitrate of soda five pounds to the tree scattered under trees out about as far as the limbs extended, at the same time doing quite a lot of cultivating with a disk. The first year showed a very decided in - crease of fruit on the trees so treated, while the trees not treated with nitrate showed the same weakened condition as before. We have con - tinued the use of nitrate with such satisfactory results that we are now applying it to practically all of our old trees and we feel that it is paying - us good dividends. We have also used it this year on the orchards of the Loess Land and Orchard Company near Shubert, Nebraska, mostly on young trees </seg>
            <seg id="p540">542 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRIOTLTHRE ilanted on thin land that were not making satisfactory growth. These rees responded quickly to the application of nitrate, showing a more vigorous twig growth as well as a heavy leaf formation which stayed on the trees until very late in the fall. We do not especially recommend nitrate for young trees on good soil but there is no doubt of its value on poor land. From our experience nitrogen is evidently the best ferti - izer for Nebraska as its application has resulted in an annual increase n production. Contrary to a common impression the time required for results to appear has been surprisingly short. Both the value of fertili - zation and the elements especially needed were quite evident the first season and more clearly established the second season. Another fairly common impression is that the influence of fertilizers is soon gone and that even where favorable at first. Their effect soon wears out and they leave the soil worse than before. Our experience shows that this is not so. On the contrary, it seems to be well estab - lished that the beneficial effects of nitrogen fertilizers increase from year to year. It is evidently impossible at this time to consider all our experiments in detail, although we are convinced /that the use of nitrate has mater - ially increased our yield and has improved the wood growth, increased the foliage and added considerably to the size of our apples in South Eastern Nebraska. We believe that the quantity of nitrate of soda to apply to apple trees should be about as follows: Trees, five to ten years old, growing well, none. Trees, five to ten years old, growing poorly, 1% to 2 pounds per Trees, ten to fifteen years old, growing well, none Trees, ten to fifteen years old, growing poorly, 2-3 pound, per tree. Trees, fifteen to twenty years old, growing well, none. Trees, fifteen to twenty years old, growing poorly, 5-6 pound per tree. / Old trees declining in production, 5-10 pound per tree. The quantity should vary from year to year depending on the re - sults obtained. We advise that nitrate of soda be applied when the buds show green, ten days or so before the period of full bloom. "HOW NITROGEN FERTILIZERS AFFECT SOIL AND PLANTS" Professor J. C. Russel, Department of Agronomy, Uni. of Nebr. Ladies and Gentlemen: It has been very interesting to me to sit </seg>
            <seg id="p541">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 543 "here and listen to the address of Professor Pickett and this paper by- Mr. Shubert. A soil man ought to know something about fertilizing orchards. The facts are, however, not so very many soil men know as much about it as they should. The soils work in the agricultural col - leges is usually organized around field crops. The soils men are usually ■"crop-minded." There are a few things, however, in soils that are fun - damental and the same for all crops. If I did not think that, I would not have consented to come up here to talk. A number of points not directly connected with my subject were suggested by Professor Pick - ett's paper. In the first place, in the orchard section of Nebraska we have a very splendid soil — deep and fertile — admirably adapted to root development and showing a high amount of potash all the way up and down and a reasonably high amount of phosphorous all the way up and down, as much in the subsoil as the surface; but unfortunately, rather lacking in nitrogen on account of topography the soil having been denuded of a good deal of the black surface soil that contains the nitrogen. We have felt there was not very much need to think about potash, and very little need, probably, about phosphorous fertilizers. I believe the work in the orchard by Dr. Wiggans is showing that phosphorus fer - tilizers are quite promising in developing young trees. We certainly would agree with Professor Pickett that acid phosphate has a big effect on root development. We can see marked results on wheat, corn and oats for two or three weeks after the seeds sprout where phosphates have been applied. The question was brought up about the use of sulphur on the soil for trees, and the use of lime. The probabilities are that our soils will derive very little benefit from the addition of lime. Our soils are not acid — not deficient in lime. Very likely we will not get beneficial re - sults even for our legumes, so no one should be so unwise as to apply ground lime to orchards. THE SECRETARY: Mr. Householder has an orchard near Kear - ney. Would the same thing hold out there? PROFESSOR RUSSEL: The same and more so. In the Platte valley the soils are never deficient in lime. Usually the upland soils are, however. Our soils are well supplied with sulphur, and its copious use is likely to leave complications in the nitrogen problem. Now, it is rather humorous the way all three of us have attempted to write our papers. We have overlapped a little, and neither knew what the other was writing. I tried to anticipate what Mr. Pickett might say. I will change a few of my remarks as I come to them. The element nitrogen is absolutely essential to life. Every living cell contains it. Every animal and plant must have it to function and </seg>
            <seg id="p542">544 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE grow. The animal gets it in the form of protein from the food which it eats. The plant gets it in the form of mineral salts from the soil. Certain lower forms, particularly the bacteria that live on the roots of legumes, ,get it from the atmosphere where it exists as an uncombined gas. The most obvious effect of nitrogen on plants is to make them green nd healthy. Withhold the nitrogen and the plant turns yellow. The reen color of plants is due to chlorophyll. A healthy plant produces ilorophyll in sufficient quantity to keep itself healthy and growing, for llorophyll is the agency which unites the energy of the sun with the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere, and water and minerals from the soil, » produce new plant substance. An unhealthy plant produces insuf - cient chlorophyll and so it cannot grow. Lack of water, alkali, disease, nd starvation for nitrogen and iron make plants particularly unhealthy nd lead to yellowness of foliage. If the cause cannot be assigned to nything else, it is nitrogen starvation, and yellowness is usually due to itrogen starvation. A yellow, nitrogen-starved plant makes little growth. In the case of cereals, the plants are short and spindling, and develop short heads and shrivelled grain. In the case of trees, shrubs, and vines leaves are few and small, there is little new wood growth and fruit is scarce, small, and woody or dry. A green, or nitrogen-satisfied plant, makes rapid growth. Cereals - stool well and grow toll. Heads and ears fill well, and are large. The grain is plump and of good quality. Trees, shrubs and vines leaf well,, leaves grow large, new wood developes abundantly and fruit is satis - factory in yield and quality. Too much nitrogen gives a plant a deep green, almost a blue green color. Photosynthesis is abnormally high. Sugars are formed in the eaves faster than they can be carried away and converted into starch. Consequently plants become sappy or succulent, flacid, and weak. In g^ain lodging occurs, and maturity delayed. Flowers are infertile, and grain is of low quality. In trees wood grows sappy, shoots and suckers grow unusually long. Such new growth is subject to winter killing, and ubject to diseases of all kinds because the succulent tissue is so easily enetrated and such a good medium for development of the organism, ''oliage becomes unduly dense and shades the fruit, leading to poor color f fruit. Maturity of fruit is delayed and growth of tree is prolonged late into fall with danger of fall frost damage. Too much nitrogen on truck crops makes them "grow to tops" and reduces the yield in to - matoes, potatoes, and roots, and lowers the keeping quality in lettuce, cabbage, etc. Too much nitrogen is to be as carefully avoided as too little. The ideal should be a normally nourished plant. In the main the orchard </seg>
            <seg id="p543">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICl'LTrRK 545 or the vineyard should be handled with respect to nitrogen feeding like a pen of stock cattle or hogs. We all know that it is poor practice to starve the breeding animal and just as poor practice to corn feed it. Force feeding of plants is precarious and should be attempted by only the most expert. The rest of us should strive to do normal feeding, only adopting force-feeding practices when the correct practice has been demonstrated beyond mistake. In dealing with a tree or a vine or a shrub, one must keep in mind that its growth habits are entirely different from those of a grass or a cereal plant. In oats, or coi-n, or wheat, the plant begins to absorb nutrients from the soil from the day it comes thru the ground. It con - tinues to absorb nutrients and convert them into plant substance up to the tim2 of heading. At that date extensive absorption ceases and translocation begins. The material stored in stem and leaf and root begins to migrate to the grain. When the grain is completely developed and ready to harvest the plant's work is done. Leaves dry up, and stem dies, and in the annuals even the roots die. Nature seems to intend that in the annuals, propagation should take precedence over preservation. In case of stress, some kind of grain or seed always forms, even tho the rest of the plant suffers at its expense. In the tree, shrub, or vine, when the sap begins to flow in the spring, almost the first thing to occur is blossoming. Coincident with development of leaf and branch comes development of fruit. And after the fruit is harvested, the plant keeps on growing, indeed it makes tho bulk of its growth. Incidentally it may set fruit buds for another year; it may not. It seems that often nature intends that in the perennial, preservation takes precedence over propagation. In time of stress, the fruit falls or shrivels in order that the plant might hold out longer. Therefore it would seem that the principles and practice of fertiliz - ing trees would differ from the fertilizing of field crops. In the case of crops, what man wants is grain, and what nature wants is grain, and when man applies fertilizer with a reasonable degree of intelligence, nature responds. In the case of trees, what man wants is abundant fiuit. What na - ture often wants is growth with less fruit. If man applies fertilizer what will he get? He may get nothing, or something, depending upon whether he works counter-nature or pro-nature. To get a good crop of grain is comparatively simple. To get a good crop of fruit is complex. You cannot have apples next August without blossoms in May. You cannot have blossoms in May unless there was vigorous fruit bud formation last season. And you did not get vig - orous fruit bud formation last summer without healthy spurs. But even if you get plenty of blossoms in May you will not get much fruit unless you get an adequate set of healthy young fruit. So it seems that fer- </seg>
            <seg id="p544">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 546 tilizing next year's apple crop should have been thought of last summer and should be thought of again next spring. The main fruit fertilizer is nitrogen. Whether to apply it; when to apply it: how much to apply, and how, are questions that should be answered practically, but must in part be answered theoretically. We know that the proper amount of nitrogen makes for healthy prow - ing trees which develop fruit buds normally in season. Therefore nitrogen should be applied in summer to promote fruit bud formation. It should not be applied too early, lest too much wood growth be in - duced; it should not be applied too late, lest it induce too rank growth of leaves and delay the maturity of fruit. If it be applied at all, probably August is near to the right time. Now, as to applying it in the spring. It has been shown that bear - ing spurs, — that is spurs that blossom well and set well, — have high nitrogen and low carbohydrate contents at blossoming time, while non - bearing spurs have low nitrogen and high carbohydrate content, and barren spurs have low nitrogen and low carbohydrate contents. There - fore it has been suggested that nitrogen be applied in the spring, pre - ceding blooming, just early enough so that the nitrogen could get into the spurs by the time the blossoms open. There are three kinds of nitrogen fertilizers in addition to legum - inous cover crops and manure. These are sodium nitrate, ammonium sulphate and such material as blood-meal, cotton seed neal, etc., col - lectively called the organic ammoniates. The sodium nitrate contains 16 per cent nitrogen and the ammonium sulphate 20 per cent nitrogen and they both sell for the same price per pound of nitrogen. If nitrogen is 30 cents per pound, 100 pounds of sodium nitrate would sell for $4 80 and 100 pounds of ammonium sulphate would sell for $6. Blood meal contains from 12 to 14 per cent nitrogen, and is higher priced because it is a stock food, as well as a plant food. The only one of the three fertilizers already digested, so to speak, and ready for plants to absorb, is sodium nitrate. If it can be got to the plant roots it will go&gt; into them at once and up the tree and into the spurs in seven to ten days. With field crops, sodium nitrate begins to make a showing from four to seven days after it is washed down around the roots. Sodium nitrate leaches readily and if put on top of the ground, it will go into the soil with the first rain to the depth that the rain penetrates. It will not diffuse into the soil, and if put on »p of the ground, it will lie there indefinitely unless rains come. So n the springtime, if sodium nitrate be used a few weeks before bloom - ng, which seems to be the proper time, it will be of no value unless enough moisture comes to wash it down. Cultivating it in may not &gt;e effective, because the tree roots run much deeper than the depth of cultivation, and will not be able to get it. In this climate there is very </seg>
            <seg id="p545">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGUU'l'LTrRK 547 little danger of loss by leaching, because we do not get sufficient spring rains, therefore sodium nitrate might be applied rather earlier than customary and then there will be more chance of it* being down at the /oots when absorption begins. Ammonium sulphate is not immediately available altho it becomes available rapidly ordinarily. Before the nitrogen which it contains can be used by plants, the ammonia must be converted into nitrate. This is a bacterial process. It proceeds rapidly enough when the soil tem - perature is warm, but very slowly in the spring. In applying ammonium sulphate to wheat on April 1st, we have never been able to see any effects earlier than May 1st to May 15th. Ammonium sulphate applied to fruit trees in the spring time will almost invariably fail to function at blossoming and fruit setting stages. Blood meal and similar nitrogeneous materials cannot be compared with sodium nitrate in orchard fertilizing. The nitrogen which they con - tain becomes available slowly and blood meal applied in the spring will not function completely until summer. Manure and leguminous cover crops have always been favorite or - chard treatments. They cannot be depended upon to furnish nitrates at any definite period. Particularly they cannot be depended upon to furnish nitrates at blossoming time. They decompose gradually in the soil and elevate the general level of fertility. This leads to increased tree vigor and growth and if used moderately will lead to better trees which will in turn set more fruit buds, bear more blossoms, and set more fruit. They have one disadvantage over sodium nitrate, in that the time when their nitrogen becomes available is beyond control. They have one big advantage over sodium nitrate in that the organic matter added by them makes the soil more receptive and retentive of moisture which is an important factor in fruit production. Nitrogen fertilizers must be used with considerable descretion for harmful effects can result from them. This is true of both sodium nit - rate and ammonium sulphate. Sodium nitrate used heavily year after year may lead to alkali soil, while ammonium sulphate used year after year may lead to acid soil. Suppose for illustration, that sodium nit - rate is used once a year at a rate of 250 pounds per acre. The plant uses the nitrate part of th fertilizer leaving behind the sodium part. The sodium left behind unites with the carbondioxide in the soil to form sodium corbonate, sal soda, or "black alkali" salt. 250 pounds of sodium nitrate per acre will give 156 pounds of sodium carbonate. 4,000 pounds of sodium carbonate per acre would be absolutely ruinous to an or - chard. Half this amount might be serious. Ten to fifteen years of continuous use of sodium nitrate would lead then to serious complica - tions. The roots of the tree would become corroded by the alkali and the tree would cease to thrive. The soil would become puddled, and </seg>
            <seg id="p546">548 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE Eould run together and bake and crack, which would reduce the effect - eness of rainfall and the clay would leach downward and form hard In case of ammonium sulphate, the nitrogen is absorbed by the plant leaving sulphuric acid in the soil. 300 pounds of ammonium sul - phate per acre would leave in the soil 220 pounds of sulphuric acid. This would be immediately neutralized by the lime in the soil and would &lt;lc no immediate damage. Eventually however 125 pounds of lime would leach from the soil and be lost for every 300 pounds of ammon - ium sulphate used. After ten to twenty years this loss would become serious. The soil would get too acid for growth of cover crops and for bacterial activity and the tree would consequently suffer for nitrogen, even tho one was using fertilizer. In other words the fertilizer would become less effective and more of it would need to be used. Since sodium nitrate makes the soil alkali and ammonium sulphate makes the soil acid, it would seem rational to use one to neutralize tha other. In practice this is done and with results. Theoretically about 200 pounds of ammonium sulphate should be used for every 250 pounds of sodium nitrate. These should not be mixed for use, rather they should be used at different periods of the year in order to get best results. Sodium nitrate should be used in the spring followed by ammonium sul - phate in late summer. Or ammonium sulphate might be used on the young orchard when growth is wanted, to be followed by nitrate when fruit is desired. The use of nitrogen fertilizers on orchards is bound to increase. Orchards yield large enough acre returns that $10 to $20 per acre in - vested in nitrate is easy to recover in fruit if the fertilizer does much at all. The one drawback at present is the uncertainty of when to use them for most efficient results. "Cut and try" methods are expensive. The first thing to do is to get down to fundamental principles and learn the function of nitrogen in the physiology of the tree and the vine. THE PRESIDENT: I think those who wanted a little information on fertilizers have been amply paid for their time. There are very few programs where it is possible to get three such papers as we have had on that one subject. We have scientists and successful orchard men re - port on fertilizing. If we had just the scientist report, the commercial man might bat his eyes a few times before he would pay a great deal of attention. But when you have the commercial grower's report and then the scientist's, and both are getting the same results, then every - body is happy. Discussion PROFESSOR RUSSEL: Have you noticed any ill effects of the nit - rate on the soil at all where you have used it continuously? </seg>
            <seg id="p547">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 549 MR. SHUBERT: We have not used it long enough to have any detrimental effect on the soil. We commenced about 1917 and we have not noticed any bad effect. PROFESSOR RUSSEL: Have you used it every year. MR. SHUBERT: We have on the forty-acre block I spoke of. This particular forty had been in heavy bearing for quite a number of years after we acquired it. It did not do right. We did not get large crops. We had lots of bloom, but not a good set of fruit. We commenced on the nitrate. I think from 1918 until the present time we have had a crop every year with the exception of the year we had the freeze, in 1921. Outside of that, we have had a crop. Most of the time we have had too large a crop. It is a question whether to go ahead with nitrate. We may have to tone it down so we don't have too many apples on a tree. PROFESSOR RUSSEL: I doubt if anybody needs to hesitate be - cause of its effect on the soil. MR. ARTHUR SHUBERT: We have seen a marked improvement on the grass growing under the trees. It becomes dark green and grows much more rank. Q. Will the accumulation of alkali resulting from the continual use of sodium nitrate be counterbalanced by manure? A. No. Experience has shown it can not be overcome by the use of manure. There are three ways of overcoming the bad effects of alkali. One is to use gypsum, which is not expensive; the second is to use ammonium sulphate in rotation; and the third is to use sulphur. If your soil gets black alkali, add something else with your fertilizer and reclaim your damage. Q. Wouldn't it show on the vegetation? A. It will begin to show. It may be ten or fifteen years before it shows any ill effects. I do not think you should get ill effects in seven years. MR. SHUBERT: I am mighty glad you brought that point out. I had never heard of it before. We might have gone on and used it for a number of years, until our orchards commenced to go down hill and we would have wondered why. I have been strong for this scientific part. I am not a scientist. For theory we must depend on you, and it is fine to be able to get it. THE PRESIDENT: Another problem the growers have with ap - ples and other kinds of fruit is packing. We want to know how to pack this fruit for the big markets, and what the market demands of us in a pack. </seg>
            <seg id="p548">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 550 I will take this opportunity to call on Frederick S. Merrill of Columbia, Missouri. He is Vice President of the Central States Or - chard Company which bought our crop last fall. He came around one day when we were packing. We had five barrels of York Imperial apples on the grading table. He came up and jumped all over the boys. He said, "Those apples haven't enough color." I said, "What do you expect on York apples?' He said, "Wait and I will show you." After half an hour's search he found a nice red one. He wanted them all red like that, he said. I said, "We can't do it. They won't get red in Nebraska. He said, "Maybe I was a little hard on you fellows. PROFESSOR MERRILL: You fellows know I know what I want. A VOICE: You give it to him! GROWING AND HARVESTING APPLES F. S. Merrill Any factors that may be developed to simplify our orchard practices so as to effect our total production, our cost of production or our net returns are always of interest. The fruit growers have among their number many of the real sportsmen of the agricultural world, else they would hardly be fruit growers. Possibly no other line of agricultural endeavor carries with it the number of hazzards that confront the apple grower. His is a continual risk from the time he selects his nursery stock; and the ele - ment of risk never ends. He must select varieties having as his guide only his understanding of what then may be popular. How can he know but that in fifteen years today's favorites may be in the discard? This problem has confronted many a grower. How can he work out a set working plan of orchard practice to meet conditions that are never alike? The practices of past seasons would give us an accurate guide for our future performances if the future conditions were ever exactly like those of the past. Since there are always new problems, it de - volves upon the fruit grower to develop initiative to the highest degree, to observe all changes and interpret the effect of each change upon his An examination of horticultural literature shows that there have been doctrines advocated that have carried instructions from one ex - treme to another. An examination of the list of successful orchardists will show men who have never accepted either of the extremes in their orchard practices. Their' s has been a plan of moderation; and the middle course has been found safest and best. </seg>
            <seg id="p549">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 551 In establishing orchards, we find one type of extremist who has set his trees about twenty-five feet apart. We find comparatively few of the other extreme who have set their trees over forty feet apart, but the first type of extremist has a condition to confront that is often dis - heartening. His trees, because of the competitive struggle for food and sunlight can produce neither large crops nor good quality. Since the position of a tree after it has become established can rarely be changed, it follows that the mistake of crowding should be avoided. The grower who plants fillers must have a high standard of courage, otherwise he will leave the fillers until they have injured his permanent trees. In pruning, we have had those advocators of "let nature alone" prun - ing and, to counterbalance their advice, we have had instructions that led us to feel that if you continued to remove about three-fourths of each year's growth you would have trees free from faults and fruit in abundance. Of the two, I would rather tie up with the former; for in pruning I believe there has been much actual injury caused by radical treatment. A moderate plan in which the form and type of tree is maintained by conservative methods regularly practiced is found in or - chards that have been most productive and profitable. In our spraying work we seldom find a grower who contends that spraying is not essential. However, we have found a growing tendency on the part of some growers to visualize a proportionate increase in their profits from the amount of spray material and the amount of pres - sure they are using. There can be no question as to the merit of time - liness of application, but thoroughness may of itself be misleading. There is some possibility that in our zeal to vindicate the use of the spray gun we have gone beyond the limits of reasonable safety in our use of high pressure. It is a known fact that higher pressures give finer atomization of the spraying materials; but this same pressure may cause a mechanical abrasion of the skin. The young apple is very tender and susceptible to injury, and it is not improbable that the spray materials, driven at a high pressure, may injure it through their force alone. Was there not less injury when we used poles with a moderate pressure of 200 to 225 pounds than has occurred in recent years when higher pre - sures have been in vogue? While I do not think it is true under Nebraska conditions, I do believe that some sections have increased the number of sprays without proportionately increasing the percentage of perfect fruit. Any opera - tion that will not return the investment together with a fair profit does not seem to be a sound business practice. The problem of soil fertility is one that is calling for more atten - tion than it has received in the past. During the past season the writer had an opportunity to visit several of the best orchards in the Missouri </seg>
            <seg id="p550">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 552 liver section. In two of these were large blocks of Winesaps; and &gt;oth showed vigorous, healthy trees bearing heavy crops of fruit. In one manure had been used at the rate of six tons per acre, and the other lad been treated with nitrate of soda. The owners of both blocks tated that they had been forced to fertilize because of light crops. The response to the treatments was plainly evident. In another section, I saw a block that had been fertilized for several years with nitrate of soda and I was impressed by the lack of color even at a time when the fruit should have been at its best. An ex - amination of the fruit itself showed that it was mature, but lacked the rigment that makes fruit attractive. Here moderation had been for - gotten and successive applications in large quantities had so affected he tree growth that normal coloring had been checked. Most of our better types of soils show a fairly high percentage of available potash and phosphorus in the subsoil and the application of these elements is scarcely ever needed for deep rooted plants like apple trees. The available nitrogen content of soils is largely confined to the upper areas and frequently is deficient. Clover may maintain a soil that is not too lacking in this element and clover will not seriously affect the color of fruit. I was examining- some wonderful specimens of Missouri Pippins at Shubert last fall and Art Shubert said, "You can see the clover mulch in each apple." When commercial fertilizers or manure are used, exercise caution both as to amount and frequency of application. The production of quality fruit does not end the grower's problems, for to many of us the growing end is the easiest part of the game. The harvesting season brings more causes of grief and worry than all the other operations combined. Some of the elements of risk are beyond our control and to these we become more or less accustomed. There are factors that can be affected by efficient management and to these we should apply ourselves. Careless management and wasteful prac - tices may increase the cost of harveting so as to eliminate all chances for profits. The grower who handles his entire output in the bulk grade can probably effect the most economical organization of all. His method requires the smallest investment in equipment and reduces handling to the practical minimum. With your bulk market already established and with your favorable rates on this class of fruit, there is little won - der that many are practicing this system. This grade can be handled more efficently and economically in the orchard than in any other way. One feature of this work that often increases the expense in orchard packing is caused by the delays incident to moving the packing table and equipment. Some growers have overcome this feature through the use of a sled upon which is set the chute table. The table is fastened </seg>
            <seg id="p551">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 553 to the turntable top of the sled and can be turned so as to take ad - vantage of the slope of the ground. It is moved by horse power and calls for a much shorter delay than where the table must be carried and adjusted by the packers. Where the fruit is packed in packages, a different type of manage - ment or organization is required. A stricter standard is usually de - manded and, to secure a better grade, more efficient help is called for. This absolute need of hiring or training efficient men cannot be over - emphasized. The cost of production varies in direct proportion to the number of packages packed per day. This is as true of the sorters as of the packer, the tailer ,etc. Nature has supplied parts of Nebraska with soil and climatic conditions that are nearly ideal for the production of certain varieties. To take the fullest advantage of this natural condi - tion, growers must come to the realization of the need for improved grades and packing. You cannot secure either a high grade or a uni - form .grade of packing with untrained help, at least not with any rea - sonable speed. An important consideration in reducing the cost of packing opera - tions is the elimination of lost time and wasteful effort. Where packers are hired either on straight time or by the day it is necessary that they be not delayed in their work. In my observations, under ordinary working conditions, I have found that because of delays and reduced efficiency, packing in the orchard may cost as much as 30 per cent more than where the packing is done in a central location. This percent - age of increased expense is greater with a light crop than with a heavy crop, but it is an avoidable expense. If more than one packing crew is being used, it becomes even more important. The use of a central lo - vation need not call for the erection of a packing shed; but if the size of the orchard justifies it, a shed will more than pay for itself. Some of the advantages of the central location may be listed as follows: 1. Central location permits better organization of forces and equip- ment. 2. No delays are necessary, since packers are permanently located. 3. Is more economical, when fruit is packed in containers. 4. Work is more easily supervised if more than one table is used. 5. Neither fruit, packages or packers are exposed, (if shed is used.) 6. Lower grades can be handled most effectively. 7. Packages are kept cleaner (when shed is used.) 8. Is convenient as base of supplies. 9. Reserves may be maintained so that packers may be kept busy during disagreeable weather (when shed is used.) </seg>
            <seg id="p552">554 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE It has the following- disadvantages: 1. Cost of shed, (offset to some extent by its value as a storage for packages.) 2. Fruit may be bruised by additional handling and hauling. 3. It requires large number of packing containers. In most work we can never achieve satisfactory results with poor ools or poor workmen. This is brought out very plainly in fruit pack - ng. Among my acquaintances, I have known men who, through good rganization and management, have effected an efficiency that guar - antees them a profit. I have known others who, because of poor man - gement, have failed to profit even from large crops. Wasteful efforts nd unskilled labor cause an overhead that is almost impossible to con - tend with. Discussion THE PRESIDENT: You say you think either barrel or bulk is the way apples in this section should be handled, but the market demands the apples from this territory be packed in barrels, and considering the cost, we will get the most money out of our apples by packing in bar - rels. Take your markets. The Central States Orchard Company has eleven distributing houses. We want to know what they want for their trade. PROFESSOR MERRILL: If you have an orchard and are going to pack one thing, you should try to keep it uniform. If you make a rotten pack, make it uniformly rotten. If you make a good pack, make it uniformly good; or an excellent pack, bang-up excellent. Try to get every barrel in every lot the same. If you have a real good packer he can mix up the stuff so that it comes out uniform in the barrel. Sometimes we get a lot of green fruit. A good packer will keep this worked in together so that the well colored fruit will carry that which hasn't sufficient color. We should try to have every package absolutely uniform. Try to get every barrel the same — even the package itself. Then have your stamp the same. After you have the outside fixed, have everything that goes into it of one grade. In facing, there are two different types. One is the single face where we put a ring of apples on the outside and concentric rings in the center. The stems are placed down. Accompany apple buyers into cold storage sometime. If you ever see one open the face of a barrel, I will pay for the drinks. If they do that, what's the use of faeing them? Put the good apples on the tail LI do not mean to try to get them uniformly big for the face — good lea that will run two and three-fourths inches in diameter are most </seg>
            <seg id="p553">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 555 desirable. That is your minimum requirement, and that apple will fit in nicely and make a nicely packed face. Great big coarse apples leave great big holes. They do not look attractive. Pick a facer with a stem on it. When you put in the face, have the apples snug enough so that every apple is tight. If you do not, they will rattle around so that they won't be as attractive when opened. Next have them uniform in color, as good as you have. Lots of people say that is cheating. Maybe it is. The distributors always like a barrel that opens up right. If it appeals to the eye, the stomach gets second consideration. They don't have to be 100 per cent color, however, just so they are uniform. A double face is where another layer is placed on the first one cheek down. It takes more time and costs more money, but gives less returns. Take a few well colored apples and place them so that the colored cheeks fit into the spaces between the apples in the first layer. When you open the face end of the barrel there are no holes in evi - dence. With the single face there is apt to be a hole here and there, and the package looks as if the buyer were not getting all he should. By this means try to make the buyers think they are getting lots for their money. Many of us can't see that one good apple all by itself is worth more than that same good apple with two rotten ones thrown in with it. The two rotten apples detract from the value of the one good one. Even though you have given three apples, you will get less for them than for the one. Nature gave parts of the eastern section of this state remarkable soil and climatic conditions. I think conditions are so favorable for production and so limiting to the propagation of many of our injurious insects and diseases, that I really believe if the folks starting orchards in the eastern part of the state maintain the proper cultural and grow - ing conditions, three good sprays will raise A No. 1 apples; and you will have a lower cost of production than any other territory I know of. But there is one thing that must be brought home, as I see it. Perhaps I am selfish in one respect. If I am going to buy apples, I want something I can put away and forget for from two to five months, and still have a good product to distribute. I am also figuring from the other way, because we produce apples. We have found that the man who resells the product wants the same thing and he is willing to pay for it. I could tell you the story of a man near St. Joe who makes as much out of his apples as anybody I know of. For a time he scarcely broke even on his operations. One year he sold one carload of Duchess to a firm, whose man was at his place and said, "You do not know the </seg>
            <seg id="p554">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 556 first thing about packing apples. I will show you how to pack one barrel." He showed him how to face it, to run it along and tail it off and put up a finished product. They did not get good control on the fungus; but they have had the nerve to toss out those apples that did not come up to the standard. If a man who has apples to sell, will keep to such a standard, he can talk about the weather or anything else when the buyer comes, be - cause if he does not buy today, he will come back tomorrow, or some - body else will. The man has realized that his poor apples are worth more on the ground than hidden away in his barrels. That is what everybody who is going to make a real success out of the apple business must come to. We can get something out of our poor apples. But when they are thrown in with our good apples, we have to scale the price of the good ones down toward the poor ones. Better grading and better packing is one of the big needs in this territory. In facing a full half bushel of well colored, uniformly sized apples Euld be used. Dumy some in and face the first layer. Pour in what lains of the half bushel. That packs up the face with a few of the t apples. Pick as good as you have for this purpose. We have certain grades and standards. For certain varieties we have certain limitations of color and size. We try to stick to our stan - dard, and throw out what does not come up to grade. If you have a trademark brand, it will be valuable in proportion as you stick to the standard. Maintain it to the point that the quality of your pack is better than anybody else's. I know a grower whose apples can be bought without ever putting an inspector to watch the packing. It has paid this man big. The bet - ter the pack, in the long run, the better the price. The first year or two it is necessary to get a reputation. Thereafter your fruit sells on this reputation. In filling barrels from a chute, we let in a few apples out of the pron. When the barrel is one-third full, shake it firmly to settle the pples. Every time the apron is set, the barrel is shaken. When the tarrels are full, we tail them. I asked a man how he came out on his pples. He said, "I could have had twenty-five cents more per barrel I had tailed them." In this operation the apples are put on their de in concentric rings. The height above the end of the barrel will epend on the firmness of the apples themselves and the firmness with which they have been packed. Sometimes we get them tailed so high it causes bruising. Sometimes they are not tailed high enough and they are loose and cause injury in shipping. </seg>
            <seg id="p555">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 557 I think the biggest thing we have to figure on anywhere, whether in Nebraska or Missouri, is this: Why is it Washington growers can sell their apples as they do? If you are in the fruit business, you can buy twenty cars of Winesaps, of a certain grade and need not send a man out there to inspect them. You know that every one will be extra fancy or fancy which ever you ordered. When we can get barreled apples, graded in this way in our orchards, we will have a better chance to sell them and for better prices, too. THE PRESIDENT: We have enjoyed Mr. Merriell's talk very much. We certainly appreciate his coming up here and delivering these two addresses. Tomorrow morning Mr. Coe will be a strong advocate of the box pack, just as Mr. Merrill likes the barrel pack. We will have quite a discussion in this packing business from every angle. After some announcements by Secretary Hoppert in regard to the "Fun Feed," adjournment was declared until nine o'clock Thursday morning. THURSDAY MORNING SESSION January 8, 1925 The final session of the convention was called to order by President Porter at 9:45 on Thursday morning. THE PRESIDENT: I am sorry there are not more here to hear the papers to be given this morning. These papers will be printed and about six or seven hundred people will receive copies of them. We are to have some talks this morning of vital interest to fruit men. I said yesten'.ay (hat I would not know where to go to buy No. 1 Nebraska apples in Nibraska. I would know in Minneapolis or Duluth or Chicago. I do know th:ri are twenty-five cars of what we call "commercial pack" Nebraska apples in Omaha. By that we mean one's and two's in the came barrel. A No. 1 is a perfect apple — at least 90 per cent color end cbcut two ar.d one-half inches in size or over — different varieties vary in size. That's the red apple. No. 2 is two and one-fourth inches and GO per cent eclor. It must be perfect, too, as far as freedom from blemish is concerned. You can find apples crated that way here. As far as No. 1 apples are concerned, they don't pack them that way. If they buy them packed, the chances are they ship to their own market. As Mr. Hunt said yes - terday, the reason you can not buy Nebraska certified seed potatoes — the reason they won't grow the early Ohio for seed purposes — is they can get a better price for Triumphs in the south, and are shipping all the potatoes out. Two years ago I wanted to buy a car of Nebraska </seg>
            <seg id="p556">558 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE certified seed potatoes. I called Professor Howard and he could not get them for me. Three years ago it was the same way. That is just exactly what is the matter with the apple business, [n Kansas City, speaker after speaker was talking 1 about the wonderful fruit he grew in the Missouri valley; that it was the best flavored fruit you could get. Then these fellows could not find it on the market. We told how many cars we grew in Nebraska, and wondered what had be - come of all the apples. We would like very much to sell Nebraska ap - ples in Nebraska and get a good price for them. We feel the freight rate is an important factor, and we should be able to sell our stuff closer to the growing point and get a better price. We wanted a paper on "What the Market Demands of Nebraska Apples." We know it is probably our fault these Nebraska apples are not sold here. We have called on the Federated Fruit Growers for a speaker to tell us what the market demands of apples. They have to sell these apples and know what the market wants. I think we are fortunate this morning in having with us Mr. Chisam, from Omaha, who represents the Federated Fruit Growers. "WHAT THE MARKET DEMANDS OF APPLES" By A. J. Chisam (Omaha Manager of the Federated Fruit and Vegetable Growers) Our organization appreciates very much the courtesy of being re - quested to appear before this Society. I was asked to deal with the subject you have given, "What the Market Demands of Apples," because practically all of my experience for the past fifteen years has been devoted to the sale of fresh fruits and vegetables in carload lots in various markets throughout the country and naturally I have sold a good many carloads of apples. You have assigned to me a big question and a very important one. It is a well known fact that the consumer is the party who really con - trols what the market demands and the consumer of apples, as well as of ether perishable commodities, has been highly educated for a number of years to the idea of better quality, better grade and more attractive package. The desires and requirements of the consuming public are of first importance to the producer and consequently the producer must give heed to these requirements if he wishes to secure for himself the high - est degree of success in production. Different markets draw their apple supplies from different sections of the country. Some markets will take bulk, some prefer baskets, others </seg>
            <seg id="p557">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 559 barrels or boxes, and still others take all varieties of packages. Some markets prefer red varieties and others green varieties. Some mar - kets want the cheaper grades and others want the best, but it has been my experience that the average market has trade which requires all grades. The trade as a rule demands red apples on most any market. The article that looks good to the eye sells readily. The green apple has no attraction and consequently no demand to speak of. My subject is: "What the market demands of apples." This means, what does the wholesale dealer and retailer expect the Nebraska grower to do? They expect him to spray and take care of his apples and pro - duce as fine an apples as there is to produce, and there isn't any state in the union that can produce a better apple than Nebraska, if prop - erly taken care of, properly graded and packed when ready for market. They want sound apples, and apples which have been picked at the right time, and which are uniformly sized and true to variety as to shape. It is my idea in packing Nebraska apples for Nebraska markets or even for Eastern markets — and they very often are shipped there — that they prefer the Nebraska apples to be packed in barrels. When you pack a barrel of apples here in Nebraska, you "face" the barrel, which is a ring packed face. All of the growers here in the state know how to pack a barrel of apples but few of them know how to pack a basket. You know how attractive a barrel of apples is when opened, if prcperly faced. Your baskets of apples would look the same, and consequently, more attractive than when merely jumbled in. There is more or less demand here in the state for bulk apples, and the same care should be used in loading bulk apples that you use in the handling of higher grade apples. Don't forget that although you have sold ycur car of apples to some dealer, he in turn has to sell them to a retailer or direct to the consumer and if they are not properly graded, they are going to deteriorate very rapidly in the handling and consequently, the first remark the consumer will make is — "Apples are no good this year." It is far better to throw away very poor apples. Sell the medium and better grades so that they will keep after the con - sumer buys them, because it is the consumer that holds the key to the situation. He pays the bill and consequently should get good merchan - dise. Every market has a certain amount of trade which will only take the very best grade, regardless of price, but we also have a middle class, the laboring man, who usually has a large family, and who will take an "orchard run." By this I mean choice fancy and extra fancy - apples packed in the same basket, but every wormy, poorly shaped apple should be thrown out. These are cider apples. In order to draw trade on all your apples, it is necessary that you take sufficient care </seg>
            <seg id="p558">560 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE so that you can turn out both top grade apples and medium grade apples to a good market. I Another thing — the growers here in the state should adopt packing les just as they have done in the Western states so that no matter lat loading station these apples are from, they would all be graded e same. It is very necessary that grading rules be adopted here in e state and that every package be n:arked with the grade that it con - ins. It is a law in the Western states and should be one here. The srthwest has created a demand for their apples simply because they ive taken care of them; they have tended them carefully, graded em properly and you can do the same thing in Nebraska for you have much better flavored apple here than they have in any of the Western ! During the past few years the Western markets have taken very ndly toward Idaho and Colorado bushels. These two states have eatly improved their grading and packing rules so that they are ship - rig- apples in bushel baskets which compare very favorably in size, ality and condition with the best packs of Washington box apples, lis past season, by far the greatest percentage of the extra fancy ashington box apples have gone into the largest Eastern markets. Why are thousands of carloads of Washington box apples shipped rom the state of Washington, right through all the Eastern markets o New York City, when New York state is perhaps one of the heaviest roducers of apples? The answer is simple. It is because the growers n the state of Washington, long ago recognized what the buyer or the onsumer really wanted in the way of grade, pack and quality and they ave it to him. It costs probably in the neighborhood of $1.00 to ship box of apples from Washington to New York City. There are hun - reds of thousands of bushels of apples grown in the East and yet :iere are thousands of cars of Washington box apples shipped East. Another thing we hear a lot about these days is overproduction. It is my firm belief that if the grower would load and ship nothing ex - cept the product which has a recognized commercial value in the mark - ets, there would be less to say today about the problem of over-produc- A point of collosal importance, one that has been brought to my lind hundreds of times, is the amount of money wasted by growers II over the country, including shipments of fruit. There is a certain uantity of the product being shipped which is absolutely worthless on le market. If you could be in the market and get an idea of the freight, abor charge, selling charge and all such expense that goes into the landling of those products, a portion of which has no commercial value, ou, as a grower, would be astounded. The remedy and solution of this roblem lies entirely in your own hands. The salesman in the market </seg>
            <seg id="p559">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 561 is obliged to sell as best he can and for the most money he can, what - ever you ship in a car. J have been talking from a standpoint of a broker and jobber. I do not come in contact with the retail trade. In other words, we stand between the grower and the jobber of the different markets of the coun - try. We, as jobbers and distributors of fruits and vegetables are in touch with the markets all over the United States and consequently distribute our merchandise in such a manner that there isn't too much of any commodity on any market, which is very essential in the dis - tribution of fruits and vegetables. In years gone by, before the present distributing organizations were formed, shippers consigned their fruits and vegetables to market and very often caused a glutted market, with low prices, and other markets without any supplies at all. This has largely been overcome by proper distribution and handling of fruits and vegetables. During 1923 the Federated Fruit and Vegetable Growers, Inc., dis - tributed 35,000 carloads of fruits and vegetables in 772 cities in thn United States and in the foreign markets of Mexico, South America, Cuba, Great Britain and Scandinavia. These shipments originated in 33 different states and 93% of all sales were on an f. o. b. basis. There are approximately 10,000 carload buyers of fruits and vegetables in the United States. Our offices cover approximately 70% of the con - suming population of the country. About 30% is covered by bonded brokers, these being in such small offices that they would not justify salaried branches throughout the year. The federated organization ex - tends from coast to coast and from Canada to Mexico and the majority of the carload receivers are in touch with the Federated's offerings. In conclusion then, it seems to me that there is plenty of evidence all over the country to indicate to you what the markets require and if you would succeed in the state of Nebraska as apple produucers, you have but to investigate, if you have not already done so, and then pro - duce in accordance with your findings. I thank you. THE PRESIDENT: I am sure that is just what we want. I think we will probably have a number of questions to ask you now. Discussion Q. I wonder if Mr. Chisam will be so kind as to analyze the wants of the Omaha markets in particular? It seems peculiar to me so many apples are shipped through Omaha to Minneapolis, while Omaha prob - ably uses a lot of stuff shipped in from the west. A. We have apples in storage now bought in Nebraska. But we have never handled . any Nebraska apples before, so I am not com- </seg>
            <seg id="p560">562 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE petent to talk on Nebraska apples. They come in competition with our western apples. tTHE PRESIDENT: I shipped eight cars of apples to the Central tes Orchard Company. Two of them went to Minneapolis and I lk the balance to Omaha. kWhat grade of apples would you say sells best on the Omaha mar - -the fancy box pack or the basket? You get Idaho apples in ets? A. Yes; and Colorado and Utah apples. Colorado apples are ringjed this year for the first time. Idaho's are all ringed. THE PRESIDENT: The storage houses don't like baskets &lt;1o they? A. They do not care. They will take anything this year. It is not necessary to ring tail them. Ring face them. Q. The baskets must be ringed? A.Yes, to get value out of them. Q. What grade? A. Most of the Utah fruit comes in a combination pack fancy and extra fancy, and marked at the top: "Culls out. Two and one-fourth' minimum." THE PRESIDENT: Southeastern Nebraska in a normal year will hip from 400 to 600 cars, I should say, from Union down to Rulo. The huberts alone ship about 100 cars in a normal year. The apple grow - rs in that section are not getting as much out of their fruit as they lould. Of course it has been their fault. The reason they could not make the grade was because they were not growing the stuff that would grade up. We are trying to remedy that. For a number of years the ulk of those 250 cars has been handled by the American Fruit Growers. As far as I am concerned, the American Fruit Growers' method of istribution is not satisfactory. So the American Fruit Growers came nto Omaha, and the Federated Fruit Growers were there. The latter tad bought a lot of apples, selling on consignment. The only thing the American Fruit Growers have invested is their percentage. They could ndersell anybody. They can make a break in the market, can't they? A. The American Fruit Growers are not co-operators. We are entirely co-operators. In the state of Washington they have their own orchards and handle on consignment right with it. They have a lot of high grade stuff of their own. It is human nature to sell that. Q. Yesterday we had a paper by Mr. Merrill who advocated the barrel pack for apples grown in this section. I think we will have papers </seg>
            <seg id="p561">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 563 this morning that recommend the packing of apples in baskets or small containers. What we want is to find out the way we should pack in order to obtain the best results. We grow the Jonathan, Grimes, Delicious, Winesap, and other winter varieties. The question I am anxious to have answered is, which is the best package for us to market our apples in foi the Omaha market for example? A. Before I wrote what I have in this paper about baskets, I took the matter up with Trimble Brothers and the Gilinsky Fruit Company of Omaha, and Messrs. Scott and George F. Burt of Lincoln — the four largest dealers. They all requested I put in something about baskets — fruit put up in the right way. Q. But did they like the baskets? A. Yes and you you can make as much on a basket as on a barrel. They like barrels, too, but also baskets. They like No. 1 and combi - nation — both grades — in baskets. They get as much for their stuff on the market as for straight No. l's. THE PRESIDENT: Do you ship Idaho apples in bulk and basket them at this end? A. Some peddlers do that, and some small jobbers. THE PRESIDENT: Two years ago I sold my apples and the wholesalers had a lot of Idaho stuff arriving in bulk — bought by the ton. Q. I noticed in our basket apples this year a combination pack was used. You probably would not see this feature as the consumer sees it. The top layer contained first-class apples, and the bottom ran down to less than two inches. A. There is supposed to be a mimimum size on your combination pack. It was not an honest pack. Q. It looks like an old-fashioned way of putting small ones at the bottom. I think that is one trouble we would have from the combi - nation pack. THE PRESIDENT: We were looking at that sizer this morning, and the question came up, would it pay to have all your small apples packed together — will not a few large apples spoil a pack of medium sized ap - ples and vice versa? A. You want uniform size, even if small. You must have a min - imum and stick by it. The consumer sees the difference and criticizes the fruit. Q. Don't you find a different demand from different sources — that some want the large apples? </seg>
            <seg id="p562">564 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE A. Yes, the restaurant trade buys by the box for this reason. It wants apples of a uniform size and shape and free from blemishes. Q. There is no reason why they would not buy basket apples if sized efficiently. A. They must have pretty nearly perfect apples. Q. Do you think we ought to pack our extra fancy stuff in boxes? A. Personally I would not pack in a box. You have competition from states that have been packing in boxes for years. Q. They also get a big price. A. I do not know how much of that is net to the grower when the difference in the freight, packing and package are figured in. Q. But we do not have to pay that freight. They Lave estab - lished a high price on the market for box apples. If we can box apples just as good, couldn't we get the same price and wouldn't it pay us? A. If you put them in barrels, the net would be just as much to you. We are selling fewer boxes every year. I am not selling within 26 per cent as many box apples this year as I did four years ago. Q. What percentage of consumers on the Omaha market demand an extra fancy apple? A. A very small percentage. You have to take the larger markets — the eastern markets — to find this demand large. Q. The feature is the price of the barrels. The box apples cost more. By the time you buy the box and paper and pack them, you ve more expense. I forget what they claim it costs. SECRETARY: About 41 cents per box. That is in the co - ative packing plant. Have you had experience with the "Easy Pack" basket.-;? A. This basket is very good. Better than the other kind. It loads better in the car. THE SECRETARY: This package certainly looks promising. Re - tailers here in Lincoln complain that the ordinary basket usually is slack packed and the fruit bruises. A. You load them in the car flat and they do not bruise, THE SECRETARY: We find the other baskets broke where the side curves. Do you have trouble with the bottoms dropping out of the "Easy Pack" basket? </seg>
            <seg id="p563">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 565 A. We used it for Colorado apples the first time this year and had rio trouble. THE SECRETARY: This package has certain advantages the other basket does not have. I think they are 25 cents as compared with 25? cents apiece. In large quantities that price might be reduced. THE PRESIDENT: If we can have our apples in a package like that without too much loss from breakage and the like, it will be a. big help to us. Good barrels are high in price. A. We are going to pack all our apples next year that way. THE PRESIDENT: Our next paper will be "The Need for Better Packing and Grading," by Professor Wiggans, chief of horticulture here ir&gt; Nebraska. He is a commercial grower in a way. He is both a practical and a scientific man in horticulture. We will be glad to hear from Professor Wiggans. THE NEED FOR BETTER GRADING AND PACKING C. C. Wiggans Your program committee assigned to me the topic, "The Need for Better Grading and Packing" — without giving to me, at least, any reasons for the choice of speaker. You have already had some discus - sion along this line this year from other speakers. I don't believe I can bring to you anything new or startling on this subject but there are a few ideas that I want to pass along for your reflection. You may think perhaps that men from the Agricultural College are stressing too much this phase of the subject when you recall that last year Professors Howard and Hoppert discussed the score card and its application to both exhibit and packed fruit. However, you may also recall the reception which attended the early recommendations of the spray schedule — a practice which everyone accepts today without question. No commercial grower now even thinks of attempting to grow apples without spraying three, four, five or even more times and my own prediction is that ten years from now, not many growers will be found using the methods of grading and packing which now prevail. That there is a need for improved grading and better and more - attractive packing and packages for Nebraska apples, no one will deny. Attractive packing of fruits and vegetables has friends everywhere. Evidences can be found on all sides to prove the point. The owner of a string of restaurants in Detroit recently told the Michigan Society that he used eight boxes of western apples every day in preference to Michigan grown fruit because and only because of the uniformity of pack. He offered to use weekly 100 bushels of Michigan apples packed in. </seg>
            <seg id="p564">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 566 similar fashion. The same spirit can be found in other places. Why? As is usually the case, there is a sound reaon back of it all, namely when this restaurant owner put onto his counter a pan of baked apples he wanted them all to be of approximately equal side. Could this be accomplished if he purchased Nebraska apples packed as they usually are? I'll leave the answer to you. The man who merchandises products of any kind knows from ex - perience how much the general public relies upon appearance and ar - rangement in making selections of any kind. The evidence everyday is more and more convincing that the outstanding need of the fruit and vegetable industry is better grading and packing with a consequent stand - ardization of the product. Standardization and the simplification of methods and the economy which would result in the distribution of fruits and vegetables is one of the things most needed and is perhaps the most complicated problem in the fruit business. Every move made toward the adoption of more rigid grading rules, to the use of packing- methods that will insure the carrying of the product to the consumer in perfect condition and to the standardization of everything in the processes of packing, shipping and selling fruits, is a move toward economy of labor, time, produce and money and therefore toward increased profits. The appeal to grade, pack and standardize all agricultural or horticultural products is today more insistent than ever before. Bits of evidence as to what grading and packing accomplish can be secured here and there if one reads carefully the reports in the trade papers. For instance the Packer reported recently that one carload of potatoes sold at $3.70 per cwt. while others were bringing in $1.00 to $1.25. The editorial comment on this sa'e was as follows: "The high priced potatoes were packed in bushel baskets and were graded to a certain size. It took work to grade and put these potatoes up in this manner of course, but it certainly paid the owner. What can be done with potatoes in grading and packing can be done with any other commodity." You are all familiar, probably, with the marketing plan of one Idaho concern which packs Russet Rural potatoes in paper cartons and sells them through chain stores and elsewhere under the trade name "Idahoes," securing, of course, good prices. These illustrations do not mean that all the potato crop or like - wise all of the apple crop, should be packed in bushel baskets or card - board containers, but they do suggest quite strongly that the grower might very profitably pay more attention to the grading and packing of at least the choice portion of his crop. That the problem is a complex one we all know. It also has many angles beyond the mere physical grading and packing of our fruit as </seg>
            <seg id="p565">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 567 the following extract from the report of the Joint Commission of Agri cultural Inquiry will show: — "Therefore, the solution of the problem of distribution must be se - cured thru a betterment of methods and an elimination of wastes and uneconomical practices. A better system of distribution can only be hoped for thru a more intelligent study of methods, facilities and pur - poses. It is the responsibility of the entire people to make such ad - justment of custom and habit as will permit the development and estab - lishment of a system of economic distribution that will result in a more equitable relationship between what the producer receives and what the consumer pays." The Missouri River Valley grower is not the only one who has puzzling situations to meet. This is well brought out by an incident recently reported from Toronto, Canada. It seems that foreign fruit in that city dominated the market to the almost absolute exclusion of home grown products. (The same state of affairs exists in many of our own American markets, too.) One of the provincial papers advo - cated a tariff prohibiting the importation of foreign grown fruits so as to force use of home grown products. The Toronto Globe commented editorially as follows: Assuming the facts to be as represented, the solution is rather to improve the method of marketing Canadian fruits. A pro - hibition tariff would not benefit our export trade and it would be an in - adequate means for increasing domestic consumption. Our own fruit needs better packing. A box must take the place of a barrel for apples. There must be better means of distribution and better display to catch the eye of the consumer. The fruit business must be reorganized." How frequently we hear the statement, "Well, I just have to buy Northwestern, Colorado or Idaho fruit because I can't get Nebraska ap - ples. I wanted Nebraska Jonathans but had to take the coarser, drier Yakima apples instead. Why can't I get home grown fruit?" The fruit grower himself is largely responsible for this state of affairs and in his hands lies the solution. And what is the solution ? In his own mind, at^ least, the answer is more rigid grading and better packing so as to place the fruit on the market in a package attractive and acceptable to the purchaser. Too often the fruit grower has been spraying in faith, harvesting in hope and profiting by accident. The accidental portion of his operations can be remedied to a large degree by the proper preparation of his fruit for market. Let us examine for just a moment the fruit buying habit of the public. I can recall as a boy that each fall we had a picnic- or vacation day in apple picking time when my father would line the wagon box with straw, drive to a neighbor's orchard — our own orchard at that time was young — and get our winter's supply of apples. These were possibly a </seg>
            <seg id="p566">568 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE ew Wealthy, some Grimes and Jonathan, but mostly Winesap and Ben avis. These were stored in a cave. Later on this custom changed omewhat and a few barrels of fruit were placed in cold storage to be withdrawn as needed. Now the purchases are made in still smaller uantities — boxes or baskets — and as needed from the groceryman. I wonder just how universal such an evolution has been, and juft what tortion of the general public is now buying apples in smaller quantities &gt;ut much more often. And why have such changes come about? I believe there are sev - ral reasons responsible for the shift. In the first place, there is more emand for the higher quality, shorter keeping varieties which for in - lerent reasons cannot be handled in the old way. Second, with the in - reased — one could almost say universal — use of the automobile, there s a natural demand for packages which can be transported in the car. Turd — it is not now necessary to purchase apples in large quantities ince cold storage makes them available from the merchant during any month of the year. Fourth, even if there was an inclination to buy ?n arge quantities there is often times no suitable storage place in our uinace heated homes. One of the first things, therefore, that the Nebraska orchardist can o to improve conditions in his industry is to adept more generally the ;ype of package which sells bast on the market. The barrel in the past las been about the only package recognized by most growers in this state, although a few have been trying smaller containers in a limited way. There is undoubtedly a place for the barrel in the trade and certain markets apparently pay a premium for this type of container. mall grocerymen prefer to buy barrelled apples if their trade demands mail sales of bulk fruit. However, even these men are coming more and more to demand fruit packed so that they know just how many ap - &gt;les and of what size they are buying. Then, too, some varieties are much better adapted to barrelling than are others. Ben Davis, and its near relations fill barrels rapidly and can be subjected to the pressure ecessary in barrel packing without particular damage. However, the ten Davis is rapidly becoming a thing of the past in Nebraska because f the Blister Canker and along with new varieties comes a new crder f doing things. Imagine, if you can, trying to pack Delicious in a tarrel and then getting top price for this variety. It is essen;ia'ly a ancy pack apple and should be treated accordingly. Even Jonathan and Jrimes and other tender skinned varieties are frequently dam.itr.ed se - verely especially toward the tail end of the barrel. Sufficient pressure to prevent slackness later on cannot be applied at packing time without xcessive bruising. Hence, repacking is often necessaiy. The same dis - advantage will also obtain with a basket but to not quite the same de - gree. It is very largely eliminated in boxes, however, by proper bulg - ng at packing time. </seg>
            <seg id="p567">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 569 One of the strongest arguments against the continued use of the barrel with our better varieties is found in the practice frequently in - dulged in by the wholesale buyer of the fruit. Too frequently in the past has the buyer been willing to get good apples in barrels at com - paratively low prices in order to later grade them into fancy and extra fancy and repack them in boxes or baskets for resale. This practice goes on here in Lincoln, in Chicago and in other markets whers Miss - ouri River Valley Jonathans are in demand. Now why can't the grower pack this fruit in the proper way to start with and at a profit, too? He can, if he only thinks so, and the successful man in the future is going to do so. All of these arguments do not mean that the barrel immediately or possibly ever will be eliminated as a package for Nebraska apples. At the present time it certainly cannot be dispensed with. My conten - tion is that as now used, too much high grade fruit, especially of the better varieties is sold in the barrel. Whether the basket or the box is to be used I am not prepared to say. Both of these packages have their place and probably will be used. The older objection to baskets that too much bruising occurred at the top is partially done away with in some of the newer styles. The box, however, can be properly litho - graphed and thus the grower's identity will not be lost as is the case when the stenciled basket lid is removed. The labor costs may be some - what lowered in packing baskets due to the fact that the fruit is not wrapped. On the other hand facing or tailing a basket requires more time than similar operations with the box. But I hear some one say, "It is so expensive to box apples." Since I originally am from Missouri, you must prove that statement before I will agree with you. As often handled, I am willing to admit that box - ing is a costly operation but when the work is properly organized it can be performed almost as cheaply as barrelling. How much does barrelling now cost you say from the time the fruit is delivered at the table or packing shed until the head of the barrel is in place? Includ - ing the cost of the package and all overhead, is it as much as $1.00 or $1.25 per barrel? A recent analysis from the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, on the "Margins and Costs of Marketing Washington Apples" showed that the average cost per box of packing fancy and extra fancy Winesap, size 163 or larger was 40c. This covered package, lining and wrapping paper, overhead and all labor items, such as (1) receiving loose fruit (at packing shed), (2) dumping; on .grading machines, (3) grading, (4) sizing, (5) wrapping and placing in the box, (6) pressing, (7) lidding, (8) stamping variety, grade, size, etc. on the box, (9) trucking fruit in the packing room and (10) fore - man. To be sure these figures were taken from central packing plants where the volume is comparatively large but never-the-less they indi - cate that after all it may be as economical to box as to barrel. </seg>
            <seg id="p568">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 570 Another objection raised to box packing is that such a practice immediately brings our fruit into direct competition with western stuff. While this is true it is also true that the Nebraska grower faces no handicap of an 80 cents charge per box for transportation. On the basis of a retail price of $5.00 per box in New York City of the 1922 crop the western grower received 23.6%, the shipping organization 5.4%, the transportation company 16%, and the dealers, wholesaler, jobber and retailer margins were 55%. If the Nebraska orchardist is afraid of such competition as that indicated above then he is in the wrong business. Also if he hesitates to display his fruit alongide Wenatchee or Hood River fruit his courage will be revived after taking a look at the display in the adjoining room. No one need be ashamed of Nebraska fruit when it is properly graded and packed. The discussion up to this point has been based most largely upon the question as to the proper package to use. It is superfluous to add that it is just as undesirable to have poor fruit in good packages as it is to put first class fruit in less desirable containers. Along with "better packing — in fact preceding it — then must be better grading. And ever ahead of better grading must come better production methods so as to assure a lesser per cent of low grade fruit. More attention must be paid to pruning for color, culture and thinning for size and especially spraying for freedom from pests and diseases. On this latter point it may not be out of place to add that the Nebraska grower may of necessity be forced to apply an extra summer spray to control the late codling moth which has become much more serious in the past few years — in some cases affecting 20 to 40 per cent of the fruit which apparently was clean at the time of the July spray. t Better grading of the fruit naturally will begin with more careful ndling from the tree to the table so as to avoid mechanical injury far as possible. Careful supervision of pickers should remedy this uation. The next question then concerns the division of the fruit into var - ious sizes and grades. Grading and packing in this state has usually been done altogether in the orchard by use of a movable sorting or grading table. More progressive growers however, are recognizing the value of a central packing plant and in some sections — western New York and more notably still the Pacific Northwest — co-operative pack - ing plants with trackage and some storage space are very successful. It seems to me that both schemes are feasible here, the one to be used depending upon circumstances. Certainly, however, we must get entirely away from the hap-hazard plan so often followed of packing here and there in the orchard, leaving a pile of culls on the ground at every point. A packing shed, especially if there is storage space available, means a much better output from the packers, because of convenience, free - dom from delay caused by bad weather and better general supervision. </seg>
            <seg id="p569">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 571 If an emergency arises, a heavy picking crew can be used to hurry ofC fast ripening fruit and the surplus beyond the packers' capacity set aside for a day or two. Low grade fruit is also concentrated and thus does not need to be rehandled. The Nebraska apple man must grade his fruit more carefully than has been done in the past, for on this point and on it alone have the famous apple producing sections of the west built their reputation. He must be willing to call a cull a cull and a No. 2 a No. 2 instead of trying to put too many such apples into the next higher grade. Be - cause of ease of packing Nos. 1 and 2 are often packed together. I doubt the wisdom of such practice since such pack develops into more or less an "orchard run" grade. Better separate out the different grades and sell each by itself for what it is worth. A pack with 60 to 75% No. 2's will sell for little if any more than a straight No. 2 while the No. l's in it will bring enough premium to more than take care of the grading cost. Grading is a job necessarily done by hand. Grading in the strictest sense of the work means a division into grades based on freedom from blemish and because of certain color re - quirements. Along with grading should go also proper sizing for that then adds the finishing touch to the uniformity of your pack. Small ap - ples mixed with large ones bring little if any more than when alone while under such circumstances the selling value of the larger ones certainly is lowered. Sizing may be done with the eye — a rather slow laborious process — or by a machine. If a machine is used it can hardly be taken to the orchard and carted around from place to place and therefore is an additional reason for the central packing plant. Mr. Coe will discuss sizing machines a little later. When it comes to the actual packing work, then there is more lat - itude as to just how you pack your stuff and what containers are used. Under any circumstances, however, grading and sizing are preliminary to an atractive pack. The barrelling process, in case you still use the familiar container, is so commonplace that it needs no discussion. You all know what constitutes a good pack but I am frank to confess that all Nebraska growers do not follow the rules. The introduction of box and basket packing will, I believe, increase the uniformity of pack if for no other reason than that the contents can be inspected much easier than is the case with the barrel. Basket packing is barrel packing on a minature scale, especially with the newer type of basket. In the east frequently the seven-eighths bushel peach hamper is used for apples — the apples being packed from the bottom. Bushel baskets are superior to the hamper, however. Facing pads eliminate quite largely the bruis - ing which formerly occurred around the rim of the lid. I commend the basket pack for the serious attention of the grower of good fruit. Box-packing is a science or rather an art in itself. It really can </seg>
            <seg id="p570">572 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE &gt;e learned only by practice and especially is this the case when the ruit is wrapped. One may or may not wrap the fruit. The unwrapped ruit may or may not be layered but wrapped fruit is always placed o many tiers and so many to a tier. Unwrapped fruit is difficult to ayer all the way through the box and as a result the so-called ''jumble - ack" may be used. This consists of facing the box and then packing le remainder without attention to placing. This may be satisfactory or small sizes which take more time and paper if they are wrapped &gt;ut certainly the larger sizes should be handled this way. The box (resents one decided advantage over the barrel when it comes to the varieties which scald in storage for the introduction of oiled wraps has practically eliminated this trouble. Ordinarily, the most profitable «ples to box will be the larger sizes of the more desirable high quality rieties. The newer plantings of eastern Nebraska during the next few years should furnish many thousands of bushels fulfilling these requirements. With the enforcing of more rigid grading and packing rules, there will be, of course, low grade or small sized fruit unsuitable for the whole - sale trade but fruit which should represent a profit to the grower who has gone to the expense of growing and harvesting it. I know of some orchardists who have been paying most of their production expenses through the sale of the cull fruit. To the one who has developed a home market or roadside demand, the disposal of such fruit is not much of a problem. The large commercial grower however, sometimes has a dif - ficult situation to meet. His solution may possibly lie in the direction of having cellar storage available to hold the surplus for only a few weeks. Every year at apple picking time there is a great flood of low grade stuff available from small orchards and unsprayed orchards, generally. When this disappears in just a few weeks, there is a real demand still for cheaper fruit before the cold storage apples are quite ready for use. If the grower was prepared to hold his lower priced product for this short period it probably could be sold profitably. I am not sure but that a good common storage with natural ventilation and possibly an auxilliary cold storage cooling system would be a means to the desired end. With such a plant in connection with the packing shed, handling would be very materially facilitated. That there is a demand for the smaller sized fruit is conclusively liown by the fact that a Lincoln dealer recently paid $470 freight on a carload of Northwestern unwrapped, unlabelled apples which averaged ess than 2% inches. I suppose the grower was ashamed to have these mown as his fruit and hence did not place his name on the box. Why hould not the greater share of this freight charge have gone into some Nebraska grower's pocket? I heard one orchardist this fall complaining nat he could not dispose of his culls because there were too many home </seg>
            <seg id="p571">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURK 573 orchards in the country. Had he been able to hold his fruit three weeks the story would have been a different one. I have intended to discuss primarily in this paper the sorting and packing problems of the commercial grower — the man who after all rais - es the bulk of the fruit on the markets but who does not sell direct to the consumer. To the small grower the question is not so serious since he has generally a negligible quantity to dispose of. If one is favorably located even though he may be a comparatively large grower a roadside market may be a profitable outlet. Regardless of the difficulties often suggested and sometimes met I feel that commercial apple growing in southeastern Nebraska is a sound proposition. As long as the produc - tion per capita in this state is less than the average for the nation there need be little fear for if we can capture home market our future is safe. The method of doing this is I believe, to a considerable degree, a ques - tion of proper grading and packing. Discussion THE PRESIDENT: That was a very fine paper, and that remark about second-grade apples is true to some extent. You can readily see by the papers given so far that Nebraska growers have a great deal to learn about packing; and some of them will have to learn it and move to California and let somebody else pack their apples, because they can not stand to see those apples going out. This Dr. Funett, Professor Merrill spoke of, gets the top price on his apples. He had been buying these Dr. Funett apples for years. Stacy Brothers overbid him one year and then got all the trade until the Dr. Funett apples were out of the market. When they go down to him now to buy apples, they go down with instructions, "Get the apples at any price. If you don't who - ever gets them will kill that market." That is a situation we would like to have here in Nebraska. PROFESSOR WIGGANS: We are going to have some fruit farms after a while that will put you fellows in the shade, and the pack will be just what the buyers want. THE PRESIDENT: I know they have to do it. It is easy enough to say every barrel that won't make the grade is going out — to sign a contract to that effect. You instruct your packers. You see them throw - ing these apples out into the cull pile — about twice as many as are going down the chute into the barrel. You are going to find yourself looking over those culls pretty closely. "What did you throw that ap - ple out for", you say to the packer? He will probably show you a tiny spot. You have told the packers these apples must be perfect. If you ease up, they will go to the other extreme. It is a mighty hard proposition, and the thing has resolved itself into this: We are going to have to grow better and cleaner fruit. </seg>
            <seg id="p572">574 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Eare getting better every year, but there is too much of that second - de fruit. Out of a crop of eight thousand bushels, you can not pack imercially over five thousand to save your life. Mr. Homeyer will go to his orchard and look under the trees and can not see a worm. There are not many worms. When the apples com - mence to run over the table, they are pretty bad. There will be a little )it of scab or something like that. We are going to have to keep our ruit clean, and the Nebraska soil and climate will produce the rest. We have only a few pests, but we are going to have to check up closer n the control of those. On the train we had an argument about the coddling moth. In lissouri and in some other places they spray seven or eight times. At Nebraska City we have sprayed according to schedule. One year we prayed about every two weeks. We gave six sprays. In that way we lad better control than ever before, but it runs your cost up too much. Vhat we are going to try to do now is to get every man who has an rchard to put a cage in his orchard, and try to get a little better method of control of the coddling moth. If you get a sprayer with a pressure f over 225 pounds you are reducing your chance of controlling the oddling moth. Instead of throwing out a stream with force to it, you lave nothing but a mist — a cloud — with no drive to it. I am trying to start something, and maybe I can. There will be some objections, and ;hat is just what we want. The point of it is we do not control worms. They say you should put on your second spray about ten days after &amp; first application. Isn't it true sometimes that if you watch the rgence of moths that in a cage, 2 per cent would come out one day, maybe the next day 5 per cent, and maybe the next day 20 per cent, and the next day they would all be out? Sometimes 2 per cent will come the first day, and the next day 98 per cent will come out. Is that true? PROFESSOR WIGGANS: You would have a large variation there, and that is why you must spray every two weeks. It means we must pay more attention to the late brood which has been giving us the trou - ble. If you had sprayed those orchards another time after your July spraying, you would not have half as many worms. THE PRESIDENT: We did spray, but the fellows down below didn't. The buyers would look at Mr. Homeyer's orchard and look at. mine and say, "You fellows don't know what worms are." We sprayed from early in the morning until 9:30; then sprayed from 4 :30 p. m. until ! at night. Even with that, we slipped up some place. PROFESSOR WIGGANS: You mentioned the fact you are running up your production cost. Didn't it pay you to put on that last spray? THE PRESIDENT: Yes. </seg>
            <seg id="p573">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 575 PROFESSOR WIGGANS: If by running up your production cost you can increase the net returns about 10 to 30 per cent, isn't that a paying business? THE PRESIDENT: It is. We are going to have to grow better fruit if we will try to pack it and put it on the market in competition with other fruits. Where they pack 75 per cent of their crop, we only pack 50 per cent, and their overhead is about the same as ours. We do not like to send so much to the cider mill. We try to sell it. I sold a car in Omaha last week. It was poor stuff, but this fellow wanted it. When he saw it, he threw up his hands and said, "I don't want it." I said, "Will you sell it to our account?" T It got in a wreck, and even good apples will look bad under those circumstances. We had so much of that stuff and wanted to sell it. We would probably have been better off if we had taken that poor grade stuff and dumped it in the river. If we could become organized to the point where every grower would do that, we would be better off. PROFESSOR WIGGANS: If you had dumped those worms in the river, they would have landed in Richardson county. (Laughter.) THE SECRETARY: I have a few words to add to that spraying talk. Quite often people are "penny wise and pound foolish." In Pro - fessor Beck's orchard at Peru he had followed the regular schedule until the last spray. He resented the fact that I suggested we spray some of the trees that did not seem to have many apples. Usually when you have but few apples on a tree that does not have much else to do, it will make those few apples big. He would not let me put the spray on those trees. We found the percentage of worms in those was so great that if they had been sprayed, the difference between what they brought as culls and they would have brought as first-grade fruit, would have paid for all his spraying for the first year. THE PRESIDENT: I want to ask you about a spreader. It is used especially in the last two sprays. What is your opinion on the use of a spreader? THE SECRETARY: I think we will have to come to that. I no - ticed our fruit this year — the Jonathans particularly — were badly rus - seted by our spray in mid-summer. They found in Iowa that the spread - er seems to reduce the russeting. Big blotches of spray material make the apple unsightly. It can be rubbed off if the packers will wear cot - ton gloves. But what is the use of having the spots there? I think our material will go a little farther and do a little better work, because it will be more evenly distributed over the surface of the fruit. PROFESSOR F. M. COE: Professor Lovett was one of the auth - orities on spreaders. He said where you use the spreader you can </seg>

Where you are using - three pounds to one hundred gallons, you can cut it to one and one-half pounds and get the same effect. He recommends the spreader particu - larly with outfits of low capacity with which the grower can not get good control. He recommended it for the last spray because the drop - lets of lead were not as conspicuous on the fruit. THE PRESIDENT: What brand of spreader? PROFESSOR COE: This is the Calcium Caseinate In Iowa they have been running some tests with skim milk. They take a barrel of skim milk and put in some soda to make it dissolve. They make a stock solution and put a certain amount in every spray tank and it makes a good spreader. I can give you the formula for that if you want it. LTHE PRESIDENT: I do not know whether this will be of interest all of you. It is pretty important for everybody in commercial wing. Q. Have you tried hydrated lime? THE SECRETARY: I have seen that done. It has a tendency to neutralize any acid arsenic in the lead arsenate. Ordinary lead ar - senate is not dangerous with apples, but with peaches it is, and it is advisable to use about a pound of Hydrated lime in 100 gallons of spray material. PROFESSOR COE: (Reading from the Iowa State Horticultural Society's proceedings, discussing "A New Development in Orchard Spraying, by H. E. Nichols.) "A cheap form of caseinate spreader was used in an orchard at Charles City. Skim milk was purchased and al - lowed to sour. Two-thirds of a pound of common baking soda was added to a ten-gallon can of this milk. One gallon of this mixture was added to each 100 gallons of spray material. This material should be as good as any of the commercial products, and should be much cheaper." It gives a number of formulas for calcium caseinate mixing. I want to say something about the relation of high pressure in the Calyx spray. In the northwest they find the higher the pressure, the ner the spray. They get better control by a fine spray and under high ressure — 250 pounds — than by a coarse spray. Many investigators lave compared the coarse driving spray to the fine mist in the control f coddling moth and have found the mist fully as • effective. MR. HUTCHINS, (University Place): 1 want to make a remark. I have listened to the discussion with very much interest. I want to say this is an exceptional year according to my experience.

This year I sprayed the same as usual. When I went to get the apples for market I was ashamed to show them to anyone. Where did all these worms come from? This year, in spite of spraying, we had worms. Every year won't be this way will it? THE PRESIDENT: Ask Mr. Wiggans about that PROFESSOR WIGGANS: The worm situation is different nearly every year. When the worm comes out and how long it takes to develop is a question of climate and heat as much as anything else. We never have any two summers just exactly alike and we can not follow any set rule. That is why some of these people are recommending spraying every two weeks. Regardless of season, you can cover the apple ami keep it covered, and no matter whether the worms come out early or late, you can get them. I think that is the answer to the problem. THE PRESIDENT: Is there any condition that will hurry the life of the worm — weather conditions for example ? THE SECRETARY: Certainly the weather affects the life cycle of the coddling moth. If we have cold, wet weather, it would mature slowly. PROFESSOR COE: In the fruit valleys in Idaho they have a sys - tem of horticultural inspectors in each district. Part of his job is to study the coddling moth. He makes recommendations to the growers as to when to spray. THE PRESIDENT: I am glad you mentioned that. There is going to come a day when we must have that inspection and compulsory spray - ing as they do out west if we will grow the right kind of fruit. I will appoint the following as a LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE C. G. Marshall, Chairman, Arlington. George Homeyer, Nebraska City. E. H. Hoppert, Lincoln. AMENDMENT TO NEBRASKA LIEN LAW MR. C. G. MARSHALL: This will be the last chance to get a reso - lution passed. This is a matter of an amendment to the Nebraska lien law. You all know that the mechanics' lien law in Nebraska provides that any contractor, plumber, electric light fixture man, etc., who puts material or labor into a building or puts a windmill on a place, and it is not paid for, can put a lien on that property to help him make the collection. </seg>
            <seg id="p576">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 578 I The nurserymen, especially the gardeners about Omaha and Iin- In, find they are in need of such a provision where they are putting idscape work on properties in the cities. They do not have access to e present lien law. They feel they have just as good a right to place lien on property for their planting materials and labor — grading and ing the lawn and planting shrubs and trees — as have the others who w have such protection. When they go after their money they can't t it, and must bring suit. This is not applicable to country territory; but in Omaha and Lin - coln, and possibly Grand Island and Hastings, is where it is needed. tThe nurserymen and gardeners of the city through their little or - zation are trying to get an amendment to the lien law. I would like ■ much if we could get the endorsement of the Association for this ndment. (Reads present lien law.) kThe amendment would insert: "Or any person who shall furnish r or material for the improving of lawns, including the planting of s and shrubs and plants in or on the lawn." It is to get such labor, material and services included in this lien law. It is no more than fair. You people in the smaller places who pay your bills for nursery stock have to help pay for quite a little loss oc - casioned by fellows of that kind. The building material men, the con - tractors and light fixture men can get their pay, but the fellow who has put in his time and labor with the trees and shrubs can hold the sack. I would like to see this Association go on record as approving this amendment to the present law. Iowa and Kansas both have such a law. The Omaha men find it is easier to make collection in Council Bluffs than in Omaha. I move that the Nebraska State Horticultural Society, in convention assembled, approves the passage of a bill by the Nebraska legislature which will add to the present mechanics' lien law a provision for a lien upon real estate by persons who improve same by furnishing or planting trees, plants and shrubs and other improvements. The motion was seconded and carried. THE PRESIDENT: Mr. George Marshall will tell us regarding this Izaak Walton League and its activities. The Izaak Walton League MR. GEORGE MARSHALL: I have been a member of the Omaha Chapter of the Izaak Walton League for two years. It is certainly the greatest organization in America, coming up quicker than any other organization has. It has gone all over the United States. People haves been wanting something of the kind, but never found a medium whereby </seg>
            <seg id="p577">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICUI/TfRE 579 they could express themselves. I think it will come through this League. They are anxious about what I am going to mention, and that is all the natural places in our prairie states — natural watering places and timber nooks which will be destroyed if left alone — that these be protected. They will do everything in the way of protecting our natural places. . The idea was if at least 50 per cent of the people who go away to Wisconsin or Minnesota or to northern Iowa or Colorado in order to have a little vacation and change and rest would stay in this state and keep the money here, they would be better off and the state would be better off. Their assumption was that the money expended would be put back twice over every year by people who are taking the money out of the state now. There is a way provided to take care of any expense. Fishing and hunting licenses bring in more money than is used in run - ning this department. They were thinking of turnin™ the surplus back into the general fund. The Isaak Walton League wants it used to protect these things. Lots of people pay licenses who never fish or hunt. The fact of the matter is, I have one this year, and have never gone fishing. I do not hunt with a gun, but I pay for a license. We ought to have some kind of a resolution. I move that this Society recognizes the furtherance of this idea and the protection of all these natural places. The motion was seconded. THE SECRETARY: One region that always impressed me as need - ing just that sort of backing is west of Fremont where the sand com - panies have excavated many acres. This area is an eyesore and a source of danger too. Those holes could be made into nice little lakes and parks could be developed around them. I have often wondered why the companies doing this work could not be pursuaded or compell - ed to develop these areas into beauty spots instead of an eye-sore? I think that could be accomplished by an organization of this kind. MR. MARSHALL: I was talking to George Wolz, who is Secre - tary of the Fremont Chamber of Commerce. He told me those sand companies own nearly every bit of that land along the railroad from those pits to Fremont, and says that not only is it a good scheme to develop it, but it will become dangerous to Fremont if it is not develop - ed. The Platte River might chop in and flow right into Fremont. They have been talking to the owners of this property and can't get anything from them. The owners won't let Fremont develop it and they won't develop it themselves. A law is needed whereby it can be condemned and made into a good watering place. The area is growing every year. I would estimate there are ten or fifteen acres of pond made annually. All through the Platte bottom and the Elkhorn bottom the same thing is true, and I think it would also apply to the Niobrara and Republican valleys. </seg>

Machinery Used in Grading and Packing Apples PROFESSOR COE: Before I talk about grading and sizing ma - linery, I want to call your attention to the Market News Service. If ou are interested in the apple market, you can write to the Bureau of gricultural Economics and ask for daily or weekly reports on the apple market. These reports give prices paid both at shipping points and terminal markets. (Reads today's market report.) It is a peculiar ling that fancy barrel Jonathans bring more money in Minneapolis tan in any other market. tl also want to call your attention to the U. S. Department of Agri - ture Bulletins No. 120 and No. 1080 on the preparation and packing apples for market. Dr. Wiggans has covered the subject of grading, packing and siz - ing. I will talk on the various machines used for these operations. In America our industries have been built up very largely on the principle of saving hand labor and using machinery as much as pos - sible in order to cut costs. Apple graders are of several different types. The simplest form is a sloping table. The apples are poured in at the top, and the different grades picked out as they roll by and placed in different barrels. The Cutler grader which we have here for your inspection has a rolling grading table that turns the apples over for the grader's inspec - tion, and carries them into the sizing part of the machine. This arrangement saves a good deal of handling of the fruit, it not being </seg>
            <seg id="p579">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 581 necessary for the graders to pick up the first-grade fruit. It goes by them into the sizing mechanism. The graders pick out only the culls and second or third-grade fruit. They do not size the fruit — just pick for color and quality. Some of the types of graders used in the northwest have a wide belt that carries the fruit past the grader, with narrow belts on each side. With this arrangement, the sorters pick up all the fruit and place it on the different belts according to grades. THE PRESIDENT: What is the difference in the cost? PROFESSOR COE: It costs very nearly as much to make a sys - tem of belts as to make the rollers, which are wooden cylinders with cotton rope wrapped around them like a screw. It is a very simple arrangement. Sizing mechanisms are of two kinds, those that size by weight and those that size by diameter. The Cutler machine which we have here sizes according to weight. Each apple is automatically placed in a canvas-lined pocket which slides along over the bins on a steel track. A section of this track is hinged over each bin and supported by a spring in such a way that the apple will be dumped when it weighs more than the spring will support. By adjusting the springs with a gradually decreasing tension, the large apples drop into the first bin, while the smaller ones pass over into the second, third, fourth, or cull bins. Perhaps simpler are the machines that size by diameter. The "Ideal" grader made at Hood River, Oregon, uses this principle. The fruit is placed on its side in depressions on a narrow belt running just above the bins. A series of cross-belts at varying heights above the carrier belt roll the fruit off into the bins according to size. Another sizer of this type is a home-made machine called the Vir - ginia grader. The sizing is done by a board slanted at an angle so that the fruit would lie against it when rolling on the belt. The nar - row belt is slanted so that the fruit rolling on it is supported by this sizing board which is fitted with different size apertures. The small apples drop out in one place and the next size in another. It is driven by motor or gasoline engine. You can obtain blue prints from the •'American Fruit Growers" magazine. The material to make one of these can be purchased for $25, exclusive of the motive power. It can be built by any good carpenter. The machine will size fairly accurately, but has not the capacity of the Cutler grader. You must have persons watching the apples as they feed by. You get a little bruising. This is about the cheapest grader that can be obtained. Fruit sizers and graders are made in many sizes and with varied arrangements. Capacities vary from 100 barrels to 1,200 barrels daily, </seg>
            <seg id="p580">582 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE and may be adapted to almost any pack or container. Models are now made for barrel packing and for basket packs. You can get a model arranged with spring- bins on one side and hoppers for barrels on the other so that you can pack your fancy grades in boxes and the rest of the salable stock in barrels. Ordinarily in the northwest, packing houses are equipped with a number of various accessory machines. On each side of the grader they have roller conveyors. All they have to do is to pick up the box of fruit, set it on the rollers and give it a shove. They may have a second conveyor that will take them down to the box press. Under - neath the roller conveyor they usually have a chute for empty boxes. With barrel grading you can get the same type of conveniences you can with box packing. The Cutler people put out a barrel grader which has a barrel filling station for the fruit after it is sized and graded. On one side it has a barrel conveyor, and the empty barrels are put on this and faced by one man who picks the fruit off the belt. When faced, the barrel is conveyed to the filling station. The fruit drops into the barrel, being controlled by a foot lever. The filling station is equipped with an automatic barrel shaker, the speed of which is reg - ulated by the operator. When the barrel is full the conveyor takes it to the barrel press where the head is put on and nailed. The con - veyor then takes it to the loading platform. If you are in a situation where you can build a central cooperative packing house, you can afford to get all this accessory machinery to cut down the cost of packing, more than if you have a little individual packing house. In the northwest both methods are in use, but the community house is growing in favor where orchards are close enough to warrant hauling the fruit loose. Temporary common storage space is usually provided in the base - ment of the packing houses, and sometimes cold storage plants are operated in conjunction with them. By combining community packing with cooperative selling, growers not only save money on packing costs, but benefit by having a uniform grade and pack which commands a premium on the markets. (Fruit grading and packing demonstration with the Cutler grader followed.) </seg>
            <seg id="p581">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 583 ♦SOME IMPORTANT FACTORS INFLUENCING THE SUCCESSFUL GROWING OF GRAPES AND RASPBERRIES Prof. R. E. Marshall, Dept. of Horticulture, Michigan Agricultural College, East Lansing, Michigan. Outlook for Grapes. During the past five years there has been a tremendous expansion in the grape industry in Michigan, in New York, in the Ozarks and, of course, in the European grape industry in California. In the Paw Paw-Lawton section of Michigan all of the suitable grapes prunings were made into cuttings during the spring of 1924 as has been the case for the last four or five years. In spite of the thousands of plants which have been propagated for these cuttings, the nurserymen have been unable to supply the demand from growers for new plants. Not only are the older grape growers increasing their acreages but many farmers who have never grown grapes before are making plantings of considerable size. When one sees or hears of this expansion of the grape acreage, he, of course, begins to turn over in his mind the possibilities of an over-production of grapes and in Michigan we have been analyzing the situation somewhat as follows: Grapes will not always bring from $50.00 to $100.00 a ton as they have for the past several years. In fact, many of our Michigan grape growers can well recall having received $15.00 and $18.00 per ton for grapes. Perhaps, we shall never again see such low prices, but it is entirely reasonable to believe that we may within a few years see the price of grapes decline to the neighborhood of $20.00 to $25.00 a ton. With such prices, can the grape men remain in business? We figure that the average overhead cost of a vineyard in Michigan including such items as interest, taxes, insurance, trellis maintenance, replacement of vines and cover crop seed to be $35.00 per acre. Then the operative costs, such as spraying, cultivation, pruning, brush removal, tying, etc., will average about $40.00 per acre, although this cost varies widely be - tween vineyards. This, then, gives an average annual fixed cost of $75.00 per acre. The cost of harvesting and handling the crop will average in the neighborhood of $10.00 per ton. Thus, the vineyardist who produces only three tons of grapes per acre is producing them at a cost of about $35.00 a ton while the growers whose yield averages five tons has a production cost of $25.00 per ton. Then we have a very few growers who get yields as high as eight tons per acre and whose production costs are not more than $20.00 per ton. It is very evident that even though there are hundreds of acres of new vineyards coming into bearing every year that the growers who •This address was delivered at the J. J.

            <seg id="p582">584 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE have the right conditions and use the right production practices can produce grapes at a profit, even though the selling price declines to half of the present. Fig. 1 — A fruiting cane. Six of the eight! buds left on this cane have produced shoots. Note the flower clusters on the basal buds of the new shoots. Establishment of Vineyard. Grapes in Michigan are grown on a rather wide range of soils and dvantages are claimed for both the light and heavier soils. The grow - rs on the lighter sandy soils claim that they produce a grape of higher uality and a higher sugar content. Their yields, however, are con - iderably less than those obtained on the heavier soils and since the ommercial man is interested in dollars and cents returns the heavier oils are regarded as more profitable. Good air and water drainage s also very essential. We figure in Michigan that the twenty-acre unit is about the min - imum of economical production unless one is also engaged in other lines of fruit production and can use the same sprayer and other tools for his vineyard that he uses in caring for his orchards. We prefer strong one-year old plants. These are cut to two buds at planting time. Our planting distances vary all the way from eight by eight to ten by ten feet, but there is a general tendency among the growers now to place the rows ten feet apart so as to accomodate power sprayers and to place the vines eight, nine or ten feet apart in the row depending upon the character of the soil. During the first year, it is a common practice to grow two rows of corn between the grapes as the cultivation necessary for corn is also very satisfactory from the standpoint of the young grapes. While it seems of little importance, I would stress very strongly the necessity of developing a good straight trunk, because it means a considerable saving in labor after the vines have reached bearing age if the trunks </seg>
            <seg id="p583">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 585 are straight enough to permit horse cultivation of all of the land and to reduce the amount of hand hoeing. These straight trunks may be developed by placing stakes by the side of each plant and tying one of the shoots to this stake at six inch intervals as it grows throughout the season. Fig. 2 — A straw mulch is very practical for the farm vineyard in keeping down weeds and conserving moisture. Large vine&gt;at&gt;.1s are usually cultivated At the end of the first year if the vines have made a good growth, the trellis should be constructed. We usually use one post for each three vines, placing them from 24 to 30 feet apart. Two wires of number ten, eleven or twelve guage are placed at 30" and 54" from the ground. If the growth during the first season has been strong enough, we tie a cane to the upper wire. If the growth has not been strong enough to permit tying it to even the lower wire, we cut the cane back to two buds. All other canes are removed with the excep I? on of the one selected for the trunk. After the first season all suckers which originate from near the surface of the ground are removed shortly after they appear. At the end of the second season's .growth four short arms are selected, one extending in either direction on each of the wires of the trellis. This presupposes that you are going to follow the Kniffen System of train - ing which we have found to be the cheapest and simplest of the long cane systems of pruning. This is the only system of training that is used in the Paw Paw-Lawton section in Michigan. </seg>

Pruning the Grape. During the past three seasons Dr. N. L. Partridge of our Experi - ment Station has been conducting some rather extensive experiments with regard to the pruning of the Concord Grape. His experiments are being conducted in three vineyards; one growing on a heavy soil, one on a medium soil, and the third on a light sandy soil. I have only time, however, to give you a sort of a summary of the results he has obtained. He has found that there is a considerable difference in the amount of fruit that different buds on a cane will produce the succeeding season. For instance, the basal bud on a cane is very un - productive, often producing no grapes. The second bud is more pro - ductive than the first but is still a poor producer. The production per bud increases from the base of the cane until we reach about the fifth or sixth bud when there is a very slight, but gradual decline in pro - duction from there on to the 12th to 15th buds. In other words, on the average the fourth to eighth buds are the most productive ones. A definite cane length can not be recommended but Dr. Partridge says that we should leave not less than eight buds per cane on strong soils. In our average vineyards, we usually leave about ten buds per cane. </seg>
            <seg id="p585">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 587 Dr. Partridge has also found that the more vigorous the growth the better the yield will be the following year and that if the growth is not strong that the vine should receive a heavier pruning. In other words, there should be fewer buds left on the weaker plant. He rec - ommends an average of about 40 buds per vine, evenly distributed be - tween four canes but with vines which have made a very vigorous growth it is advisable to leave more buds, perhaps 50 or even 60 in some cases. With the vines that have made less growth, 25 or 30 buds may be sufficient. Where as many as 50 or 60 buds are left there should be 5 or 6 canes rather than the customary four. The additional one or two canes should originate from the main trunk just above the lower wire and should be trained diagonally across the trellis to the upper wire. There is a distinct correlation between the size of cane and the yield of that cane. The most productive canes are those which are about one-quarter inch in diameter or in other words about the size of an ordinary lead pencil between the 5th and 6th buds. If it is neces - sary to choose between a cane slightly larger than this or slightly small - er the larger should be given the preference. Canes with inter-nodes of medium length are more fruitful than the close jointed or long joint - ed ones. It is evident that from what has been heretofore said that the so - called spur system of pruning is not as profitable as the long cane sys - tem of pruning. The Iowa Experiment Station found a number of years ago that the long cane system of pruning gave an increase in yield of 40 per cent over the spur system. These results were borne out in Tennessee and more recently in Michigan. </seg>

Six canes originating close to the trunk have been left ar.d these shortened to 8 or 10 buds. Note also the renewal spurs which insure protection of fruiting wood near the old trunk. Management of the Vineyard. t Plowing in a vineyard should never be at a greater depth than se inches and for this purpo.-e the three bottom gang plow is pre - yed by our growers. After the vineyard has been plowed we usually most of the cultivation with a disc or with a spring tooth harrow. We should use a cover crop for the vineyard that kills down during the winter so as to avoid unnecessary hand work the following spring in hoeing such crops as rye and vetch out of the grape row — either oats or millet are satisfactory. We must maintain a good supply of humus in the soil and this must be furnished either by growing cover crops or by applying manure or by following both practices. We have had some good results from fertilization of our vineyards and have found an application of about 200 pounds of nitrate of soda to give the best results. Outlook for Raspberries. Michigan is the leading raspberry state in the union. We now have in the neighborhood of 9,000 acres of raspberries in the state — 4,000 of which are located in Berrien County. In this county, we also </seg>
            <seg id="p587">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 589 have from 600 to 800 acres which are devoted to the growing of rasp - berry plants for the nurseiy trade. During the past few years, there has been a considerable decline in the yields obtained from both red and black raspberries. This crop has probably given us more concern than any other fruit crop in Mich - igan. We were unable to account for this decline in yield until some two years ago when we found that part of it could be attributed to the raspberry disease situation. In the New England states, for instance, diseases have been so serious that the black raspberry growers are planting raspberries with the idea of getting not more than two crops before the plantations must be destroyed. In New York state there has been a tendency to plant the poorer quality Columbian rather than the Cumberland and Plum Farmer. The situation is fully as bad in Ohio, but here the government has eradicated these diseases from two townships near Cleveland with the idea of demonstrating that they can be controlled by completely destroying all plants showing signs of dis - ease. We have found that we have some of these diseases in Mich - igan although they are not as ~e.iGus as they are in other states. In view, however, of our leadii.g position in the raspberry industry we have, of course, been very much interested in the general disease sit - uation. Some of these dl^;. -s with which we have to contend are Crown Gall, Mosaic, Yellows and Leaf Curl on the red raspberries and cane blight and blue stem o.i Li-clt raspberries. Antharnose, of course, can be controlled by spray.i. o t . .a ..ot to be regarded as being in the same class with these other , . -j~.se s. We are eradicating all plants showing signs of any of these J jjases in our nursery plantations and as well as in the fruit plantations and hope to keep Michigan quite free of these threatening diseases. As a further discouragement our Michigan growers have not been receiving good prices for raspberries at the canneries during the past few seasons. Neither has the shipping situation been what we desired until 1922, when several pre-cooling plants were installed and our ship^ ping radius was increased to some 500 or 600 miles. It is evident then that it has been rather difficult to encourage the planting of more rasp - berries in Michigan in view of the situations that we have had to face. However, for those who are located near larger cities the situation has been considerably better. For instance, the prices on our Detroit Municipal Market has been at least 100 per cent better than those at the canneries in western Michigan. Again, the raspberry is one of our best canned products. I do not believe the demand for canned raspberries has ever been satisfied. So that, even though the immed - iate outlook is a little discouraging for the grower who is dependent upon the canning factory and the Histe^t market, I firmly believe the raspberry game is bound to soon be.on.e more profitable. </seg>
            <seg id="p588">590 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Establishing the Raspberry Plantation. I Our varieties of black raspberries are for the most part Cumber - d and Plum Farmer. In most plantations these two varieties are re or less mixed. Both are satisfactory from the standpoint of the iwer although I personally prefer the Plum Farmer because of the sater tendency towards plump, attractive fruits. Cuthbert and King the leading red varieties. Cuthbert is decidedly the best for can - g, and of course, is a higher quality table berry. King is grown a great number of our growers for shipping, because it is firmer 1 does not have a tendency to mash down in the boxes like the Cuth - t. Due to the fact that it crumbles badly, it is not desired by the tners. In starting a new plantation, we should be particularly careful to secure plants that are as nearly disease-free as possible. Of course, you do not have the great number of diseases which I have previously mentioned and I would suggest therefore that you secure your plants It is very necessary that raspberries be located on well-drained land. Where there are hard-pans or subsoils that are rather impervious — either black or red raspberries will not make a satisfactory .growth and, in fact, frequently, die out during the second or third season. Many Michigan plantations are unprofitable because of poor soil drainage. Planting distances vary considerably in Michigan. The rows are usually placed some six to eight feet apart and the average spacing of the plants in the row is about three feet intervals. Cover crops, such as oats and millet, are preferred for the same reasons as were men - tioned in the discussion of grapes. Manure is probably the best all round fertilizer for raspberries. We have been experimenting with commercial fertilizers but as yet have nothing definite to report, al - though, we have considerable evidence to indicate that summer or fall applications of nitrate of soda or sulphate of amonia will be of more value in increasing yields than spring applications. We get commercial control of anthracnose with one delayed dor - mant application of lime sulphur used at the rate of one to twenty. We have been recommending a second and third application but because of the fact that there has been so much damage to the plants from these sprays and since we have been able to get commercial control with a dormant application, we are eliminating the second and third applica - tions of lime sulphur. Of course, it is necessary to remove all the old canes immediately after the fruiting season, as this adds materially in controlling anthracnose. Pruning the Raspberry. Mr. Stanley Johnston, Superintendent of our South Haven Experi- </seg>
            <seg id="p589">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 591 ment Station has been conducting some experiments in the pruning of raspberries which have given us some very worth-while results. First, he has found that every bud on the black raspberry is potentially a fruit bud and that if it is given a chance it will produce fruit. How - ever, under our ordinary systems of pruning, many of these buds re - main dormant throughout the season. During the spring of 1923 he pruned one lot of black raspberries very heavily, leaving only four buds on each lateral. A second lot received the ordinary commercial prun - ing in which the laterals were cut back to about 12 to 15 inches in length and a third lot received no pruning except that the winter in- jured tips were removed. These berries sold at $1.75 per 16-qt. case. You will note that the unpruned plants gave an increase in yield of a little mere than 10 cases per acre over the heavily pruned lot -but to secure this increase in yield it was necessary to pick more than a half million more berries and to pick these additional berries the grower received only three - fourths of a cent per quart for his labor. The plants pruned to four - bud laterals slightly out-yielded the commercial or ordinary pruned plants, but of considerable more importance is the fact that the fruit from the four bud laterals was considerably larger, ripened earlier, produced no crumbly berries, and that the pickers cou'.d p'ck at Last 50 percent more plants in a given period of time with the plants pro - ducing about the same yield. At the first and second pickings, the plants pruned to four-bud laterals yielded two times as much fruit as the commercially or ordinarily pruned plants and four times as much as the non-pruned plants and with us we are desirous of getting just as many early berries as possible. Mr. Johnston has also found that the canes of large diameters produce more and larger berries than the smaller canes. For instance, canes 21-32" in diameter yield more than twice as much fruit by weight as canes 13-32" in size and the fruit of the former was about 25 percent larger than that from the smaller canes. We have, also, found that it is preferable to pinch the shoots back in the summer when they have obtained a height of 24 to 30" rather that at 18" which has been the ordinary practice, because the best fruit comes from buds which are located on the main canes and if the canes have been headed at 18" only five buds on the average wDl be left on, the main cane while if these shoots have been pinched at 24" to 30" there will be on the average about 14 to 18 buds on the main cane Mr. Johnston's recommendations then are that we leave four canes 'runing Yield per Acre o. o: lernes per acn bud lateral 210.3 16-qt. cases 1,819,727 lommercial lo Pruning 200.9 16-qt. cases 220.9 16-qt. cases 2,162,145 2,374,241 </seg>

The canes selected should have a diameter of from one-half inch to five-eighths inch at a point about six inches above the ground. Pruning Red Raspberries. Our pruning practices with red raspberries have evidently been more nearly correct than with the blacks. We find that the yield in - creases in general with the height of the cane and that the size of the fruit produced from different buds remains rather constant until after we get above the 35th bud when the size of fruit begins to decrease. This would indicate then that for average plants, we should leave about five canes and that these should have from 25 to 35 buds each on the main canes. If, as is occasionally the case, laterals have been formed from the main canes, we should leave about twelve buds on these lat - erals because the basal five buds of a red raspberry lateral usually remain dormant or are vegetative rather than fruitful. </seg>

            <seg id="p599">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 601 CORN BELT LAMB CHOPS FOR DINNER Prof. H. D. Fox, Agricultural College. Mr. Fox discussed the changes that have taken place in the types of sheep produced within the last century. His address in part is as fol - lows — At first sheep were primarily a wool proposition. Sheep were kept from which woolen clothing could be produced, with the result that the prevailing type was the wool-producing sheep. In fairly recent years there has been a change of types produced, and a reduction in age of sheep sent to market, especially since 1870. With the introduction of refrigeration it became possible to produce sheep in the west and send mutton to the east, and with this has come a change in the methods of slaughter. These have had their effect on the type of sheep produced. Transportation facilities have improved and have had their effect on the sheep industry. Americans do not like mutton more than two or three weeks of age. The great increase in the demand for lamb and mutton has been very noticeable in the last forty or fifty years. Our average consumption of lamb and' mutton is not over six or seven pounds per person, while in 1912 the average was a little better than eight pounds, very much lower than the beef consumption of sixty pounds. At the present time the average runs around six pounds. You will find that consumption varies somewhat with prices. During high-priced years consumption falls down. In 1921 sheep were very cheap, result - ing in quite a little increase in mutton consumption. Lamb as a market product was not very firmly established until recently. Until 1910, a few in the nineties, lamb were not very im - portant, in fact according to U. S. Department of Agriculture statistics sheep placed on the market prior to 1840 ranged from four to eight years of age, seventy-five to ninety per cent of them. Now eighty per cent of them are from four to twelve months of age, so that you can see there has been a decrease in the age of marketing. Some keep lambs to an older age for the sake of the wool crop. The quality of mutton de - sired is that produced by the lambs. Nebraska Adapted for Growing Lambs. Nebraska as a lamb producing state. I do not know of any state that is better placed than Nebraska for sheep raising — for location, available feeds, and climate. Nebraska is favored with the largest sheep market in the country, Omaha. Omaha is connected with the best transportation facilities. A number of lines pass through Omaha, that give very good transportation facilities. It makes it possible to buy sheep on the western market and ship through to either of the river </seg>
            <seg id="p600">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 602 markets. For location in this respect, Omaha is unexcelled. Lambs are going east for the reason that over a third of the lamb and mutton con - umed in this country is used in the Northeastern and New England tates, about 35% of it to be exact, and the surplus of lamb and mutton »at are produced in the western and northwestern states are finished lere. Nebraska is very well fixed with regard to feeds. With regard to imate, the fact that the winters are relatively dry, fairly open, and rather cool is very advantageous. Lambs do best when weather is fairly ool and dry. A large percentage of feeding done in this state is done n open yards. The combination of local transportation and abundance n sheep feeds, and also climatic conditions make this possible. High Priced Corn Makes Feeding a Problem. There is the problem of buying at the right time and at the right price, but at the present time the problem of feeding is of very great im - frtance. Corn seems pretty high in price, and it seems particularly ad - ntageous to feed some protein supplements. Corn that was sixty nts last year is a dollar and ten cents this year. Linseed meal and bton seed cake have not risen in proportion to corn. Alfalfa is about e same price. A person should feed one-fourth to one-eighth pound cotton seed meal with the alfalfa and corn, resulting in fattening in I shorter length of time. While it is not always policy to feed such pplements, I think those that feed from one-fourth to one-eighth and a day with the hay and corn will find it economical. As to corn substitutes. We have tried barley. It is one that might be used if it can be purchased cheaply. Barley is worth about eighty per cent as much as corn. A little barley or all barley can be used if it can be purchased, at a proportionately cheaper price than corn. Hominy feed is efficient with sheep, and is good to feed. If you can bay it cheaper than corn it might be a good feed to use. QUESTION: What about oats as a feed for sheep? MR. FOX: I believe that you can use a limited amount of oats during the first part of the feeding period. Oats are relatively low in feeding value compared to corn. I believe you could use them the first four weeks to get your lambs started, but after that greatly reduce the oats and replace them with corn. Last year we found no advantage from substituting oats for corn. QUESTION: How about Sweet Clover as compared with alfalfa. MR. FOX: If of good quality as compared with alfalfa it can be used with about the same results. L QUESTION: What plan of marketing would you advise in the case a small flock? -MR. FOX: If a man is going to produce lambs, I would suggest </seg>
            <seg id="p601">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 603 that he breed his ewes to come in about February or March. I would feed right from the start. Have an arrangement to feed separate from the ewes, and crowd them from the start. They should weigh from seventy-five to ninety pounds in July, a very good market weight. They will probably return more profit then than later in the summer. In ad - dition they will make more rapid and cheaper gains while running with their mothers and nursing them. The larger breeds will, of course, make the larger gains. Get your lambs off as early as possible in this state. Hot weather does not do them any good, there is some danger from stomach worms, so there is some advantage in crowding them off to market as soon as you can. Sheep should have some kind of shelter, but no elaborate equipment is necessary. A FARM FLOCK IS A PROFITABLE INVESTMENT. W. H. Forsyth, Malmo, Ohio. The subject assigned to me on the program is one that might be approached from many angles, and I doubt if I shall handle it quite as any of you would do had you been called upon to fill this place. First let us stop for a minute and visualize these facts. Nebraska is a state of nearly eighty thousand square miles in extent. There are within the state one hundred twenty-four thousand farms, and on those farms a total permanent sheep population of about two hundred thousand, or about one and one-half sheep per farm. That does not include the half million or so western lambs now in the limits of the state for feeding, which you can see would bring the total sheep population for a few winter months up to something near eight hundred thousand head in the state. Figure 1 — A flock of good sheep, properly managed nearly always pay a profit. In a state where the farms average as large as in Nebraska you can easily see that the population of the livestock wealth of the state </seg>
            <seg id="p602">604 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE which sheep constitute is very small. Another index of the present scarcity of sheep within the state is the fact that only about four farms out of a hundred reported breeding ewes on the farms in 1920. The number has, of course, increased since then. WHY DOES NEBRASKA PRODUCE SO LITTLE WOOL. Now let us see if we can find causes for Nebraska's farmers pro - lucing less than two pounds of wool for each member of the family while hey consume on an average of five pounds per year, according to gov - ernment statistics. In the first place the sheep may be termed a &gt;ioneering animal, and has always been most prominent in frontier countries. Its fleece can be hauled long distances without deteriorating. '."he sheep can be handled in large numbers with a minimum of care and shelter, and can thrive in dry or mountainous regions where general farming is impossible. Further, sheep require little trouble to finish, and can be sold off the range easier than other animals. Such traits fit hem for cheap lands far from market, under which classification most of Nebraska does not qualify. The state is in the edge of the corn belt, and the farmer with thousands of bushels of corn does not turn to sheep as an outlet. Rather he feeds hogs and cattle, both capable of putting on large quantities of fat, and consuming large quantities of corn. Then there is the old idea, and one with considerable foundation that sheep and cattle will not thrive on the same pasture. If pas - tures are stocked as heavily as in the later days of the free range, they cannot be kept together profitably, although no one can say how im - portant it is. I am sure that the old-time enmity of the cattlemen for sheep and vice versus is responsible for a lack of interest in sheep in some sections today. Predatory Animals Curb Sheep Production. Another factor that curbed the early Nebraskan's interest in sheep was the presence of predatory animals which made the breeding of sheep in small flocks almost impossible, and prevented the establish - ment of farm flocks. Formerly it was the wolves, but latterly the dogs from villages and neighboring farms. Troubles with internal parasites ex - perienced personally or witnessed as part of a sheep venture on the part of someone in the neighborhood may also deter a few from adding a small flock of ewes to the farm inventory. And, although these last two are very easy to combat, they loom very large in the minds of most people. Lastly, but by no means least in my estimation, Nebraska's non - role as sheep breeder is due to the nationality of many of her people. The population of Scandanavia, Germany, Poland and Czecho-Slovakia have suffered severely in the growth of Nebraska. These are all indus- </seg>
            <seg id="p603">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 605 trious people and careful farmers, but not one of them is a sheep pro - ducing country of the world. Accustomed at home to cows and pigs and chickens, it would have been unusual had they engaged in sheep raising here. When the father did not have them, his son unskilled in their management hesitated to begin breeding sheep. He may feed some, but habit and custom are strong and he will not change easily from the manner of his father. Those are a few of the reasons that I believe are responsible for the scarcity of small flocks in Nebraska. Sufficient for the causes. Are there any good reasons why a Nebraska farmer should have a small flock of ewes on his farm? Sheep Clean Up The Farm. A few sheep will live around the farm on roughage and pasture that would otherwise go to waste. I do not like to speak of them as scaven - gers, but they are very good in that role. While other farm animals will eat only about fifty per cent of common weeds, sheep will relish about ninety per cent of our common weeds, and sheep farms are as a rule pretty well cleaned up with regard to weeds. If we except the sow, there is no other animal as prolific as the ewe. With reasonable care we can expect almost 100% lamb crop, and such cannot be said of either cattle or horses. In many cases sheep men get as high as 150% lamb crops, but such cases are unusual. We may also say that the sheep makes more economical use of feed than other animals, putting on more flesh per hundred po\inds of feed con - sumed. They require less labor than the dairy cow, but probably as much as the beef cow. In the way of buildings, all that is needed is a dry shelter. Their wool protects them from the cold and an open shed is enough for any but the youngest lambs. Just now, at the close of the recent depression, when specialists are crying for diversification of farming operations, the farm flocks of - fer two new sources of income. The fleece and the lamb are not sold at the same time and neither goes to market right with the other crop. Here, then, is another chance to add to and fill up some gaps in the farm income. Lastly, I believe the strongest reason for your having a flock, is the present supply and demand for lamb and wool. I say lamb and wool because we are consuming ever-increasing amounts of lamb, not mutton, and the sheep industry is now a two-fold industry. The old system of keeping sheep (wethers) until three and four years old for their fleece, has disappeared save in a few sections of the world where land is cheap and grain is high. </seg>
            <seg id="p604">606 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Lamb Prices Fixed by America. Our lamb prices, the economists tell us, are fixed by America, be - cause lamb and mutton are eaten fresh, in contrast to the chilled beef an-1 cured pork. But, even without export trade, and with the breaking up of the range flocks, and our ever increasing population developing a stronger appetite for lamb, we need have little fear for the future phase of the industry. In the way of wool market competition, England has less sheep than ie had before the war. Argentina they tell us has one-half less sheep lan she had twenty-five years ago. Russia is out of the running in her nsettled condition and offers no competition as a wool producer. It is so true that she does not offer us a market for a surplus. The United tates has witnessed a huge decrease in total sheep population since 910, two hundred thousand of the decrease occurring in Nebraska. On top of all these figures there comes word that Australia and New Zealand are eight hundred thousand short of a normal sheep population. hat is a shortage that cannot be replaced easily. South Africa is the ne place, I believe, we can expect a growing competition in the near uture. With that condition in the world at large and much of the 1925 rop already contracted, lambs selling at $17 to $18, I think sheep men lave reason to be cheerful. Sheep Pay a Profit. Now you may want to know what you coulo expect in the way of returns from a farm flock if you should buy one. I don't intend to make ny promises, but will stop long enough to cite a few cases with which I m familiar (in eastern states). One Indiana farmer purchased twenty - ve old ewes at $3.50 per head. Twenty-one ewes had lambs that sold n the market for $16 per cwt. when weighing about seventy-five pounds per head. The gross return per ewe was $14.80 which made a nice rofit. All the feed they had taken was thirty-six bushels of corn, orty-five bushels of oats, and about seven and a half tons of alfalfa. Another farmer, in Ohio, realized last year $550 gross income from flock of twenty-nine grade ewes. Your flock is like anything else. You will get out of it what you put into it. A little feed and care will o a long way. Don't expect the "old ewe" to do it all and become a ource of unlimited income. For instance, we found that the cost of iroducing one pound of wool varied from less than ten cents to over ighty cents on different farms in the country. One man was using a hropshire ram, getting good lambs and taking good care of the flock. The other had mostly two and three year old wethers which he was wintering on timothy hay. The difference was in the men and their management, not in the sheep. </seg>
            <seg id="p605">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATB BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 607 Start With Caution. Now, in starting a farm flock, go cautiously at first. Don't plunge, and expect to be successful. I have known men to buy two or three car loads of ewes the first year and then write the sheep specialist at the college asking how to feed, etc. Of course the Nebraska farmer would not do that, but such instances have occurred. If the weather and luck and the Good Lord were kind to them they might be-all right, but chances are that they are poorer and wiser men at the end of six months. Take it easy with a few the first year unless you have had previous experience in shepherding. If you have, it will be all right for you to buy aged ewes, but for the beginner I would recommend younger ewes even at higher prices. I could name you prosperous, even wealthy men, who made most of their money buying aged and diseased ewes and doctoring them back to a reasonably healthy state, but my advice to the beginner is "Don't try it that way." After buying the ewes, it is necessary to purchase a ram. Don't be afraid of getting him too good. Such rams are not sold, but if you are paying a good price be sure to get what you are paying for. I have seen rams that had such disqualifications as to deny them registration papers shipped to farmers in distant and non-sheep districts. There are a few breeders that will take advantage of such customers, and be on your guard, though most pure bred breeders are honest men. Face coloring and wool covering of the ear may be unimportant in the average flock, but we like to get full value for our money. One mature ram to forty or fifty ewes should be enough. Flushing Ewes, Now, as to handling your ewes, before breeding, I would suggest you put them on a very succulent pasture, such as sweet clover, alfalfa, etc., or give them some grain and have them gaining in flesh. This is called flushing and will result in a larger lamb crop the following spring, because a ewe that is gaining flesh is much more likely to be bred than one that is losing or simply holding her own. The gestation or preg - nancy period of sheep is one hundred forty-six to one hundred fifty-two days, approximately five months and the breeding dates can be figured back from the time you want the lambs dropped. Although the time the ewes will show in heat varies slightly with different breeds, few ewes will breed in the hot dry days of early fall. Before turning the ram in, the ewes should have all the wool around the dock and vulva trimmed so that she will be clean and the fleece will not bother the ram. Likewise it is a good thing if the wool on the fore half of the ram's belly is shorn, or at least stubbled. Leave the ram with the ewes about four weeks or a little longer if the weather has been warm, because they will be slower to come into heat in warm weather than when the weather is a little chilly. After removing the ram handle him just like any other </seg>
            <seg id="p606">608 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE breeding male not in service. Give him sufficient feed to keep in good condition and allow plenty of exercise. At the same time keep the ewes from losing in flesh. The foetal growth represents quite a drain on the body, especially for the last five r six weeks of pregnancy. This growth will of course cause a gain in eight unless the ration is so light as to force the ewe to tear down body ssue to supply her developing off-spring. Such a condition results in eak lambs, abortions, and other lambing troubles. You must feed next ears lambs from the time the ram goes to the ewes this fall. What to eed has been so ably presented by Professor Fox that I shall not stop o speak of that. Winter Shelter, So much for the breeding season. Let us turn to winter shelter. I have already made the point that sheep barns need not be warm, n fact they should not be warm, for warm crowded stables are the ost frequent causes of cotted wool. The animals crowding in a warm &gt;arn will cot or felt their wool and render it almost hopeless from the anufacturers standpoint. In this climate the open sheds, vuch as our college has here for feeder lambs will suffice, except during the ambing season. The one thing, however, absolutely essential to a good leep house is dryness. The sheep is more susceptible to bad effects rom dampness than any other farm animal, so feed your ewes and give lem a dry sunlit shelter, allowing fourteen to sixteen square feet of oor space per sheep. At lambing time you must be on the job to help any ewes that have trouble, and to revive weak lambs. Lambing pens made of two - by-four hurdles, hinged and fitted with hooks are very useful in helping to make ewes own lambs, especially when we have twins. After lamb - ing it may be best to try the udder. By the time the lamb is two days old it can be turned out with the flock unless the weather is bad. Creep Feed the Lambs. tAs soon as they will eat, supply the lambs with a creep and feed they will clean up. Your gains will be cheaper then than ever after i you should take advantage of it. Keep them growing, and don't d them too long for the market ,for the public is wanting light lambs. Now in conclusion let me say that I don't advise anyone to jump into the sheep business, for if you did the rest of us would have to swim hard to get out. It is like any other good thing; it can be overdone. However, if you are a real stockman, and want to add a little to your income a flock of sheep will help you do it. I can thank the three and four year-old wethers of which Professor Fox spoke for my own college education. </seg>
            <seg id="p607">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 609 QUESTION: You made a statement about turning the ewes out on sweet clover. Have you had any trouble with your ewes bloating? ANSWER: Not much. I think there will be very little trouble if you turn them on the clover when it is dry. THE WOOL END OF THE SHEEP BUSINESS. C. N. Cadwallader, Lincoln Hide &amp; Fur Co., Lincoln, Nebr. The United States produces only 2 lb. of raw wool in grease for each man, woman, and child in this country, and we consume 5 lb. of raw wool in grease to every man, woman, and child. In all sections of the world where the temperature at certain seasons drops to freezing, or below, wool will always continue to remain the majority of man's wardrobe, or each article of heavy clothing, bedding, etc., will continue to be made for the greater part, of wool. Suits and overcoats, hosiery, underwear for men, women, and children, are made of wool. As population increases demands for wool increases. Outside ■ of furs, — wool is the warmest clothing known, and, as the population of the world increases our vast areas of grazing lands will decrease as they are settled more and more for agriculture. We must then look to the smaller farms for our wool production. Wool prices today have almost reached the peak of war prices, due to a world shortage of wool and mutton. Prices of wool today are higher than they have been for over forty years, excepting during the period following the war, from 1917 to March 1920. Many of the so - called territory wools in the states of Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Arizona, Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, and Texas have already been contracted at forty to forty-two cents, while some of the best clips of Texas and Montana have brought as high as fifty cents or more. It is estimated that fully seventy-five million pounds of territory wools have been con - tracted. This gives you an idea of the confidence the wool merchants have in the future of wools. Since last June prices in the United States have increased fully fifty per cent, and we cannot expect anything but high prices for wool in the United States for the next four years. It is true, of course, that the market will always fluctuate more or less, and this should be expected, but at the same time it will not get so low but that profits to the grower will be made. It is difficult for those not connected with the wool trade to under - stand why such an advance in price should occur in such a short time. In the latter part of July and the first part of August the mills were </seg>
            <seg id="p608">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 610 carrying very low stocks of raw wools, some of them carrying only about wenty-five per cent of normal at that time, and were stilly unwilling to uy at the then comparatively reasonable prices. We tried very hard o contract at that time, for this section of wools at around thirty-five o thirty-six cents per pound, without results. But cloth and yarn at lat time were not selling and not much encouragement was offered for any material buying in the near future. The mill interests have not &gt;een making profits and there was an exceedingly draggy market on the nished products. But foreign markets on raw wools were strong and as soon as no change in administration, together with a high protective ariff was assured, prices began to climb and we have had a rising market since. However, the market is not quite so strong the past ten ays and as clothing prices have not fully followed the advance in raw wools, we may S2e some slight declines before spring. 'Wool is in a Strong Position Today. Wool is in an extremely strong position today, the world over. The World War materially reduced the number of sheep in the world and the low prices of wool and mutton in the United States in 1920, due to free wool and general deflation elso demoralized the sheep and wool industry so that we are now producing only from 225,000,000 to 235, - 000,000 pounds of wool in the United States against 275,000,000 pounds in the years 1910 to 1914. We have made a very slight increase in pro - duction in the last two years but it only amounts to two or possibly five per cent. While we are producing but 225,000,000 to 235,000,000 pounds, we are consuming from 500 ; 000,000 to 600,000,000 pounds per year. With this condition existing we must have a high tariff on raw wools in order that the sheep and wool industry may survive and increase. Without tariff protection our American farmers cannot compete in production of wool and mutton on our high priced lands, with the vast open areas of free range in Australia and South America. There are still large vast areas in Australia, uninhabited, uuncharted, and unexplored. Wools can be shipped by water from South America to Boston or New England mills cheaper than by rail from Nebraska or Wyoming. Our present tariff on raw wool is thirty-two cents per scoured pound, which is equiva - lent to about fifteen cents in the grease on wools similar to our Nebraska quarter and three-eighths and eleven to twelve cents in the grease on wools similar to cur Wyoming half bloods. Our farmers and stockmen should have this protection. Legislation will not cure all our ills but proper tariff on raw wools will make the industry a paying one, or free trade on wools will drive our sheep men to bankruptcy. More Wool Should be Produced in the United States There is no reason why we should spend annually from one hundred to two hundred million dollars for foreign wools. This wool can and </seg>
            <seg id="p609">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD &lt; )F AGHIITLTI'RE 611 should be produced in the United States. Sheep have been the most profitable livestock for the farmers in the past fifteen years and every farm in the South Platte county of Nebraska and the eastern half of the whole state should have some sheep on them. Every one hundred sixty acre farm can care for fifty to a hundred fifty ewes with very little added expense, and will bring the owner a handsome profit from the sale of wool and lambs. The small flock will usually do better, pro - duce a larger percentage of lambs and more pounds of wool than large flocks will produce. There is no better way to keep the boys on the farm than by giving them ten or fifteen ewes of their own to work with. The sheep and wool industry in Nebraska, if properly studied and properly managed may become the most profitable part of the Nebraska farmer's income. Sheep will pay better than either cattle or hogs and have paid better for more than ten years. The sheep men in Nebraska are making money both from the farm flocks and from the feeding proposition. I read a statement in one of the leading stock papers just a few weeks ago to this effect — "that the sheep and lambs were the only livestock paying their own board bills." Eighteen-cent lambs and forty to fifty-cent wools are a realization of a prediction that I made before this same group two years ago. I have faith in the future sheep and wool industry of Nebraska. I have been associated with it now for more than twenty-one years and have studied it from every angle. You show me farmers with good flocks of sheep on their farms and I will show you the most progressive class of farmers we have. The farmer with sheep the last few years has paid his bills and has not bellyached about high prices either. Sheep Produce Two Crops a Year Sheep produce two crops a year, one of wool and one of lambs, bringing in an income both in the spring and in the fall. They will keep the farm clear of obnoxious weeds, fertilize the farm and make it produce bigger and better crops. With the best alfalfa and corn land in the world, Nebraska farmers are especial] &gt; well fitted to the sheep and wool industry. The trouble with many Nebraska farmers is the fact that they do not know how to handle sheep. It is easier to handle sheep than any other livestock, and if you don't know how to handle them you can learn if you want to. It pays every man to know his own business, and it also pays, at times, to attend to it. Nebraska has less than 300,000 breeding ewes, while a little state like Ohio, with a much smaller area, has a little less than three million breeding ewes. There is a vast opportunity for the Nebraska farmer and stockman. Protect Wool Against The Elements. Nebraska wools do not bring in the market as much per pound as wools from many other states, due somewhat to climatic conditions. We </seg>
            <seg id="p610">612 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE have considerable dust at times in Nebraska and extremely hot weather usually during July and August. The dust often stains and discolors the wool and if the sheep do not have proper shelter during the ex - treme hot weather the hot sun will make a part of the fleece on the back frowsy. But the big reason why Nebraska wools do not bring as much as wools from some other states is the fact that Nebraska farmers and stockmen are unwilling to study the best methods of breeding — the best methods of feeding and the growth and care of wool. Australia pro - duces an average 12-pound fleece of wool showing a high scoured yield, while we produce an average 8-pound fleece with a low scoured yield. Certain breeds of sheep do better in certain localities, but you cannot grow good dense or long staple wool on a poorly bred or a poorly fed animal. Cross breeding will stimulate the growth of the animal and will also stimulate the growth of wool. To get a uniform and well - grown wool you must feed regularly and abundantly. Plenty of good clean water is always necessary — yards should be kept clean. Ha&gt; should be fed in such a way as to not fill the fleece full of chaff and other seeds and at shearing time bear in mind that your wool is bring - ing you more per pound than butter or any other product from the farm, and is worth taking care of. It should be kept clean and free from hay and other debris. It is best to procure a professional shearer and with even a small flock it will pay you to prepare in advance a clean place in which to shear. Sheep should be sheared on a clean board or cement floor, even if you have to build a temporary one. This floor should es - pecially be kept clean of any hay and dirt, so that your fleece comes off clean. Then each fleece should be tied properly and securely with regu - lar fleece twine of either jute or paper made for that purpose. Then put the fleeces immediately into clean burlap bags. Do not leave the fleeces exposed to dust, hay or other foreign matter. In buying wool over the country I have found many clips just thrown on the ground or in open sheds or corn cribs where chickens, pigeons, sparrow, and even calves and pigs run over it, left for the wind to blow dust and pieces of straw or hay into it. We find many wools in Nebraska still being tied with sisal twine which is very injurious to the fleece as the strands of sisal become entangled in the fleece and cannot be removed in scouring or combing. Burrs, of course, are very bad for the fleeces of wool and will often reduce its value five to fifteen cents per pound. There are many different grades of wool, from the finest Delain or Rambouilett down to the coarse or carpet wools, but the principle grades are fine, fine medium, half blood, three-eighths, quarter and low and coarse. The Detains produce the finest wool and is worth the most per scoured pound. And it has been in big demand recently, during the past year. The medium or quarter and three-eighths grades have been in very big demand recently due to the immediate scarcity of these grades. The quarter and three-eighths are produced from the black-faced type Shropshires, Hampshires, and Oxfords. We made sixteen different </seg>
            <seg id="p611">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 613 grades of Nebraska wools during the time of Government control. The long staples are graded as staple or combing wools and always demand high prices. The short staples are graded as clothing wools. Styles Regulate Prices of the Various Grades. The styles as well as the supply has a great deal to do with the regulation of prices for the different grades, but study the breed that will do best in your locality. Usually the black-faced type wools are the best for all-around purposes in Nebraska. They produce well in both wool and mutton and are usually' more healthy and easier kept than other breeds for this section. However, any good Western ewe crossed with black-faced bucks will make a good production of mutton and wool for eastern Nebraska, and from fairly young stock with proper feeding and care a fleece of eight to twelve pounds can be produced. To produce the best results and growth of wool, feeding should be done regularly. An abrupt change in feed will often weaken or break the staple of the wool. Do not put your sheep or lambs on full feed too quickly. An animal in poor condition, if fed heavily to begin with will start the growth of the wool so vigorously that the new growth will break from the old so that the wool will not spin properly. Alfalfa meal with twenty-five per cent molasses is a very good wool grower. Sugar stimulates the growth of wool. Sheep should be dipped once a year, using almost any of the good sheep dips. This will eradicate the ticks and keep the skin and wool healthy. Sulphur dip is effective for scab, but it is very hard on the wool growth. Tobacco is a stimulant to the growth of wool. With a growing need of more wool, the world over, there is nothing discouraging in the future outlook of wool growing. Don't sell your ewe lambs — keep them on the farm. Build up your flocks by keeping the younger animals in the flock. Do better breeding by using thorough - bred mates. Get the best — $10 or $20 more for a good ram will more than pay you back in wool alone in one season. Nebraska has no min - erals, no oil, no coal or gold, but it is very rich in agricultural and graz - ing lands. The best alfalfa land in the world is found in Nebraska. We are situated in the midst of the corn belt. These two products, corn and alfalfa, make it ideal for the breeding and raising of sheep and other livestock. Do you farmers and stockmen realize your opportunity ? Let's realize how wonderfully fortunate we are and start this New Year right with a vision of a better and growing future, filled with rightful optimism and work toward the end that we may make Nebraska farms pay brgger and better dividends and at the same time make Ne - braska one of the largest states in the production of better wool and mutton. (At the conclusion of his address Mr. Cadwallader brought in some very interesting specimens of wools of all grades and types, not only from the United States, but foreign wools as well.

"I did not come up here to talk. I came up here to learn something from you. It seems to me that a few sheep on the farms are about the only salvation for the farmers at the present time. Much has been said about producing sheep, but not much has been said about marketing them. I think here is where you are falling down. People do not study market conditions as they should. Last week I spent three hours at the market in Kansas City. There was one ship- Pt from New Mexico of four hundred twenty-five lambs. They had i taken off the range and put on alfalfa pasture for fattening until ;y days ago. They brought $16.50 per hundred. They weighed ty-two pounds and were not very fat. Another lot tnat were very weighing eighty-three pounds brought $17.25. A third lot weighing one hundred pounds, very fat only brought $15.50. People should study market conditions ,and market demands more closely, and the same thing is true with every class of livestock produced. If people are to be more successful then they have to study market conditions. Visit commercial firms and find out their demands and their prices. I know a man who always goes along with every shipment of cattle he sends to Kansas City. He says that he gets no better prices for going along. His sole object is to get an opportunity to study market demands and conditions at first hand, so as to know better how and when to market his cattle. Study the livestock papers, the agricultural press, and the markets themselves whenever you can." HORSE DEMONSTRATION. Jay Hepperly, Norfolk.

THE HORSE— A FRIEND THAT PULLS FOR YOU Thos. Holbert, Greeley, Iowa. About six yeas ago some very able men prophesied that by 1925 the horse would not only be supplanted in the cities but, by that time, half the twenty odd million horses on the farms would be replaced by motor power. Well, here we are in 1925 using as many horses on our farms as we were using six years ago and in the past few years many a truck has been replaced with horses in the cities. The economy of using horses en all short hauls in the cities is now well established. Some tractor salesmen still contend that a farmer can save money by doing his farming with a gas engine. Some farmers evidently still believe this is true. Some have tractorized their farms and entirely done away with horses. Many farmers use or have been using a tractor for certain farm work and have continued to use horses for part or most of their farming operations. Many of you here have tractors that you are using to farm with. Some of you may be considering the purchase of one. The question at issue is, will the tractor save you money or make you more money than you could make by using horses exclusively. Many of you have sufficient belt work to justify the ownership of a tractor. Is it profitable for such a man to leave his horses on pasture and do his breaking with a tractor outfit ? FARMING WITH TRACTORS Last fall I drove into a farm near McGregor, Iowa. The father was dead. I found the two boys breaking sod with a large tractor. A new Fordson tractor was standing in the corner of the field. They had just bought the small tractor as the large one cost too much to operate. But the small one would not pull the plows and they were again using the large one. I counted the horses pasturing on the meadow they were plowing. There were horses enough to handle two gang plows. The two boys with their two horse outfits would likely have had the plowing done as soon or sooner than they did with the tractor. The boys were not enthusiastic about horses but the mother said she would like to have the boys interest themselves in horses again as the tractors were losing them money. It looked to me like an investment of two or three thous - and dollars that was unnecessary. </seg>
            <seg id="p614">616 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I was selling a stallion to a company near home last fall and stopped at a man's home and asked the woman where her husband was. She said he was plowing with a tractor in a field north of the house. I had not seen the man nor the tractor, but hazarded the remark, "He's fixing it isn't he?" The wife said "Yes, that's him". KThe Department of Agriculture at Washington and several of our te universities have made exhaustive surveys on farms and we have instance where tractor farming has been proven more profitable than use of horse power. The North Dakota Experiment Station made a survey of 125 farms in that state about three years ago when all their farmers were operat - ing at a loss. They found that the average cost of plowing with trac - tors was a little more than double the cost of doing the same work with horses. They found also that the average loss to the tractor farmer for field work was $688.00 more than to the farmer who used horses ex - dusively. t About this same time the Illinois State Agricultural College made ■etty thorough survey on farms in Illinois and found that the farmer farmed with horses were losing on an average of $500.00 less than tractor farmers. In 1919, when farming was a pretty profitable sort of occupation, the University of Indiana made a survey of profits on 74 farms and found that the net incomes of the farmers who used horse motive power ex - clusively averaged $900 greater than that of farmers who used tractors. tThe United States Department of Agriculture has made fairly ex - tive investigations on large farms and without exception has found horse motive power is decidedly the most economical. Facts About Horse Power The Horse Association of America has published the following statements and information gathered from some of the largest farms in the United States and Canada. (A few years ago I visited the farms belonging to the Noble Foun - on Ltd. in Alberta. They have 30,000 acres of land, all perfectly I, and that can be divided into any size fields desired. I think that i a farm would be a tractor man's dream of the ideal place to •ate and demonstrate his goods. C. S. Noble, the manager of these is makes this statement, "As a result of long and costly experience l steam and gas tractors, the Noble Foundation has abandoned all tors for field work, reserving them for belt power only. Farmers, or little, cannot afford to use tractors for anything but belt work." In Oklahoma, Z. T. Miller of Miller Bros., owners of the 101 Ranch, </seg>
            <seg id="p615">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 617 the largest diversified farm and ranch in the United States, says, "We have kept careful costs of keeping tractors and mules and it costs us, figuring in extra cost of labor and repairs, about $3.00 for the tractor to $1.00 for the mules. We believe that any farmer who intends to do all his farm work with tractors will hit the rocks, and is working only for the man who sells tractors, for as soon as he has made enough to pay for his tractor it will be necessary for him to buy another." Glenn M. Averill, President of the Cedar Rapids National Bank, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in a written statement to the Horse Association of America says, "Fewer tractors are in use in this part of Iowa than five years ago, and the majority of the farmers now use them solely for belt power. Tractors are not a profitable investment for any farmer, for they do not displace any horses, and I know whereof I speak because I own an 800 acre farm about seven miles from Cedar Rapids, live on the farm myself, and it is operated under my personal directions. While I have owned two tractors I have found them less reliable and much more ex - pensive than horses for all field work." Use Judgment in Buying Motor Trucks. Motor trucks are unwise for farm use. With any care or planning, virtually all road hauling can be done with teams when they are not needed any place else. I have two motor trucks, which were put in use with the idea that sufficient saving might be affected to justify their use. No such saving resulted. I would not buy another tractor for field work nor motor truck for farm use. I am advising all fanners who ask my counsel accordingly." I had to go to Bison, South Dakota, last Winter in December. Bison is a county seat town out where the West begins, and is some 30 miles from the railroad. They had had a fairly good crop around Bison. The farmers there had begun to diversify, but most of them were extremely hard up because of the low price of wheat and livestock. The sheriff drove me back to Lemmon, the railroad town. I asked what the many big trucks were hauling to town. He said the farmers hired them to haul their hogs to the railroad and others were delivering wheat to market. I remembered when in that country the farmers used to haul their own hogs and their own wheat to the railroad with horses, each man handling two teams. They still had the horses, feeding them at home, with which they could have delivered their own produce and most of them had little else to do until time for Spring seeding. Is it not possible that this is one of the leaks that is making for hard times in agricultural districts? Smith Bros., buy produce and sell gas and do a dray business in our little town at home. They did quite a business in trucking hogs and farm produce to town from near by farms at a very reasonable charge. I suggested that they might save money by doing their local draywork </seg>
            <seg id="p616">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 618 with horses. For the outside hauling he gave me the figures and we computed the income and cost of this service and they indicated that a ew truck would be needed before the one was paid for with the net in - ome. The dray man in the town just South of us does his draying with orses. He buys good rugged three and four year old geldings, thin and n the rough. He uses them two or three years while he feeds and grows lem well and then sells to horse buyers or back to the farmers. He says his power costs him nothing and that his horses make him a nice ttle profit each year. He says he wouldn't let anyone give him an auto ruck. A good price for good draft horses depends on the continued use of lorses for hauling in the cities. Many people think that the horse is radually being crowded out by motor trucks in these congested dis - ricts. The fact is that the horse has been more than holding his own n the large cities during the past two or three years. In that time orses have increased about 50 percent in Philadelphia with a substan - tial increase in Chicago and other cities. Horses In The City. I will quote some statements made by some of the largest city users of motive power as compiled by the Horse Association of America. b Department Stores: The Fair, Chicago, "Having studied the cost and iciency of the different types carefully, we found that on all routes t can be covered with horse drawn equipment, the service is carried out just as efficiently, with greater reliability, and at less expense." Dairy: Borden Farm Products Co., Inc., New York City, "Our rec - ords for many years show that no auto trucks can compete with horses in first, cost time, upkeep, and depreciation." Manufacturing: Colgate &amp; Co., Soaps and Perfumes., "Besides nine single wagon horses, weighing 1600 lbs. each, we have forty high class draft horses, weighing from 1900 to 2200 lbs. each. Such horses cost at least $500 each and only occasionally can they be found regardless of price, which shows that farmers and breeders are not awake to the grow - ing demand for horses of more weight and quality in the larger cities. We believe the future increased use of horses in cities depends largely on the class of animals available." President Coolidge Is Sound. Last month I heard President Coolidge's speech on the agricultural situation, the talk he gave at the banquet at Chicago given in his honor by the International Live Stock Exposition. I thought it the ablest and Est sensible talk on that subject that I had ever listened to or read, has a commission of wise men from the East and some of them from the West sitting around a table in Washington trying to determine ways </seg>
            <seg id="p617">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 619 and means of patting agriculture in as good a situation as other indus - tries and keeping it there. President Coolidge says it is a question of supply and demand. Our great agricultural problem is to devise some means of disposing of our surplus of grains and feeds in some manner that will not ruin us by breaking the price of our grain or the stock we feed it to. Most People Still Work Horses. With all the advertising and high pressure salesmanship but 3 per cent of our horses on the farms have been replaced by tractors. But this means they have displaced about 600,000 horses. The reduction of horses in the cities between 1910 and 1920 was 1,352,000 head. This displacement of horses in the cities alone wiped out a market for four million tons of hay and the equivalent of 243 million bushels of oats annually. This is more than one-fifth of our average annual oat crop. The horses that have been displaced by tractors and trucks would con - sume more grain and feed than we were shipping to Europe during the War years. Figure 2 — Real draft horses that furnish the power on th&lt;; farm of W E. Thorn, Bladt-n, Xebr. A few months ago all kinds of legislation was proposed to help us get rid of our surplus of farm products. The tractor man says to do away with your horses and handle more hogs and cattle to eat the sur - plus grain and roughage. Yes, but then what would your big supply of cattle be worth ? I say do away with the tractors you are now using for field work and put the 3 percent or 600,000 horses back to work. Put more of your land into pasture. Feed the fuel you raise to the motive power you produce on your own farm instead of buying your motive power from the manufacturers and your fuel from the Standard Oil </seg>
            <seg id="p618">620 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Empany. That way you are paying the freight both ways and buying urer produced by high priced labor and short hours and dumping your xluce to pay for this service on an already oversupplied market. Right here you have a certain and adequate market for your sur - plus grain and feed and in developing and keeping this market you can cut down the cost of your farm power. I don't mean to advise you to breed more horses than we have now. You will have to breed more for replacements though, than you have been breeding in the past five or six years. What we need is to raise better horses, horses that will give the maximum of service both in the fields and in the cities. Spend Conservatively. On account of a general shortage in the world's grain crop this ear ,the prices of most farm products have advanced materially in the »st few months. We farmers, could not make a greater mistake than o begin to fly high again the moment we begin to put a few figures on ie right side of the ledger. When we get some surplus money or credit et's not spend it for a tractor outfit without first gathering a few sta - istics from our State Agricultural Schools and the Department of Ag - culture at Washington, D. C. as to the results of their surveys in 1919 hen farm produce was high at the end of the big war. And before you ake the advice of the good salesman who tells you to sell your grain and hay and buy your motive power and its fuel or to put your surplus eed into more cattle and hogs you had better take into consideration the feet a couple of years of good crops will have on your present fairly ood prices. A few years ago while at the Chicago International I met an Illinois fanner who was using registered Percheron mares on quite an extensive farm near Kankakee. He said he figured he could do his farming cheaper with tractors than with horses and that he was going to sell all his horses and motorize his farm. I told him that if I thought that he was right that I would go home and not only sell all my horses but that I would also sell Our farms at whatever price they would bring. If I thought for one minute that any serious percentage of the horses of this county were going to be displaced our farms would be for sale to - morrow. Good Horse Prices Are Good. There never was a time in the history of the horse business when a »ig high class gelding was worth more than he is right now, but un - ortunately there is a serious shortage of that kind. A few years ago a lorse buyer could go into most any community in my State and buy wo or three carloads of strictly high class horses in a very few days, rat now it takes him days in an automobile to find a few head of good oung horses. </seg>
            <seg id="p619">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 621 Since general conditions have been improving in Europe there has developed a shortage of market horses. This is especially true in Ger - many and France. We are now corresponding with parties in Germany, France and Belgium who would be interested in importing good market horses from this country. Good draft horses are worth from $600 to ten and twelve hundred dollars per pair in our money in these continental European countries. The same horses are worth an equal amount in Philadelphia, New York or Boston and we are unable to supply the de - mand with the right kind. We have written to these men very frankly that the kind of horses they are wanting are not available in this country in any great numbers and that they would cost more than they expected to pay or could afford to pay. We also told them that useful horses with less size and quality could be purchased cheaper than they would an - ticipate. The horse business will not be generally on a boom until the or - dinary, medium sort of farm horse is worth a fair price. When farmers generally are in the market for farm horses the price of all kinds of work horses is good. That condition now exists in a great many com - munities. A year ago this winter in traveling through Iowa, Southern Minnesota and Illinois, I found many farmers in most every community who were in need of additional work horses. It was very evident that the demand surpassed the local supply. But about the time we expected to be able to sell a medium sort of horse for a fair price the horse buyers began to unload Western horses all through our country. Many of these horses came from South Dakota and we in Iowa had begun to wonder whether the supply might not be inexhaustible. Last Summer I made a trip through the Dakotas and found that there is very little, if any, surplus of horses that are broke and fit for work in that country. I found that in some sections the farmers had been so hard hit that they had sold anything that would bring a price in order to pull through until another crop could be harvested. Many horses were sacrificed in this manner that really should not have been spared. In my opinion a limited number of Westerners are going to be unloaded on us again this Winter but we have that slack about taken up and we are about to face a general shortage of useful horses all over the United States. Horses Are Getting Old. Horses on the farms in Iowa are getting old. On account of the hard times we have been using and are still using any kind of horse that can get along on three legs. It is reported that the average age of the horses on the farms in Iowa is 14 years. Old horses die faster than young ones and the colts to replace them are not in the country. The danger to the horse business now is not that horses will be too cheap. The danger is that good horses and serviceable and useful horses </seg>
            <seg id="p620">622 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE may in the next few years be too costly. When a commodity gets too high priced look out for your substitutes. Agriculture can do itself the greatest service in attaining and stabilizing its prosperity by breeding better horses and then using the horses raised on the farm for all farming operations. Every community should have at least one good draft stallion. Good stallions are not cheap and are not plentiful. There are lots of inferior ones. The best way for a community to get a really good stallion is to buy him either as a company or club or, by paying service fees in advance to help some one man purchase the kind of stallion you want to breed your mares to. Break these young well bred draft horses at two or three years old and put them to work. In Belgium they break and start working all their colts as two year olds. As you work in these young horses have your surplus five or six year old horses fat and conditioned and sell them. In this way your farm power should cost you nothing or next to nothing. No other industry that I know of can get its power that cheap. You will be using your own .grain and hay for motor fuel instead of dumping it on the market and breaking the price of what you and your neigh- Er have to sell. You will be manufacturing your own farm power on ur own land and with your own produce and labor instead of selling eap oats to pay the big motor companies for it. You will get good jney for your surplus good draft horses and will sell the oats and hay feed them in the cities where they have gone to work. Many firms in b cities are not now using the horses they would use because they can - t get enough of the kind they want. Any farmer who motorizes his farm and any banker or land owner who permits his farm to be motorized and thereby does his bit toward destroying his own markets and the value of all farm land has no right to holler and insist on radical legislation to create a market that does not exist for his surplus products. . HORSES VS. MOTOR TRUCKS IN THE LARGE CITIES Prof. D. J. Kays, Columbus, Ohio. Recently I purchased a copy of the "Motor Magazine." As I was scanning it, thumbing the pages over, I noticed a picture that made an especial appeal to me, ami the legend of that picture was very interesting to me; it was a picture of the first Automobile Show ever held in this country at Madison Square Garden, New York City. A little further along I came across an article the title of which was "The Motor Car has created the Spirit of Modem America." The writer of tha.t article was a man who did things with his tongue and did them well. The article also said something like this: "The saturation of the world with auto - mobiles will be coincident with eternity." </seg>
            <seg id="p621">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 623 Traffic Conditions in Large Cities I shall try to give you an idea of the traffic conditions as I found them in two of our large and widely differing cities recently; that is, Chicago and Boston. In Chicago all the great business of the city is crowded in the district known as the loop, it is approximately one square mile in area. Within that loop traffic is so congested that street cars move forward a half block at a time, and stop, waiting for the street to clear ahead so they can proceed. Trucks, taxis, and cars do the same; the constant rattling of horns and whistles is enough to drive one mad. One can scarcely move in that area during the congested hours of the day, and at night conditions are not much better. If it were not for one thing, I cannot imagine how anything could be done within the Loop at all. That one thing is the Tunnel railroad underground, which works night and day, handling the routine traffic of the district. Coal is hauled in and placed in the bins, where it is fed to the furnaces on automatic stokers, and in the night the tunnel cars come and haul the cinders away to a shaft where they are elevated to the surface and hauled to the lakeside where they are dumped. The ideal location for a great wholesale house in Chicago today is to have a water front on one side, good railroad connections on another, and a connection with the tunnel railway beneath the ground. Some Things That Have Happened. Let me give you a few facts about my own city. When we began to liberate some of our great supply of ten-cent gas things began to hap - pen and they have been happening ever since. Here are some of the things that happened. When I went to Columbus there were seventy-five blacksmith shops; today there are twenty-two, and not a boy in the city learning the trade. If you went down town at that time you could buy anything in the harness line that you could need. Today if you wanted a drop thong whip you couldn't get it in town. In 1909 the horse busi - ness reached its peak in Columbus. In 1908 there were ten thousand motor vehicles in the state, according to the State Registrar. In 1922 there were 1,067,000. The three counties containing the largest cities in Ohio once were the first three counties in the state so far as horse population was concerned. Today those three counties rank eleventh, fourteenth, and seventeenth in the state, all because horses have been displaced by motor trucks. The rural counties now not only lead in horse production, but also in horse population, the center of the horse industry is now only to be found in our rural districts. Livery stables are very rare, in fact, if you suggest building one, somebody will get out an in - junction to prevent you building any stable at all. On the other hand garages are increasing, both in size and numbers. I asked a man at a garage wheie I left my car one night, "How many cars can you park here in a. ni;;ht?" He said, "Six hundred cars were in here last night." </seg>
            <seg id="p622">624 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE He charged me a dollar, I suppose he charged the other five hundred and ninety-nine the same. He added that he was thinking of building on another story or two to his building so that he could handle a thousand cars a night. The Hired Man And His Car, I went out to visit my mother and my brother recently. I noticed in the driveway of the big barn an old Ford. I found it belonged to the hired man. He didn't have money enough to pay for it, nor money Eough to keep it in repair, nor enougn to run it, but he had it. I even irned that to get a hired man now you have to sign his note to get him car — you may believe it or not as your judgment permits. I heard f folks tell that in the evening the men came in in a hurry, threw up i harness from their teams, fed them in an equally great hurry, gob - id up a little supper and were off to town to spend the evening until b small hours of the morning. Gentlemen, I heartily agreed with the iter in the Motor Magazine. "The motor car has produced the spirit modern America." II shall paint you two pictures, or attempt to, to show two sides to i horse and truck situation. I have already shown you the situation Chicago. We will now journey to Boston ,and then come back to icago again. I do not want to scare anybody. I would like to know you know how many freight yards in Boston are shut. Over half of ;m are, and they are shut because the motor trucks have shut them. e trucks are driving the railroads out of business on long distance iss country hauls, hauling the raw material to the woolen mills, and &gt;se mills all have admirable facilities too. Why does this condition fail get the business for the railroads? I asked a man to whom I was king that question and he answered with the following explanation: I The railroads themselves are responsible, during the war and after - ird they have manifested a "Public-be-damned attitude" and have made Bmselves very unpopular, but this alone would not kill their business. le freight rates are so high as to be prohibitive, in comparison with ick service. Inefficient service on the part of the railroads has driven siness away from them. Many lines have only two or three day ser - x. In one case I know of seven hundred bales of wool were loaded on car in Boston, where they stood for a week ,and were finally unloaded trucks and hauled to Lawrence by truck. There are no commodity tes on trucks. The truck hauler cares not if his load be two hundred ty dollars in value or twenty -five hundred or more. There is no such ing as demurrage in trucking, you know what it is by freight. There e no embargoes when you ship by truck, and there are many by rail, lere is a great reduction in overhead expense because of daily deliveries the mills, and there are many more, and better satisfied customers due prompt delivery service, made possible only by truck. </seg>
            <seg id="p623">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 625 Truck Owners Have Their Share of Grief. There is another side to this problem. The truck owners and drivers are having their share of the grief. They have notes that are coming due on their trucks, and they have heavy bills to pay, and unless they can use their trucks constantly they are bound to lose money or go bankrupt, as many of them are doing right now. I have talked to several truckmen, and they gave me a most discouraging outlook on the business. The small owner cannot compete with the large truckline owner on his own terms and as a result is being forced into bankruptcy. In addition to just the upkeep and expense of the truck there are heavy registration fees, and no shipper will allow you to haul for him if you do not have the requisite insurance on your load at all times. Your fees will amount to nearly a thousand dollars a year per truck, and you can readily see the necessity of keeping your trucks busy at all times if they are to pay you anything at all. I do not know what the remedy for this situation is. I shall not even attempt to suggest one. It requires a bigger man than I am to solve the problem. But something must be done and something will be done. I do know, however, that we are not ready by a long ways to hang out "for sale" signs on all our horse stables in this country. I do not wish to start an argument with the gentlemen who precede me, but I do not think the horse business will ever come back, if "coming back" is used in the sense that the business will exist as it once did. I do not think it will, ever. If we qualify the statement to mean that the busi - ness will become established again, I think we can say "The horse busi - ness has come back," but it will never come back as it once was. There are very few good horses to be had at any price; I mean heavy, well-built horses of the draft type. There are a great many in - ferior horses to be had. Our motto should not be "More Horses," but it should be "Better Horses." Better horses that will run the machinery of our farms for a long time to come, and give a pride and a lift to the business that will bless many a horseman yet unborn. SHORT TALKS BY PROMINENT HORSEMEN. Mr. A. P. Coon, Lincoln, Nebr. I can tell you from observation in Wisconsin that a good horse will bring good money, but the country is overrun with cheap horses, most of them are bringing next to nothing, and are worth less. Good teams weighing no more than 2800 or 2900 are seen selling as high as $450 per span. There is so much cheap stuff that there is almost no market for </seg>

Mr. Joseph Rouselle, Seward, Nebr. tMy county is full of cheap stuff. We need better horses, the buyers t to buy good horses. If we get good horses we can get good money them. Now even where we find good horses we find that they are not being broken as well as they used to be. Mr. Andy Patterson, 'Kansas City, Mo. Last summer I was instructed to get twelve teams for heavy hauling. They must be heavy, not weighing less than 1500 pounds. We, of course wanted young horses. I drove all over the country trying to find that number of suitable teams, and believe it or not as you will, it took me nearly three months to find them. Good horses are simply not to be found, it is not a matter of price so much, the horses are not to be had. Last winter we tabulated information taken from 257 bills of pub - lic farm sales in order to find the ages of the horses being sold. Follow - ing are the number and ages of mares, geldings and mules sold at 257 dispersion sales in 25 Nebraska counties, winter of 1924. Professor W. W. Derrick, Ag. College. I have little to say except "Amen" to a lot that has already been said. I think that if we started out here in Nebraska we would travel over a good deal of territory before we would find horses that would do.

            <seg id="p625">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRKTLTL'RK 627 Professor H. J. Gramlich. There have been many inquiries as to the use of the stallion here at the College. Our horse is here for service. Since 1921 an average of about sixty mares have been handled. About the same number each year. Located as we are we can draw only from a limited territory, and thus our horse is not used as much as we should like to have him used. THE TREJSD OF HOG PRODUCTION. Professor H. C. Filley College of Agriculture. Wherever you find a Corn Belt you will very likely find a swine belt. Hogs will probably always be produced wherever there is a surplus of corn. We have produced hogs and corn in Nebraska for many years, and the chances are that we are going to continue to produce them. From 35 per cent to 40 per cent of the corn crop ordinarily goes into pork pro - duction. There are, however, a good many factors that enter into corn prices and hog prices. We find that the prices of both corn and hogs run in cycles, and that the length of these cycles vary with circum - stances. During the Civil War period the price of all commodities rose very high. The price of farm products rose more rapidly and rose higher than the price of manufactured goods. The price of hogs was higher than the price of many other farm commodities. At the end of the war the price of all products dropped, and the price of farm prices dropped faster and farther than did the price of other products. In the middle nineties following the panic of 1893 we find that all prices were low and that the prices of farm products were very low. Prices rose gradually following this depression until the World War when they rose very rapidly. Hog prices vary with different seasons of the year. They are or - dinarily low in December, January, and February and are highest along in July, August, and early September. In November, December, and January we have big hog runs on the markets each year. You will note a secondary run each year along in May and June when the fall pigs come to market. You have all noticed that the price is generally low during these seasonal runs. There are a few periods of two or three years duration when hog prices have been fairly uniform throughout these years. Without exceptions these years have been prosperous years. Prosperity always creates a greater demand for pork and increases the price of pork. Whenever the price of hogs is high compared with the price of </seg>
            <seg id="p626">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 628 corn, hog feeders make a profit. Hogs were high in price compared with corn in 1906, and as a result, more pigs than usual were produced in 1907. The little panic in the autumn of 1907 held the hogs off the mar - ket, so that a very large number of these spring pigs came to market in January, 1908. The price of hogs fell. The 1907 crop of corn was short, and the price of corn rose. Hog feeding was not profitable. As a result the pig crop was small in 1909, and consequently hogs were high in price in 1910. We had a good corn crop in 1910, and as might be ex - pected corn was cheap compared with hogs. There were not enough hogs to eat the corn. From these facts we notice that an increase in hog prices results in increased production, and it in turn is followed by a decrease in price. The corn prices fluctuate about as do hog prices only they fluctuate in the opposite direction. Corn prices are high when there is a large de - mand for corn to feed hogs and low when there are few hogs to be fed. You notice there was a very large number of hogs sent to market in 1916, but because of the war, conditions were abnormal. The high peak of war time high prices was reached in January, 1919. We find a peak of another cycle in January and February, 1923. Now, note the peaks of hog prices we have had in 1908, 1912, 1916, 1919, and 1923. You will also notice that when prices of hogs are relatively high, the price of corn is relatively low because at the time that hogs are high iii price, due to shortage in production, there is not so much demand for corn. There have been unprecedented runs of hogs on the market during the fall of 1924. Millions of pigs of the 1924 crop have been sold short weight because of the high price of corn. They have produced less pork than normal in proportion to the numbers marketed. We may be very sure that these hogs which have already been marketed will not be on the market in March and April, and as a result we can anticipate that prices will be considerably higher then than now. The number of sows bred for spring farrowing in 1924 was less than the number in 1923. The number bred for fall farrowing in 1924 was also less than in 1923. The number reported bred for farrowing in the spring of 1925 is considerable less than the number for 1924. It is safe to predict that history will repeat itself. High prices will follow this slump in hog production. Because of the high prices, hog production will be increased. Then following high prices, we may expect that the increased production may result in lower prices. Of course, we can only guess at what the future will give us, but it seems safe to say that if we have a good corn crop in 1925 the man who produces hogs will come out on the right side of the ledger despite the high prices of corn </seg>
            <seg id="p627">REPORT OF XEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 629 Barley makes a fair crop in Nebraska. It is a crop that can be produced relatively cheap. We have found that it makes a good feed to use instead of corn. It can be produced earlier in the season and by feeding it some men can place high priced corn on the market. I would certainly hate to see any man sacrifice his gilts at the present time be - cause he fears that corn will be high in price until next September or October. QUESTION: Do you think that a little 90-day corn, maturing early, might serve the same function and purpose as your barley? PROF. FILLEY: I think it might. I think we make a mistake in trying to raise exclusively a big type of corn that requires the entire season for growth. QUESTION: It appears that we are going to have a thin wheat crop. Could you sow barley in wheat and feed the mixture? ANSWER (from audience) : I did once, and I got fifty bushels per acre. That was an exceptional year, and there was not enough wheat in it to notice. Perhaps that will be your condition too. QUESTION: What should hogs bring now in order to represent a profit? PROF. FILLEY: Under normal conditions, I should say about ten or eleven cents. PASTURE VALUES. W. J. Loeffel, Ag. College. For a long time men have appreciated the fact that pasture was of great value in cheapening hog costs. There have been a number of questions, as to how valuable pasture actually is, as to what grains and feeds and how much of them should we feed. If a good business man, a manufacturer for instance, loses money he starts at once to hunt for the cause. He tries to find out just where the loss occurs, and he tries to correct the trouble. He may do it by raising the price of his product. In the case of the hog producer that is one thing he cannot very well do to any .great extent. Another method we can follow, however, is entirely within our means. We can find out where the leaks and losses are and try to stop them. For the past two years ,we have carried out some pasture experi - ments at the college here, and last year they were quite extensive. We fed eight lots of purebred March pigs. These pigs were divided so that the pigs in the different lots were uniform in weight, condition, and </seg>
            <seg id="p628">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 630 quality. There were ten pigs in each lot. They were fed one hundred and ten days beginning June 12, 1924, and ending September 30, 1924. During the last part of these experiments the pasture in all lots was very scanty and dry. Frosts on September 27 and 28 killed the Sudan grass, and those pens were fed dry feed from that time on. IThe first five lots were on full grain feed, that is all they would eat, fattening ration. Lots 6-7-8 were on a growing ration and were not i so much grain. Lot 1 was fed in a dry lot, and fed all the corn and tankage they would eat, permitting the pigs to balance their own rations. Lot 2 was fed the same as Lot 1 except that they were fed on alfalfa pasture. Lot 3 was fed corn alone on alfalfa pasture, no tankage was given 4 was fed on corn and tankage like Lots 1 and 2 but were ed on Sudan grass pasture. Lot 5 was fed a light feed, corn alone on a Sudan grass pasture. Lot 6 had a light feed of shelled corn on alfalfa pasture. Two and one-half pounds of corn was fed daily for every one hundred pounds live weight. This group received a trifle more than half the feed per head as Lot 3. The pigs were weighed every two weeks and the amount of feed regulated accordingly. tLot 7 was fed on the same basis as Lot 6 except nine parts of corn I one part of tankage by weight were fed. The pigs consumed less n one-half as much feed as the pigs in Lot 2, which had free access the same feeds. Lot 8 received a light ration (2*% of their live weight) of nine parts corn and one part tankage, the same ration as Lot 7, except that Sudan grass pasture was used instead of alfalfa. !In computing costs in this experiment, shelled corn is valued at lety-eight cents per bushel, a little high perhaps, but a fair average the entire season, tankage has been figured at $65.00 per ton ,and sture at one-half cent daily per head in Lots 1 and 5, and at one cent ily per head in Lots 6 to 8. Our Sudan grass was not ready at the ginning of the experiment. We had some excellent pasture of oats d barley and all Sudan grass lots were kept on this pasture until June when the Sudan grass pasture became ready. Lots 1 and 2 were fed well balanced rations. Lot 2 on alfalfa pas - ture ate about one pound more corn daily and gained a fourth of a pound more per day than the group fed in dry lot. The pigs on alfalfa pasture ate only two-thirds as much tankage as the dry lot pigs. Since eighteen </seg>
            <seg id="p629">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 631 pounds less corn and twenty-six pounds less tankage were required to produce one hundred pounds gain, the pasture-fed group produced pork at $7.26 per hundred as compared with $7.70 in dry lot pigs. Because of the larger gain and the cheaper cost of gain on pasture, a larger profit was returned by the pasture fed pigs. Pigs Self Fed Tankage Ate Small Amount. Although the pigs in Lot 2 had the opportunity of eating as much tankage as they desired, they ate only four-tenths of a pound a day. This small amount of tankage increased their appetites so that each pig ate a pound and a half more corn daily. The pigs receiving tankage gained almost twice as rapidly as the pigs receiving no tankage. To produce one hundred pounds of pork in Lot 3 it took four hundred seventy-one pounds of corn while in Lot 2 three hundred sixty-one pounds of corn and twenty-nine pounds of tankage accomplished the same results. Twenty-nine pounds of tankage, then, saved or replaced one hundred pounds of corn, or one pound of tankage saved practically four pounds of corn. With corn at ninety-eight cents a bushel, or one and three-fourths cents a pound, one pound of tankage would be worth seven cents or one hundred forty dollars a ton. Where tankage was fed, one hundred pounds of pork was produced for $7.62. This was $1.32 a hundred cheaper than where no tankage was fed. The tankage-fed pigs made. $2.58 more profit per head than the pigs not receiving tankage. Not only did the pigs in Lot 2 make larger and more economical gains, but they were more uniform and thrifty at the close of the trial than the pigs not fed tankage. Sudan Grass as Hog Pasture. Sudan grass is new to us as a forage crop. It is an annual, which seems to be its biggest drawback as compared with alfalfa. It is strictly a hot weather plant and should not be planted until warm weather is assured. It will not do any good if it is planted too early. Once started, it stands the drouths and heat of the summer and seems to thrive under such conditions. It is, however, easily killed by the first light frosts. This is a big disadvantage, but while it is growing it excels alfalfa in its carrying capacity as a pasture. Comparing those lots in which the only difference was the pastures of alfalfa and Sudan grass, we find a little advantage in favor of Sudan grass. On the whole no larger gains were made on Sudan grass, but those gains were a little more economically made, with the result that the cost per hundred pounds again was slight - ly lower. The Sudan grass was in better shape during the latter part of the feeding period, due to the dry weather. It remains to be found out whether Sudan grass will be found consistently superior. We found that on Sudan grass as on alfalfa pasture, the feeding of tankage to pigs receiving a full feed of corn appears to be a good thing. </seg>
            <seg id="p630">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 632 They consume more corn, and larger and more economical gains are made at a considerable saving in cost. In this comparison as in alfalfa lots one pound of tankage saved about four pounds of corn. Should Pigs Be Full Fed. We are asked if pigs should be full fed from birth or should they be grown out on pasture with a light grain ration to be full-fed in the fall when cheaper new corn is available? We found that the full-fed pigs gained almost twice as rapidly as the pigs on a limited ration. The latter, however, made more economical gains, requiring three hundred forty-five pounds of feed, while the full-fed groups required four hundred eighteen pounds. Since the light-fed pigs ate seventy-three pounds less feed, the cost of one hundred pounds gain is $7.70 as compared with $7.90 where similar pigs received a full feed of the same ration. In this comparison full-fed pigs were charged one-half cent per head for daily pasture. Since the pigs receiving a light grain ration required more pasture, they were charged one cent per head daily, or double the amount charged the full fed pigs. The higher pasture charge for the light-fed pigs largely offsets the advantage of the light ration. Full feeding requires large quantities of corn during the summer when corn is normally high in price. Full-fed pigs do not use pasture io efficiently as light-fed pigs. This, together with the high grain re - quirement, makes the cost of production slightly higher on the full-fed lots than on the light-fed lots. The man who full-feeds is generally able to place his hogs on the market early in the fall when prices are comparatively higher than later when larger receipts and lower prices prevail. Full feeding shortens the route to market. It reduces risk and labor. The various lots reached the market weight of two hundred twenty - five pounds at the times given below: Lot 1 Lot 2 Lot 3 Lot 4 Lot 5 Lot 6 Lot 7 Lot 8 November 3 October 20 January 9 October 10 January 10 January 6 November 17 December 3 During the fattening period following the experiment the pigs that had alfalfa slowed up better than those that had Sudan grass. During this period the pigs on light rations made more economical gains as well as in the summer. There is one other rather interesting thing about the experiment. About the middle of October the pigs all had a touch of the flu for about </seg>
            <seg id="p631">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGUICULTl'UK 633 ten days. Those pigs that had tankage during the summer seemed to me to have a less severe attack, and to recover more quickly than those that did not. I do not want to make that statement too emphatic, be - cause I have no data to back me up, but it seemed to me that the pigs on a balanced ration recovered more quickly than those on a straight corn ration. You might be interested in knowing the returns paid for the pas - ture used in the above experiments. Lots two to five paid an actual charge of $13.41 per acre, while lots six, seven, and eight paid nearly $20.00 for. the summer season. Pasture Produces Economical Gain, We know that pasture cheapens the cost of gains. Pasture increases the fertility of the soil because of the manure scattered over it at the right time, and in a more efficient way than we can do it by hand, and pasturing very materially reduces the cost and labor of feeding. It fur - nishes exercise to the hogs. Whenever you want to obtain a revenue from any untillable land try a pasture crop on it. Pasture crops may be divided into two classes: annuals like rape, Sudan grass, etc., and perennials such as alfalfa, red and sweet clovers. Rye seeded in the fall is an excellent crop for pasture in the fall, during the winter, and very early in the spring. Sudan has its place as a pas - ture crop, but is essentially a warm weather crop. There is no use seed - ing it before warm weather is here for keeps. Rape is another one of our annual pasture crops and is a good one, however, for most of our state it is overrated for our conditions here. It is of little value during the hot dry season. It comes early and stays late. Among the biennials and perennials we have sweet clover and alfalfa. Sweet clover I do not believe is nearly as satisfactory as alfalfa. We hope to carry out a similar series of experiments using sweet clover. Our experiments show that the man who gets to the early market is going to have a high cost. He will get a higher price for his pigs Ifut his costs will be greater. QUESTION: Would you feed any mineral feeds? MR. LOEFFEL: No, I would not, we have not found that they helped a"ny where pigs were on alfalfa or where they had tankage. QUESTION: Did you feed any salt? MR. LOEFFEL: No, we did not. QUESTION: Have you made any experiments with red clover? MR. LOEFFEL: We have not at our station. I understand that other stations in other states have and have found it very satisfactory- </seg>

LOEFFEL: None QUESTION: What about the different grades of tankage? MR. LOEFFEL: Most brands are about the same composition, and have the same protein value. There is some difference in palatability, but whether this effects its feeding value I am not prepared to say. I would get nothing less than 60% protein. QUESTION: Have you ever fed any mineral feeds? MR. LOEFFEL: Yes, we have. QUESTION: What results did you have? MR. LOEFFEL: Our results have been very disappointing from the standpoint of mineral feeding. We have found that the pigs that are fed mineral make no better gains than those that do not receive them. In fact, it has seemed in some cases to show a negative result, that is, those having mineral did not seem to gain as rapidly as those without it. I really believe that with tankage and alfalfa the mineral needs of the pigs are taken care of. QUESTION: Would you discard salt? MR. LOEFFEL: I answer that by saying that we have. QUESTION: How much milk would you think would be required to equal tankage? MR. LOEFFEL: About on the ratio of ten to one is the proportion of tankage we use with corn. In the case of milk you would have to con - sider the high water content and use considerably more. Three to four pounds of milk, or about a half gallon to every pound of grain. Theor - etically that is a balanced ration, but in actual practice it cannot be done because of the inadequate milk supply on the average hog farm. QUESTION: What is the feeding value of oats? tMR. LOEFFEL: Oats in themselves are just about a balanced ration. ;y are valuable for brood sows, but for feeding and fattening pigs y are too bulky. QUESTION: What about adding a little oats to a corn ration when the corn is chaffy as it is in many places this year? MR. LOEFFEL: I do not believe you would help matters any for feeding pigs. QUESTION: What would you add to chaffy corn? </seg>
            <seg id="p633">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRHTLTURK 635 MR. LOEFFEL: If you can get shorts or hominy meal for feeding cheaply enough they would be all right. The price of these feeds will de - termine whether they can be fed from a dollars and cents point of view. QUESTION: Is barley better than oats? MR. LOEFFEL: I think so. QUESTION: How would you feed barley? Whole? MR. LOEFFEL: It should be ground coarsely if fed dry. If fed with slop it should of course be ground fine. Our experience with slop feeding is that it does not pay for the additional labor involved. The hogs will eat a little more, and make somewhat better gains but in my estimation not enough better gains to compensate for the extra labor involved. THE PREVENTION OF PIG TROUBLES. Dr. A. H. Francis, U. S. Bureau of Animal Industry. It has been emphasized that in Nebraska it is necessary to raise hogs. Instead of quitting the industry we should turn our heads to more economical production. Our greatest loss is the loss of our pigs from birth to one or two months of age. It is generally conceded that 50% of pigs farrowed are not raised to maturity. The farmers in Ne - braska have lost from S to h of their hogs, some even forced out of the business because of the loss of their pigs. Where this loss does not ex - ceed J in many places it is regarded as a necessary part of the business. They do not realize in many cases what the pig costs to farrow. It costs just as much to feed a sow over the period if she loses the pigs as if she should raise those pigs. Figure 3 — Hog Camps prevent diseases and produce pork economically </seg>
            <seg id="p634">636 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE How Many Pigs Do You Lose? This attitude of indifference was brought out in a recent sm-vey. Twenty-one farms were visited and only one case was met where the farmer was able to give the number of pigs farrowed, and only in one case did he know how much it cost to farrow one pig. According 1 to that survey the average sow atcually farrows nine pigs. That is possibly a little bit high, but anyway we know the sow does her part. Let us see, if possible, what is the cause of this enormous loss. We know if the sow is properly fed that the embryo is properly cared for. At the time of birth the even temperature is changed for ne very different and the food supply is changed; but the most import - ant change the pig must necessarily face at that time is his environment. t changes the protection of the maternal uterus for an atmosphere reeking with bacteria and other pathological organisms. If the place s clean the pigs may live, but if not most of the pigs will die. If you onsider the places that our pigs are compelled to live in all their lives, the wonder is not that we lose so many, but that we raise any at all. Change Hog Lots. We should not try to raise pigs on the same ground every year. In spite of the fact that a great deal of experimenting is done every year we have learned only a small part of what there is to know. We have learned a great deal about hog diseases, but a great deal more has been learned about pig diseases. Many continue to pin faith to so-called hog remedies. It has been found that most of them are useless. There is no combination of drugs that will prevent most of our pig diseases. As was brought out this morning, it is not necessary to feed remedies of any kind. You can feed bone meal and tankage and accomplish more than by feeding "remedies." It is possible and proper that you should feed something other than is grown on your farms of Nebraska, but that should be tankage or bone meal. </seg>

Sanitation is the only thing we know of that will prevent pig dis - eases, but all clean practices are not sanitation. Some men think they are practicing sanitation, when they are allowing many opportunities for disease infection. A system of sanitation has been worked out by the United States Animal Industry workers to eliminate round worms in pigs. It is called the McClean system. It has since been practiced extensively, particularly in Nebraska. In order to understand the system by which it is carried out it is necessary to know the life cycle of the round worm. This worm is found normally in the small intestines. It attains a length of from six to twelve inches, and is about the size of a lead pencil. One worm can lay as many as eighty million eggs, which must, of course pass out with the manure. It takes, ordinarily a couple weeks for the first period of incubation to pass. It is then again taken into the animal, through feeding, and again reaches the small intestines, where it does its first real damage. It goes through the muscular mem - branes that line the intestines and gets into the blood stream, where one can readily see that it is going to cause serious trouble. It gets into the blood stream and finally reaches the lungs. While it is in the lungs it is still in the blcod stream. It goes into the lung tissues and begins to wander through the lungs. It breaks down the lung tissue and weakens them, causing thumps, or pneumonia. Those that do not die as a result are stunted and weakened. The worm finally works up the windpipe, and is swallowed, and reaches its growth in the small intestines. </seg>
            <seg id="p636">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 638 Fight The Round Worm. In combatting this worm, we must have a clean pen, not one that oks clean, but it must be clean. We must thoroughly clean a hog ouse before we can disinfect it. We can use scalding hot water and e for disinfecting. The hot water is to soft-boil the eggs of the worm, nd the lye for removing deposits on the house. A solution of creosol ill kill the egg but the egg must come in contact with it over a period f forty-eight hours. It is best to wash your hog house before you try o disinfect it. The next step is to clean the sow. Brush all the dirt and ust off her back and wash off her udder. After farrowing, the next step s to take the sows and pigs to a clean pasture, one that has not been sed for hogs before, and leave them there until the pigs are about four months of age. At that time they have attained an age which the round orm is not capable of passing through its life cycle in sufficient num - »ers to do much harm. Some of you think you haven't much trouble with round worms because you do not find them in your hogs when you butcher. You do not find them in older hogs very much, but remember that every round worm you find in the intestines of a pig must have gone through its lungs. You will hear occasionally a remark that alfalfa is a source of round worms. It is not the alfalfa, but we know that under favorable conditions the round worm egg will live five years. Many of your alfalfa pastures are twenty years old and older even than that. The Youngest Pig Is In Most Danger. The younger the pig is the harder it is for him to resist the life cycle of the round worm, and he is more susceptible to its effects. kThe next step is to plow all our lots occasionally. The plow will destroy the round worm eggs but it will create an unfavorable place them to live in. A treatment for these worms is in order, because they do a great leal of harm. We must keep in mind, however, always that it only takes ten days for the worm to pass through its life cycle and that it akes the worm but two months to produce its full crop of eggs, so that within ten days after you worm your pigs out you may find a great many of them in the small intestines of the pigs. We should keep in mind vhen we worm out pigs that we should put them some place where the worms can be destroyed, and not where the pigs can drop them all over the place. This system of rotation and sanitation was primarily tried out for round worms in pigs, but it has proven that it will stop many of our other pig troubles, many of which are different diseases caused by germs; germs which are always found in permanent and dirty hog houses. These </seg>
            <seg id="p637">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURK 639 germs cannot enter unbroken tissues. Many times in clipping teeth we injure the mouth so that these germs gain entrance to the tissues. We find in most cases there is no necessity to clip the teeth at all, and where necessary, it is just as satisfactory and much safer to file them off instead of clipping them. The internal diseases, with the exception of some cases of scours in small pigs, are generally found as a result of dirty, filthy hog lots, and by getting away from our dirty hog lots until the pig is four months old, we find that he gets to the age where he is less susceptible. We find one form of scours that is caused by improper feeding of the sow. One thing that we should always keep in mind, is the fact that our most expensive hog disease is hog cholera. While we may do a great deal by sanitary measures, it is best that your pigs should be vaccinated every year. We know that will prevent cholera. It is best to do this at a regular season. This may be done just before weaning time; pos - sibly it can be done to a better advantage at this time than at any other, and it will carry your pigs through to marketing age. Mange Is a Costly Thing. Another disease that causes us trouble is mange. Sanitation is not going to eradicate this disease. It is found to be more noticeable in the feed lot than any place else. The trouble is caused by a very minute parasite, measuring not over 1-50 to 1-60 of an inch. This parasite works between the layers of the skin. It starts around the eyes and works back to the shoulders and all over the hog. The loss from this disease is not from death, but from the fact that the hog will not fatten or do very well. In some instances death may result. This parasite will live several years on one animal, and a new crop can come on in fifteen days. In the summer time we think we are free from this disease be - cause we do not notice it, but when we later put our hogs on feeding ration and in pens and houses close together this parasite spreads rapid - ly in the herd. One packer reported that 409r of the hogs showed evi - dences of being infested with this parasite. Naturally the choice cuts are more or less lowered in value, and the packers are going to discrim - inate against mangy hogs. This parasite can be readily cleaned up by dipping your hogs in oil. A mixture of coal oil and common fuel oil will answer quite as well as, or perhaps better than anything else. There is another parasite that causes scab, and if you are not able to clean up your herd, you had better take deep scrapings and send in to the station here, and if infected with this parasite the easiest way to get rid of it would be to get rid of your hogs. But in any event, don't overlook the necessity of cleaning your hog lots, even though you have no evidence of infection among the animals. Other dips than oil are on the market, and some of them are very </seg>

HOW I RAISED AN AVERAGE OF EIGHT PIGS PER SOW. Mr. Oscar Schlictman, Edgar, Nebr. So far as raising eight pigs per litter is concerned, I do not know whether it was all good management, or whether it was largely luck. I did manage to succeed in doing that this year, however. I started with thirty-four Duroc sows, and a good type boar. All these hogs were in - dividually ear-marked. They were fed plenty of corn, ground oats, and alfalfa hay. I fed this feed eighty reds from the sleeping quarters to induce exercise. I got my share of the exercise all right, but there were thirty-four of them, so my efforts were not wasted perhaps. Figure E — This little house is 7 feet •wide, 6 feet lcnp, and has 6 foot roof boards. It is usually built without a floor and with a high, door in. each end. It is warm in winter, cool in summer, and is liked /by brood sows as well by hog men. I will have to tell you about my equipment. I have fourteen houses with individual pens five by eighty rods. The houses are of the A type 10x8 feet with a 6 foot 4 inch roof, v front so that the entire front can be o better because I can put two sows to a too. I put two sows together using a with a door and a window in the opened if desired. I like this size a house. The light is a good thing a two-foot partition between them. sows were kept in these pens until June 1, when they were oved to be fed for the market. The pigs were placed in a new lot. </seg>
            <seg id="p639">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 641 I sowed about three acres of oats and a little Sudan grass. It is the best pasture for early use. After July Sudan is perhaps best, while for extremely early, and very late pasture alfalfa is best. The hogs net me $9.50, and were shipped through to California. The only mistake I made was that I sold them about eleven days too soon, eleven days later I would have gotten about one thousand dollars more for the bunch than I did. Out of the entire bunch of pigs with which I started I raised ex - actly two hundred seventy-two, or an average of exactly eight pigs per sow. Figure 6 — Oscar Schlietman raised these two hundred seventy-two pigs from thirty-four sows. Yes, of ccurse he vsed little housts on clean ground. I realize that sanitation is a very important matter. I used to have a great deal of trouble. I move my pens and houses back about ten rods every two years. About five days after the sows have farrowed I re - move the partitions, the pigs by this time have learned their mothers. I may be wrong, but I disagree with the man who spoke before me about cutting the pigs' tushes. I am for cutting their tushes. It seems to me that they can do more damage than I can do by cutting them off. This year I am going to grind my hay with the oats and corn. 80 pounds of hay to 20 pounds of oats and corn. These sows, after the pigs were two weeks old were fed S oats and 2-3 corn with a 5% portion of tankage, and a 27c portion of mineral feed, all ground together. 1 use no slop whatever, and I use self-feeders. QUESTION: What mineral feeds do you use? </seg>

            <seg id="p641">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 643 Clubs. In Nebraska baby beef clubs are on the rapid increase. This is clearly shown by the Club entries at the State Fair for the last few years. In 1921 the first baby beef class was shown at the fair. In 1922 there were twenty-two calves shown, and in 1923 we, had fifty-five, while in 1924 there was no class of livestock which attracted more attention than these calves. Figure 7 — The 1924 Seward County Junior Livestock judging team who won the State Fair junior contest and represented Nebraska at Sioux City and Chicago. Left to right: County Agent. L. A Wilson; Stanley Danekas; Clinton Stahley; Arthur Eberspacher. Why have we had this rapid increase in club work in Nebraska? I'll tell you why. The baby beef clubs have been making these young - sters some money. Last year we sold sixty-three baby beeves to buyers from Omaha and Lincoln at an average of $11.65 per hundred. This shows that the packers are willing to pay good prices for good calves. The youngsters are proud of the fact that they can make some money of their own in this way. In one county the boys and girls made an average of $52.27 per head. This, of course, includes a considerable amount of prize money. In another county the boys and girls made </seg>
            <seg id="p642">644 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 33.21 per head, here again a considerable amount of this money was trize money. Even without considering the prize money it has been making considerable profit for them. Another reason for the interest s that it is a project where they are compelled to keep a record, so ley know definitely just what their financial returns have been. All eed is charged at a fixed price. In some cases there may be a loss, »ut a youngster registering a profit takes a great deal of pride in oing so. ■ '.: \ As Mr. Gramlich has mentioned we have been carrying on some age Esriments here at the College. We have found that we can make bet - gains on the first year calves than we can on second year calves, can put on eighteen pounds gain on the first year calves with, the b expense required to put on twelve on the second year calves. Baby Beef Clubs Are a Rather New; Thing In Nebraska, Baby Beef Clubs have developed rather recently. However, back as far as 1909 we were carrying on work of a similar nature along other lines. It was not until 1914 that United States assistance was given to dob work of this kind. Since that time the work has been tremendous, particularly in the development of field crops. We now have 800,000 boys and girls in this work, a veritable army of them. It would be impressive to have this army march by in review, but it would be more impressive to note the quality of young manhood and young womanhood produced. bin 1918 the young folks were called upon to help the older boys in ice in the trenches. In Nebraska alone these youngsters produced ,000 worth of supplies from their activities. In 1916 the first organized club work was conducted. Since that time there has been a great growth of boys' and girls' club work throughout the state. I consider the money value but a mall part of real club work. We know that a boy or girl must keep a efinite record of his work. They have their organizations, business meetings, they study parliamentary law and procedures. They come in contact with many trained agricultural leaders. I think the most im - ortant thing is the awakening it. gives to the boy or girl as an incentive o more schooling. Out of four hundred Home Economics students now t our college, over fifty of them have had former club training. It ives them something that makes them have a desire for more schooling. Jlub work, for a good many of them makes it possible to go to school. Te have one such boy here in school now, Peter Pratt, who had a great eal of experience in club work, and is now a sophomore here in the college. </seg>

Club Work Is Important I wish I could make you realize the importance of boys' and girls' club work, especially the beef clubs. To make a successful club we must have not only the co-operation of the boys and girls, but we must have a leader. To organize a club we must have five boys and girls between the ages of ten and eighteen years. They must organize and select a local leader. If you can, &lt;Jo not hesitate in accepting the position as a leader to them. All it takes is that you watch the youngsters and direct their energies. All we have the leader for is to direct them along the right lines. In baby beef work it is very important that the club get started right. If you know of some one going into club work see that he gets the right kind of a calf. We find some who have very poor specimens at the State Fairs. (At this point in his talk Mr. Hepperly led out one calf from the college lots, and demonstrated to the convention the type of calf he considered the most desirable for the club workers to have.) Get a calf that has some good show points. Show it at your county fair, or your club fair. Get a calf with good lines, straight lines and uniform back. • After picking out the calf, the success of his venture depends on how - he is fed. Here is where you can help these youngsters. In order to get in on this season's work, it is necessary to have the calves on feed by February 1. Immediate action must be taken in order to get started </seg>
            <seg id="p644">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 646 this year. I think we will have from one hundred twenty-five to one hundred fifty calves here on exhibition at the State Fair next fall. QUESTION: Must these calves have a pedigree to be entered? MR. HEPPERLY: It does not make any difference in baby beef club work. QUESTION: Would pure bred stock have a better showing? MR. HEPPERLY: As a rule most of them raise pure bred calves for that reason. The grand champion last year was a grade steer. It might be of interest to discuss the price of calves. Some have bought their calves on the market, while many of the youngsters go directly to the breeders to get their stock. «a QUESTION: Can a boy get into the purebred class with a grade steer? MR. HEPPERLY: There is no such class. Competition is open to all. MR. GRAFF: (to Mr. Hepperly) Isn't it a fact, Mr. Hepperly, that it will be harder to get the same quality in a purebred calf as in a grade calf for the same money ? MR. HEPPERLY: I think as a rule we find that the grade calf will cost the youngsters less money. Many breeders of pure-bred stock are selling calves to these youngsters practically a' cost as an inducement to club work. TODAY'S FEEDING PROBLEMS. PRQF. GRAMLICH: I think what Hepperly has said is a splendid thing. We feel that these beef clubs are really producing better young people as well as better beef. You have heard us talk of corn and alfalfa hay. This year is a dif - ferent proposition. Corn is high in price and low in quality, therefore, we think the feeder is up againt a tough proposition. We can turn to some other feeds as supplements. Many of them are about the same as normally. Cottonseed cake is about $45 a ton normally, you can get it now for about $47 per ton. linseed meal is about $60, less than the price of corn at your feed lots. These high protein supplements have not advanced in price in proportion with corn. Molasses feeds have not advanced. We should use tankage together with our corn. We have been using tankage, but as yet it is a little too early to tell just how advantageous the results will be. It has shown no disadvantages so far, bat I do not know what' the actual returns will show. So far as beef H. J. Gramlich, Agricultural College. </seg>
            <seg id="p645">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 647 is concerned there is more chance for an opening than any year in the last fifteen years. If you can get corn it may be your best bet, but there is a good chance to try out other feeds. Your own conditions may be different from ours and of course you will have to work them out largely by yourself. QUESTION: Have you ever made any comparisons to determine the PROF. GRAMLICH: I think the whole problem depends upon the re - sults you have in mind. It depends a great deal on market conditions. So far as starting cattle on feed quickly is concerned, we can do that very quickly if we use ground feed. QUESTION: About how much tankage are your cattle consuming? PROF. GRAMLICH: About 2-3 to 3-4 pound a day per head. QUESTION: Do they take to it right away? PROF. GRAMLICH: It usually takes a week or ten days to get them eating it. QUESTION: Do you mix tankage with salt? PROF. GRAMLICH: No. It may be that we will have to do that, however. Mr. H. J. McLaughlin, of Doniphan, was unable to attend the con - vention .and Dr. Spencer substituted for him. TUBERCULOSIS ERADICATION. Dr. W. T. Spencer, Lincoln, Nebr. I feel my inability to substitute for Mr. McLaughlin. However the subject of tuberculosis is one I have had some experience with. I think it is of importance to every breeder and grower of livestock in the nation. It, at the same time, is one that many breeders fail to realize the significance of. Let me give you a few figures. It causes a total loss of over $5,000,000 a year, and many more ar.jpial.g axe infected partially, according to government inspectors. At one plant they have to kill and destroy from five to six per cent of the hogs coming in, that is, their entire carcasses. At one plant alone the loss from this disease is over $150,000 annually. That is one reason why this problem should be of interest to you. It is a tax that is layed on every hog on the market, an increasing tax every year if conditions con - tinue to develop. In 1908, 2 percent were found infected; in 1922, 16 percent were infected and held by government inspectors. During the past two years we have had a reduction of this amount. </seg>
            <seg id="p646">648 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE This is an immense problem, and few of us realize how big it is, and how long it is going to take to cinch it. We have just now made good start. We are going to make much better progress and that we will eradicate it to a very large degree is certain, not completely, but to very large extent. We can reduce it and control it until it will not be serious problem. If we do bring it under control we are in a position o prevent this condition obtaining again. We know now that we can ean up herds and that we can keep them clean. It is different from infectious diseases that we have to combat. We do not have to deal with it from that angle. We are going ahead with a program of safety; we intend to eradi - ate tuberculosis from our herds. This has been done to many herds in ebraska. In small areas this work is being done very rapidly. It is mportant that we should have public funds for this problem. It is a ublic interest and should have public support. We know we can do . Is it justifiable, and is it worth while to take public funds? I say ; is, both from the economical standpoint, and from the standpoint E its danger to the human families. AREA ERADICATION AND ITS RESULTS. Dr. C. H. Hays U. S. Bureau of Animal Industry, k Owing to the fact that time is limited I am not going to take very ig. I have prepared my speech in the form of a report that you may ve if you wish a copy of it. We often get inquiries as to the cost involved in this area eradica - tion program. In this pamphlet I have here you can get an idea as to what it has cost several counties, in the eastern and southeastern section of the State. You will also find a complete report of what we have done. I believe this pamphlet will answer all your questions as to whether tuberculosis can be eradicated or not. This eradication program, like any other is more efficient where it can be applied on a 100% scale. (Dr. Hays pointed out on a blue print map the areas in the State of Nebraska where the eradication program is being carried on by counties. The map had those counties in which the program has been completed, in which the program is being completed, and those in which it has just started indicated so that a comparative idea of the work could be gained. The marked areas were very small compared with the size of the state.) </seg>
            <seg id="p647">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 649 THE DANGER OF TUBERCULOSIS. Dr. L. Van Es, Agricultural College, "The Danger of Tuberculosis" looks like quite a scarehead. I am not going to scare you though. It should have been "The Dangers of Tuberculosis," because there are many of them, including the danger to health, and I would also say the great danger to the pocket book. The real danger is based on the fact that most of the dangers are misunder - stood altogether. The work of eradication is passing along well, and I am sure the field is a big one. The field of tuberculosis and its dangers is a big one. I believe there are people who could talk the full extent of their natural lives, and then not cover the subject very thoroughly. Tuberculosis is a specific disease due to just one cause, and you cannot get tuberculosis into your stock without that one cause. We have said that the housing of cattle and of man has something to do with it. It is true. It has, but you cannot get tuberculosis by keeping either cattle or man in the foulest, dirtiest places unless the germ of tuber - culosis gets in there too. It is that same germ that always causes it. We are not interested in the structure of this germ, the Bacillus of tuberculosis, we are today interested in how it works and what it does in animals. In our experiments we can reproduce this Bacillus very easily. It is one crop that we can be absolutely sure of. Our question, then, is not what it is like, but how does it behave. In the first place, while it is the tuberculosis bacillus that always causes the trouble we must remember it acts very different in different hosts. The same cause, but rather different results. There are dif - ferent varieties in growth and characteristics in different animals, and under different conditions. We find that very seldom does a case of human tuberculosis come from cattle in Nebraska. This is hard for some people to understand. But remember that we have probably not more than 2% of tuberculosis in our cattle in this state. There is very little in our people. The tuber - culosis danger from cattle, then, is entirely potential. (Dr. Van Es used a great many charts, and pointed out statistics to illustrate his statements from them during the remainder of his talk.) There are three strains of this bacillus of tuberculosis. Bovine, that generally found in cattle, human generally associated with man, and Avian, that generally associated with birds. There are, no doubt, inter - mediary varieties, but on the whole the strains are quite true to type. We have found that Bovine bacilli will kill cavia and rabbits, but does not affect birds. The Human bacillus has practically the same effect on *he cavia, but the rabbit seems almost exempt, the fowl is also </seg>
            <seg id="p648">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 650 exempt from the human variety. The cavia refuses to take the disease from the Avian bacillus, the rabbit is more liable to Avian than Human, but the fowl invariably gets it "in the neck" when the Avian infection is used. You perhaps wonder the why of this. Here it is. That enables us to tell just where a man gets tuberculosis. Out of 938 cases of pulmo - nary tuberculosis tested in England 932 cases were found to be of human origin. The danger of adults getting tuberculosis from cattle is very doubtful. The human adult is very resistant to bovine tubercu - losis infection. After sixteen years of age the chances are very remote that he will take it at all. In young children the danger of infection is very great. It is rather interesting to note that in Scotland tuberculosis of children by bovine infection is most common, while Germany, also with a high percentage of bovine tuberculosis appears to be much less af - fected. This is perhaps to be explained by the fact that the German mothers have not forgot the fine art of nursing their children. LNow is the time to get at the thing before the situation gets too big us. I know of areas in Europe where 95% of the herds are infected to the point where they react to the test. We have preached for a long time that if you clean up your cattle you will have no tuberculosis in your hogs, which sounded so sound that we did not pay any attention to tuberculosis in hogs, but devoted our at - tention to cleaning up our cattle. But something happened. When we cleaned up the cattle the hogs did not seem to know anything about it. They kept on having tuberculosis anyhow. We have been reducing the disease in our cattle but we find no improvement in our hogs. It looked very much like here was a brand of tuberculosis that was different, but what kind was it? We had reason in some cases to be - lieve it was caused as the result of an Avian infection, since pigs will take tuberculosis from birds, and p'oultry tuberculosis has become very common. We do not know just how common, but to a very great extent. Out of two hundred nine cases of tuberculosis in hogs the following results were obtained with regard to the source of infection. Eleven cases, or 5.2%, were of bovine infection. One hundred eighty-five cases, or 88.5%, were clearly Avian infection, while thirteen cases or a little over six per cent were of mixed infections. It looks as if we should also turn our attention to the disease among chickens before we can hope to do a great deal with our hogs. The Following Resolution Was Introduced By Mr. H. R. Smith And Was Moved, Seconded, And Passed Without a Dissenting Vote. "Whereas tuberculosis in cattle, hogs, and poultry is causing serious </seg>
            <seg id="p649">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 651 economic losses to the farmers of Nebraska, and is, according to the in - vestigations of our leading medical authorities, responsible for at least one-third of the tuberculosis in the human family of this country; Resolved that the Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association, in convention assembled at Lincoln, Nebraska, Jan. 8, 1925, that we en - dorse the Federal and State aid plan of eradicating tuberculosis in co - operation with herd owners and with entire counties under the area method and we urge all counties in this state to begin as soon as possible actual work in the testing of all breeding cattle to eliminate this disease. Resolved further, that we urge the present legislature to provide adequate funds for carrying forward this work as rapidly as it can be done, and we recommend such changes in existing laws as may be found desirable." A SPEEDOMETER ON THE CATTLE INDUSTRY Prof. S. D. Gromer, Columbia, Mo., Agriculture College. We hope when you show a man he will understand. We believe in a great deal of competition of the right sort. We believe that in differ - ent parts of the state different methods will be required, and we have been discussing these different methods. Personally, since leaving Ne - braska I have tried to farm. We have fed from four to five carloads of calves every year for eight years. We have managed to make a little each time. We have found, for our purposes, it is cheaper to go south - west where cows and calves are measured in terms of acres to buy our calves and bring them up here to feed for the market, than it is for us to try to raise them. Figure 9 — Good cows and legumes build up a farm and a bank account. </seg>
            <seg id="p650">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 652 I grow sweet clover. I am very much in favor of sweet clover. I like to have sweet clover to save my blue grass for winter. I think I can winter my stock this way, and in the spring with about twenty-five bushels of corn and about sixty days I can make them weigh nine hun - dred ninety pounds. We are passing from the big steer; I have been away from them about eight years. We want young beef in America. In England a bull will sell for about as much as a steer; that is not true here; we must have young beef. These small cattle are the coming What's Wrong With The Cattle Business? The point I want to make is a point that is hard to interest people in. Why is the cattle industry in the shape it is today? There is no speedometer on the industry. Beef cattle are "coming back." My notion is that one great big overshadowing factor is something we haven't thought about much. The dollar is entering into the thing. The phy - sical sciences are very important, and very good; but we must have the social sciences as well. We must make a study of the economic situation. Your success on the market is as necessary as your success to eradicate stock diseases; both are very, very important. We are going to place more emphasis on our present economic order. This order is not found on any statute books. It has been adapted more or less because there is a reason. If you want beef, offer the price and you will get it, as you will get anything else if you offer the price. I am in favor of the present economic order that is based upon competition. There must be a standard. This standard on the markets of the world You Can't Inflate Gold In every war we seem to get a man in the treasury who seems to now! very little about his business, that of money matters. In Lincoln's ;ime we had Chase. He knew very little about money matters. He is - ued the greenback money. During the war the Greenback dollar was worth about 40 cents. There were two standards of money — you can't nflate gold. When we came to this World War, we had the same thing, only hey issued Federal Reserve Notes. We have now about half the gold of the country tied up, and we have half the gold of the world in our country. Here is another factor — too much money was spent. The price evel rose to about two hundred fifty, then the gold dollar actually had about 40 cents purchasing value as compared with pre-war times; this caused a business boom, and a business boom always brings ruin to many who own property. A healthy business boom will not, but an in - lated business boom will always do it. That induces an enormous pro - duction. Every thing boomed, and the farmers thought it would last </seg>
            <seg id="p651">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 653 forever. There was a kink introduced into the thing this time — the Federal Reserve System. The men who were working the machine this time did not know their business so well. Things got away from them and then they went to work deflating. The war stopped and the great demand for this overproduction stopped. The result was a great agricultural panic, the greatest that has ever occurred in the United States. It is a wonder that most of us came out as well as we did. Much of a Farmer's Expense Is Fixed Charges, Here is the part about the farmer. About sixty per cent of the farmer's expenses are fixed charges, about twenty-five per cent must be charged to the labor of himself and his family. Here is eighty-five per cent more or less fixed. Then, only fifteen per cent is actually under his control. Have our cattle decreased in number? Nobody knows exactly — something has happened. My notion is this. Just as a result of inflation they increased pro - duction, so as a result of deflation the farmers reduced production. There is the trouble. The business men everywhere will tell you the farmers are on their feet. In my country they are more likely on their feet be - fore the sheriff, or on the "mourners" bench at the bank trying to get a little loan, or an extension of a loan to help along a while longer. The situation is about this. Next year if we have a good corn crop hogs and cattle are going to be higher because there are no hogs and cattle in the country. The fanner often says that supply and demand do not have any effect; he will see if they do not play a. part next year. Deflate your cattle production and you will increase the price, I don't care what other conditions prevail — we have to have beef, and the world will pay for it. Inflation is the whole trouble. The price level is still about 557c higher, and the dollar has about 65% of its purchasing value as compared with 1914. Your cattle will get you about as many dollars as they would in 1914, just as much gold, but the purchasing value of that gold is about 2-3 as much as in 1914. The Federal Reserve System. The American Bankers' Association that met about a month or two ago have offered themselves against the Federal Reserve System. These bankers are stocked up with bonds and other securities that are redeemable in gold. Prices have remained on an even keel now for near - ly three years. By issuing federal reserve notes to the extent of $10,000,000 and fluctuating the rates of reserve discount to meet condi - tions they have managed to maintain a uniform price level. Coming to this bankers' meeting. They have declared themselves against the fed - eral reserve system. They declare that the money situation of this </seg>
            <seg id="p652">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 654 country should be controlled by the bankers. They want the rates of re-discount raised from three to six per cent, or even seven per cent. What would this process of further deflation do for them? It would reduce the price level, and correspondingly increase the purchasing value toward 100%, in other words it will increase the actual purchasing 1 value of the proceeds of the obligations they hold which are due them, and will decrease the price level at which the rest of us have to work under to make the money to pay off those obligations. Gentlemen, I am for the Federal Reserve System, are you? How are we going to get the price of cattle up? The purchasing value of their proceeds is about 2-3 as high as it was before the war. How are we going to do it? I cannot answer that question. The farmers can only deflate in one way, and that amounts for them to failure, by the casualty method. Sometime we may get another method. Co-operation may help us. Co-operation is just this — instead of one there are many who pool their money, take the risks and get the profits or take the losses. You will get the profit all right, but remember you'll have to maintain a competitive business against all kinds of competi - tion. We might get a bigger market from somewhere. Can we increase consumption? I do not believe we can. Last year saw the largest consumption we have had since 1918. We are using more beef than ever. We only export about a half a pound for each of our own people. Our beef is just penned in our own country. Argentina keeps us out of the British markets, as well as most European markets with her grass fed cattle. Argentina is building up her cattle. They buy the best bulls that can be bought in the world ,and they are certainly building up their herds in that way too. Our Tax System Is Ridiculous. We might reduce some of our expenses; taxes for instance. We have the most ridiculous tax system conceivable, the old property tax system. We should have a tax where it will hit the places where the real money is located, instead of tacking it all on the property as we generally do now. We might raise better cattle. That will help some, but will not solve the problem entirely. There are a good many things that will help. It is a hard problem, and it may be that the best thing we can do is to go on in the old casualty way as we have been doing. We must make ourelves more efficient than our neighbors. Many of our farmers are moving to the cities. We only export about enough food to feed six million people. Our population is increasing at the rate of 1* million a year, perhaps in four years we can take care of our own production here in America. </seg>
            <seg id="p653">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 655 As to solving the real problem I haven't made much of a showing. I hope you will see that you can pay your debts and taxes on the 65% of your gold dollar, because if further deflation takes place you are go - ing to have to pay those debts with a hundred per cent purchasing value dollar. ULTRA BABY BEEF. Mr. J. S. Hopper, Chilicothe, Mo. My twenty-seven calves, twenty-six of which were registered Here - fords, and one very poor Shorthorn, had an average birth date of March 18 to 20. Two calves came in February and four in April and twenty - one in March. They ate a total of four hundred eighty-nine bushels of corn, two hundred twenty-seven bushels of oats, and three thousand five hundred ten pounds of a mixture of four parts bran and three parts shorts and two parts tankage by weight. The corn cost an average of ?1.15 per bushel, the oats an average of fifty cents per bushel, and the mixture of bran, shorts, and tankage an average of $1.75 per hundred. The mixture of bran, shorts, and tankage was gradually substituted for oats during the last half of October and entirely substituted oats by November 1. The corn was fed shelled until the 10th of November and after which time it was ground. The calves were turned on a small pasture with blue grass from May 1 to September 20. After September 20th they were fed in a dry lot with soy bean and sudan mixed hay. The consumption of hay was very light; I did not weigh it. I haven't more than an estimate of the amount the calves ate each month, but the estimate is quite close and will show the rate of increase of consumption of feed. April, three bushels of corn, six bushels of oats; May, nine bushels of corn .twelve bushels of oats; June, fourteen bushels of corn, sixteen bushels of oats; July, twenty-seven bushels of corn, twenty-seven bushels of oats; August, fifty-four bushels of corn, fifty-one bushels of oats; September, ninety bushels of corn, seventy bushels of oats; October, one hundred twenty bushels of corn, forty-five bushels of oats, two hundred twenty-seven pounds of mixture of bran, shorts, and tankage; Novem - ber, one hundred forty bushels of com, twenty-seven hundred pounds of the mixed feed; and December, 1-6 inclusive, fifty bushels of corn, five hundred forty pounds of the mixed feed. 600-Pound Calves In Eight Months. The average age of the calves was eight and one-half months and the average home weight was six hundred five pounds. The average market weight on the twenty-six Hereford calves, seventeen steers and </seg>
            <seg id="p654">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 656 nine heifers, was five hundred eighty seven pounds and sold straight at $11.50 per hundred. The Shorthorn calf weighed at market six hundred sixty pounds and sold for $9.00 per hundred. The average shrink was a little less than fifteen pounds per calf. QUESTION: How long have you been following this plan? MR. HOPPER: About four years. QUESTION: Did it return a profit every year? MR. HOPPER: Yes. QUESTION: Without grain what would these calves have been worth at weaning time? MR. HOPPER: Not over fifteen dollars a head. L QUESTION: About how much grain does it take to make a pound of ? MR. HOPPER: I do not know, we did not figure this out. QUESTION: Is there much labor to handling calves this way? MR. HOPPER: Not a great deal. QUESTION: Would you advise this plan in a general way? bMR. HOPPER: From the present look of the market ,and of the feed ket it would seem that the larger cattle should be eliminated from market. QUESTION: How do you handle the cows? MR. HOPPER: I keep the cows in one pasture, and the calves in an - other, letting them together twice a day, morning and evening. QUESTION: Do you wean the calves at all? MR. HOPPER: Just before shipping them. Meeting adjourned until the annual business meeting at the Lincoln Hotel. ANNUAL BUSINESS MEETING OF NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVE - STOCK BREEDERS ASSOCIATION.

Mr. McLaughlin reported in regard to the funds available for the use of the association. He stressed the importance of the judging work not only with boys and girls clubs, but also with college boys. H. J. Gramlich gave in detail the present status of judging team aid from the financial standpoint. Mr. Charles Graff suggested that a definite part of the funds avail - able for the use of the Breeders Association might be used to defray a part of the expenses of the college judging team. It was the con - census of opinion of those present that some sort of financial aid should be given the members of teams which are doing much to advertise Ne - braska and her livestock industry. Mr. Harrison of Indionola, C. B. Steward of Lincoln, and Frank Crocker of Filley, each reported in favor of something being done in behalf of our 1924 state judging team inasmuch as the members are all boys who are dependent upon themselves for the finance required to go through college. Mr. C. B. Steward made a motion that the State Board of Agricul - ture be requested to present the 1924 judging team with a prize of $150.00 and that they be requested to make arrangements to take care of the proposition in the future by making a certain fund available for the Nebraska College Judging Team. The motion was seconded and carried unanimously. Mr. Weyland Magee offered a very logical argument in behalf of such an action but advised against setting any precedent which could not be followed out in future years. </seg>
            <seg id="p656">k Meeting was opened for election of officers. Charles Graff was nimously chosen as president to succeed H. J. McLaughlin. H. J. mlich was elected treasurer. M. B. Posson was elected secretary. Prof. H. J. Gramlich made a motion that the following statement be placed on record and copy be sent to Mr. H. J. McLaughlin, our re - tiring president, and newly appointed State Secretary of Agriculture. Seconded and carried unanimously. "We, the members of the Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders Association congratulate the State of Nebraska upon being so fortunate as to have as their secretary of agriculture, a man who is so big that he will make personal sacrifices to serve the livestock industry of our great state. We realize that Mr. McLaughlin is making a sacrifice, prob - ably greater than the average person realizes, but knowing him as we do, we are confident that he has made his decision hoping to serve his state ahead of himself. We pledge him our undivided support and wish him a prosperous term. We know that he will give Nebraska his best and that every move he makes will be one which he sincerely believes to be the best for his state." Mr. Graff in his speech of acceptance paid great tribute to Mr. McLaughlin's sincerity and ability. Mr. Charles Steward in turn paid high tribute to Mr. McLaughlin. He also congratulated the people of the State of Nebraska for electing a governor who uses such careful judgment in selecting the members of bis cabinet. Motion made at 11:30 P. M. to adjourn.

Pedrett, of Kimball, at 3:15 P.M. CHAIRMAN PEDRETT: We are informed the first speaker on the program did not know he was to address this session. I take pleasure in introducing to you a well known citizen of Gering, Mr. Lyda. (Ap - plause.) ADDRESS OF WELCOME Mr. President, Members of the Nebraska Potato Improvement Asso - ciation, Ladies and Gentlemen: I have an office in which I was rather busy. For some reason, I did not receive one of these programs. Some - body told me I was to have something to say to you tomorrow evening, and I had begun figuring up a speech for that occasion; but I did not know I was expected to say something this afternoon. However, it does not take a long speech or a very fancy one to say the people of Gering are glad to have you with us. We hope you will enjoy your stay, and &gt;pe that this eighth annual convention will be of interest and of value to you. We know it will be of value to us. Some time ago I saw a statement with respect to the general market - ing of farm products that ran something like this: "The farmer plows in faith; plants in prayer; harvests in hope; and markets by accident." I take it one of the principal features of the Potato Improvement As - sociation is not only to raise good potatoes, but to know what to do with them after you raise them. I presume that is as important as to rake good ones. Hon. C. O. Lyda, Mayor, Goring, Nebraska </seg>
            <seg id="p666">668 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The city of Gering is very proud to have you here. I was authorized by the Commercial Club to extend to you at this time a welcome, and also the invitation of the city to come back with us next year, and as many years as you may see fit to do so. We will always be glad to take care of you the best we can. If there is anything we can do at this time to make this Show a great - er success or add to the comfort of those in attendance, we hope you will call our attention to any such matters that may arise and we will be glad to do the very best we can. We are not of metropolitan size, but I take it these conventions have not been meeting in metropolitan cen - ters, so you are probably used to towns of about our size, and you should feel at home. I hope you will take advantage of anything we can give you, and let us know wherein we can be of- service to you. Extending you again a hearty welcome at this time, and an invitation for your ninth annual Show, I will close my remarks. (Applause.) THE CHAIRMAN: I do not want the speaker to think he is excused for tomorrow night, because we will hear from him again. Next on our program is "The Nebraska Certified Seed Potato In - dustry." On account of the lateness of the trains, some of the speakers who were to have discussed this topic are not with us, so we will pass to the "Competitive Potato Club Demonstrations," by the potato clubs of Bushnell and Dix. We are neutral to both parties. We live in the mid - dle. (Laughter.) I am sure both Clubs will satisfy you they have done splendid work. COMPETITIVE POTATO CLUB DEMONSTRATIONS Bushnell The Bushnell Potato Club, represented by Alice Forsling and Arnold Gadeken, put on a demonstration, showing a knowledge of the potato in - dustry in western Nebraska which would have done credit to an exper - ienced potato raiser of twice their years. Dix tniis was followed by a demonstration by Robert Gunderson and Don- Peterson, of Dix, whose diminutive size was offset by their knowl - : of the subject. They stressed the diseases affecting potatoes in ir region. The demonstrations of both clubs were attentively received and warm - ly applauded. </seg>
            <seg id="p667">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURK 669 THE CHAIRMAN: We have a man from Louisiana who will give you an idea what the potato clubs do down there at the other end. Our boys and girls have shown what they do to raise the best seed. The next speaker will tell you how they use that seed. I was down in Louis - iana last spring and had the pleasure of meeting the southern gentle - men. I was surprised at the Club work they carried on. It was wonder - ful. You see how they test the seed from different states and bring it back to us and show the results down there. The speaker who is about to come forward may tell you something about me, but don't believe it. (Laughter.) I do not mean you should not believe all he tells you about what they have clone down thera — I mean just about me. I take pleasure in introducing to you Mr. Henry Clay Smith, Agricul - tural Agent of the Missouri Pacific Railroad, who was formerly with the Louisiana State University. (Applause.) "THE RELATION OF THE BOYS' AND GIRLS' POTATO CLUB WORK IN THE SOUTH TO THE CERTIFIED SEED POTATO INDUSTRY" Mr. Henry Clay Smith, Alexandria, Louisiana I am sorry there was not some more of that title! Before this meeting commenced, I said to Mr. Pedrett, "You know I usually start out with a joke; but I do not know any." He said, "Just stand up there for a minute and they will all laugh when they see you." I did have some things to tell you about Jake and what he did in Louisiana. I told him what I was going to tell. He said he would give me a dollar if I didn't tell. I have the dollar, so I'll keep still about it. (Laughter.) You have been kind enough to send some of your certified seed po - tatoes to Louisiana for distribution over our state to the boys and girls enrolled in the agricultural clubs in Louisiana. It is becoming the cus - tom of men from Washington in surveying the south to go to Louisiana and study our Club work. We have a good representation down there in Club work. « I dislike this business of saying, "the boys of the south." I never can find the border line between south and north. I seem to be very much at home in both places. </seg>
            <seg id="p668">670 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE I heard Mr. Pedrett say, not so very long ago, that he went to Louis - iana, and Mr. Tiebout, with whom I used to work, said, "We want so many potatoes for our boys and girls." When he got down there, he found some fertilizer company had given nitrate, and some had given phosphate. Mr. Pedrett said, "What is he doing? His kids must be well fed with all those potatoes, and he must have some fertilizer to pui on his own land." Mr. Tiebout was able to get the potatoes, and I had the pleasure of sending them out all over the state. This is how we handle it. You ship us some potatoes and they come to Batort Rcu^e. I am promptly notified the car is there, and I get out my old clothes and don them ac - cordingly and go down to the railroad station. Mr. Tiebout has his cam - era, and we have a semi-celebration while we open the car of potatoes Elated by the folks up here. We go over them to see if the potatoes s frozen. They let us use the railroad platform for a day or two in oading and billing. We make a list of the counties in which we have a demonstration agent and a county agent. We send out a Questionnaire and say, "How many bushels of certified seed can you handle?" Up until this time they have asked for more than we could give them. They said perhaps, "We want enough potatoes for one hundred demonstrations." We notify the agents the car of potatoes will be shipped them on a certain date. We go to the car and cross off the old labels; give new labels; weigh out the potatoes to the different agents; bill them ourselves, and divide them in lots. Usually we have to hire some labor to get them off to the county agents and then we have them hauled to the different railroads. The agents have organized clubs. They put these potatoes in the Eck end of their Fords and take them to the Club meeting and give jse potatoes to the boys and girls. I have been to meetings when the tatoes were distributed. If the day is suitable, they take them to a near-by garden where they have some of the land ready. We want to demonstrate the use of a good fertilizer, as well as the use of good seed. We have two rows eighty feet long. In one we use a fertilizer and in one we do not. A demonstration was given how large the pieces of po - tato should be cut for planting, etc. Then we fertilized the ground and put in our potatoes at the proper distances — usually twelve inchss apart — and covered them up. We have there had a demonstration with the po - tatoes, how they should be planted, etc., and then tell the boys and girls to go home and plant them like that. We use poet cards for records. The boys and girls note the grower's name. "The seed was donated by So-and-So in Nebraska." On the card is also the name of the man who gave the fertilizer. They note the date they were planted; when they came up; when they were harvested, and the yield. Copies are kept and at the end of the season they send it in </seg>
            <seg id="p669">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 671 to our office; or the demonstration agent gathers them and sends them to the Baton Rouge office. When they came in, I had to file those cards; tell who the grower was; the kind of seed planted, and the number of pounds of potatoes gathered. That was no small amount of work. During the summer when the work was going on, as soon as I got the potatoes out and they came up, I traveled the state as fast as I could and took my camera with me and took pictures of the potatoes in the field to compare with other potatoes, and checked up to see if the potatoes raised up here were good, after all. Often parents would say, "They are no good. They are just a bluff, and we will plant some we get down town." Usually they do it. It is some of the best demonstration work I have seen. Nine times out of ten, with the potatoes the parents plant, one comes up here and one over yon - der — one today, and one a week from now. The potatoes from here have come up regularly, with very few scabs, and much sooner than the home - grown seed. That is pretty general over the state. I took pictures, and I believe Mr. Tiebout has brought them up here. This club work has been a real source of pleasure, and I think one of the best ways in which certified seed has been spread over Louisiana. To prove it to you, I will say the parents have bought their children's potato seed again and again in the fall of the year. It did so well that instead of letting the children sell their potatoes, the parents would buy the po - tatoes the children raised and use them for the fall planting. Some have kept them until the next spring and planted them, although we do not recommend that practice highly. We try to get them to get new stock every year. What you are interested in is having your seed used in Louisiana in great quantities. I know this because I have been with the county agent; these demonstrations have helped him sell your seed in Louisiana, in several different ways. In some places the home demonstration and county agents have put on potato shows. The boys and girls bring in their potatoes and the record card of the year, showing the time planted, etc. Each boy and girl is allowed a place to display the potatoes. I had the pleasure of reading over the county agents' report in Louisiana. Some of them wrote a year ago they considered the best piece of really constructive demonstration work they did that year was the work with the boys and girls with certified seed. That is saying a good deal. They put the potatoes in store windows. The merchants gave prizes for the boy and girl who raised the best potatoes and kept the best record. As a result, the county agent has been able to induce dealers to invest in certified seed. The records and the quality of the potato and its returns have been so fine, the dealers have taken up this seed. It takes a long time to introduce something new, especially when </seg>
            <seg id="p670">672 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the price is higher than home-grown stuff. It seems to me this work has been remarkably well done. It is impossible to say how much seed has been sold due to the boys' and girls' club work. We cannot measure it. We know the amount of seed we sell is increasing year oy year, and I hope we will be able to lake 500 cars yearly. That depends upon a good many factors which I can not tell you. I have had some experience in trying to advertise good seed. One of my theories is good seed is cheap at practically any price. believe in good seed. I am all the time talking about it. We must lave it down there — good Irish potato seed. I do not know how much it has cost you to advertise certified seed in jouisiana. If you had taken it up through the channel of the news - tapers, you would be a long way back of what you are now. I do not mow how much it is your intention to do in future. I seriously question whether you can find a better medium of advertising than through the toys' and girls' clubs of Louisiana, especially since we are having our po - ato shows, and putting exhibits in the store windows and leaving them. 'hey let the boys and girls have a special day. On top of that, Louisiana is strong on county fairs. I find our Irish Potato booth with certified eed is one of the most talked of booths at the whole fair. I think it has teen a fine piece of work to give us that seed. I hope you realize it has teen a good piece of advertising for you. We know it has been a dry year and certified seed is worth some - ting; but I am also convinced the time things go higher is the time to advertise the more. It is not the time to quit advertising. I know you will give some more certified seed for this year's planting. If the wea - ler is with you, you will have a big crop next year and you will want to sell it. This year is a good year to advertise for next year's business. f next year's crop is good, I hope when Mr. Tiebout asks for your part f certified seed to be given to the boys and girls, you will not hesitate to ■end it down. I am glad that I do not know anything about your trials and tribu - ations. If I did, I might not ask you to give me so freely for this work. ometimes I think I see so much of little troubles I forget the big thing. 'he big thing is to give those potatoes down there and advertise your stock in Louisiana. We have been preaching the doctrine of good seed. It is hard to teach an old dog new tricks." We have difficulty in sell - ng to the old folks seed that costs more. They usually say, "Little boy, have been on the farm a long time and know a lot about it." So it goes on. I do not have that trouble with the boys and girls. There are places n Louisiana -where the county agent could not convince the old folks lere was not a string to this offer. They could not believe it. We gave lem to the boys and girls who are not quite so incredulous. They have one the trick and convinced their parents. </seg>
            <seg id="p671">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 673 We can see into the future long enough to know Nebraska will stay in the certified seed game. You want us to buy them, and we want to. The boys and girls are growing up fast. The other clay I came across a sev - enteen-year-old boy who is helping his father on the farm. We hope to keep him there, because we are convinced Louisiana will be one of the greatest producing states in the future. We have a climate that will do the trick. We are going to use it and going to raise Irish potatoes, too. When these boys and girls know what certified seed is, they are not go - ing to say, "I have been farming a long time." They will say, "Sure, we know about certified seed, and want it." If you look to the future, you will finil you are making a great friend of the boys and girls in Louisiana. They will believe in your seed and buy it. If you will forget the trials and remeirber your own sons will be raising seed in the future, and that the boys and girls in Louisiana want your certified seed to make them prosperous, and you want to sell it to make you prosperous, I do not think there is any doubt you will be glad to send the seed to the boys and girls for demonstration work in Louisiana. They say a good man can make a speech in thirty minutes, and any - body can talk two hours. I guess I am getting in the poor class. I should like you to feel the Extension Department at Baton Rouge is very liberal in respect to what it has given me while I have been with the University, and Mr. Tiebout and his office force have spent a great deal of labor in advertising your certified seed down there. My own sal - ary and expense out of the state checking up this seed and going to the Fair to judge potatoes costs money. The Extension Department has given it willingly not only to foster the industry for us, but for you, too. Mr. Tiebout's assistant has gone to the dealers of the state on state expense and asked them instead of buying home-grown seed to invest in this seed. One of our biggest buyers decided, "If they send a man from the University to tell me this, it must be so;" and he bought the seed. We have done that for you, and you have been just as kind and sent the seed to us. . I want to say this demonstration of the Potato Clubs we saw chis af - ternoon is one of the hopeful signs of the future of the potato industry. The way they told what they had to tell has any bunch of men in the state of Lousiana just naturally "skinned". We want you to feel you are taking part in the education of the boys and girls who are to mean a great thing for this country — your own boys and girls, and ours. Some - times we feel limited in what we are able to accomplish. After all, if we implant in the boys and girls who are here all these things you saw and heard this afternoon, we need not worry that our time and money have been spent. Just what the future may bring I do not know. I am with the rail - road, but still interested in Club work. Several of the railroads are ar- </seg>
            <seg id="p672">1 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 674 ranging to haul these potatoes free, and they will be hauled to the respective parishes free ; so the railroad is deeply interested in this work. Although I am not with the Extension Department, I go with the county agents whenever possible and have the pleasure and privilege of talking with the boys and girls. The next time I will have more to tell them, be - cause I have come here on two different occasions — one to inspect your field, and at this time. When I tell them how you take care of those po - tatoes, and of the boy's and girls' demonstrations given here, I know our boys and girls will take care of those potatoes better. I do not mean to intimate that they do not take care of them well now. Probably it would be well to end with this story: Once in a while, due to the overflow of the Mississippi, people tie their &gt;oats in their front yards. Two years ago in Louisiana the river was on top of the levee, and they had to put sacks to keep it from flooding the ountry. The people slept peacefully with the water above the top of the louses. Occasionally a levee gives way and we have a flood. It was the ed River in that instance. One demonstration agent lived in Indiana. he appreciated the trouble and pains it took to raise these potatoes. She gave them to a little girl and told her how to take care of them. They lad a raft in the front yard made out of boards, and put their household urniture and the chickens and pig and cow on that raft and went float - ng down the river. The little girl found the flood was getting around to the garden. She did not know you could not transplant potatoes. She ook them up and put them in a basket and carried them to their new tome and planted them. tl tell this to convince you we do not waste these potatoes; Mr. Tie - ut does not feed them, and I do not eat them. I want to prove the ys and girls do take care of these potatoes and appreciate them. I did not know I was going to be on the program this afternoon. I have heard of people making one of these extemporaneous speeches, and they can laugh it off. I have always been under the impression those extemporaneous speeches were thought up for months. Maybe not. I have tried to outline to you what happens to your potatoes when the potatoes get to Louisiana. To revert to the boys' and girls' club work, we think it is one of the finest pieces of demonstration work that has ever been done and want to thank you for your assistance, and I know you in turn are glad to thank us for helping to do the advertising work for your certified seed, which at present seems to have the world beaten when it comes to first - class stock. Discussion MR PEDRETT: How many pounds do you give to each boy and girl? </seg>
            <seg id="p673">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 675 MR. SMITH: About eight. They make two eighty-foot rows. The first year we started with three or four. I think the average is about ten pounds. It makes it easier to weigh out. This year we would like to spread them over as wide a territory as possible and still get results. MR. PEDRETT: Are the boys and girls planting the second crop? MR. SMITH: We plant in August and try to get a fall crop, but it is uncertain in Louisiana. They do not sprout. They plant the second year in the spring, but the second-year planting is not good. I think Mr. Tiebout would like to discourage it. Are j ou satisfied ? (Ap - plause.) MR. PEDRETT: 1 am very well satisfied. Ycu can .-ee the boys and girls in Club work have the advantage of our boys up h:re. Our Club members have a good strain of potatoes and can use thsm, by care - ful selection, for several years. In Louisiana you get eight pounds a year, and that is the least. They must have new seed every year. Awarding of Prizes in Competitive Potato Club Demonstrations MR. SMITH, (Louisiana) : I am not like Jake. He says, "They live there and I live here; so I am in the middle, and can be neutral, and I am all right." I feel like I am between the devil and the deep blue sea, because 1 dislike to do this sort of business. I notice those white potatoes began to turn red. They told so much more about potatoes than the potatoes knew about themselves, they were blushing. (Laughter.) I will have to admit that was the best Club demonstration I have ever seen. I have been in Louisiana and have stopped in Kentucky and was raised in New York, but I have never seen a Club demonstration to equal these two in completeness of detail and the way things were explained so carefully and fully. You both are to be congratulated very highly The next time I go out and see a Club in Louisiana, I shall tell them how you did this thing. I want to assure you both ycu are considerably better than anything I have seen in Louisiana or any place else. I think it is very important and one of the greaest things in Club work to remember this: "For when the great Scorer comes To mark against your name, He writes not that you've won or lost, But how you've played the game." Some one is the winner and some one is the loser. If you are a nice pleasant winner, you are to be congratulated. If you are a good loser, </seg>
            <seg id="p674">676 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE you are to be congratulated just as much. I met one of the professors at the University who was interested in a boy, and the boy lost. The man said, "I am certainly glad. Winning too often spoils a youngster. Winning once in a while is all right." If we will remember somebody has to lose and somebody has to win, and you deserve about as much credit if you lose graciously as if you had won. first prize goes to the Bushnell Club, and the second prize to Dix Club. (Applause.) kTHE SECRETARY: I know Mrs. Forsling is in a hurry to get home, I think it would be well if she would tell the convention what she the Potato Club did during the month of Septembar. (Applause.) tMRS. GUS FORSLING, (Bushnell) : I could not tell you that. I did t think of anything else but the Club, because I have really enjoyed i work. We went to Lincoln to give our demonstration, and we were very for - tunate in getting on as the champion team on farm products in the state of Nebraska, giving us a trip to Sioux City. At that time, instead of coming home, we stayed at Lincoln and made quite a nice acquaintance there in the Agricultural College. It was an education to me, in a measure, as well as to my team. bFrom there we went to Sioux City and gave our demonstration. Of rse we did not feel that we were able to win there, because we had sen states to compete with; but we came in fourth. I thank you. (Applause.) THE CHAIRMAN: I want to say for the Potato Improvment Asso - ciation, it shows that we have made good progress, no matter who did it. I wished as I looked over the exhibits out here they could have been lown at Sioux City and Lincoln. You can train children so they can tell it by heart, but I wish we could have followed up that demonstration with the actual work of what they have produced, and selected, which ou see on the table. That is what I should like to see shown during Agricultural Week in Lincoln — the actual work in the production and selection of good seed. You have the samples out there of what those ;wo teams did by their own selection. </seg>

Every year prior to this, there has been complaint fter the convention, (coming to me more or less indirectly), that the irogram was too full and the growers were not given opportunity to iscuss things or exchange views. We tried at times to leave space or discussion. We generally found the growers did not avail them - selves of the opportunity. We thought we would try it again. We left whole day practically entirely open for anything the growers wished o bring up not scheduled on the program. If you desire to participate n these meetings, show it by making this last day worth while. We lope you will have many things to bring up at that time. THE CHAIRMAN: All the members received a copy of the Annual Report of the proceedings of last year's convention. The book alone is worth a dollar. A good many who should have been here at the opening of the pro - gram were not here; consequently we are behind with our program. We will stand adjourned until seven o'clock this evening. WEDNESDAY EVENING SESSION. December 3, 1924 The second session of the convention met on Wednesday evening and was called to order by Vice-President Pedrett at 7:30. THE CHAIRMAN: We have with us a gentleman who has been here for the last several conventions, who always has some things to say about certified seed and the potato industry here and in Louisiana. I do not need to introduce to you Professor Tiebout, of Louisiana. (Ap - plause.) </seg>
            <seg id="p677">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 679 A MESSAGE FROM LOUISIANA Professor G. L. Tiebout, Baton Rouge, Louisiana Gentlemen: I do not expect to do much talking at this convention. It was good of you to ask me to come up and meet with you. I am glad to get back to Nebraska again. I think this is my sixth trip. Some of my folks are wondering whether I am from Nebraska or Louisiana. I was introduced the other day by a man who said he did not know whether to introduce me as coming from Nebraska or Louisiana. We are very fortunate in having with us this year these gentlemen representing the railroads. I want to say a few words as to what the railroads are doing toward helping us develop this certified seed indus - try. I have been telling you from time to time that I hoped that we could get more growers from Louisiana to come up to Nebraska, and I still entertain that hope. Last summer, however, I took it upon myself to invite the agricultural representatives from several of the railroads in Louisiana, and you know that when we started out with the big tour in the Kimball section, there were five of us. Professor Werner smiles when I make a statement like that, because he has more or less discredited my expressions regarding these representatives from Louisiana. I think we are going to make good right now. We are glad to have six railroad representatives with us at this time, and I hope next summer we will have a dozen in attendance at the potato tour. The railroads are helping us a great deal in this connection. Some of the agricultural agents who are here now are old University people, and our good friend, Newsom, of the Kansas City Southern, is an old ex - tension worker; so we feel they are a part of our big educational family. These gentlemen travel about the country a great deal and are in posi - tion to tell the people about what the colleges and the growers in the respective states are doing to improve the Triumph potato seed. We are interested in the Triumph in Louisiana because it is the po - tato in demand. About five or six years ago the Triumph in Louisiana had run out, and the growers in some sections were abandoning this splendid variety for reasons not known to them. The College got into this work with the help of the United States Department of Agriculture, and collected samples from several states of the north beginning to grow certified seed. Our first effort was to demonstrate the superiority of aertif ied seed over the common run of stock such as offered through the regular commercial channels. We found after a period of years that there was a decided advantage in planting certified seed. Meetings like these today are the fruit of activities carried on here and carried on in the south. Agricultural representatives of the rail - roads help with agricultural problems. We have a number of represen - tatives who are anxious to do what they can to assist us with our traffic </seg>
            <seg id="p678">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 680 problems. There is a great deal of confusion in regard to rates from Western Nebraska points to Louisiana points. We are making splendid progress in getting these rates adjusted, and these traffic representa - tives have been kind enough to come out here and help us on this prob - lem, which is of course a mutual one. Somebody must pay the freight; therefore we are all interested in getting the lowest rates we can con - sistent with good business, and getting rates that are approximately the same from sections that are located under similar conditions, or in simi - lar territory. I asked these gentlemen to come along to talk for me. Mr. Smith started off, and some of these other folks are "rearing to go." Railroad men always like to talk. That is the way they have of expressing them - selves. You perhaps heard of the test work we did at the Experiment Sta - on of the Louisiana State University. This was the most extensive work ever attempted in the United States with certified Triumphs. We lad 250 lots of certified Triumphs from seven different states growing i the Experiment Station under parallel condition so that the represen - atives of the agricultural colleges from these northern and western ates who are growing certified seed could come and see what their respective stocks were doing under southern conditions. We had a splen - id meeting of these gentlemen. Professor Werner from your College was with us, and representatives from the agricultural colleges of Mon - ana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin, as well as Professor Scribner from Maine. We were honored with the presence of Mr. W. A. tuart, the potato ■ specialist of the United States Department of Agri - culture. kl think these gentlemen got a better insight into the mutual prob - ns that confront us. If you could have seen Mr. Stuart spending five ys there, and Professor Werner spending nine days looking over 160 s, you would get an idea of the magnitude of this work. We have a long way to go yet in this certification activity. Our certified seed is not all that it should be yet, but we are making some wonderful strides. We hope to be able to help the growers of northern and western sections to improve their stocks as rapidly as possible. I believe through the interchange of visits we can advance very much A potato tour was held at the same time these gentlemen favored us with a visit. We took them over some of the largest growing sec - tions of Louisiana so that they could get first-hand information as to the performance of certified seed under field conditions. We also want - ed our growers to meet these gentlemen and get an idea as to what the people in this section were against in producing certified seed. </seg>
            <seg id="p679">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 681 We are planning a bigger and better tour next year, and right now I want to invite all of you to come and see us, and help Professor Wer - ner eat some of the frogs' legs. He is getting more than his share. I think we can show you some of the most interesting things this coming year that have ever transpired in the history of certification work. We are going to have locations where three states will be represented, and I believe an opportunity of that sort will not be afforded by any other section. If you want to see Nebraska certified seed in the race, come to Louisiana next year. I want to say a little bit about club work. Mr. Smith covered that topic in an able manner today. As he used to have charge of the field work, he is in position to speak on Club work. Last summer I told you we were planning to have ten thousand boys and girls growing potatoes from certified seed. I must say we are making splendid progress in that work. You good folks have prom - ised to give us .a whopping big car of your fine certified seed for this work. Montana has promised to do likewise, and it may be possible I will get another car from another source. The railroads are very gen - erously hauling this material to the University at Baton Rouge from these respective points free of charge, and the lines radiating from Ba - ton Rouge connecting with other lines are going to carry this seed through to the county demonstration agents, who will in turn distribute it to the boys and girls. This is one of the most extensive Club projects ever attempted in this country. Our club executives tell us the agents are anxious to do this work. It is one of the most popular lines of Club work that has ever been undertaken, and the boys and girls of Louisiana feel a great deal of pride in their potato patches. The Barrett Company of New York is planning to make a very generous contribution of sulphate of ammonia. It will be used along with acid phosphate as a fertilizer fo^ one-half of each of the plots of these boys and girls. We are just getting in our reports of last year's work, and so far it has been determined that the fertilized row in the Club project yield - ed one-third more than the unfertilized row. Our object in using fer - tilizer in this connection is to show the boys and girls, their parents, neighbors, and friends, what fertilizers will do when used with good seed. I believe we are accomplishing this. We have just passed the Fair period in Louisiana. We put on our customary exhibit of certified seed at our State Fair this past Novem - ber. This work has always attracted a great deal of attention. The prizes at the parish, district and state fairs for potatoes grown from certified seed are very liberal. You hear a great deal about diseases up here. I shall not attempt to describe any of them. Professor Werner can do that so much better </seg>
            <seg id="p680">682 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE than I can. I want to tell you about three diseases that are the most important to us from the southern standpoint. I believe spindle tuber has jumped into first place. Mosaic is still a limiting factor, as it has been for several years past; and our growers are asking us to pay especial attention to the scab. Of the 250 cars bought by Louisiana in - terests last year, about the only complaint we had was on account of scab. I am just afraid some of the certified seed that came from Nebraska last year was not sorted quite as well as it should have been. That is a matter of the past, and we are assured that such a condition will be remedied this year. We have annexed a specialist in marketing at Baton Rouge who is licensed inspector of the United States Department of Agriculture, ureau of Agricultural Economics. We will be glad this year to offer us service in the event it is needed to inspect cars for condition or onformity to the United States grade No. 1, except as to size, on cars that may arrive in Louisiana that need inspection service. With the help f the certification of officials up here and your good growers, I believe le matter of scab ought to be a thing of the past from the Nebraska certification standpoint. bWhen you come to Louisiana next year, we want you to see our new ege. You perhaps have heard we are building a new institution. expect to move to our new site next summer. You will remember that after visiting western Nebraska last year, had the privilege of spending about six weeks making a survey of the erritory in the United States where certified potatoes are produced, find there is considerable interest in the production of certified Tri - umphs. You folks are going to find, I am sure, that competition will be much keener in the future. I believe, however, that competition will cause you to put forth extra effort in the production of good certified seed. If you will pardon me for drawing a few comparisons, perhaps I might be of some service. After leaving here, I went to the Black Hills section. It is possible that South Dakota will begin to produce some certified seed. They do not have any this year. The Montana section seems to be the most promising new territory. They are anxious to grow certified seed from one strain — the Sharpies strain. I believe they are taking the right step. As they have the ad - vantages of the mistakes that have been made by other states in the development of this certification work, I think they can start about right. The growers there are co-operating remarkably well with the University, just as the growers here are paying special attention to the suggestion of your University. It is not my purpose to speak about the business phases at this time, except to say I think we are going to see certified seed grown on a con- </seg>
            <seg id="p681">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 683 tract basis, beginning with this year; and that contracts will be made for next year. We have already been approached on this point, and a survey has been made. We find that some of our larger growers in Louisiana are in favor of this particular method of trading. I believe it is going to meet with response from this territory. I was impressed with the Montana strain known as the Sharpies strain. It seems to be remarkably free of disease, and the fields I saw were of exceptional vigor. In the Gallatin Valley I saw one field of two acres certified that yielded nine hundred bushels. That is an exceptional yield, of course; but it gives an idea of the yield that can be made in that section. As you know, the Triumph producing section of Montana is confined to the Gallatin Valley and in the northern part of the state along the Great Northern railway between Havre and Glasgow. We spent several days in that section. We visited Mr. Sharpies. I have some views of the survey I made, and will be glad to have you look at them. We saw his field, as well as the field of his neighbor. You may be interested to know the history of the Sharpies strain. It has developed from three little potatoes given Mr. Sharpies eighteen years ago. The first year he planted them, fifty pounds were harvested. He has kept them more or less isolated during that period of eighteen years. From Montana I passed to North Dakota. I found one grower who appealed to mo as being unusually progressive in that when he saw the results of the tert* at Baton Rouge, he abandoned his own .-.train anl took the leading strain as indicated by the test work. I was especially impressed with the enthusiasm of that grower. He wanted right from the start to get what was showing up to be the best, and I think he took the proper course. I passed through Minnesota and went into Wisconsin. I was not able to detect any spindle tuber in the fields I saw. There were very few real green plants. I saw one field where the planting had been made very late, and got a fair idea of that disease in that field. This year we are buying certified seed in Louisiana from practically every state that is producing it. We are going to have some very inter - esting fields in the state next year. I intend to watch developments with a great deal of interest. I thank you for your attention. (Applause.) THE CHAIRMAN: We are very fortunate to have with us tonight Mr. H. C. Fondren, Agricultural and Colonization Agent of the Southern Pacific Lines in Louisiana, </seg>
            <seg id="p682">684 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE "GREETINGS FROM A RAILROAD MAN" Mr. H. C. Fondren, Lake Charles, Louisiana Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: It is through a conspiracy between Professor Werner and Professor Tiebout that I am supposed to make a few remarks to you tonight. I am very glad to attend your potato show this winter. I had the pleasure of making the tour with you through your state this past sum - mer. I ran into Montana one day, but did not make the rest of the our with Professor Tiebout. I have traveled a little better than thir - een hundred miles to come to this Potato Show. That should be proof nough I appreciate what you folks are doing, and the opportunity to meet you again and see the results of your year's work. Ordinarily a man, no matter where he is from, first starts to boast. Californians are the chief of all in this respect, but we have all learned to brag. Instead of bragging on Louisiana tonight, I will brag on you folks. I see Mr. Neuswanger looking as me as if he thought I wanted a car of potatoes. (Laughter.) I am not here to get potatoes. As a matter of fact, we are contributing quite a bit of freight on this move - ment of seed potatoes Professor Teibout is distributing in Louisiana. I feel free to say I will work among you without anything in return but good fellowship. The thought of complimenting you comes from the fact that to one who lives in Louisiana where we have sunshine the year through and rarely see snow, it seems like it has taken real men to come up here and carve out what you have wrought. I say that in real earnestness, without any contribution of potatoes. You have built some real homes and real farms and real herds of cattle, and you are producing some real potatoes and doing things in a real way. I am mighty glad to come up and shake hands with people of that kind. iWe are hoping when we put on that tour in Louisiana next spring i get a whole bunch of you down there, not only Professor Werner and r. Pedrett, but a great many others. We owe a lot to Professor Wer - r. We are indebted to him for the splendid potato seed we are plant - er in Louisana. Come and look over our country and let us show you lat manner of men we are. We do not all live on frog legs, as Pro - ssor Werner does when he is down there. I travel around quite a good deal, and your development brings to mind this thing: It does not matter where you are. If you are real men, with dynamic force in you from your shoulders up, as well as down, you can make a good country community, a good town, and a good place or anybody to live. I was in western Nebraska a few weeks ago. I ran onto Professor Werner, and I rani onto a wonderfully progressive people and commun- </seg>
            <seg id="p683">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 685 ities. That brought it all the stronger to me that it is the men who make the country, not the land or conditions generally. It makes no difference whether it is in Louisiana or Nebraska. If you have the right kind of folks, you have a real country. It is true every place I go. There are a few little differences in the method of farming in our country and here. One of them is you barn your cows and leave your grain outside; we do it the other way. It is not necessary to barn the cows in Louisiana. We have not enough winter to justify putting stock in the bam except four or five times during the entire winter when we have some northern winds with a little rain that is hard on cattle. If we do not put them in barns at such times, we have a good straw stack to let them hide behind. Where you get snow, we get rain, and rain will spoil the hay and grain, so we must barn our hay and grain. There is one other difference. In the springtime when you are shov - eling your last snow, we are shoveling the.se potatoes out of the ground. We planted them in January, and begin to dig them out in April and the early part of May. Then we start the same ground in some other crop. It has been said southern people are lazy. I want to tell you they are not, and I will show you why. We have to work all the year around, because we can grow something three hundred and sixty-five days in the year; so we do not have to work so hard as you do. If you work six months in the year, you can afford to go all the time, because the other six months you must stay in. We work twelve months. We are not lazy. We just take it a little easier. (Laughter.) As a matter of fact, even our potatoes, after they stay lor a year, become a little lazy. Some one said something about not planting our seed year after year. They are a little bit 'atev tlic second year. They get like we do. They take it slow. A difference of ten days in a market makes a lot of difference with us. It may let Florida or the Rio Grande valley in. We want the quickest potato we can get, and that is what we get up here Coming 1 from Scottsbluff this afternoon, this came to me. I think it is literally true. The alluvial land where we are raising potatoes is made up of soil that went down the Platte River into Louisiana and was deposited there. When your potatoes get down there, they recognize this old territory and wake up and go to work. They recognize they are at home. (Laughter.) We can get those potatoes out in April and May and ship them back to you folks, and this is your first greens in the springtime. I do not know what you pay for them. We get a fairly good price. We are glad to ship them to you. They are seed out of your own stock. Professor Tiebout touched on how we got into the potato business. There has been a race on between two specialists: Professor Tiebout </seg>
            <seg id="p684">686 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE and Mr. Edgerton — the former working on potatoes and the latter on sugar cane. Those lands where we plant this certified seed have been growing sugar cane for one hundred and fifty years. It is forty feet deep. Nature has a way of rebelling. As rich as those soils are, the sugar cane tonnage has been constantly dropping. I think if we nad no cane diseases probably the tonnage would be profitable yet. But mosaic and two or three other diseases have attacked the sugar cane. The planter is paying no particular attention to these things, and growing nothing but sugar cane, and these diseases have spread until sugar cane is no longer profitable. Three or four years ago when it was getting badly infected with these troubles and Prof. Edgerton was still working on his resistant varieties, Professor Tiebout introduced the first of the certified seed from this section. That introduction proved very successful. It went through the county agents to the clubs, and those demonstrations proved so conclusively certified seed from this section of the country would double the yield down there, people have gone strongly into certified seed potatoes and into the production of potatoes in that cane country. An incident of what has happened in one county. Two years ago there was one carload. The county agent, by hard work and soliciting, got the farmers to make up a carload of certified seed potatoes. Last spring that same county used thirty-two carloads, and some adjoining counties did almost as well. Those potatoes are making good. They give a good yield that is wonderfully profitable to our people. I think we will figure a rotation with Irish potatoes that will mean a great deal to our people. You only plant sugar cane every three years. It comes up in the stubble the second and third year. Planting of cane is laying the stalks down, two abreast, in the row. The land is depleted from the continuous cropping of sugar cane. It is harvested in Novem - ber and December. In January we can plant potatoes. In May we can plant a legume crop. Soy beans are largely used for this. We have an alfalfa from South Dakota that is proving successful. It gives a fine hay crop. In the fall we can have our oats in October and November. Plow under the oats and put in Irish potatoes again. In May have a crop of — say cotton or other suitable summer crop. Our friend Mallory has made five hundred and twenty bales of cot - ton on five hundred acres of land. Nothing but high class seed and good cultivation could do it. The third year, go back into sugar cane again. Dr. Edgerton has come in with a new variety of sugar cane that is disease-resisting. I think we will double our sugar cane yield. We will work this potato rotation to splendid advantage. If you do not make a thing out of your potatoes, you are getting a rotation that will be profitable. We have never raised a crop that is not profitable. When you put Irish potatoes in the market in the consuming centers of the north in April and May, folks will eat them at a profit. </seg>
            <seg id="p685">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 687 We must plant certified seed. It will give us a crop ten days earlier than home-grown seed. We must have certified seed because it has been thoroughly demonstrated as far superior to anything else. I said to some of you last summer we have had quite a lot of fellows selling "bootleg" or so-called certified seed, fellows who buy potatoes out of certified territory and tell the people, "These are from Bushnell," or "Kimball", or "Alliance", and sell them to our people who do not know the difference, and undersell your certified seed. That is hurting your market. That is one reason you can not get what you should have for your certified seed. You have people in this country doing the same thing. They are going down and soliciting business. It is working to your detriment. It is a pity because we can not get together and easily eliminate that thing, because we have had some disastrous ef - fects from this uncertified seed. One man from one of the sections was in the certified game for sev - eral years. He got careless about his certification work. The last two years in his shipments of so-called certified seed to Louisiana, they developed a tremendous lot of disease. Any disease whatever in these potatoes will revel in the warm moist soil. He has not only practically ruined his business, but he has hurt yours at the same time. I know of one district where if you talk certified seed, they will tell you it isn't worth a cent. "I have planted certified seed for three years and did not get results." Through the county agents and the industrial agents of the rail - roads and Professor Tiebouts department, we are fighting your game to put your potatoes on the market down there for what they are worth. I want to help Professor Tiebout out on his club seed contribution proposition. This year he is getting three carloads out of you folks. This is the finest piece of advertising you could arrange. The "Old North State" tobacco company, if we could get the kind of advertising you folks are getting, would not ask the price of a car load of seed potatoes. You are not getting free advertising, but it is the biggest piece of ad - vertising, backed by the Extension forces and the Government itself. It is the finest endorsement in the world, and it is only costing a few loads of potatoes. He is sending it out to thirty thousand people — all boost - ers for certified seed. With these potatoes distributed not only in one parish but over the entire state our growers will all demand certified seed. I am looking for the time when the farmer who goes to the store and will call for a tag that says "certified seed." Whether it is a gar - den plot or a commercial plot, he knows they double the yield. This very work is going to bring it. So we are wonderfully indebted to Professor Tiehout down there, and along with it, we are wonderfully - indebted to Professor Werner who started it at this end of the line. Send up something we can swear by and our planters will swear by </seg>
            <seg id="p686">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 688 that brand and buy all the seed you can produce. I do not think you need to worry about the quantity of good certified seed you will pro - duce, because I believe Louisiana will take an increasing number of bushels year by year. If you will put the brand on it, we will make it our guide by which to buy. I will call this a little pessimism, although I am an optimist. Any man who could talk to the farmers in the last few years must be an opti - mist. We have a lot of disturbing element — high taxes and high freight rates. That is where we get called down often and loudly. Agricultural products are not as high as they ought to be, and the purchasing power of the farmer's dollar is lower than it ought to be. That is true through - ut the whole United States. Tariff matters are disturbing a great many people. Immigration is vexing problem, and the assimilation of those people who are coming. All of that is coming around -to a solution. For instance, our immigra - tion problem has been largely solved in that this restricted immigration s stopping what commenced to be a tremendous overflow of undesir - ables from Europe. The happy part of that immigration law is that we can get an extra quota of farmers. An extra fifty per cent of the &gt;resent quota may be brought if they are skilled agriculturists. In Louisiana we have on the way now one hundred Germans coming to ur state under that preferred quota. We are working on the same number of Swedes. W« are trying to people Louisiana with this preferred dass of immi - grants from Europe. I feel this way: If years ago we had stopped hese fellows from coming to the cities and become everything but what they ought to be, and got them on the farms, we would have made good citizens out of them. There is something about the farm that rows good men. There are no street corners nor pool-rooms to ttract. There is a big reason why the farmers should make good itizens. The fellow who goes to the city gets mixed up with the bunch and is apt to become a bad citizen. Just the other day you noticed a big spurt in the stock and bond market. Things are looking up wonderfully all over. There will be a ot of money to do business with. It seems to me you should be get - ting a good price for wheat. Corn has gone clear out of sight. It is so ligh we can not eat corn bread any more. We are getting eight dol - ars a bag for rice, instead of four dollars. Meat products are going op. The hog market begins to look up. I does not seem to me it is possible for a man to feed this kind of corn to beef cattle and get by. hit there is hope, just the same. I understand the table potato busi - ness has been pretty discouraging. They are getting thirty-eight cents a bushel in Wisconsin for eating potatoes. If you go into the industrial centers you will see there has been very slack employment of labor. Flint, Michigan, has run 15 to 20 per cent </seg>

I think that has had a considerable effect on the market for your potatoes. Those people have been planting their own potatoes. Practically all the eastern industries are now going full force, so you will have a domestic demand for farm products you have not had here - tofore. Let us look at the European condition, starting with Austria and France and Belgium, and winding up with Germany, with the loan of millions. All is credit coming back to us. I think we may confidently expect a tremendous demand for farm products next year. In the last few months, the farmer's dollar has climbed twenty cents higher than last year, and I think in the next few months you may ex - pect to see your dollar back to par. Set your house in order and get ready for some real prosperity, because I think it is coming. I thank you. (Applause.) An interesting diversion at this time was a drill by the American Legion boys of Gering. Note: An executive session of the Nebraska Certified Potato Grow - ers Co-operative was held after the proceeding program had been rendered. Adjournment was declared until 9:30 Thursday A. M.' THURSDAY MORNING SESSION December 4, 1924 The third session of the convention met on Thursday morning, De - cember 4, and was called to order by the Vice-President, Mr. J. Pedrett, at ten o'clock. THE CHAIRMAN: First on the program this morning is a dis - cussion of practices that increase or decrease profits. Mr. Ehrman will discuss it from the standpoint of the irrigation grower. PRACTICES THAT INCREASE OR DECREASE PROFITS For the Irrigation Gxower MR. FRED EHRMAN, (Gering): Mr. Chairman, Fellow Growers, Ladies and Gentlemen: I do not know why I was called on to give you </seg>
            <seg id="p688">690 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE this talk. There are so many growers who are a good deal older in this business than I am. I have only grown potatoes for the last four years. I know there are many here who have grown potatoes for fifteen or twenty years. The subject is "Practices that Increase or Decrease Profits for the Irrigation Grower." The first point to consider, I think, is in the seed Several years ago, before I ever heard of certified seed or knew what it meant, I selected seed out of my own raising. Of course I only planted small lots — probably two or three or four acres. I picked out potatoes I thought were true to type, and the very best I haxi. I planted them, and the result often was a very poor stand. Some of the stronger tubers came up early — probably within two weeks — and the rest came up all summer. I never could tell what the trouble was I could not raise a proper crop of potatoes, so I finally quit until four years ago this coining spring, when I talked to our county agent, Phil Sheldon. He advised 6 to try some certified seed. I took his advice and went over to Kim - county with Phil and a few others. There we got hold of some d seed from Gus Forsling. I planted those potatoes about the first of June. They came up with nearly a perfect stand. Some time in August we had quite a hail storm which stripped the foliage to the stems. I thought my potato crop was ruined, but in two weeks they had their foliage back, and I had a yield of three hundred bushels per acre. The following spring I sold out practi - cally all of these potatoes — they were Triumphs — to neighbors and friends in the valley at three dollars per hundred. When my neighbors saw what price I received for* my potatoes, they started planting potatoes — any kind of potatoes — the cheaper the bet - ter, with some of them. I sold one neighbor some potatoes. He con - tracted them for his renter. I sold fifty bushels. He got about twenty - five bushels and did not come and get any more. He used my planter to plant them. When he returned the planter, there was about half a bushel of seed left in the planter box. What variety they were I do not know. I never could tell. They looked like some of these spindle tubers around here. I said to myself, "That man will never receive a crop." In the fall after he dug his potatoes he came over. I was not at home. The hired man asked him how the Dotatoes turned out. He said, "From the potatoes I got from Fred, I had a good crop. The others I did not dig at all." That has been the trouble with many of us in the past about our losses in growing potatoes. I find under irrigation that too much stress can not be laid on the quality of the seed. Under irrigation, where we can crowd the crop along, the yields are normal. First of all I think we </seg>
            <seg id="p689">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 691 shall consider quality. Quality commands the price in the market. Next we want quantity. These two factors determine whether we get a profit or loss out of our under taking. The result we get out of our other «*rops following potatoes under ir - rigation is another important factor. Usually we follow potatoes with beets. The result as a rule is all the way from five to ten tons increase per acre. So even if we do have a year, as we sometimes do, when our potatoes are nearly a total loss to us, there are other things that make up for the loss. The results we get from the crops following the beets I think make up any loss we have in potatoes. I spoke to a neighbor the other day who grew potatoes for several years, and the last year in 1921. We all know what a year it was, Practically every grower lost money on his potatoes that year. There was no sale for them whatever. This neighbor said, "I am going to grow potatoes again. The result I had from my potato-growing years ago were that I raised so many more beets, so that if I did not get any - thing out of my potatoes, I would raise enough other crops to make up for the loss." In the last four years, I have had one year when the potatoes were a total loss. That was the year I had the largest crop I had ever grown. I did not get enough to pay for digging them. But for the four years I have grown potatoes, I am quite a little ahead, anyway. My potato crop and the prices I have received the last four years average as muc&gt; or more than any other crop I raised. I thank you. (Applause.) Discussion THE CHAIRMAN: You are thoroughly convinced, if it costs a man ten dollars more an acre for certified seed, you would sooner pay that than plant cheap seed; in other words, your returns from the good seed would make you more than ten dollars an acre more? MR. EHRMAN: Yes, sir. THE CHAIRMAN: On the same subject we will listen to Mr. Thomas. MR. CARL THOMAS, (Morrill): Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gen - tlemen: I don not feel that I have much to say on this subject since Mr. Ehrman got through. He covered the territory very well. The subject is "Practices that Increase or Decrease Profits, for the Irrigation Of course every time we can increase the yield and keep up our quality or improve it, our profits are bound to be larger; or if we can increase the quality, even with lowering the yield, we are bound to in - crease our profits. </seg>
            <seg id="p690">692 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE I will say this one thing about seed, from the experience I have had. never have failed with certified seed. It has always done as well or better than other seed. But under careful selection out of good stock, person can get irrigated seed that will do as well as the other, some - mes. The main thing to look out for is spindle tuber. I would not ad - ise anybody to plant seed, no matter how good the potatoes look, if lere is a large percentage of spindle tuber in it; because it will show up 1 you do not plant any of it. It is communicated from one plant to an - ther. If there is any amount of it in the lot, it is bound to affect all f them. The selection of the soil is one subject with which I have had quite little experience. Under irrigation, we usually plant on alfalfa or weet clover ground. On alfalfa ground with good seed, we practically [ways have a good crop. I had an experience in 1922 when I planted two ots of potatoes with practically the same kind of seed. One was treat - ed with corrosive sublimate, and the other I did not. I harvested these two crops, and the one I had treated came out clean stock. The other howed some scab. It was not bad — perhaps 15 or 20 per cent. In 1922 planted the field to barley and sweet clover; pastured it; broke it up the fore part of June and planted to potatoes. This ground with the scab in 1922 came out scabby this year. The ground clean in 1922 was lean this year. I reaped the benefit of treating my seed potatoes in 922, this year. I am convinced that any ground with scab should not be planted with potatoes for a period of at least four years, and I think six years is even better. Sweet clover ground is good for potatoes providing it has not had diseased potatoes prior to the time it was planted to sweet clover. As to the planting, I have had the best luck plowing the ground late and planting late. I commence plowing the 25th of May, and commence Wanting the 10th of June. It will produce a larger yield and cleaner stock of potatoes, as a rule, than the earlier planting. In 1924 I am of he opinion some of the earlier planting produced better than the later. As a rule the late planting is the best practice in this country. As to plowing the ground, I have come to the conclusion the shallow plowing is best. By that I mean four or five inches. I used to plow a foot deep and make it hard to irrigate and cultivate, and I could not notice any advantage. In cultivating, it is not good practice to culti - vate deep. The planting, of course, should be done about the tenth of bl practice one thing I do not know whether any one here follows or The ground practically has no slope. I irrigate every other row, never irrigate the dry rows. I leave them dry throughout the </seg>
            <seg id="p691">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 693 season. This leaves a dry space on one side that never bakes as the ir - rigated side will. On flat ground, I think that is a good practice. If it has very much slope, I advise him to leave it alone. When it comes to harvesting the potatoes, I do not know whether there is any one here who has tried the new type of machine or not. It is called the Zabel-Getty potato picking machine, from Minnesota. These machines are very successful, in my opinion. There are a few people who are disappointed with the use of them. They were especially successful on the smaller yields. On a yield of four hundred bushels, they would waste some potatoes. As cheap as potatoes have been, the loss is small. It does not bruise the potatoes. It has a churning method that will loosen the soil considerably. In taking them out of the bin they have no bruises and are in a much better condition than under the ordinary method of picking in wagon boxes. While the marketing of potatoes has a great effect on increasing or decreasing the profits on potatoes, I shall not dwell on it now, as I understand tomorrow is the day marketing is going to be discussed.' We have an Association at Morrill that is working successfully at the pres - ent time. I thank you. (Applause.) PRACTICES THAT INCREASE OR DECREASE PROFITS FOR THE DRY LAND GROWER THE CHAIRMAN: You have heard the opinions of two irrigated growers. Now we will call on the dry-land farmers. We have one with us who is a very successful certified seed grower from Bushnell. I will introduce to you Mr. Gadeken: MR. AUGUST GADEKEN, (Bushnell): Ladies and Gentlemen and Fellow Growers: When I first received Mr. Werner's letter in which he said, "I want you to give a talk on who is making money and who is not," I stopped to think for quite a while what he wanted me to talk on. I could not help but think back some years ago when I heard Professor Hibbard of the Iowa Agricultural College talk. He gave an illustration of which farmer was making money and which was not. He put it something like this: "The farmer's profit is always equal to the difference between his judgment and the judgment of the poor - est farmer." Maybe his judgment is better on his crop lines or selling lines, or having better seed. Any way, all through, his judgment is better than that of the poorest farmer. The poorest man's profits amount to nothing. He must drop out from production. </seg>
            <seg id="p692">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 694 Coming to the dry-land seed production, or dry-land farming, the main thing is our potatoes and what we have been doing with them. I have been growing potatoes, I think, about six years; in fact, I shipped E first carload of certified potatoes out of Kimball County. The versity did not have any tags and I used my own tags, and we nped them at home to be certified seed. They went to Dallas, Texas. The question is, "Who is the most successful, and who is making money out of it?" There are a good many things to take up. Crop rotation comes in there. In raising the seed, the soil becomes infected with disease, and it is only every five or six years we can raise a crop of potatoes on dry land. There is usually a lot of disease left behind that will come into the potatoes in the following years. Of course the selection of good seed has a whole lot to do with it. These irrigated fellows can readily go to certified seed and choose something that is better than their own. When we come into new - seed, we have quite a different factor . It is not so easy. I have been experimenting along certain lines. I tried Wisconsin seed — raised it for three years — the Smith brand of Wisconsin. While it was free from disease, finally the yield was not as big as that of my own stock. We finally concluded our own stock was a good deal better. I have had an experimental plot of certain strains on my place for quite a number of years, and I always bought the best I could get. I tried out one year the Russet Rural and some Rural New Yorkers and different strains of Triumphs. This year I tried out a patch of Cobblers. Every two years I try a patch of Downings. The Cobblers I have this year made a fairly good yield, but I honestly believe they went out of the field and hunted scab! They are so scabby the hogs wont' eat them. They did not produce marketable seed. I shall try to treat the best of these and see if they won't do better next year. In going further into production methods, there is a big factor always left in the marketing. The market changes a good deal, and it has always been a big problem for me. I have done my own selling and have been quite successful. I do not believe everybody had had quite the success in selling I have had. It is to be hoped the organi - zation we have formed here will be successful and take that part from the grower; so he will have more time to devote to his crop production, and he can increase his yield per acre and also lessen disease more than heretofore has been possible. I have prepared some tables as to what it costs me to raise my stuff, and also to bring out whether potatoes are a competitive crop, and what other crops compete with them, that we may make money oat of it. I will give what I figure they cost me. Starting with certified seed — the 1924 crop. I put it on the </seg>

It germinated and came up about the same time as the potatoes did, and it caused quite a good deal of trouble. We had to go through twice with a hoe and try to clean it out. The culti- vator would get them in the row, but there was a lot between the rows and around the hills, and there would have been enough competition so that the potatoes would not yield. The second time we went through, we did quite a little roguing. Expenses to Produce an Acre of Potatoes. In the operation, the first thing is the cost of the application for the certification on the acre basis. That is the easiest way to get at it.

For sorting, I figure 15 per cent, the potatoes are not bruised and fairly good quality, and that in- cludes careful handling, I figure I can make out on 15 per cent. Some years it has run considerably more. On the average, this year I do not believe it will run much over 15 per cent. Taking 25 per cent out of the yield leaves 37% bushels of marketable potatoes off an acre. Figuring these at $2.50 per hundred gives me a net income per acre of $56.25 Deducting expenses of 46.65 leaves me a net profit of $ 9.60 That makes a cost per bushel to produce those potatoes of $1.24, and a profit per bushel of 26 cents. It looks rather serious when we have to spend $1.24 a bushel in order to get a profit of 26 cents. Last year there was quite a little difference. We had a bigger yield. Our price was not as high as this year, although I figured $1.90 per hundred last year. Last year my average yield of marketable potatoes off the certified ground ran about 75 bushels per acre. This made a gross income per acre of $85.50. The expenses, on account of increased yield, increased picking, sorting, and sacks, were $54.15, leaving a net income of $31.35 per acre. That made a production cost of 72 cents per bushel, or a net profit per bushel of 42 cents. It looks a little better; but last year we had a total failure in our wheat, while our potatoes had to pay our loss on wheat. I think, in round numbers, my entire loss on wheat amounted to $1500 on about 400 acres. I prepared figures on wheat this year. Take our winter wheat, the first thing on summer fallow. It takes pretty nearly two years' operation to make a crop of winter wheat on summer fallow. Expenses to produce an Acre of Wheat, Summer fallowing $ 2.50 (I do not charge as much as plowing for potatoes, because we do not do it as deeply, and do not use as much gas or oil.) Two harrowings at 25 cents .50 Seed .50 Seed wheat per acre figured at $1 per bushel .75 Binding and harvesting per acre 3.00 Hauling to market 1.25 Taxes and interest on land 4.40 $12.90 </seg>

I do not allow for that, because there usually isn't any.) I figure my average yield this year at 25 bushels altho most of it ran over 25 bushels. Gross income $25.00 Total expenses per acre_ $12.90 Net income $12.10 That makes the production cost per bushel 50 cents, and the net profit per bushel 48 cents. The profit is larger per bushel than on potatoes, because we have 48 cents as compared with 33 cents. Following that, usually the ground is seeded back to wheat, so I have made a list of stubble wheat. Cost to Produce an Acre of Stubble Wheat. This is a per bushel cost of 58 cents, and a per bushel profit of 42 cents. On corn this year we fared a little better.

Your method is probably quite a little different. Discussion. Q. How does the potato ground planted to wheat compare with summer fallowing? A. I used to put in wheat on potato ground and I found out the yield per acre does not run very high. I never got over six or eight bushels. I always need oats for feed, so I used the potato ground for oats the following year . Several years the oats were so short I could not cut them with the binder. One year I cut them with the mower and ran in wind rows. We have trouble with the Russian thistle. If you get your oats in early, they get ahead of the Russian thistle. If you put them in late and have a little dry spell, I do not care how much work you do on the ground — whether you double disc it two or three times — the thistle is always there. If you have a little dry spell, the Russian thistle will have the ground, and you will raise more thistles than oats. There is another factor that comes in, in ground that has been in otatoes, and that is an erosion by dust blowing in the winter. The winds pile the ground up like sand dunes, and half of it has traveled o your neighbor's. When you come with a crop on that, the ground is hard and you must plow up the subsoil. It takes three years' time o get the ground back in shape. Last year I had good success with barley. I think it will make a more competitive crop on the potato ground than any other crop. It makes good hog feed. I ran it through a grinder and mixed oats with it and put it in a self-feeder for hogs. They eat all the time. Q. When we put a crop in the ground, we take a certain risk. How do these crops you have mentioned compare in safety to the pro - ducer? Is your potato crop a safer crop — a surer crop — than your corn for you? A. It runs about nip and tuck. You can have failures in corn, </seg>
            <seg id="p697">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 699 and you can have failures in potatoes. A man should have overhead. I do not know of any other way of getting it than when you have a real good year to lay away part of your profit. Put it in the land bank or somewhere so you will have it in the lean years. I do not see why a man should not be entitled to an overhead. Q. Has not this year's crop, not only in Kimblall County, but throughout the western part of Nebraska, been practically a failure? A. I can not say that. I have always managed to make a living. I have, besides my crops, my cattle. We milk quite a few cows each winter. We have potatoes. If wheat is a failure, my potatoes are usually good, and vice versa. It is almost impossible to hit me in such a way as to cut me out altogether so that I have to live one year off the other year. Q. Of these crops you mention, which do you regard the safest? A. I believe potatoes are, although I can say one year my potatoes made seven bushels to the acre; but that year I was unfortunate. I had a field of potatoes, and about harvest time a streak of hail came up without any rain. The potatoes were dry and the vines quite big. It slashed those vines right and left, and they bled to death. That is the only failure I have known in potatoes, although I have had several low yields. If a man works his potatoes and keeps the weeds out, and gets them in early so that one can list on top of it and works the ground down so that one has a solid seed bed, if one does not get rain while the potatoes are growing, one will have potatoes. Q. How many years have you farmed in this country? A. Eight years. Q. People who have farmed for thirty years have had several fail ures. MR. GADEKEN: I thank you. (Applause.) THE CHAIRMAN: We have another grower from Kimball County. As I told you yesterday, I am right in the middle, with good potato growers on each side. We will call on Mr. Peterson, from Dix. Practices That Increase or Decrease Profits for the Dry-Land Grower. MR. PETRUS PETERSON, (Dix): Mr. Chairman, Fellow Growers, Ladies and Gentlemen: I always thought I was a friend of Mr. Werner, but since I got the letter from him two weeks ago, it seems to me he must have a grudge against me to ask me to come up here and talk to you today. I feel like the boy who ran away from home. He grew homesick and was trying to figure out some excuse for returning. He could not. </seg>
            <seg id="p698">700 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE It is the same with me. I could think of no excuse except to stay away, and I did not want to do that. In talking about potatoes I am somewhat confused, because you have heard my neighbor from Kimball County speaking about the best crop. In the nine years I have been in the state of Nebraska, it is the only crop I have raised that has netted me a profit above the cost of production. It has never failed in nine years. We often brag in this country of the wonderful wheat we have. t is one of our great crops. We will have to admit the last few years t has not been virtually able to pay the cost of production, let alone profit. I often think — especially this fall as I have driven about a ot over Kimball County and talked with practically every grower in le county, and have seen these fertile fields so adapted to the pro - uction of potatoes and especially seed potatoes — it is a wonder we do grow more of them as a side line. I think the farmer should have rom five to twenty acres. They can handle it easily without incon - eniencing their other farm crops. The question has been so often asked of me, "Does it really pay to produce certified seed?" It seems to me there is consensus of opinion among so many potato growers that the cost of raising certi - fied seed and the work which must be put on it are so exorbitant as to take up the extra profit we get by having a larger price. I thought I might interest you today by talking on the subject of cost of production plus a profit on the certified seed and uncertified seed. In doing that, I selected a field of potatoes close to Dix, of thirty acres, not that our yield was large or that they were especially attended to, to produce the crop, but because we had a complete record of all the labor and cost of everything. I have figured an average of what it would cost if it had been uncertified seed, and what we got for them. If you will bear with me a little while, I will put up a crude chart on which I have put the estimates. Cost of Production of 30 Acres of Potatoes Certified Seed Uncertified Seed Che first cost I have put lown is plowing. I think have made a radical mis - take in dry land.

The cost of the certified seed was $1253.30, leaving a net profit of $1030.20 on certified seed, but only $284 if it had not been certified. In other words, there is a net profit in favor of certified seed of $746.20 on 30 acres. You see from that it pays to be in the certified game. I have been in it for three years, and have noticed if it were not for using certified seed and being in the business, it would not be a paying proposi - tion with me. By the time you figure rent on land, there would be very little left. I am like some of the city people: if I have to farm, I like to have a little profit. I thank you. (Applause.)

DETERMINING FACTORS IN POTATO PRODUCTION. E. R. Bennett, Field Horticulturist, University of Idaho, Boise Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: I am sorry I have not been able to hear the discussions all through. I have not gotten the drift of the meeting so far. I would like to know where things are drifting so as to know what not to say sometimes. However, this morning while I have been judging, I have been a little like the boy in "The Hoosier School - master," when he said he was eating pie with one eye and keeping his other eye on the problem. So I have been scoring potatoes with one eye and listening to you with the other. I think the previous speaker has stolen quite a lot of my thunder. I do not know as I can say anything new to you. There is not anything new in potato work, although there are a lot of things new to me. I find new things every year, and find things true the year before that are not true now. . I have been in the work so long I have come to the point where I think maybe nothing is true. We have been fortunate in Idaho in the past, and I guess we will be in the future, in that we have a high freight rate. The result is we can not grow potatoes except as we grow these high yields and high quality that your sub station superintendent has told you about. The man in Idaho who grows potatoes of poor yield and quality might as well quit </seg>
            <seg id="p701">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 703 first as last. We have to have high yields and high quality. I guess from the advertising we have had indirectly, you have seen our potatoes are being advertised in the east. The restaurants are advertising Idaho baked potatoes. That is because we have had to do it, not because we have had better people or land. We thought perhaps we had better con - ditions, but since I have had to judge this stuff, I have concluded some - thing is wrong, since it is all grown in the same fields by the same man. I have had to juggle scores to get somebody ahead. When they are all scoring around 99.5 it is a little difficult. I do not think you got them from the same land and same man and bin, but they are all high grade, which indicates a good many of you have learned the trick. I say to some of our farmers, "I do not care whether you grow po - tatoes or not. We are growing too many potatoes." On the other hand, we are like the man in Texas telling me about the cotton business. When they had a low yield of cotton they got more money than from a high yield. They called a big mass meeting at Fort Worth to cut the acreage of cotton and increase their income. They had thousands of people there from all over the state. They decided to go home, and each promised to cut his cotton acreage in two. The next year they had the biggest cotton crop in the world. (Laughter.) Each man went home and increased his acreage. These things are nice in theory, but won't work in practice. The factors of successful potato growing are two: getting high yield and high quality. The. factors that produce these two things are the same. The man with high yield usually gets high quality. Other things being equal, you will have high yield if you have high quality. To me the whole problem for every grower is to solve that proposition. The preceding speaker told you a part of what is the matter, a lack of rota - tion of crops. There is no use putting potatoes on land that won't make a high yield. It will be accidental if you make the cost of production. It will be because back east they did not get a crop. What are these factors? I am going to talk upon the knowledge I have gained in Colorado and Idaho on factors of production. If I say anything that sounds theoretical here, all you have to do is- to try it out if you believe me. I may tell you things true in Idaho that are not true here, but generally the principles of production are the same wherever you go. I think you will agree that the first big factor in production is the seed. Without good seed you have no hope. We are living in a different day than twenty years ago in regard to seed. The old growers try to follow it yet in Idaho, and I presume it is true here. In Idaho Falls, for instance, a great many of the growers — particularly the poorer growers — take their stock to town and sell it in wagon-load lots to the dealers. They take it to the warehouse to be sorted over, the number one's taken out; and all from two to six or seven ounces that are nice and smooth are their seed. It is taken and sold in the lower country. </seg>
            <seg id="p702">704 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE They got by pretty well with it a few years ago. They began to find that stuff did not produce the yield it should. We got "limber neck" in the lower country. They would be taller than the others, but spindley and tipped over. The lower leaves would drop off. We got so we recognized what was the trouble. The pathologists got busy and called it "mosaic" tWe also had leaf roll in the same way. There may be from 10 to 50 cent of that condition. The healthy plants would produce big pota - s, but there would not be any tubers in those leaf roll hills. One of our good seed men two years ago, in selecting his potatoes, old his men whenever they found ideally shaped tubers to save them by &gt;emselves. The next summer when I went into his field to inspect it — I enerally strike the poor field first, — I found possibly 2 per cent of what we thought mosaic. I had a bunch of fellows with me. We began to get ired and it was late. We went to the other farm. I said, "Fellows, I am going so say I am either seeing things that ain't so, or else there is more mosaic in this field. "What about this?" He kind of grinned. I said to the other fellows, "Do you see more mosaic?" "I believe there is." "There is about 4 per cent instead of 2 per cent. What is your an - swer?" "This is from select seed. These are those real fancy, smooth shal - low-eyed potatoes. The others are the deeper eyed rougher stuff." In picking out his prettiest stuff, he had increased the amount of mo - saic. Those fellows are picking out seed and selling to growers, and frequently growing as high as 90 per cent of mosaic in the fields. The result is our growers do not like that kind of seed any more. That is where certification come in. Our dealers do not like it. It has spoiled one of their best games. They saw a good, profitable game of sorting over their stuff. Sometimes the farmer would get the same seed he took in, but the other fellow picked it over. The day is past when that can be considered seed. The day of certified seed is here to stay — no ques - tion about that. I have had people say, "That is just a fad. When I was a boy we did not have this sort of thing." When I was a boy in Michigan we used the culls for seed. You can not do it now. We must grow seed and know it is right. When you ask, "What is good seed?" I do not know. A man will send me some stuff from several places by parcel post and want to know if.it is good seed. I got one a while ago. I wrote back: "I received your potatoes and your letter. It looks good. I do not know whether it is good seed or not. I do not know anything about it, and you do not </seg>
            <seg id="p703">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 705 know. Going into the bin, you do not know whether it is good, bad, or indifferent. I can take you out in Idaho and show you a carload of seed, and you would say if you looked it over "It is pretty seed." It is mosaic stuff." Your disease of spindle tuber we have not recognized yet. But they are here, and here to stay. Three years ago I was at a point I was afraid mosaic was going to get us. Now I do not believe it. Our men who are roguing, isolating, and doing the work write it isn't do - ing any harm. We have not had a legitimate kick on certified potatoes in the last five years. Some one will say, "I do not think much of the certified potatoes. I planted them last spring and they were the poorest stuff I have had in years." "What is the trouble?" "Everything." "Who grew those potatoes?" "I do not know. I got them of So-and-So." "Well, you should know who grew them. What kind of a tag did they have?" He would kind of stall "There was a tag?" "Yes." "What color was it?" He begins to evade — he has no case "Whose name was on the potatoes, and what percentage of diseaso on that tag?" "I don't remember." "There wasn't any tag on it at all, was there?" "I think there was." "You did not have certified potatoes. If you had had certified potatoes you would have known all about it. The tag is on the sack. Even if they passed second inspection, you would have had a memo - randum. The trouble is you bought potatoes that were not certified at all. They were bootleg stuff." We get a lot of that because our people refuse to learn the differ - «nce between certified and uncertified stock. Somebody tells them, "I </seg>
            <seg id="p704">706 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE lave certified potatoes." He made up a thousand sacks and sold fifty lousand sacks on the strength of it. Some of our people bite every ear. The majority of them do not. I do not think we have had generally any kick in certified potatoes. Maybe you have "witches &gt;room" in Triumph. If you look at it, if it sprouts in the bin, it will lave little fine sprouts. The sprouts keep coming up all the time. hey produce little potatoes. This year we have had some of that tock, and it was sold in the Yakima country in Washington. This ear when harvest time came we heard them holler about their seed. knew there was some "witches broom" in it. We went to investigate the matter. The fellow who sold them went to see about it. This was Bliss Triumph. He said, "How much does it yield?" "Close to one hundred sacks in the acre." "What did your local stuff yield?" "About one-half as much." "I do not think you have any legitimate kick coming. You may have a little trouble, but when you are making practically twice as much in yield and more than as much in money, you have no kick com - ing." In taking stuff from the higher districts to the lower where mosaic is bad, we expect to get some trouble. If Louisiana does not have more than 10 or 15 per cent trouble from your seed, they should not kick much. I know from local seed, in places in the east they are getting 50 per cent trouble. We cannot expect our certified seed to give 100 per cent results. As a general proposition, it comes along pretty good. I rather suspect it might be profitable to you people to tell you omething of the methods we are recommending. We are pretty rbitrary over there. We direct what to do in order to grow certified seed. I do not think our regulations there are quite as strong as in le central and eastern states; but I believe we are living up to them more closely — in fact, I know we are. We say, "If you are going to certify stock potatoes, they must be between two and twelve ounces; e free from cuts and bruises and mechanical injury; they must be free rom rhizoctonia within 12 per cent, and from scab the same; free from usarium infection, within 5 per cent; they must not have bumps, and most be of the right type." We are giving a leeway of 12 per cent. In a field inspected a few days ago there were good Ohio's. The man grading did not rave any in - terest and was putting in poor stuff. They thought they would get a tag, and said so. I picked out one hundred potatoes and found five with mechanical injury — marks of the fork; two were under size, and a </seg>
            <seg id="p705">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGIUCCLTrRK 707 couple had rhizoctonia. Before I got through, the man said, "How many will you take out of the one hundred?" I got out eleven. I said, "You had better cut down a little closer than that. If it goes to 13 per cent you are clone." You would have said those potatoes were pretty fine stock, and yet 2 per cent leeway is not very much. If you shut your eyes arid let 25 per cent of rhizoctonia go through, it is a different proposition. We do not do it. If we are going to put a tag on, we want it right. Most of our certified seed — so-called — is not certified seed, but 95 per cent of it is what we call "second inspection" potatoes. They passed the first and second field inspections. At the end of the season I have sent each man a memorandum of inspection s!:c^ ing that it has been inspected and has passed two field inspections and is eligible to certification when sorted to meet specifications Most of our dealers say, "I do not care about the tag on the sack. I want to know that there is no serious trouble in the field." If you rogue your field thoroughly, there is no use cf sorting it in the bins. You sort it in two piles, and ycur pcor pile will get as good results. Our bin selecting does not get us anywhere. It is the field work that. does the trick. We are getting a little "hard-boiled." We recommend that they use big seed pieces — not less than two ounces, and preferably four, and sometimes more. We prefer whole potatoes. We want them plenty large and plant late. There is a difference of ?even hundred miles between the north and south territory with us. The lower dis - trict late planting means after the Fourth of July. In some places late planting means the first or second week in June. When we first did this, the fellows said, "It will cut our yield, and we know it." "Yes, I suspect it will. We want them immature and smooth." Lots of them would not do it. A few tried it out, and said, "It didn't cut my yield, by planting late." The point is if you plant late, your potato — take our Russet — will keep growing through the dry and hot weather. About the last of August it turns cold and we usually get some rains, and our potatoes begin to form and grow rapidly. Whether they get big or not, they are gocd shape. In Canyon County, they put in potatoes late and found the first smooth potatoes they had grown in years, and just as good a yield as before. With the Gem we can get good potatoes. Our reputation in Idaho is in the high-priced markets in the east. The reputation is based on the Gem (Russet Burbank). If it grows too long it gets pointed near the stem end and gets bumps on it. If planted late, we get away from. that. The demand is for Gem potatoes </seg>
            <seg id="p706">708 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE that are smooth. We can sell them, no matter how many potatoes any - body else grows. We are getting better seed. There is little chance of a man not etting by if he plants big potatoes, and plants late. I said, "I want ou to plant farther apart." In the Burley district, there is loose, eep soil and the potatoes get big. They got to planting them seven inches apart in order to cut the potatoes down in size. You can not rogue and can not select that way. I said, "I want you to plant your otatoes eighteen and twenty inches apart." "Heavens, Bennett! You will have potatoes as big as your head! y will be unmarketable." "I want you to plant big potatoes and put them far apart." You know the number of tubers in the hill is determined by the number of stems in the hill. You get more potatoes with five stems than one stem — greater numbers, but not as large potatoes. You can put it down as law the number of potatoes is determined by the number of stems in the hill, other things being equal. The number of stems is determined by the size of the seed piece. I got fooled this year. We cut our potatoes in big pieces and got ne stem coming up. Digging around, we found the trouble was it as beastly hot and dry when planted, and the potatoes began to rot rom the cut surface within thirty-six hours. We got the same results as if we had dug out the eyes and planted them. All we had to do as to plant big pieces. The boys tried it at Greeley. They planted two- ounce pieces and found an average of three and one-fourth pounds to the hill. I said, "That is good certified stuff, but pretty big." e said, "Wait a minute." We went to another part of the field and ound eight to twelve in the hill, some of them as high as eleven pounds — an average of over six pounds to the hill. They were six-ounce otatoes planted whole. Our dry-land fellows in the cut-over lands must do something to keep from starving to death, and potatoes are their best bet. Any man who needs stock food can not lose growing potatoes, because he can always get his cost of production by feeding stock. If you have eighty acres, you can not do it. If you have ten acres, you should feed all your low-grade potatoes to the stock. They are worth seventy cents per hundred for that purpose in Idaho. I recommend planting these by hand, not with the planter. I would rather they would leave the planter alone. I want them to get their land in good shape and plant them on a square thirty inches apart each way. Put in a big piece of potato in each check corner, and five inches deep into good, moist soil. If you have uniform potatoes of that size, 99 per cent will come up and make good, big, thrifty plants. </seg>
            <seg id="p707">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 709 If there is a plant that is weak or diseased, you can see it. There is no alibi. If you have uniform, big pieces, the hill is either good, or isn't. If not up to the standard of the rest of them, take it out. It simplifies roguing. We require them to use big pieces and plant far - ther apart, and they are getting on a basis where it is working out nicely. We are requiring also that our stuff shall be planted on land that has not been in potatoes the previous year. In some of our land, the potato becomes the worst weed we have. It snows in Idaho, and stays on until the next spring, and every potato as big as a pea will come up the next year and make a weed. There would be a dozen potatoes to the square foot. I have turned down some fields. I said, "I can not certify it." We want our potatoes at least one hundred yards from any other potatoes in order to keep away from contamination. You may have seen some of the demonstrations. They were bone-head demonstrations. One man put in twelve acres of stuff in a new field. He ran out of seed and did not want to pay two dollars, so he said, "I have some in the bin that look just as good. I will plant twelve rows of them." The field with the good seed was a fine stand — uniform and good market stock. We went to the twelve rows and found he had something like 3 per cent of good plants, and the rest were bad. There was every - thing you could think of in them. He said, "That won't get my seed back." I said, "I do not need to say anything. You have learned your les - son." He was convinced and said, "I will plant good seed after this." Another man had some stuff with .good and poor seed in the same field. There was a difference of fifty to sixty sacks to the acre. An official in the State House had been growing good potatoes for years. He said, "I did not realize there was much to this game. I sent up and got a bunch of your certified seed. It did not look any better than mine. I did not believe it was. I got fifty sacks to the acre more pota - toes from yours than I did from the other seed, and they will grade bet - ter. Me for certified seed!" I get these demonstrations all the time. Here is an instance about the dry-land fellows about Pocatello. They have quite a high altitude and have been growing wheat for years. They are not getting big yields. They were supposed to plow in the fall. One man got all plowed but four or five acres in the middle of the field. This spring he plowed it and conserved the moisture, but he did not have much to conserve. He put potatoes in and most of them came up. The first inspection, they looked more or less alike. The second inspection, the county agent and I were digging in the middle of the field. He had a </seg>
            <seg id="p708">710 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE half a pound to the hill — no good. The county agent said, "He has fallen down badly." I said, "I do not believe it is as bad as this. We are in that spring - plowed ground." We got out of it. In a few rods we went to digging and found two and one-half pounds to the hill — a difference between spring and fall plowing. If you fall plow to conserve your moisture, then disc or harrow in the spring, you can hold it. We have been doing it over there. Then plant your potatoes the last of June — nothing growing on it. Put them a good depth and a good ways apart; harrow before they are up and after they are up, until they get so big you are afraid the neighbors will take you to the insane asylum if you continue. Then it is time to quit harrowing and go to cultivating. They have saved moisture enough to get good crops. A seed company at Moscow was trying to get good seed. They rented land two years ago and put in potatoes. They are a firm and I can abuse them and get by with it. They wanted to know what I thought of the potatoes. "If you plow your ground and quit planting your seed with a grain drill and use some decent 'seed, you may get by with it. If you are going to do this, why don't you get some land, plow it and get it in shape, and keep it in good shape until planting time, plant a good dis - tance apart, and I believe you can get some potatoes." Most fellows won't follow instructions. These fellows did. They tut in Ohio's. They were good uniform stuff a long ways apart, and five lundred feet above the valley. They work three sides of the land in E country. They had no rain in the spring nor during the growing on, but had a little rain in August. They got fifty-five sacks to the of as pretty Ohio's as these we have over here — not so big. That as without moisture — simply moisture held in winter time (that soil is trobably one hundred feet deep), under the most adverse conditions you ould imagine for potato growing. 1 have come to the conclusion it is up to the man. I have also come to the conclusion, after running around Idaho for eight years, that we do not know how to irrigate. That may be a broad statement. On our irrigated land, our Gems are always rough. We have one district that sub-irrigates, and the Gems are nearly all smooth. We have some places where the Gems are smooth where I find sub-land. If potatoes on sub-land planted in the old way come smooth, and on irrigat - ed land do not, what is the trouble? I believe it is this: We have not learned to irrigate. Sub-land means there is water underneath, and that keeps constant moisture on the potatoes. There are a good many times that the potatoes are too wet or too dry. I can not tell you how often to irrigate — maybe every three days, and maybe every two weeks. It may be putting water in every other row. The irrigation will depend on the contour of your land. If it is flat, it means a big ditch, and pushing </seg>
            <seg id="p709">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 711 the water across quickly. If it is steep, it means a shallow ditch and watering longer. Sometimes we have land where we irrigate for seventy- The point is this: If we are going to get by, we must have our land irrigated in such a way as to keep that same condition — less irrigation, and oftener. Pretty nearly every man I have seen irrigating is not doing that. You must irrigate to keep the moisture down, and then dig into a row to findout whether the moisture is there. Irrigate before it is gone. If we irrigate every three to five days and keep water underneath, we would approximate the condition we are getting in our sub-lands. In production of Gems, it is a matter of good land, and then keeping the moisture and temperature constant, as far as we can. I thank you. (Applause.) Adjournment was then declared until 1:30 P. M THURSDAY AFTERNOON SESSION. December 4, 1924. The Fourth Session of the Convention was called to order by President Phelps at two o'clock on Thursday afternoon. THE PRESIDENT: The nominating committee is not ready to report so we will have the first number following that and have the business session as soon as they can report. I shall call on Mr. Edmundson, Superintendent of the Colorado Potato Experiment Station at Greeley, Colorado. (Applause.) W. C. Edmundson, Greeley, Colorado. Mr. Werner invited me to come to Nebraska and talk to you about our experimental work. The last time I attended your meeting I talked to dry land farmers on irrigation problems. This time Mr. Werner assured me that there would be more growers interested in irrigation problems than at the other meeting. I will give you some of the re - sults of our experimental work. While I am talking I hope you will feel free to ask questions. If you do not believe some things I have to say or if you have opinions entirely different, or if I do not make my ideas clear I wish you would interrupt me at any time. The first experiment which I wish to discuss is called the "Running Out Experiment." I feel (in some ways) we do not know exactly the causes of potatoes running out. It may be it is because they are diseased or it may be that a great many of our potatoes produce low yields be - cause of unfavorable climatic or soil conditions. </seg>
            <seg id="p710">RKPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 712 We started this experiment with two varieties, the Pearl and the Rural. We were unable to keep the Pearl from running: out. With the Rural our efforts have met with considerable success. We have been growing: the same strain for the past ten years. We plant no other Rural seed at the station except to compare with our strain. The Rural is producing just as well as when we started the experiment and we sell 800 or 400 sacks of this seed to the growers each year. Growers report that this seed is fully as satisfactory as the best seed they have shipped in from northern states. This year one grower received 100 bushels more from this strain of seed than from his own selected seed. Another grower reports a yield of 460 bushels per acre. Perhaps the Rural is particularly adapted to the type of soil on which it is grown. The Rural foliage makes it a good hot weather variety. It is one of the best va - rieties to withstand heat and perhaps that is why it does well in the Greeley district. Irrigation The irrigation studies are being conducted along the following lines: (a) Irrigating the land prior to planting when conditions seem to warrant. (b) Irrigating up the newly planted crop, (c) Withholding the first application until the growing of the plant is checked. Applying water as nearly as possible according to the general ctice in the Greeley district. (e) Applying water as the plants require it throughout the grow - ing season to maintain a vigorous growth. Owing to seasonal conditions it is impossible to conduct all phases of lis experiment in any one year. The summers of 1919 and 1922 were ry and hot, making it necessary to irrigate up to secure a good strain; hile in 1920, 1921 and 1923 the weather was cooler and there was suffi - ent moisture in the soil to insure a good germination. In normal years lere is sufficient moisture in the soil to germinate the seed and produce rong sturdy plants. But it sometimes becomes necessary, owing to in - ufficient winter precipitation or to hot spring weather and drying winds, c irrigate up or to supply moisture to facilitate germination. Where good-sized seed has been planted it will be found that the sets will sprout ithout soil moisture, but roots will not form unless moisture in the soil omes in contact with the sprout. Therefore, it is essential that where water is applied to aid germination it should come in contact with the seed piece. From our work and from numerous observations, it is be - ieved that this can best be done by running water through a shallow urrow. The deep furrow which is used for later irrigations to supply </seg>
            <seg id="p711">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 713 water to the deep feeding roots will usually be found to be too deep for conveying water for this particular purpose. Many fields were visited in 1919 and 1922 where growers had irrigated up but failed to get a good stand because the water never reached sufficient height in the soil to be available to the young plants. The frequently irrigated plots usually receive the first application of water about the time the stolen growth first starts. This is usually be - tween the 6th and 10th of July, when the planting has been done about the first week in June. The normal or check plots are usually irrigated between the 20th and 30th of July, the time of the first application of water depending on the moisture content of the soil. The plots which may be called late irrigated are not watered until the vines begin to suffer for lack of moisture. This condition is manifested by the darken - ing of the foliage and a wilting of the upper leaves. In 1919 the plots that received the early irrigation gave an average yield of 256.78 bushels per acre, while the plots that were not irrigated until the plants began to suffer for water gave an average yield of 151.5 bushels per acre, or a difference of 105.28 bushels per acre in favor of the early irrigation. In 1920 the plots which received the early irrigation gave an average yield of 267.11 bushels per acre, while the late irrigated plots gave an agerage yield of 228.15 bushels per acre, or a difference of 38.96 bushels per acre in favor of the early irrigation. In 1921 the early irrigated plots gave an average yield of 329.31 bu - shels per acre, while the plots not irrigated until late in the season gave an average yield of 231.06 bushels per acre, or 98.25 bushels per acre in favor of the early irrigated plots. In 1922 the early irrigated plots gave an average yield of 382.53 bushels per acre, while the late irrigated plots yielded 297 bushels per acre or 86.53 bushels per acre less than the early irrigated plots. In 1923 the early irrigated plots gave a yield of 329 bushels per acre and the late irrigated plots averaged 205 bushels per acre or a difference of 124 bushels per acre. Many potato growers in the irrigated section are of the opinion that potatoes should never be irrigated until the vines begin to suffer for lack of moisture. In fact, many growers state that they have re - ceived their largest yields when they have withheld the first application of water until the vines begin to wilt. However, the above data would indicate that there is much to be gained by early irrigation, at least in the Greeley district. It is also believed that many diseased vines may produce a fair yield when good growing conditions are afforded throughout the growing season. </seg>
            <seg id="p712">714 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Soils vary greatly in the amount of water they retain and seasons also vary greatly from year to year, and each farm presents its own special problem. Therefore it is impossible to lay down an iron-dad role for irrigating potatoes. Discussion. Q. How far apart should one space his rows? A. We plant 36 inches. That might depend somewhat on the varieties of the potatoes or the richness of the soil. If you have very rich soil you may plant closer. The distance might differ on the differ - ent farms and in different localities. Q. I am interested in knowing the difference in yields in those potatoes planted early and late. A. These were all planted at the same time. Q. I mean the quality of the potatoes in the early and late irri - gations. A. The early watered potatoes were about 1% higher in starch content. Q. I mean the merchantable quality of these potatoes. A. The figures I have given you were the total yield. The yield of culls was probably between 20 and 25 bushels per acre. Q. Do your experiments show the irrigation about July 10th is the best time? A. It has been so with us at the Greeley station. I would suggest Eit if you have had very good success with watering later that you aside ten or twelve rows on one side of your field and try early tering. Do not experiment with your entire field because this method of irrigation may not apply to your condition. What has proven so successful with us may not apply to your condition. Therefore, I would advise that you try the early watering on a small scale at first. I wish to recommend that your first irrigation especially be very light. We do not water heavily at any time. Heavy irrigation is not good Ethe plants. It excludes the air, especially on heavy soil and I eve you will have more diseased plants when heavy irrigation is cticed. Q. What method do you use in administering water to the rows? A. Water is run in every row from a head ditch or laterial. The water is checked at different places in the lateral by check dams. These dams are made of canvas which is not nailed to the support as is the customary method of making dams but an inch hem is made along the </seg>
            <seg id="p713">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 715 top part of the canvas and a rope is run through the hem. The rope is so arranged that it may be loosened or tightened at either end of the support according to the amount of water to be checked. Two 2x2 braces about 18 inches long are fastened on the support with strap iron loops in such a way that the canvas may be supported. If the strap iron loops are used the braces may be adjusted according to the width of the head ditch. Q. Then your setting is done without much dirt? A. I do not have to use dirt with these checks. There have been one or two checks on the market but I do not believe they are as satis - factory as this one. You can lay the ends of the canvas on the ditch bank so that there is absolutely no washing of dirt around the checks. The water can go underneath or over the top of the check. If the sup - port for the check is six feet long you will be obliged to use nine or ten feet of canvas. Q. After you have made your first set, how do you come from that set to the next? A. By taking a canvas dam down the head ditch and setting the dam at the end of the next set. The checks are then put in place and the dam from the previous set is then removed. It usually takes about ten minutes to get the checks properly adjusted so that the same amount of water is running in each row. Q. What percentage of grade on countour? A. I cannot give you the exact slope. Q. Eight feet higher? A. I have one ditch where I can run water the length of the field by checking only a few times. On other lands checks are necessary every five or six rows. Q. I do not believe you have my idea; on changing the set do you KO down in that same lateral? A. Yes. I have an idea I have practiced which I think is superior to any scheme I have seen. At the end of the rows we have a turning space for cultivating during the season. I like a double lateral system for contour. Use one lateral as you put it and the other lateral should be put above the first. That lateral would be used for carrying the water to each set. You do not need to alter the set from one irrigation to the other. You have not wasted the ground because the first lateral can be put where the turning row has been. A. I have used a similar system and it proved very satisfactory. </seg>
            <seg id="p714">REPORT OP NEBRASKA 8TATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 716 Q. On level ground you do not have the fall in the lateral you would like to have. Therefore a double lateral would be better. A. Your system of irrigation is good. Q. When I irrigate I have three canvases. The canvas being supported by a piece of pipe. Then I let the water out in the rows. When I have too much water I bend the pipe a little until I have every one as I want it. A. Suppose you want to raise it? Q. It is easy to bend them right back (laughter). A. I use rope to support the canvas in the checks and by moving the rope very slightly one can regulate the water. Q. Does the water fall over the top of the dam? A. You can let the top down so that the water will go over the check or you can raise the bottom of the canvas and let the water run underneath. It is very easy to regulate the amount of water held by this check. Q. You would not want the water to run underneath with sandy soil? A. Not unless the fall to the next set was only a few inches then it would make a little difference. It depends on the soil how you must handle all your irrigation problems. Q. I have been irrigating for quite a while. I tried a scheme last summer that worked out well. Made an ordinary dam and measured the set of it crosswise. Dropped one foot, cut a hole 4x8 which lets two feet of water through with a four inch pressure. When you cut the hole put a patch over it and tie four strings. You can drop that patch and the water will go out and never wash a hole. One string is above where it is cut crosswise and the other two on the outer edge. Two are along the side about half way up and the other two at the top. It is sewed tight across the bottom with the lap on the upper side. By adjusting the strings you can regulate the amount of water which flows through. A. That is the finest thing going. It flows right out does not wash a hole below the dam. Q. Have you noticed any tendency of potatoes to blight from early irrigation — the blight that affects the Russet Rural potatoes with us? A. No. </seg>
            <seg id="p715">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 717 Mature and Immature Seed. To test the relative value of mature and immature seed an experi - ment has been conducted over a number of years. One lot of seed is harvested about the middle of September while the vines are still very green, while the other lots of seed are left in the ground until late in the season, usually about the middle of October. Data from this ex - periment shows very little difference in yield. The difference has been so small that one does not feel justified in advocating the use of im - mature seed. It may be that we did not have mature seed even from our lots harvested during the middle of October because the vines from this lot are usually green when killed by frost and it is quite possible that this seed is not fully ripe. An experiment is being conducted to study the effect of irrigation on seed. The seed for planting these plots is taken from the irrigation experiment. In 1921, the seed which had received six irrigations the previous year gave a yield of 360 bushels per acre, the seed which received four irrigations gave 375 bushels per acre, while seed that had been irrigated but twice gave a yield of 380 bushels per acre. In other years very little difference has been noted. Next year I will have seed from the plots which have been heavily irrigated to compare with seed which has been frequently light irrigated. I believe I could recommend that it is best to have seed that is not heavily irrigated. We are also conducting an experiment to ascertain the distance apart seed should be planted in the row. We are planting the Rural New Yorker in this experiment. The Rural does not set heavily and quite frequently, owing to the light set and rather rich soil, large over - grown tubers are produced. Seed pieces in this experiment are plant - ed 8, 10, 12 and 14 inches apart in rows 36 inches apart. As a rule the closer plantings have given larger yields and more desirable sized tubers. Quite frequently they are large hollow tubers where the plant - ing is 14 inches apart. Q. Is the flea beetle responsible in any way for the set of potatoes ? A. I do not know how much it affects the set. Q. Sometimes the first sets will be eaten off by the potato flea bettle larva. A. I have not noticed that the larva caused any difference in the number of tubers that set. The entomologists in Colorado are doing some work with the potato flea beetle. I believe that the potato flea beetle prefers to work in wet soil and I believe with our light irrigation we - have less flea beetle injury. The flea beetle also appears to cause more damage in heavy soils than on the potatoes growing in the light sandy soils. The flea beetle injury is serious in the Greeley district, but L believe that the injury can be materially lessened by proper irrigation. </seg>

Q. Is it a round hole? A. The hcle is very small, probably the result of wire worms The round holes you refer to are Q. Have you a remedy for the flea beetle? A. There is no remedy that will control it. Spraying with Bor - deaux mixture and Paris green are a benefit. These sprays act as a repellent and are probably the best sprays known at the present time. It is hoped that some time we will have a spray which will kill the flea beetle. It may be that a spray will be found which will not act as a repellent but kill the insect. I have been testing your dry land Triumphs for four or five years. This has been more or less of a strain test of Triumphs. In 1921 the highest yielding strain gave a yield of 375 bushels, the lowest 307. In 1922 the highest yield was 427 bushels per acre and the lowest 325. In 1923 the highest yielding strain gave a yield of 322 bushels and the lowest 281. I cannot give you the results of the 1924 Triumphs be - cause the grading has not as yet been done. In 1923 two growers near Greeley purchased a high yielding strain of seed from Nebraska on my recommendation. One of these growers received a yield of 270 bushels per acre. The other grower harvested 320 bushels per acre. The average for the district as near as I could ascertain was 120 bushels per acre. These men were very well satisfied with the seed which they secured but this year they did not purchase this particular strain of seed because of the high price asked by the growers. They bought dry land seed which looked to them to be very good but they advise me that it was not a high yielding strain and they are confident that it would have paid them to have paid the higher price and secured the better seed. I believe it will pay the growers to buy high yielding strains of seed, even though they have to pay $1.00 or $1.50 more per cwt. for it. Seed may be improved by hill selection but it is a tedious process and suitable only to the specialist who has time to make the selections. I thank you. (Applause.)

            <seg id="p717">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 719 SPINDLE-TUBER— THE CAUSE OF "RUN OUT" POTATOES. (Report of Nebraska Experiments) H. 0. Werner, Associate Horticulturist, Uni. of Nebr. Lincoln, Nebr. Mr. President, Members of the Potato Association, and Friends: We have most especially been experimenting with the spindle-tuber pro - blem here in the North Platte Valley. There is also, however, consider - able spindle-tuber in dry land areas. Many of you who have attended these conventions know that considerable has been said about the "run - ning out" of potatoes, and at some of the meetings, about running- out of potatoes under irrigation. We have pretty definitely established the fact that practically all of this running out with which we are most especially concerned — that which occurs in this western part of the state, causing elongation of the potatoes and decrease of yield — is due to a disease which has been named spindle-tuber. Experimental work, some of which is used for charts and slides this afternoon, was started in 1917 by Prof. Howard, who formerly was Chairman of our depart - ment at the University. In the early part of the work we were puzzled by a number of cases that came up. Finally two years ago we concluded fairly definitely that the trouble was a disease trouble, and that the name of this disease was spindle-tuber. We outlined a number of experiments to determine this more definitely and to see just how the disease was transmitted and what damage it did when it was transmitted. I will give you some of those figures by charts and slides and photographs this afternoon. (Shows slides at this time). The symptoms of this disease are quite distinct in the advanced stages. The plants are slow in emerging, are erect, with few stems. The leaves fold upward with a ruffled margin and they are also smaller and possibly darker. They are attached to the plant at a sharp angle and the main leaf petiole does not curve or droop as in normal leaves, thus giving the plant a very stiff erect appearance. The blossoms are conspicuous, being borne on a stiff erect stem. The tubers are elongated or pointed with many shallow eyes. Growth cracks are common but knobs are unusual. Infected Triumph potatoes are of light red color, changing finally to pink and a mottling of pink and yellow. Between these advanced forms and healthy potatoes there are symptons of all gradations, the milder ones being hard to distin - guish. (Note. — This speech was given by means of lantern slides and charts. Much of the illustrative material is shown in Nebraska Agri - cultural Experiment Station Research Bulletin No. 32 and Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin, — to which the reader is re - ferred for more detail information. Herewith are shown pictures (that are not published elsewhere) of some of the potatoes from transmission experiments.) Professor Goss has demonstrated that mosaic — as he told, you last </seg>
            <seg id="p718">720 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ear — developed the characteristic symptons at low temperatures and sappeared at high temperatures. Spindle-tuber, he also found out, and e have observed in fields, acts the reverse so far as the plant symptons re concerned. We investigated the effect of temperature upon potatoes — spindle-tubers and normal potatoes. We have arranged special devices n our greenhouse for controlling the temperature of soil surrounding the otato plants by sinking cans full of soil in which potato plants are growing into tanks of water kept at different temperatures. This of ourse is only practical for some rather technical experiments. Effect of Temperature on Spindle-Tuber Symptoms. We held the temperature of the soil in one case at about 55 de - grees. In another case, at 65 degrees, and in a third case, at practically 70 degrees. When we held the temperature at 55 degrees with normal potatoes, we had tubers which were 27 per cent wider than long. When the temperature for normal potatoes was 69 degrees, they were about circular. With 71.5 degrees the width was 73 per cent of the length. When we planted spindle-tubers at the same temperatures, at 55 de - grees they were 13 per cent wider than long. It would have been rather difficult to pick those out with certainty as spindle-tubers. At 70 de - grees the spindle-tubers were 10 per cent longer than wide. Reviewing those figures, the spindle-tubers at 55 degrees were a bet - ter shape than normal potatoes raised at 69 degrees or 71 degrees. The temperature had a material effect there. In a cold season one is not so liable to find all the spindle-tuber. It is there and carries over just the same. The symptoms are not as evident as when the soil is warm. The character of the soil may have something to do as to whether it is evi - dent or not. From now on the discussion will have to do only with Triumphs When we grew Triumph potatoes with different types of soil, we also got some differences. We grew plants with light, sandy soil — a soil 80 er cent sand; another of 40 per cent; and a third with no sand at all — silt soil. These were raised in the greenhouse at the same tempera - ore. In the soil with a large amount of sand, we had potatoes that were Dout as wide as long when we planted normal seed. With 40 per cent sand, they were 7 per cent longer than wide; and when we used no sand, te tubers were 18 per cent longer than wide. That was the effect upon ormal potatoes. When we grew spindle-tuber Triumph potatoes in our light soil of 80 per cent sand, the potatoes were 10 per cent longer than wide. Those pindle-tubers in that soil were a type equally as good as the normal ubers raised in the soil that contained 40 per cent sand. In all cases, lowever, as the soil became heavier, spindle-tubers as well as normal &gt;otatoes became more elongated. In all these cases, the eye character - sties of the spindle-tuber remained distinct. You could determine that hey were spindle-tubers, but not by shape. The eyes were shallow. The color disappeared at higher temperatures, but not always at low temperatures. </seg>

Place Effect Upon Spindle-Tuber Symptoms. In 1922, as you may know from seeing the field work we did, we sent fifteen halves of spindle-tubers to Dr. Folsom at the Experiment Station in Maine. (He has done considerable work on mosaic.) He planted those, and we planted the other halves of the same tubers at the Scotts Bluff Experiment Farm. Dr. Folsom returned the potatoes raised in Maine to us. All the progeny in one hill was sent in a separate marked sack. We measured all potatoes raised in Maine and all raised in Ne - braska. On the basis which we use to inspect potatoes for run-out stock and spindle-tuber, and on the basis we use it under Nebraska conditions, had we found potatoes of the character they sent back from Maine, we would have overlooked a large number of spindle-tubers and would have considered them relatively normal potatoes. When we calibrated those potatoes, we found the Nebraska stock was 22 per cent longer than wide, and the Maine stock was one per cent wider than long. We had practically round potatoes. We use a system of grading these potatoes with regard to type. Mr. Morrow did most of this work last year (1923). The worst spindle - tubers we rated as of No. 1 type. The ideal type was considered No. 10. We added the type ratings. The average type for Nebraska stock from the fifteen tuber halves was 3.8; for Maine, 8.7. In other words, the type of Nebraska stock was about one-half as good as the Maine stock. </seg>
            <seg id="p720">722 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The question would come up — and is of considerable concern: Had the spindle-tuber left those potatoes? Were Maine conditions so favor - able that spindle-tuber was overcome, or was it still in the potatoes ? LWe planted the Maine and Nebraska grown tubers in adjacent rows the Experiment Farm this summer. This fall when we measured the potatoes raised in Maine in 1923 and those raised in Nebraska — or rather, their progeny — we found the Nebraska potatoes were 22 per cent longer than wide. Last year they were 21 per cent longer than wide, so they are just a trifle worse this year. The potatoes raised in Maine last year, but grown in Nebraska this year, were exactly the same. They both had a tuber type value of 3.5. One year of production in Maine had no effect upon the spindle-tuber carried by those seed potatoes. It had a material effect upon the symptoms. I had the Weather Bureau give me the average temperature in Maine or those three months. The average temperature at Presque Isle, Maine where they were raised in 1923) for July, Aug., Sept., were 58.5. (That s the temperature at which we got spindle-tubers of better shape than normal potatoes at higher temperatures) . The Nebraska temperature in bis county for the same three months was almost 68.7°. I think prac - ically all the difference is due to temperature. In a hot season we can expect more elongation both in normal and spindle-tuber potatoes. In a normal season we can expect a better type of tubers. In either case, he spindle-tuber disease does not seem to be lost, but it is carried over about the same. Q. What was the character of the soil in Maine? A. Mr. Edmundson can answer that by first-hand experience. EDMUNDSON: A shale rock— a loose rock— not washed— a. m soil with a little rock. It is not sandy soil. Effect of Soil Type on Symptoms Mr. Werner, (continuing) : In 1924 at the Scottsbluff Experiment Farm we took three types of soil— one was a silt wash, and another a blow sand from a drift, and the other was an average soil picked up at the Experiment Farm — and raised normal and spindle-tubers in these soils. All of the potatoes were from the same seed potatoes. On the heavy soils the normal potatoes were 76.% as wide as long and spindle-tubers 63.%. On the very fine sandy loam the same ratio with normal tubers was 86.5% and spindle-tubers 75.8% whereas with the very fine sand the normal tubers averaged 83.9% and the spindle tubers 84.8%. On light soil the plants were small and the potatoes a little bit smaller. Q. Did you ever test out three pieces of potato from the same potato on three different soils? A. That is how these experiments were planted.. The same seed, potato was carried thru all these treatments. </seg>
            <seg id="p721">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 723 Transmission of Spindle-Tuber. We have evidence that spindle-tuber is transmitted. We have abun - dance of evidence on the exhibits on the show tables. I will show addi - tional evidence in the charts this afternoon. A year ago some of you heard me say something about tuber graft - ing. I do not want to be misunderstood. I am not trying to pull any nature-faking by grafting tubers; but have used one method used by pathologists in determining whether a disease can be transmitted. A normal potato half and a suspected diseased half were tied together so that the two halves met and the juices could pass from one to the other. We did that with spindle-tubers and normal halves. They were tied tightly. We took out all the eyes in the spindle-tuber halves so that none would produce plants, but that all the plants would be produced from the normal plant. We wanted to determine whether the juice from the spindle-tuber would transmit the disease to that plant. We did it with fifteen tubers that were raised in the field at the Ex - periment Station in 1923. In every case we planted the spindle-tuber check halves (not grafted) by themselves, and the normal check halves in another place. This year we planted all of the progeny from these hills in adjacent rows. Fig. 2 shows how the plants raised from this seed thus produced, appeared, at the Experiment Station this year on the 25th of July. You can see that the plants from normal halves produced vigorous plants. There is very little difference between the plants from the grafts and the spindle-tubers in that case. The degeneration is quite complete. Fig. 2 — Transmission of spindle-tuber to healthy stock by tuber grafts. At right plants from normal check, center plants from grafts, right epindle-tuber checks. (Scottsbluff July 25, 1924.) </seg>
            <seg id="p722">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 724 Q. Do you think all the seed pieces would be contaminated? A. We happened to get all these fifteen grafts to take. That is not always the experience. Sometimes only 50 to 75 per cent take. I have my doubts as to whether the mixing of the spindle-tuber and the normal tuber pieces (of cut seed) would result in transmission. It may take place once in a while. From the normal tubers we secured 387.4 bushels to the acre whereas the progeny of the tuber grafts produced llff.2 bu. and the spindle tuber checks 100.4 bu. You see the degeneration was very complete in one year. That is a type of transmission which probably you do not en - counter very much in practical work but we do have transmission taking place in other ways. In 1923 we raised plants, some normal plants under cages, to prevent infection by insects. We alternated spindle-tuber and normal plants. We planted two sets like that. In one set we caged the normal plants (See Fig. 3 at left). In the other we left the normal plants exposed to spindle-tuber infection. Fi«. 3 — Method of caging normal plants to prevent spindle-tuber infection. Then we planted the third piece from each of these, ten normal pota - toes in a dry-land field which had fairly healthy plants, and the fourth piece was planted in an irrigated field which we attempted to keep free from disease. In 1924 we planted the progeny from that stock. Three rows in these plants were raised from potatoes produced from the plants which in 1923 were not caged. They were exposed, and surely got it. In Fig. 4 are some of the plants, produced from the seed which was grown on plants caged in 1923. Although they were adjacent to spindle tubers, there was no transmission, and we have big, vigorous vines. The transmission was not thru the soil, but the atmosphere as shown by the spindle-tuber plants produced from seed raised under normal plants that were not caged (fig 5). </seg>

            <seg id="p731">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 733 It is quite evident from this material, that in western Nebraska spindle-tuber is readily transmitted and that in 1923 transmission took place early in the season. It is also apparent that transmission did not occur to any great extent in fields of supposedly normal plants. The declining yield and percentage of No. 1 good type tubers with the in - crease in infection is a very conspicuous fact in these data. Effect of Date of Harvesting Upon Degree of Infection A number of carefully conducted experiments indicate that when disease is present, immature seed, because of having been in the field a short season, is superior to mature seed. When disease is not present, it is questionable whether the immature seed has a very superior value. That has been the result of a dozen or more different experiments in this state. Jn 1923 and 1924 we ran experiments on plants exposed to spindle-tuber to see if we could escape spindle-tuber by early harvesting; We harvested lots on different dates, commencing August 20th. *Mg. 17 — The series from Fig. 17 to 21 shows tubers produced in 1924 from the progeny of noimal plants harvest*. d at different dates in 1923.

The parent seed tuber in 1923 was the same for all plants, the 1924 product of which is depicted in Figs. 17 to 21. The results secured from early harvesting as shown in Fig. 17 to - 21 and Table 3 indicate as did the results in caging experiments, that infection occurs early in the season and cannot be escaped by early har - vesting. Early harvesting is not a practical control measure. How - ever, if spindle-tuber is present in a field some infection might be avoid - ed by harvesting the seed plat before the main crop is harvested, there - by also avoiding frost injury. Producing seed in an isolated rogued plat is the most practical method, and the only one worthy of consider - ation. Distance that Spindle-tuber is Transmitted. Kther experiments showed that spindle-tuber is transmitted across 1 rows of plants, but that most infection occurs in the rows near [n Maine, spindle-tuber was found to have spread across 49 rows atoes. Selection of Good Type Tubers in Spindle-tuber Infected Lots, In the fall of 1922 we took good type potatoes out of a lot which that spring had been good certified seed, but that in 1922 had 'beep grown among spindle-tubers (on either side). In 1923 these tubers were planted in comparison with seed from the original certified seed farm. The yield from the check lot of certified seed was 243 bushels, and the yield from the selected good type tubers of the 1922 crop, that </seg>
            <seg id="p735">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 737 had been exposed to infection, was 116 bushels — less than one-half as many potatoes. Value of Roguing in Irrigated Fields. In the course of another experiment, we endeavored to determine whether it was possible for irrigation growers to raise seed by adopt - ing roguing practices. If spindle-tuber was the cause of running out, it should follow that if spindle-tuber is controlled, the seed should f&gt;e all right, even though we may have expressed our opinions to the con - trary in former years. We took the same lot of seed and divided it and planted it in different lots. When grown in 1923 on dry land and rogued in 1924 — 95.6% of the tubers were good type on No. 1 size, whereas the crop from other tubers of the same lot grown with spindle-tubers on one side, in 1923, produced only 32% of No. 1 size good type tubers in 1924. When spindle - tuber was adjacent on both sides in 1923, only 16 per cent of the potatoes were of U. S. No. 1 size and good type in 1924. On the basis of the percentage of the check, the lot raised on dry land yielded 92.7%, that from irrigated land, 93.8 per cent, and when spindle-tuber was adjacent on one side and not removed, the yield dropped to 61.5 per cent of the check and when present on both sides the yield from normal stock the following year was only 51.3%. That would seem to indi- cate that isolating and roguing a good strain is effective. Effect of Culture on Spindle-tuber Increase. We might consider some other things in this connection. Irriga- tion enters in as a very material factor in the spread of spindle-tuber. It is somewhat more difficult to raise good seed under irrigation than on dry land. Apparently the conditions under irrigation are more favorable for transmission. In 1921 we took one hundred potatoes which were secured from the unit in Kimball County. This was the product of a 40-hill unit which in 1919 was a four-hill unit. We gave these units irrigation in 1921. For various reasons we dropped 75 of these units and continued 25 thru the four years. On the basis of the comparison of the yield from those 25 units with the yield of the check, (which was seed from the original good field which was continually rogued), we have results as follows: In 1921 these 25 units yielded 89 per cent as much as the check; In 1922 we took one potato from each of the twenty-five units and planted them on Mr. Gadeken's farm southwest of Bushnell, on dry land. We did not rogue them. We brought back the progeny and in 1923 we planted it, part on irrigated and part on dry-land at the Scotts - bluff Experiment Farm. The dry land plot contained other lots that n 1922 | in 1923 U it li tt 32 m it tt ti tt t :n 1924 it ti it (I 27 u a it tt a M 9 </seg>
            <seg id="p736">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 738 had a great deal of spindle-tuber. In 1923 the lots irrigated con - tinually had a type value of 3.6 (based on 10 as perfect). The lot from Bushnell had a type value of 5.2. The Bushnell grown stock had spindle-tuber, but the type was better. The type on dry land was better than on the irrigated land. In 1923 the lot grown at Bushnell one year, yielded 97 per cent as much as the check. The type was seriously injured. For some reason the yield was not seriously cut down. On the dry land the yield was 91 per cent of the check. We saved seed from these lots and planted again. In 1924 the stock continually in irrigated land had a type of 2.5. The stock on dry land at Bushnell one year (1922) and then irrigated in 1923 had a type value of 2.6. The lot in the dry land plot in Bushnell in 1922 and on dry land at Scottsbluff in 1923, had a type value of 4. The yields were in the same ratio. The stock on dry land at Scottsbluff and Bush - nell during the two previous years yielded 58 per cent as much as check in 1924; and the lot irrigated continually yielded 27 per cent as much. This would appear to me to show that conditions in an irrigated field are more favorable for spindle-tuber transmission, and in growing such seed, it is necessary to exert .greater efforts in controlling spindle - tuber than is necessary in dry land. The same condition occurred in dry land fields in 1923. We had an unusually heavy rainfall and large vines. On the basis of these facts I believe that the greater spread in irrigated fields is due to the fact that in the irrigated field the vines lap over onto each other and provide a great deal of shade and a better place for insects to live, thus making it unnecessary for the insect to travel far from one plant to another to carry infection. So infection can take place *more readily under irrigation conditions than on dry land . There is a theory held by some people that when there is rank growth, infection takes place more readily than when the growth is less succulent. Those are given out to you as theories — not by any means as proved facts. Production of Good Seed by Ro suing. Within the last two years we also raised larger lots of four varieties of potatoes and rouged those plots thoroughly — one at Alliance; one at Bushnell; one at Scottsbluff, and some at North Platte and Lincoln. The figures show when we rogued thoroughly in 1923, with the same seed stock, in 1S24, the place of origin had little to do iwith the value of the seed, from the viewpoint of production. If there was any differ - ence, it was always associated with the difference in the amount of spindle-tuber. If the yield decreased we had an increase in the amount of spindle-tuber.

            <seg id="p737">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICI'LTTRK 739 prevalence of spindle-tuber in western Nebraska. There is no doubt in my mind it is the most serious thing with which we have to contend at the present time. In the spring of 1923, we had Mr. Bondy spend six weeks assembling and getting the history of various lots of potatoes in this valley. These were tubers the growers were actually planting. He would take half a bushel out of the bins and get the history as well as he could. Some were irrigated thirteen years. Some were grown on light and some on heavy soils. We planted a small plat from each of those 105 lots on which we have complete, reliable figures. In 56 lots of Triumphs, the minimum amount of spindle-tuber was 3 per cent, and the maximum 99 per cent. The average of the 56 lots was over 15 per cent. The yield ranged from 31 bushels to 288 bushels, with an average of 141 bushels. The average yield for this North platte irrigation pro - ject has been, from 97 to about 200 bushels per acre during the last 4 years. The average yield of the 56 strains is close to the average yield of the entire project thru the years. We had the same conditions with the other varieties. We had a large amount of spindle-tuber in most of the lots but we had a few lots which were very good. The soil upon which they had been grown seemed to have nothing to do with the quality of the potatoes. Some of the lots irrigated thirteen years were better than some irrigated only one year and occasionally some of these lots were better than some of the dry-land uncertified lots but on the whole the lots irrigated a num - ber of years were inferior. I think the certified dry-land lots were superior at all times. In the dry- land regions we find a better effort is made to keep up the quality by roguing. In 1921 we called spindle-tubers "run out" potatoes. That year after the bin inspection of 32 fields, we found we had 7.25 per cent of run-out potatoes. In 1922 we begun to get suspicious that this might be a disease, and told the growers .to rogue out the run-out plants. That was done before bin inspection. In 1922 with 144 lots, we had 2.8 per cent of spindle-tuber. In 1923 we had 2.63%. I have not the average for 1924, but judge it is a little bit lower, for two reasons: One is the fight put on against spindle-tuber and the elimination of bad lots, and the other is the fact that the lower temperature this fall has been more favorable for the development of better type potatoes and has had a tendency to develop less spindle - tuber symptoms in-so-far as shape is concerned in the spindle type. This has made bin inspection more difficult this fall than during pre - vious seasons. In 1923 we had more rejections in proportion to acreage than any other season. You may have unpleasant memories on that account. In the first inspection we rejected 932 acres on account of mosaic, and 798 acres on account of spindle-tuber. On second inspection, we re - jected 33 acres on account of mosaic and 294 on account of spindle- </seg>
            <seg id="p738">740 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tuber. At the last inspection we rejected 22 acres. - The three in - spections in 1923 resulted in 965 acres being rejected because of mosaic, and 1106 acres because of spindle-tuber. I am quite frank in admitting to you that probably 100 acres more should have been rejected in 1923 on account of spindle-tuber, than, were rejected. They slipped by for many reasons — one because it was dif - ficult in some cases to detect it, and for other reasons I do not exactly know. This year in our certification trial plot we sorted the potatoes as harvested into Grade No. 1, good; No. 1, spindle-tuber; No. 2's and culls. In the case of lots certified in 1923, 116 lots averaged 5 per cent spindle-tuber this fall. 49 new lots which were entered for cer - tification the first time this year, averaged 4.2 spindle tuber this fall. That is a partial reason why it does not seem advisable at this time to require the planting of only certified seed; because we are still finding some lots just a little better than some lots that are certified. Of lots rejected for all reasons in 1923, 51 averaged 12 per cent spindle-tuber this fall, and 23 lots rejected because of spindle-tuber averaged 20.5 spindle-tuber in the trial plat. It is quite evident that spindle-tuber was transmitted thru this seed. If you have had experience with spindle-tuber, you will realize that would be the case if you planted stock rejected. jj*ig. '12 — Pearl potatoes on dry land near Kimball, 1918. Seven vigorous rows at right were planted with selected tuber units. Stock at left was seriousiy infected with what is now recognized as spindle-tuber. The following year the vigorous units showed severe symptoms and degenerated rapidly. Seed plats should he isolated from other potatoes. tThis picture (Fig. 22) was taken in Kimball county, and shows en rows of selected stock in 1918. Notice the selected rows down a the field. The following year we did not get results like that. </seg>
            <seg id="p739">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 741 In 1919 the progeny was about worthless. In 1920 it was almost out of existence. Under those conditions, quite a little transmission disease had taken place. This is what you need to do: Plant your seed plot in a field where you won't run any chance of infection. It may not be as good, or better. If you get new seed, plant it in a new place. Effect of spindle-tuber on germination. Spindle-tuber very materially delays germination. We have a great deal of data in regard to that. If you take the number of plants that came through in 20 days in normal, only 95 per cent of the plants from good seed will come through in that number of days. A lot badly in - fected will have only 50 per cent of those plants coming through in 20 days. There is one point I wish to bring out. One of the difficulties in attempting to raise seed in an irrigated region is based somewhat on the fact I have just mentioned: — that spindle-tuber plants germinate slowly; come up late. Therefore you will have uneven germination and big normal plants. Later in the season the spindle-tuber will come up between the normal plants. Unless your plants are spaced far apart, the normal plants will lap over and hide the spindle-tuber plants, making roguing almost impossible. The small spindle-tubers among the normals are almost as serious as among the larger plants. To avoid this use large seed pieces and plant far apart and', rogue as early in the season as possible. I think I owe an apology to Professor Goss. This took a little longer than I had expected. You have been attentive. I do not know whether you have been asleep, bored or interested; I could not see you in the dark. This sums up much of the spindle-tuber experimental work con - ducted by me the last five years. (Applause) THE PRESIDENT: It is suggested that we give Professor Goss time tomorrow. It will give him an opportunity when he won't be limited in time, and the business meeting should be held this afternoon. If we hold it now it will give plenty of time to consider the matter that should be considered, and have a little rest between now and the banquet. You have the election of four officers of your Improvement Associ - ation, two of these officers to be your President and Vice-President, to hold office one year; and two directors to hold office two years. I shall soon ask for the report of the Nominating Committee. Do not misunderstand the motive in the appointment of this Nominating Com - mittee. In some of the years previous when nominations were thrown open to the house, few had given it any thought, and sometimes all the nominations were of men from one district. Sometimes it took fifteen minutes to get any nominations. Therefore we have appointed a Nominating Committee; but I do not want any one to feel he has not the privilege of suggesting from the floor any others he has in mind. </seg>

G. Phelps, Belmont; For Vice-President, J. Pedrett, Kimball; For Members Board of Directors: W. L. Hawk, Chadron M. G. Wilson, Minatare. tTHE PRESIDENT: Are there any other nominations? There uld be. With four offices and only four men nominated, there will little voting. kTHE SECRETARY: Since my office is not being vacated, and no - ' wants to say anything, to bring it before the house, I move the mmendations of the Nominating Committee be accepted. The motion was seconded, and carried unanimously. THE PRESIDENT: I want to take a moment's time to bring up nother matter. Following the various shows and meetings, men here and there have said, "We made a mistake we have paid no attention to egislation." In order that we won't leave here without giving thought to it, I want to tell you one thing. I am just back from Wyoming where I attended a meeting of the Western Regional Advisory Boards f Railroads. I found Utah, Colorado, Idaho, and to a certain extent, Wyoming, in all matters pertaining to potatoes and vegetables in gen - ral have men there who know their stuff, and Nebraska might as well ot be in that group of states. Now, whether we like it or want it or not, as time goes on, legis - ation that will affect you and me as potato growers and shippers will argely originate and be handled by these Regional Advisory Boards, could take a lot of time in telling you about this. That is a natural ling. If you want to think about it a little, you might take some steps to recommend that this state be properly represented. Bear in mind le rest of the states of this region had men there — growers, shippers — and they mean business; and Nebraska was just about not repre - sented. I want to call your attention to just a few things that came up be - fore this Potato Committee of the Regional Advisory Board. Among other things was a very heated discussion as to the possible or probable elimination or entire curtailment of your free advisory privilege. In the discussion of that privilege it was suggested and favored that should it be limited to one or two or three, that our sister states in this region in which Nebraska is grouped, being farther from market, be permitted one additional free advisory. Nebraska probably would have had nothing to say. There was a suggestion — not by the railroad men, but by others — that railroads control the distribution of cars to even the withdrawal pre- </seg>

Our recommendation was made, we asked that it be given to the other eleven regional boards, that the licensing law for all dealers and opera - tors be put in effect under the control of the Department of Commerce — not even left to be decided. Those things might be considered in think - ing about whether you had a similar letter, or want to pay a little at - tention to legislation. Adjournment was then declared until 9:30 A. M., Friday. BANQUET Thursday Evening, December 4 The Eighth Annual Banquet of the Nebraska Potato Improvement Association was held in the Gering Hotel, Gering, Nebraska, on Thursday evening, with Mr. Phil Sheldon, county agent of Scotts Bluff county, act - ing as Toastmaster. THE TOASTMASTER: It has been wished on me to call on the dif - ferent speakers this evening. I have not been able to attend all the meetings and missed some of the discussions, especially between the rep - resentatives from the northern and southern part of Louisiana; but we requeet this evening that if there are any differences between these two sections, that they be forgotten (Laughter), and that a spirit of co - operation be shown this evening. I am not going to ask Jake (Pedritt) to talk tonight, so I can abuse him without fear of a "come-back". They say he went to New York City one time. His wife waa not along. He rushed down to the depot ticket office. Jake, this story has no connectien with the Mississippi river. (Laughter.) Jake had thirty-five cents. There were seventeen people waiting to buy tickets. Jake rushed in ahead of them and laid down his thirty-five cents and said, "I want to buy a ticket to San Francisco." The agent said, "You can't go to San Francisco for thirty-five cents." "Well, where can I go?" The report was seventeen people told him. (Laughter.) Jake is vice-president of the Nebraska Potato Improvement Associa - tion. I thought I would abuse him a little before calling on the President of the Nebraska Potato Improvement Association, Mr. James Phelps, of Belmont. (Applause.) PRESIDENT PHELPS: Mr. Toastmaster, Ladies and Gentlemen: I understood Mr. Sheldon was to act as Toastmaster, so I slipped around and said, "Phil, don't call on me tonight." He' said, "Well, I am sorry, but it is customary. I can't help myself." I will say a word, before you listen to the speakers of the evening, as to the objects of this association and how it happens we are here. It is </seg>

From a small beginning, the work has reached the place where we have banquets of this size, and men from various states come and speak to us. When it started, it was merely an effort of a few men to improve an industry. It is rather remarkable that in a few years the work has resulted in an industry the size of the cer - tified seed potato industry is now. For about three hundred and sixty-four days out of a year a man who tries to be a certified seed grower has a lot of grief and work. He is told all summer what he can do and what he can't, and more or less all winter what he can't and can. (Laughter.) We finally have a banquet, to have one night, at least, of a good time. Just have it. I thank you. (Applause.) THE TO ASTM ASTER: We had an election recently. I do not know whether it is customary in all the counties, but in Scotts Bluff county the Farm Bureau Board usually interviews some of these office seekers and find out how they stand, whether they will support the farmers, etc. In the city of Gering is Mr. A. B. Wood, who runs a newspaper here. I will say this for Mr. Wood: I believe every time any farm committee ever asked him his position on any farm question, it has always found his answer satisfactory. I do not know whether he is growing potatoes this year or not, but I think we should hear from him. (Applause.) MR. A. B. WOOD, (Gering): Mr. Toastmaster, Ladies and Gentle - men: This really is unexpected. I wish to say I prefer to have a little notice upon an occasion of this sort. Mr. Phelps told about this man Sheldon, telling him in advance. I want to assure you on my honor as a man and a politician (Laughter), Phil Sheldon never said a word to Eie about it. I thought this was one occasion I would get off scot-free, ought to have something to say. I have attended your meetings at the all on several occasions. I was there yesterday, and again today. I do not pose as a farmer at all. There are three kinds of farmers: tired farmers, retired farmers, and rubber-tired farmers. I think if I belong in any of these classes, it is in the third class. tl raised a few spuds. After I got through listening to Mr. Werner — was the most scientific, explanatory, and logical one — I admit I do know the combination. That reminds me of the lady who borrowed a clock from her neigh - bor. She kept it four days and took it back, saying, "Mrs. Brown, that clock is not any good." "What is the matter with it?" "You can't tell what time it is." "The only trouble is you must know the combination. When both hands point to twelve and it strikes two, you will know it is half past six." (Laughter.) </seg>
            <seg id="p743">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 745 When I got through listening to those fellows, I knew why it was I never raised better potatoes than I did. (Laughter.) I do not know there is anything I can say of a serious nature. I think on an occasion of this sort you want something light and airy, and a little camouflage goes pretty good, so I will tell you another story. Down in a Kentucky town a very important citizen of the community died. There was no place for holding the funeral except the court room, so they had it there. On the day of the funeral, the town drunk wander - ed up to the court house. It was his custom to go there occasionally. He came in at the time the minister was opening the Book to select his text, and sat down close to the casket and went to sleep. The minister opened the Testament and read: "If a man die, shall he live again?" In order to make it better understood, he repeated it; and for the third time, to impress it, he said, "If a man die, shall he live again?" He was looking toward this drunk, and the fellow roused up and said, "Well, Parson, that's the third time you have asked me that. All I can say is, d — d if I know." (Laughter.) I can not say anything that would interest you seriously, and I thank you for the compliment of calling on me at all. (Applause.) THE TOASTMASTER: Mr. Wood is the state senator from this district. I suppose 1 should apologize for calling on him without giv - ing him any notice. MR. WOOD: You see, he admits it. THE TOASTMASTER: There is another gentleman here to whom we have given a lot of notice, and I think he is expecting to be called on. This is Mayor Lyda, of Gering. (Applause.) HON. C. O. LYDA, (Mayor of Gering): Mr. Toastmaster, Ladies and Gentlemen: Several days ago the President of the Commercial Club came to me and said, "You will be expected to say something to the Potato Growers Thursday evening." I was wandering up and down the street yesterday afternoon, having nothing on my mind in particular. Somebody said, "They want you over there at the hall right away." I said four or five words, maybe, and then I thought I was through. I think this probably will finish it. From the President's recent address, it seems the key words of the times are Economy and Prosperity. So far as I am personally concerned — and probably most of the community here is in the same condition — I am painfully aware of the first part of the keyword. The hopeful part is we are beginning to see the other keyword : Prosperity. I think it is just over the horizon. We of this valley are especially pleased at this time by reason of the fact the senators used their head, for once, and passed a very long-sought bill before the House had time to tear it to pieces. The bill affects our irrigation project in this part of the country. We are feeling especially good at this time in regard to matters of that kind. </seg>
            <seg id="p744">746 REPORT OH Pi BiiivAolvA siAiii duaii *jp vj Organizations of this kind are beginning 1 to realize the fanning in - dustry is a real industry; that it is well for us to get together— for people engaged in this particular industry to exchange ideas. We are recogniz - ing the fact it is an industry that requires expert minds and people who devote their entire energy to determining the best things for that indus - try. Those people at such times as these meet with the Potato Growers and discuss with them their problems. I suppose it is well I tell a story, too. There are two stories that seem to belong together. One is in regard to the late Theodore Roose - velt. I understand we have gentlemen with us from Louisiana. This happened in Georgia where they have cut-over timber lands or waste lands in large tracts which some of the richer people of the south and north use as game preserves, for their own pleasure and that of their friends. Some very influential men were escorting Teddy through Geor- Eon a hunting expedition. It was the desire of one of these men to Roosevelt had an opportunity to hunt in this particular spot. The person they could find at home was the darkey caretaker. He wanted to know if they had some written authority from the man who owned the preserves. They couldn't produce it. This fellow kept try - ing to impress upon the darkey the importance of the occasion, and that that technicality ought to be passed up; but the darkey stood firm. "Do you know, 'Rastus, who this man is? This is the President of the United States." "Ah don' care if he was Booker T. Washington hisself, he can't git in here without a pass." (Laughter.) We hope you will be so pleased with Gering that you will consider coming again. I am sure we would be glad to have you make this your annual meeting place, or at least to make it your headquarters for your ninth annual convention. We assure you that we have been glad to have you here, and stand ready to do anything we can for your comfort. I thank you. (Applause.) THE TO ASTM ASTER: .Our next speaker is Mr. Mathers, of Ger - ing, former Speaker of the House, and he might have been our present Governor if Omaha had not had a few too many people. We in the valley and most of the west end of the state are acquainted with him and know the farming community can always depend on him for help. He has given us lots of help here. I take pleasure in introducing for the main speaker this evening, Mr. Mathers. (Applause.) HON. A. N. MATHERS, (Gering): Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gen - tlemen: I was told — not like Mr. Wood, I will tell you the truth ( Laugh - ter) — several days ago that I would be privileged to attend this banquet and make an address, and I was pleased particularly because it was a subject I thought I knew something about: potatoes. I thought of all the different attempts I had made to address the public and the many subjects I undertook to discuss about which I knew little. I said, "Here </seg>
            <seg id="p745">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 747 is a subject I know something about: potatoes." I have been eating them a good many years. I raised a few potatoes until they ceased to be potatoes. From the word of the experts they were not potatoes at all. They were some sort of "infected tubers." (Laughter.) I had heard of French fried potatoes. A good many years ago we heard of German fried potatoes. I think that has been changed. They are called Ameri - can fried potatoes now. I knew something about the baked potatoes we had when we had a cow and plenty of butter. We do not have them any more. Then I saw somewhere about these hashed brown potatoes. I remember sometimes they put in three cents' worth of onion and it is "potatoes au gratin," and they charge twenty-five cents for it. (Laugh - ter.) After all my experience with potatoes, I thought, "This is a subject I can speak about." I got a program of the conference you were having in this city and I read it and found every phase of the potato question completely covered. As far as I could observe, there was nothing about potatoes but what could be completely taken care of by these experts and practical farmers during the different periods of the program. Then I was disappointed, for while a great opportunity had come to speak on a subject with which I was familiar, yet I realized by the time of this ban - quet, every man here would know a lot more about potatoes than I did, and know a lot I did not understand. So I had to change my line of thought. I decided I would not tell my jokes I expected there would be ladies here — but I would be serious this evening. I would make a few reflections upon some of the things I had heard at this potato conference. Remembrance of the last certified seed potatoes come to me as a very bad dream. I took the inspector out to that field and he told me we would have to rogue them, and rogue them until it hurt. And we rogued them. There was not much left. Then the second inspector came out and said, "What have you been doing?" "We have been roguing all summer. He said,* "Well, you have rogued out the wrong ones. (Laughter.) We will give you three days to improve this patch of potatoes." • In a few days the supreme judge came out one bright, sunny morn - ing. I took him into the field and anxiously awaited his verdict. After he had spent an hour or an hour and a half crawling around among those potatoes and practically ruining the few that were left, (Laughter.) and cutting off slices and peeping thru the slices at the sun, finally he said, "awfully sorry, but there are as many different diseases as potatoes." I said, "Well sir, if you won't arrest me, I will take you back to town and I won't say anything more about it." (Laughter.) I want to say to you in all seriousness, you are doing a wonderful </seg>
            <seg id="p746">748 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE work. With the good times coining of which Mayor spoke, we are going to be in the market out on our farm for certified seed potatoes. We ri going to buy them. We are going to buy them from good raisers seed potatoes. I do not know that we will ever have the courage to undertake to raise them again, but they are the thing to plant. There is no question about it. These practical fanners and these men of the south who use so many carloads of these potatoes do not travel about for pastime. We have a great country. These men like to come in here and visit with our charming ladies and chat with our farmers, and all that; but they do not come up for fun, but for business. They want these seed potatoes. They want them so badly they can taste them, al - most. (Applause.) I heard the Professor from Louisiana last night, and he took par - ticular pains to explain how that country could not raise cotton much any more. If they cannot raise cotton and are losing money on rice, about the only thing left is potatoes. They are raising tens of thous - ands of acres — more every year. They must ,get this seed from some - where. I was interested last night when I heard another speaker — not a pro - fessor, but a railroad man — and a pretty honest man, too. He said freight rates were too high. It reminded me of the fellow running for sheriff. He had no chance, but thought he would make a good fight. He went where they did not have a railroad. He said, "If you elect me sheriff, I will build a railroad." I hope this gentleman who has to do with the railroads has the ability to deliver, and not only tell the people Eroad rates are too high, but that he will use his best efforts to lower m, I heard this railroad man say there is going to be a great demand seed potatoes. There will be thousands of cars in demand this year where there were a few cars last year. Now, gentlemen, all over the west, I presume — I have not had the privilege of accompanying him over the different territories, but I have an idea he goes from place to place and honestly and earnestly endeavors to get the farmers to raise an endless amount of seed potatoes. It is rfit for the railroad and he is only doing his duty for his company when encourages production. Then comes the Professor from Louisiana and says to you: "Gentle - men, you must raise very good potatoes this year, because there is going to be possibly an over supply, and the competition will be exceedingly ti. You can not expect quite the price where competition is so keen." ughter and applause.) I have heard another gentleman from Louisiana last night. I do not want to be personal, but I think it is the Professor who said that. I like him. I have heard him several times. My remarks here are no reflection upon him. He is one of the great men of the south — a man who will spend his years and energy and effort to build up production. </seg>
            <seg id="p747">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 749 I do not agree with General Dawes, who says we are raising too much. I do not like that logic at all. I am not saying I did not vote for Dawes, you understand. But I do like this thing about the Professor from Lou - isiana: He is putting in his life increasing the production of the crops grown in his state. That is a wonderful thing to do. I heard this gen - tleman say something like this: "Certified seed has doubled the yield of potatoes in Louisana." Let us analyze that. You raise seventy-five bushels on the average, perhaps, with the ordinary seed. With certified seed you raise one hundred fifty bushels. You get an increase of seventy - five bushels. At two dollars a bushel — I guess they will get that next spring, when we pay Burchell forty cents a pound — they will have $150 more an acre down there because of this certified seed. They pay fifty cents a bushel more for the seed, and plant ten bushels to the acre, which still yields them a good profit. Is there any question about their wanting certified seed? If you ask why they don't pay more as long as there is such a big ad - vantage, the answer would come back like this: "We appreciate this seed is worth vastly more — probably five or six dollars a bushel — but we are your friends when we only pay you $1.35 a hundred. If we paid what it was worth, everybody would go into the business and you would not get anything." I am wondering if that would not be the logical answer? They are doing their best. It is an educational program. I do not doubt there are people in Louisiana who do not appreciate the value of certified seed. But these men are doing their best to educate them, and the men in this state — Mr. Werner and Dr. Goss and all these men — spend hours studying the troubles and the diseases of plants. It reminds me of the old college professor who knew everything. They do get awful smart — these fellows who devote their entire life to one subject. They can talk for an hour about something and you do not know what they are talking about. (Laughter.) A good deal of the time they do not know, either. This professor knew everything about bugs. He was the "last word" on bugs. So the students got together and said, "Let us fool that professor. There is certainly some kind of a bug he does not know." They made up a bug. They took the hind legs of one bug and the wings of another and the body of another and the head of another, and they put those parts together and made a bug. Some bug! They laid it before the Professor. He put on his specks and said, "Now, students, this is a very difficult question; but if my eyes do not deceive me, I would call this a humbug." (Laughter.) Passing from potatoes, which I do not expect to enlighten anybody upon, I will say I do want to see the business grow. I want to see freight rates adjusted on these heavy farm commodities. I shall not attempt to </seg>
            <seg id="p748">750 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE say how this should be done. I will only say there must come about some sort of an adjustment — perhaps not reducing the gross returns of the railroads — that will lower the freight rates on these heavy commodi - ties that come from these western states. It is absolutely impossible for the west to develop against the great handicap of these excessive freight rates on such heavy commodities as potatoes and grain. Jf it must con - tinue to pay these tremendous freight rates, I do not know whether the west can survive the handicap. I know that is being thought out along with the idea of reducing the net returns of the railroads. There must be a fair profit for the railroads. If they are to expand and .grow and take care of the great transportation problems of this nation, they must be on a healthy financial basis. But there must be a revamping — a mak - ing over to some extent of the freight schedules — in order to relieve the great central west of the exorbitant freight rates it is now paying. I be - lieve the railroad men will agree with me on this point. I shipped a carload of potatoes last winter and received $14.56 above freight. That seems ridiculous. But I did get a little claim back of $172, which helped out some. On all these heavy commodities, the freight is a large part of the dollar received. I think it is a wonderfully fine thing to have these annual meetings of all the different organizations. It is a fine thing for people from Idaho and Louisana and Colorado and all around to meet here and exchange ideas, and to learn from each other. I will tell this story. I hesitate to tell a story. Mr. Wood has a joke book and he can get good stories out of it. One day Mr. Lyda lent me his — just full of jokes. I went to looking through it, but he had told them all. I can not tell any of them. When you haven't a joke book and do not pick up a good story only now and then, sometimes you have to repeat. Will you bear with me while I tell this one little story ? Away out in California there are not so many people as there used to be. One came back through Gering the other day. I believe you saw him, Mr .Wood. He was driving a Ford. I can not talk about Ford cars, because I own one. This car had a sign : "From California." The wheels were wobbly and the fenders were battered and jammed and the body had no paint and the top was torn and rickety. The whole car apparently was only twenty minutes from the junk pile. On the back he had written in large letters: "One more payment and she's mine!" (Laughter.) Out there in California where this car came from there was a large poultry farm. One day one of the roosters flew over the fence and got into the ostrich farm. While he was gazing at those big birds, he ran into a great ostrich egg. The rooster slyly rolled it over the fence into the chicken yard. He called all the hens around there: "Hens, come up close." The hens gathered around this great ostrich egg. "Now, hens, listen to me. Not in a spirit of criticism, hens, or fault finding; but I just want you to see what other communities are doing." (Laughter.) </seg>
            <seg id="p749">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 751 You see what other communities are doing at just this kind of con - vention. I think it is a wonderful thing, and I know this community joins with Mayor Lyda in extending to you a welcome. I want to say something about the farming situation. Some time ago a merchant placed a blackboard in his store and asked the different men to write upon the blackboard what each was doing for the people of the community. The first man was a doctor, and the doctor wrote upon the blackboard: "I prescribe for all." Then the minister came in. He was asked to write upon the board, He wrote, "I pray for all." Then a lawyer came in. He wrote upon the blackboard: "I plead for all." Then the farmer came in. He was asked to write upon the black - board, and he wrote: "I pay for all." Now, that is the truth. This is a great agricultural country, and this country can not prosper as a whole — it can not have permanent prosper - ity — until the farmers of America get back at least a return for their labor and investment, and eventually a reasonable profit. No more can this country be prosperous with industry prosperous and the farmers in distress, than this country in years gone by could remain half slave and half free. There can be no permanent prosperity in America until the great agricultural interests, which represent more than 35 per cent of the people and the property of America, are brought up to an equal basis with the other great industries of this nation. Either one of two things must take place: the farmer must rise to the level of the other great industries, or they must be brought to the level of the farmer. Some have said — I think unwisely — that the farmer's problem is entirely within himself to correct; that his distress can not be relieved by legislative or congressional action. I think you can not cure the farmer's ills by congressional action. You can not legislate dollars into the farm - er's pocket. But Congress, with the same determination to help agricul - ture as it has shown toward the railroads, finance, labor and industry, can, in some measure, at least, assist the farmer out of his distress. You hear those who claim — and I think they border on the radical — « that the farmer can be made prosperous over night by legislation. Neither one of these is correct. The farmer's problems are not en - tirely economic, nor are they entirely political. Between the two ex - tremes lies the solution. There must be a cooperative effort on the part of the farmer, and a honest effort on the part of the national Congress to render assistance. If the farmer thinks by these co-operative meetings and by all of these good resolutions he can raise himself and bring him- </seg>
            <seg id="p750">752 KlijrORT Or N KnivASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE self into a par with these nationally benefitted and favored organizations, he is only fooling himself. I know, Phil, that you are extremely anxious to see co-operative farming and marketing and all those things put into effect, and we are all with you. Co-operative farming and marketing are all important and necessary. But those things alone will not bring the farmer and agricul - ture up to the level of other organizations which are receiving benefits from congressional action. I believe when agriculture is brought up to this higher level, it will be because of the farmer helping himself by co - operative marketing and production and all of those scientific and im - portant things working into his program. None should be in the slight - est degree ignored, but with them there must be an honest effort in Washington to give to the agricultural sections of America the same con - sideration Congress has given to industry and the railroads and finance. 1 think that is fundamentally and absolutely true. I believe we are going co have that sort of thing. It was my privilege to sit at the desk alone with President Coolidge regarding our sugar situation. Now, do not complain when you pay a fairly good price for sugar. Sugar, next to certified seed potatoes, is about the cheapest thing on the market. It is not expensive. We only think it is. How much do we spend for sugar? Even if you do think it is expensive, remember when you pay a dollar more for your sack, fifty cents of that is going to some farmer somewhere in either the south or west who is raising sugar beets or sugar cane. It was my business to go to Washington when the demagogues were out demanding the tariff be reduced on sugar. Because sugar affected some votes, it was the natural thing to jump on sugar in the campaign — a cowardly but a popu - lar thing. We were called to Washington. I read Mr. Brisbane's letter when he said President Coolidge should reduce the tariff to help our good friends in Cuba. The President said: "Let me tell you we have a good many good friends on the farms of America who need help before we worry about Cuba." (Applause.) With that kind of a man at Washington and the kind of a Congress we have, I think we will have an intelligent and honest program in Con - gress. Can not we then as an agricultural community look forward hope - fully to a better time in the very near future? I believe we can. I believe we can have faith and that we can have hope; and tonight as we gather round these tables we can realize we a?e on the threshold of a better day for agriculture — and that the clouds are beginning to sepa - rate. We know they have been dark clouds. Do not let anyone deceive himself by thinking our troubles were only imaginary. They have been real. They have been disastrous in many, many homes. With these favorable conditions and with the presidential election out of the way, whether we agree or do not agree as to the wisdom of our </seg>
            <seg id="p751">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 753 choice, even our own democratic Mayor admitted a bit ago that prosperity was just around the corner. (Laughter.) When he would admit that, I think we are already laying all politics aside and saying, "The election is over. We have the man we all wanted after all. Now we will have a really prosperous period." Without flattering ourselves, but looking at the cold facts squarely in the face — and I gather from these men from a distance they, too, are hopeful — I honestly believe we farmers throughout the west and south, if we will stand together and carry out these scienti - fic programs of co-operative markets; and if Congress, under constant pressure from the agricultural south and west, will do its part, I believe there will come from all of this a straightening out of the farmer's problems. I do not believe any of you would accuse me of talking so optimisti - cally if I did not think so. Perhaps my judgment is not worth any more than anybody's else. I do give quite a little of my time seriously to studying the past and trying to figure out the future. I say to you to - night in all earnestness, I sincerely believe when we meet together a year from now, matters will have improved, and continue to improve. I believe we have a safe, conservative, fair-minded President; that we have a Congress that is going to do something; and that we have through the Federal Farm Bureau and other organizations a great, intelligent, am - bitious, agricultural movement that is going to bring home the desired prosperity to the agricultural sections of the country. I have that great faith. I appreciate it is going to take effort — a great deal of effort. We are going to have to work and toil and struggle, but we will have ultimate success, of which we were in doubt a few years ago. They tell the story that away back on the Plymouth coast in a little village in the Boston Bay there was an old fisherman who had a parrot; and there was a parson in the town, and the parson had a parrot. This parson was given to using certain expressions that the parrot learned; and the old rough-and-ready seaman used certain expressions, too, that his parrot learned to repeat. One day the fisherman was going on a long voyage. He took his parrot to the parson's house. The next morning the parson's parrot said as the morning sun came through the window: "Praise the Lord!" and the old seaman's parrot said, "and pump like h~l or we'll sink!" (Laughter.) Now we want to do both in this valley and throughout the agricultural west and south. We want to have faith in our agricultural future, and we want to pump — we want to keep busy, because this prosperity and success will not come to those who do not earn it by hard work. My closing thought is to have faith. I remember seven years ago in this very room somebody accused me of giving a pessimistic talk. I had </seg>
            <seg id="p752">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 754 been down to Omaha talking with the bankers. That was the year before the bubble broke. I came back and made an address in this room. Sev - eral said, "What is the matter with you? What kind of moonshine are you indulging in now? That is the first time we ever heard you give such a pessimistic talk." /i was repeating the thought that had come to me from those who knew more about what was just ahead than I did. But I am not giving a pessimistic talk tonight. I think we should be extremely hopeful — not so hopeful we would trade the Ford for a Cadillac tomorrow. (Laughter.) Better get the mortgage off the Ford first. But with proper, sensible management and sound credit and faith, we will all come out of this distress the agricultural sections have been in for some little time. In speaking about our country to these splendid men we have here from a distance .especially out of the state, I want to call your attention to one congressional district in the great state of Nebraska. We have a district called the sixth congressional district in which practically all these potato raisers live. In this district, which is represented in Con - gress so ably by our congressman, Bob Simmons, we have nine hundred miles of railroad. I have worked over some facts I want to give you, or rather have arranged them a little out of the ordinary so that possibly you would remember them. To say so many millions or billions means nothing; but I have figured them out, endeavoring to put them in such language even the gentlemen from Louisiana can understand them — (Laughter) — and not only understand, but take the facts home to their good people in the south who will want to get out of there some of these days and come to a real country. Now, we have 2100 miles of irrigation laterals, ditches and all. We lave 20 million acres. In this great district you could put the states of elaware and Rhode Island and West Virginia and New Jersey, and have pace enough left for many counties in some of the western states. In this ongressional district is raised each year 2 million tons of hay. How is lat? These men would not remember that until they got out of the ounty. When I say we raise in this congressional district enough hay iat if loaded a ton to the load, and each load and team covering thirty eet, would make a string of loads of hay from here to Moscow, Russia, ou will see that is some hay! What about potatoes ? We raise enough potatoes in this congressional district, if they were dug and laid end to end, to reach from San Francisco clear to New York City, and back to the new University campus in Loui - iana. I do not give you these merely for entertainment. They are cor - rectly worked out. You can figure it out for yourself. They raise 700,000 tons of sugar beets here in this valley. There are four factories running tonight. You ought to go through these factories and see a real sugar factory once. I wish it could be arranged for you </seg>
            <seg id="p753">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 755 to go through any of these great factories. They make enough sugar in one year that if put into railroad cars, it would make a train 47 miles long. Go back forty or fifty years to the period of the candy-stick age. If all this sugar were made into pure stick of candy a foot in diameter, it would reach from Pike's Peak to the Woolworth building and back to Kalamazoo, Michigan. That is what is being produced. We have 600,000 cattle in this congressional district. If all those cattle could be reduced to one great beefsteak it would be two inches thick and four miles square. Somebody says "Hogs." If all the hogs in this congressional dis - trict could be represented by bacon — and it is surprising how much bacon they can get out of a hog these days — the ordinary local butcher — like the beef when they make it all steak — it would make a pyramid of solid bacon 60 feet square and 1200 feet high. We have 300 churches in this district, and 200 preachers — some of them good, too. We have 300 doctors. I always envy the doctors: they can bury their mistakes. (Laughter.) We have in this congressional district 250 banks, and some of them are open yet. And wheat. We produce enough wheat in this congressional district that if ground into flour and made into one loaf of bread, that loaf would be two miles long by two miles high, and one and one-half miles thick. If made into pound loaves, they would reach three times around the world and twice across the continent. These are some of the things they are doing in this congressional dis - trict. They can be multiplied and multiplied by the communities all over the south, west and middle west — the great agricultural section of America. I want to say I hope that the organized efforts among the fanners will continue to grow, working through Congress and the farmers and every manner of means to bring about a better day for this great agricultural industry; because if this industry does not prosper, then the nation as a whole cannot prosper; and should not those who produce the food that feeds the stomach of the world, that produces the clothes that warm the body of the world — those men and women who toil from sun to sun and take the chances — should not they, first of all, be permitted to work with the hope of a decent return? I am hopeful for that day, and it is bound to come. It will only come by keeping these experts, these county agents, these determined farmers shaping their program intelligently, changing it to meet the different conditions as they arise year by year. With all of that, and then with honest and favorable congressional action, the future, it seems to me, is assured. There should be no grounds for discouragement. From day to day as our problems come, whether we fail or succeed — and there are </seg>
            <seg id="p754">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 756 te periods of discouragement — remember this: regardless of what present hour or moment may bring to us, we are here on this earth service. That is all we can give. That is the only thing worth while. Somebody has said that service is the rent we pay for the place we occupy in the world. Now, we all occupy some place or space. It is ot our God-given right. The Lord will provide, providing you will do our part. But we are here occupying a space, enjoying the schools, lurches, the society of each other, enjoying the great blessings of the ommunity; and we must pay for them in the way of rent by service. So n whatever line we are engaged and whatever our discouragements day &gt;y day, remember ours is a life of service. I will close with these lines: "What man is fully satisfied with the life he lives, with the thoughts he thinks, with the deeds he does ? Who does not have constantly pounding at the door of his soul an ambition to do better; to think better; to live better, and to be of greater service to his fellows?" Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you. (Applause.) tTHE TOASTMASTER: I know everybody has appreciated Mr. Math - address. Those who have heard him before I think realized there lid be a treat in store for them. LWe have a few more gentlemen we would like to call on. I do not w whether we will include Jake or not. This story was told me recently, and I think I had better repeat it ow, for I may not get another chance. The next man I will call on was oing to call on a young lady one Sunday. He drove up to the house and got the young lady and put her in the buggy, and did not say any - hing. They started down the road. He drove along and did not say anything. After a while he said, "There's an owl." He did not say any - ling more. Then, "There's another owl." He drove along a little way urther. Before they turned around he said, "There's another owl." They started back and he did not say anything but "There's that last wl;" then, "There's the second owl," and finally, "There's the first owl." They reached the house. He helped the young lady out. Just as she was going in he squirmed around and said, "I don't suppose you will want to go with me again. I'm such a tease." (Laughter.) LWe would like to hear from Mr. Smith, who is agricultural agent of Missouri Pacific Railroad. MR. HENRY CLAY SMITH, (Alexandria, La.): That is another fairy story I have been hearing. I have been listening to them all even - ing, and that is about the climax. I must admit the last speaker was. very much of a poet. He left a great deal to your imagination. I found out some things about Louisiana I never knew before. </seg>
            <seg id="p755">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 757 I was out here last summer and traveled the good state over from one end to the other. I thought I was getting some place in ten minutes. It took me three hours before I arrived. Our automobile went on and on and on. I looked around to see if there was anything growing or any - thing to be seen. I just could not see much. After what the speaker has said about what you raise, I must concur with one of his remarks, and that is "Some state!" For me this trip has not been in vain. There is one thing that troubled me about the price of Nebraska certified seed. I did not fail to hear about it the four years I worked in Professor Tiebout's office. I would say, "How much does it cost them tc raise it?" If I were Presi - dent of this Association, there are two men I would get rid of: those two men who showed how much it cost to raise certified seed in Nebraska, and why it was they could not keep you from planting the whole state into certified seed. I am glad to find out you are making so much money. I am sure our people will be glad. If you make a cent a pound you will all be getting wealthy. There is a story goes in Louisana to this effect. We still have the good old days where we go to a neighbor's house and dance and sing. All the neighbors come. In this particular instance, all the neighbors came and we had trouble getting our orchestra. They are gotten up rather promiscuously. There is one from this place with a violin, and one from another place who plays a different instrument. The players had a hard time keeping together. We were dancing around waiting for a tune. Finally one of the orchestra said, "Well, you know I knows lots of tunes, but I just can't compliment you." There are a few gentlemen here I want to compliment and I will be through. One is my friend, Jake Pedrett. He was waiting 1 with his friend, Gus Forsling, in the Union Station in Little Rock. Jake starts for the train and picks up a lady's suit case and walks out. The lady said, "Mister, you have my suit case." Jake said, "I beg your pardon. I might look all right in your clothes, but how in the dickens would you look in mine?" (Laughter.) He is to be congratulated. He went to Louisiana and tried to get away with a lady's suitcase and they didn't put fcim in jail. Another man I want to congratulate. I see him over there. I saw him marking numbers on your potatoes. He pulled out slips of paper of different lengths. I saw&lt; him look at the potatoes and number ,and then he turned his back and closed his eyes. He was finished. (Laughter.) The next time I see a judge in difficulty, I shall be glad to recommend that way of getting out of it. There is another man in here I must compliment most highly. Com - ing up on the train and having nothing to do, I took a cross word puzzle. </seg>
            <seg id="p756">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 758 Everyone said, "Are you at one of those things, too? They were laughing at me. I did not get the answer. I saw Professor Werner this afternoon keep his audience for hours on a crossword puzzle, and when he got through, they did not have the answer, either. (Laughter.) Another man I want to compliment very highly because he is a good financier. Everybody is wearing a little piece of ribbon that most have cost about one and one-half cents, and he charged each one a dollar for it. That is what I call "high finance." If anybody can make a fortune as quickly as Mr. Rowley, I should like to get in on the game. It seems to me it would be wise to compliment this Association on its ability to get these railroad men to buy tickets and fix it so that you can finance your association and continue in future. Some one said this afternoon: "Do you believe the world is going backward or forward?" "I do not know." "It is going forward. I will give you the best example. Just look at Phil Sheldon." I did so. "Now look at the little boy. He is a good looking chap. Doesn't it prove to you the world is getting better by leaps and bounds?" (Laughter.) Another man I want to compliment is my friend and former boss — G. L. Tiebout. He managed to run the price of certified potatoes down to one cent — at least, I have heard it. This year he has managed to keep it up to $2.66 for January delivery. A man who can put it down to one cent last year and up to $2.65 this year, and keep friends with both parties, is a politician, whether the rest of these gentlement claim it or not (Laughter.) As for my own self, I am interested in getting the seed to Louisiana and getting our people to plant it and 'make it become a profitable indus - try on our railroad in that state. In the southern part of the state our rices are high, because potatoes come very early and there is good sale or them. As you get around where I live you get into the poorer soils here the farmers must use a lot of fertilizer in order to make it profit - &gt;le. It is hard to get a farmer to put in a thousand pounds of fertilizer and to convince him he will treble the yield. We must teach the farmer to fertilize and buy good seed. • I have enough faith in the future to think we will want more seed as the years go on. As our farmers become more educated along these lines, they will learn potatoes can be produced at a profit. We must be able to grow them over the state. In the sandy section they raise from fifty to seventy-five bushels to the acre. That is not profitable at the price we pay for seed. My interest here is purely to look over the situa - tion and find what is what, and go back and recommend this seed for use by our farmers. </seg>
            <seg id="p757">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 759 I will have to plead my ignorance as to this money business connected with seed. I am like a couple of negroes sitting at their dinner in front of a building in Louisiana not so long ago. It was in front of the Wood - men's hall. It said "W. O. W." Some negroes do not go to school at all. One negro said to the other, "What is them letters up there?" "Boy, ain't you had no eddication? You sho' is ignorant. W. 0. W. spells wow." "What's a wow ? "You don't know what a wow is? A wow is a big animal bigger'n an elufunt, and it has a tail like a rabbit." That's imagination. I must plead ignorance in regard to this price business. I hope you won't be like a certain farmer who did not have enough money to pay his dues to a lodge. The secretary had been paying them for him until he got tired. He wrote the farmer a letter, and the farmer answered it like this: "Dear Secretary: I got your letter about what I owe you. Please be patient. When some fools pay me, I will pay you. If you was no more prepared to meet your Maker than I am to meet your account, you sure would go to h—1. I hope you will do this." Laughter and applause.) THE TO ASTM ASTER: We have quite a few railroad men here we would like to call on, but we won't be able to. We will give Dr. Goss two minutes this evening. DR. R. W. GOSS, (Lincoln, Nebr.): If the two or three minutes will be like the twenty minutes Mr. Werner was going to talk this afternoon, I had better quit and save it until tomorrow. I am certainly glad to be here and meet you all, and will say the rest to you tomorrow. (Applause.) THE TOASTMASTER: I want to bring in a little side issue. In Idaho they have a good many cheese factories. The cheese you had this evening is cheese made in our own local cheese factory. It is too far to Louisiana, but I will say to our neighbors if you like this cheese, tell your dealers to put in an order for some of it. Until you get a local cheese factory, we would appreciate any business you can throw this way. Idaho, I understand, made quite a success starting in the cheese industry a few years ago. They are noted more for the good potatoes they grow than for their cheese. Mr. Smith says the Professor out there in charge of the potato industry is somewhat of a gambler; he is "drawing straws" for the best bunch of potatoes. (Laughter.) We will call on Professor Bennett, from Idaho. (Applause.) </seg>
            <seg id="p758">760 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE E. R. BENNETT, (Field Horticulturist, University of Idaho, ise) : I won't talk over an hour and a half. You can hold the watch you want to. I have been very glad to be here with you. I was here four years ago in this part of the state and enjoyed the meeting at that time. I realized you were doing some potato work. I did not realize you were doing such good work until yesterday, when I began to try to figure out how I would manage all those premiums. I do not know yet whether I ought to have let those tags get out until I was ready to go so that I could make a hasty retreat. There is no question you have an Association that is doing good work. These things I believe are great things. The Association is doing some - thing that nothing else can do, as it is giving education on this particular line of potatoes. Few of us realize what the potato seed industry really means. If you stop to think, the United States is producing 450 million bushels of potatoes, and it takes one-tenth of them for seed. You can grow seed only in certain districts, even in Idaho where we think we can grow potatoes in the northern and upper parts of the state. South of the Mason and Dixon line we can not grow seed, and in many districts in the north we can not. It means on the whole if we are going to plant good seed, certain districts must plant a lot of it. We must educate the people who must plant seed to realize they must have good seed to get returns. If I had it figured out like our speaker of the evening as to how far they would go, I think it would make pretty good dope. I suspect if put in bushel crates and placed end to end, they would go around the world You have a good Association here that is doing good work. In the Northwest we are a little ahead of you. It includes four states and one province. I do not know why we did not hold a meeting this year. Maybe one of the reasons was we had a judge from your state for the last three years. (Laughter.) Now that you are getting in our class and can grow pretty good stuff, we would like to have you come to our meeting and see what you can do in the way of cleaning up the prizes. I do not know whether I ought to invite you or not. Of course our big success is with the Rural and Gem. Last year we had a few Bliss Triumphs and Cobblers that would not show up beside yours. When you are lined up, we will ask you to meet with our growers and we will see what can be done in the way of who is growing the best stuff. We want to get all of us thinking the same way. We want to think potatoes the same way, of the same quality — not "many men of many </seg>
            <seg id="p759">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 761 minds," but all the potato growers of the whole northwest of one mind for quality and production. I thank you. (Applause.) THE TOASTMASTER: The next speaker is from another state. I do not know whether he knows he is going to be called on or not — Mr. Edmundson, of Colorado. (Applause.) MR. W. C. EDMUNDSON, (Supt. of Potato Experiment Station, Greeley, Colo.): I did not know I was going to be called on. I feel like the negro who was coming down the street. He had been in a fight. He said, "I met 'Rastus, and that niggah jumped on me and hit me in the nose an' blacked my eye, an' chewed my ear. I nevah go so tiahed of a niggah in all my life!" (Laughter.) I suspect you are getting tired of hearing this talk. THE TOASTMASTER: The certified seed growers have a manager. I do not know whether you can call him a new manager, but he is the first manager of the present corporation. I think we should have a few remarks from him. Mr. Morrow. (Applause.) WM. MORROW, JR., (Certification Manager, Alliance, Nebr.): I told the men that if they were going to put me on the program this even - ing I would not be here. I am on and I haven't any stories. I know the shorter I can make the speech, the better you will appreciate it; so I will stop before I begin. (Applause.) THE TOASTMASTER: They say there are two extremes. One ex - treme is the person who is always able to agree with you whether he thinks you are right or not; and the other extreme is the person who stands by what he thinks pretty strongly, even though he many not al - ways make friends by it. The next speaker does not represent either ex - treme, but I think his failing is not along the line of making friends with everybody at the expense of certified seed of western Nebraska, which I believe is certainly an excellent quality. I think most of you know the man— Professor Wernor. (Applause.) MR. H. O. WERNER, (Lincoln, Nebr.): I have at times questioned whether I had any friends at all in western Nebraska, especially after last year's season when I had something to do with the rejection of 60 per cent of the potatoes that applied for certification; but Professor Goss had his say in that, too. Of course we have delivered all this blessing to I am interested in recalling a few things in the way of reminiscences. I have not been in the state very long yet, but a good many things have - happened in that time. When I came to this hotel this week, it was for - cibly called to my mind. On the first trip I took to western Nebraska, </seg>
            <seg id="p760">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 762 six years ago during this very week, the Lincoln Hotel in Scottsbluff was not finished, and I came across the river and stayed at this hotel The influenza epidemic was at its height so I wanted to stay at a rela - tively good hotel. My purpose on that trip was to look up in western Nebraska, as well as I could, some good lines of seed potatoes to send to the south to be used in trial work conducted by Dr. Stuart, Professor Tiebout, and by other friends in the south. tWe did not know much about spindle-tuber and mosaic, but we took a nee and picked the best potatoes we could, out of a bin. That was bably the first step in certification work. A good many things have ipened since that time. k Another thing comes to my mind that happened before I came to this :e. This is the eighth annual meeting of this convention. If I know »ry correctly, there is only one man here tonight who was at that original meeting. I think he was one of two growers at that meeting, which Jake tells me consisted of himself, Link Davis of Gordon, and all the county agents in western Nebraska; and, according to Jake's story, about one-half of the professors of the Agricultural College in Lincoln. They got something started and things went along pretty well. tit has been a great deal of pleasure to me to be associated with the ato work in western Nebraska. It has been an example of what can done by people working together. We have not always worked to- Ker very smoothly, but considerable has been accomplished. I am reminded somewhat when thinking of the future of a story I eard at one of the potato meetings in Spokane. A lumberman was elling about some fellow running a lumber crew. He hired some men who represented themselves as lumberjacks. He asked them if they could fell a tree. They said they were experienced lumber men. He sent lem out to cut some big trees. A good lumberjack can tell where the ree will fall by the way he cuts it. They had nibbled all around the Tee like a beaver or some other rodent, and the manager with strong anguage said, "What are you doing there? Which way do you think hat tree will fall?" One of the fellows looked up at it with a puzzled look, and said: "We are lumberjacks; we are not prophets." (Applause.) THE TO ASTM ASTER: We feel kind of sorry at the close of the evening that everybody has picked on Jake. I know he has told his rab - bit story here about the teacher who ate so much rabbit, and a few things like that; but he is the oldest member present, and even though it is late, we should give him a chance to tell one story. Jake Pedritt. (Applause.) I MR. J. PEDRETT, (Kimball, Nebr.) : Gentlemen: Every one seems take an especial pleasure in picking on me.

It just happened at the table with Mr. Parrish. He was one; I was one, and Mr. Davis, the other grower. We organized and there were eight present: three professors, two county agents, and three farmers. We had a splendid start for an organization. The only mistake we made at that time — it came out all right afterward — was when we made all of them members, even the professors who were with us. I do not want to take any more of your time, but I heard Mr. Mathers talking about optimism. What is a real optimist? A real optimist is a fellow who tries to buy something from a Scotchman and sell it to a Jew at a profit. (Laughter and applause.) THE TOASTMASTER: This closes our program for this evening.

            <seg id="p762">764 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE FRIDAY MORNING SESSION December 5, 1924 The fourth session of the convention convened on Friday morning, and was called to order by President Phelps at 10:30. NEBRASKA POTATO DISEASES (with lantern slides.) Dr. R. W. Goss, Associate Plant Pathologist, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska. tin discussing these diseases I will not attempt to make a report upon experimental work now in progress, but will rather review the more important diseases with which most of you are familiar. In addition we will discuss the chief points which have been worked out in recent years regarding the two groups of diseases of greatest importance to the seed industry, i. e. the Fusarium wilt and stem-end rot, and the degeneration diseases. I have been requested to also mention briefly the methods used in studying these diseases. The following is a brief report of the subjects discussed. Common scab: — Tubers with typical scab spots were shown. The or - ganism lives over winter both on the tuber in the scabby areas and also in the soil. Rhizoctonia: — The tubers show the characteristic black dirt like areas on the surface, varying in size up to hi inch in diameter. The organism lives over winter in this stage and in the spring, these infected tubers re - sult in sprout infection. The young growing tip of the sprout is often Ped, or either the sprout or underground stem of the older plant may entirely girdled. When the stem is girdled the plant will often show a rosette appearance of the tops and tubers may be produced in the axils of the leaves, due to the inability of the foods manufactured in the leaves to be transported to the underground parts because of this girdled area on the stem. Both scab and Rhizoctonia are carried over on the seed. They can therefore, be controlled to a great extent by the usual corrosive subli - mate treatment, 4 oz. to 30 gals, of water for 1% to 2 hours. However, as both diseases are also capable of living in the soil it is necessary to use new uninfected soil or practice long rotations. It is useless to treat seed and plant on infected soil or to use healthy soil and infected seed. Both these diseases are influenced greatly by the soil moisture and temperature and thus the amount of disease present on a piece of land will vary from year to year, or in different locations the same year. Fusarium wilt and stem-end rot. This is the most important disease in certain sections and causes severe losses to both seed and table stock potatoes. It ranks second only to the degeneration diseases in its menace to the seed potato industry. </seg>
            <seg id="p763">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 765 Slides were shown of the different stages of wilt of the plant and the typical stem-end rot and different types of internal discoloration in the tuber: A number of slides were presented showing the microscopic char - acters of the casual organism and the methods used in isolating the or - ganism from infected plants, growing it in pure culture, and proving its power to cause the disease by inoculating either in the soil or the seed tubers. When infection occurs from or thru the seed piece the disease pro - gresses directly up the stem and then out to the new tubers. Wilfingj is not as rapid as with root infection unless the soil is very dry. It was shown that the infection of only two roots of a plant would result in the typical disease. The organism worked up the roots to the stem, and then down the stem to the seed piece causing an internal discoloration, which upon digging could easily be mistaken for seed piece infection, altho the disease really entered the plant thru the roots. With a high soil moisture content the plant will not wilt rapidly even tho the roots are severely attacked. Under these conditions, how - ever, the organism will advance to the new tubers and produce a stem - end rot of the growing tubers, without any great evidence of the disease on the top of the plant. With a low soil moisture the wilt progresses rapidly and few tubers are formed. The disease has been found to be favored by a soil temperature of 68° to 77° F. At low temperatures the disease progresses slowly and few symptoms appear even though some of the roots may be infected. At extremely high temperature (above 80° F) the action of the parasite is also retarded. Fig. 24 </seg>
            <seg id="p764">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 766 In storage the stem-end rot of the tuber is retarded by low tempera - ture (below 50° F.) and by a low relative humidity. Field tests made to determine the effect of the disease on the yield have shown that the disease results in decreased germination, wilt and barrenness of infected plants, decreased yields both total and marketable and a high percentage of stem-end rot tubers. Fusarium dry rot. This is a distinct disease from the wilt and stem - r.d rot although it is caused by a somewhat similar organism. This is solely a storage disease and does not occur in the field. The organism cannot enter a healthy sound tuber but gains entrance thru wounds or acts as a secondary invader of stem-end rot tubers produced by the wilt isease. The disease can be controlled by careful methods of handling nd by low temperatures in storage. The rotted tubers usually show a bite to brick colored moldy growth over the rotted areas as shown in ie slides presented. Frost injury. Slides showing tubers affected by different types of frost injury were presented. Potatoes may be frosted by a temperature of 28° F. for several hours, 23° for 2 hours, or 14&lt;&gt; for 1 hour. The first tissue to show the effects of frosting are the vascular strands at the stem - end, so that mild cases of this type of injury are sometimes confused with the internal discoloration of Fusarium wilt. t Black heart. Typical examples of this disease were shown. It is not sed by an organism but is due entirely to lack of oxygen in storage or isportation. Early blight. The leaves affected with this disease show the charac - teristic concentric rings by which the disease can be distinguished from p burn which is caused by high temperatures. Early blight is caused by an organism which lives over in old potato foliage. It has frequently aused severe losses in western Nebraska by defoliating the plants as much as a month before normal maturity. It can be controlled by a jray of Bordeaux mixture although the disease is not usually severe nough here to warrant spraying. Degeneration Diseases. Spindle-tuber. This is probably the most serious disease affecting seed potatoes in Nebraska. It was discussed at .great length in yester - day's program and we will just mention the symptoms briefly at this time. (Slides were shown of healthy plants and tubers as contrasted with the erect dwarfed plants and small elongated, pale, shallow-eyed tubers affected with spindle-tuber. Leaf roll. Slides were shown of typical leaf roll plants having the brittle, smooth upward rolled leaves and dwarfed appearance. The yield of tubers is greatly reduced. The disease is not very prevalent in west- </seg>
            <seg id="p765">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 767 Mosaic. Plants affected with different types of mosaic, and having the distinctive mottling, wrinkling, and ruffling were shown in colored slides. All three of these degeneration diseases are of the same general na - ture. They are all carried over winter in the seed, altho spindle-tuber is the only one which can be detected in the tubers. They are all transmit - ted in the field by insects, and they can only be controlled by careful seed selection in the field and by continually rogueing out the diseased plants. The symptoms of all three diseases are also greater modified by ex - ternal condition. Air temperature was shown by colored slides to be a factor in masking the symptoms of mosaic and spindle tubers. When a plant is infected with both mild mosaic and spindle tuber the mosaic symptoms appear at a low temperature and if the temperature is then raised these symptoms are masked and the characteristic spindle tubers symptoms appear. With the more serious types of mosaic the symptoms are not so completely masked at high temperatures. The soil temperature has been found to greatly influence the tuber symptoms of spindle-tuber. The symptoms are more evident at high soil temperatures but there is also a lengthening of the tubers and a lack of color, in healthy tubers produced at high temperatures which might be easily confused with spindle tuber. The effects of the environment are so great in masking the disease symptoms that trial plots must be grown under conditions favorable for the development of these diseases if accurate estimates of the amount of disease are to be made. Slides were also shown with the tabulated results of yield tests with these diseases. Mild mosaic seed gave a high yield in Nebraska while a combination of mosaic and spindle tuber resulted in a great decrease in yield. Severe spindle tuber either alone or in combination with one or more types of mosaic was found to cause the greatest reduction in yield. THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Bennett was interrupted yesterday. We want now to hear his report, and whatever time he has left we will give him if he will finish the talk. (Applause.) THE JUDGE'S REPORT E. R. Bennett, Field Horticulturist, University of Idaho, Boise I did not realize yesterday I was going to have another chance at you. There are a few things yet I wanted to say. I do not know that I have much of a report to make on the judging work. Your stuff on the whole is better than I expected. I want to compliment you on your ability to </seg>

You are getting by a lot better with Bliss Tri - umphs than we are in Idaho. I can not make a man stick. He will grow them one or two years and something goes wrong. He quits. We have this year about six men, five hundred miles apart, growing Bliss Tri - umphs; four or five growing Cobblers, and three who grow Early Ohios. none of which are as good as yours. I think that is true. When it comes to the Netted Gem — your Russet Burbank — you would not be in it. We have this year better stuff than you are showing here. Your miscellaneous lot of stuff was miscellaneous both in quality and Iiety, and did not score very high. Your Bliss Triumphs made excep - ially high scores. You may take exception to my scoring in that I e them high on type, and when I found them exceptionally shallow - d at the apex of the potato, which would indicate a tendency toward idle-tuber, I put it down as disease. It is immaterial. We have •ned a pretty Rural is pretty apt to be a mosaic Rural. We are teach - those smooth, beautiful Bliss Triumphs indicate, as you have been I by these men, they are going bad. We find even without those con - ons, that with our Rural in Idaho, the safe thing is not to get too tty potatoes. The best yielding strains are the coarser strains in 58 and the tuber with high eyebrows and deeper eyes. In lots of fields nd low yields, small dwarfed plants, but beautiful potatoes.

            <seg id="p767">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 769 When you build a fancy storage house out of concrete because some cement manufacturer had advertised it, you will find a storage house which is not what you want. Get down to the proposition of building the storage house with dirt floors, sides and roof. We fix it in such a way the earth does not touch the timbers. We put the timbers on concrete piers and wire straw on top. Those are our best storage houses. We are getting more and more in the seed districts and districts where they market the stock. They are building co-opera - tive storage houses and bringing their potatoes and leaving their there. lVe have one 50x285 that will hold one hundred cars of potatoes. They rent the storage and put them in, and have electric lights and an elec - tric sorter and can take care of them in good shape. They can load a car in short time out of there. Those things are a great improvement, because you can do a bet - ter job of sorting if you have an electric sorter with four or five men looking after it. The potatoes are turned over and you can separate them better than with the old shaker sorter. They found last winter some of the boys brought potatoes in December and they were sorted and put in sacks and weighed up and put back in the cellar. This is at an altitude of 5,000 feet. They were paid for on the basis of the weights when sorted. In the spring when sent to the low altitude, they had lost 2Vz per cent. That is a pretty good shrinkage, running from December until April. They could not have done that in a warehouse like this. You would have nearly 10 per cent shrinkage, I think; and the same in a concrete building. Get it where the humidity and temperature are controlled pretty carefully. I do not think they keep the temperature very accurate. They keep it about freezing point. A storage house of that sort will not bother much with freezing. Don't make your storage cellar too deep. Three to three and one - half feet under the level surface is* enough to go down. If you go lower, you get too much moisture. It is a harder pull with your teams and wagons. There is no advantage. In this country you have about fourteen inches of rain. Ashland, Idaho, has nearly twenty inches, and has trouble with leakage. If you are in a district where you have too much snow or rain at one time, the storage house should be covered over with impervious material. I have tried to get somebody to put on a regular dirt roof and cover it over with some of our road oils to make it impervious to water. I do not see why it would not wcrk. That is only' a theory that has not been tried. I will work somebody to do that some day. Discussion. Q. What &lt;lo you recommend u.;in.ir over your raftf-r&gt; to hold ynr.i st taw on ? </seg>
            <seg id="p768">770 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATIC BOARD OF AGRICULTURE A. Hog fence wire is best. If a man hasn't much money and plenty of time, he gets willows and puts over it; then plenty of straw. I A storage house is better built on the level rather than on a bank, hich does not give the ventilation. It should be built lengthwise with le trend of the wind, and you have little trouble with ventilation. Q. How deep should the potatoes be piled? A. I have seen them as deep as this room, but I think six feet should be the limit. If they are perfectly dry like these here, you could put them twelve feet and no trouble with heating. If you have a little frost in them, or if they are a little wet or immature, they will produce heat. The temperature will probably be ten degrees higher two feet under the pile than on the surface. Anything that is alive will produce heat. I never had any faith in this chilling business hurting the potatoes. I think a lot of the potatoes that won't crow is a straight case of heating in the bin. They are probably better piled in sack. If put in right and watched carefully, there should not be any particular trouble at least six feet deep. I noticed a pile at Ashland eight feet deep, and a number wet in places where they were deepest. LQ. Can you regulate that by a double wall on each side- -an nit. ace in between ? L'is </seg>
            <seg id="p769">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 771 A. Some put in a trough and have air in the middle of the bin. I do not know whether there is anything to that. Q. I have 100-pound sacks. I get 125 pounds in all the sacks. A. We have not covered the subject by a long ways. I have not anything that would be of especial interest or benefit to you people here in our experience over there. I surely have enjoyed being with you; and not only that, but I have learned a whole lot. The troubles you have are entirely different from what we have over there. We have not thought anything about spindle tubers in our country. We have become confident that we are on top of the pile. We can grow stuff and be reasonably sure of getting by with it in certain districts. I will tell you one thing that interested me. When I first went into the district, we tried to grow potatoes in the lower courtry, about 2,000 feet elevation; pretty warm; and got fairly good seed. It was not sure. We had some of our stuff higher up on the Snake River valley, up to 6,000 feet, and always got seed. We were not uniformly successful in the lower country. We kept watching it pretty carefully. The Twin Falls district is just across a little ridge in pretty nearly the same altitude as the Burley district. We can grow seed at Burley and certify it. West of Twin Falls it did not get by. On the north side of the River, just a few miles from Twin Falls, in the Jerome district, they have not gotten by any time. They can not grow seed potatoes. East of there, not over 100 feet higher, they grow seed well. We get a line of demarcation crossing the river, with Jerome and Twin Falls on the west, that can't grow seed. They do not try any .nore. Burley and Minidoka on the east grow seed all right. If you will explain that line, you will do better than I can. Above there, those men who know the game are getting along probably 95 per cent of the time with certification. In certifying potatoes, you are certifying men more than potatoes. There are lots of things we could do if we had the men. In your Asso - ciation work, don't be in a hurry to get everybody into it. Get those who can and will do the work. Let the other fellows alone. If you can teach them, all right. If you can't, keep them out. It is a matter «f knowing how. I find people over the state who seem to know about growing potatoes. I talk with them. They are full of bone heads. It takes three to five years to teach even good men how to grow seed. What is your experience here? (Laughter.) They seem to grasp it ill right, but they don't. It is a slow, steady grind of education to get to a point where we can get this to a commercial basis — a basis where you can grow good seed. It is not any picnic. </seg>
            <seg id="p770">772 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I know it takes time. We have about 100 growers who are real growers. Three years ago we had 700. Two years ago we had 140. This year we have 125 — the same old fellows. They are getting by. The new men come in, and I look cross-eyed at them when they start. They usually will fall some time along the line. It takes some time to learn this game. It is a steady grind and a lot of detail. One mis - take spoils the whole thing. They tell us what we must do to be saved, but the next thing is to believe it. In your work, you are certifying men more than potatoes. The essential thing is to get men who know the game to do the work — to be conscientious in the work. I thank you. FRIDAY AFTERNOON SESSION December 5, 1924 The final session of the convention was called to order by President Phelps at three o'clock on Friday afternoon, December 5. LTHE PRESIDENT: There has been a good deal of discussion as what the real purpose of the Nebraska Potato Improvement Associ - ation is. We want it understood all the activities of the Association are for everybody who is interested in potato improvement. While the certification has always been more or less of one variety, we try to get into the Show samples of table stock and all things of interest to make it a Show for northwestern Nebraska. Our business this afternoon will consist of the reports of two com - mittees, unless you have something to bring up. REPORT OF RESOLUTIONS COMMITTEE Presented by Secretary H. O. Werner, Lincoln RESOLVED, that the Nebraska Potato Improvement Asso - ciation extends its thanks to the citizens of Gering for their hospitality in providing suitable facilities for holding the con - vention and Show, and for their general interest in the con vention. RESOLVED, further, that we express our appreciation to </seg>

The Committee wishes to call attention to the marked improvement that has taken place in the quality of the exhibits, and expresses a hope that such improvement will continue, and that the exhibits will be more numerous in future. PETRUS PETERSON JAKE PEDRETT H. O. WERNER It was moved the resolutions be adopted as read The motion prevailed. REPORT OF AUDITING COMMITTEE Presented by Phil Sheldon, Scottsbluff, Nebraska Gering, December 6, 1924 We find that the account and statement of expenditures and receipts as presented by the Secretary-Treasurer of the Nebraska Potato Improvement Association, showing a balance of $231.62, are correct. PHIL SHELDON CLEM V. SVOBODA Upon motion, the report of the Auditing Committee was accepted and placed on file. THE SECRETARY: I wish to call your attention to the fact that the Secretary-Treasurer of this Association was responsible for the finances of the certification fund from December first to May first. At that time an audit was made and accepted by the boards of directors of both the Improvement Association. and the Certification Association, and the certification fund turned over to the Nebraska Certified Potato Growers Cooperative treasury. MR. FRED EHRMAN, (Gering): For some time the question of the advisability of certifying potatoes grown under irrigation has been under discussion. It seems as though experiments show that the potatoes raised under irrigation run out sooner than those grown on dry land. But later experiments seem to prove that by proper selec - tion and proper methods, it might be possible to raise good seed under irrigation. With the aid of the Agricultural College, our County Farm Bureau and Agricultural Agent, we think probably this could be worked out. </seg>
            <seg id="p772">774 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE bThe Scotts Bluff County Farm Bureau was the first to sponsor a ity potato tour, and also one of the first counties to carry on ex - ive test plots in co-operation with Professor H. O. Werner. This data at first pointed out that irrigated seed was not as good as dry land seed on account of running out. The Farm Bureau sup - ported and used this information, which was a great advantage to the locajl growers, since they were able to increase their yields and quality by using good dry-land seed, and especially good certified seed. The Farm Bureau, through the Agricultural Agent, has kept in close touch with the work of Mr. Werner and Mr. Goss on potato f eases, and especially the running out of potatoes under irrigation, is data developed in the last year makes it appear that it would be ssible to control potato diseases and raise good seed under irrigation certain requirements were taken care of by the grower. The Farm Bureau has worked for the best interests of the potato ndustry even when a small percentage of the local growers thought ley were over-stressing dry-land seed. They did this because the ata had been worked out justifying this action, and did not justify any other. Since the data now shows that with proper methods good seed can be grown on irrigated ground, they ask the dry-land growers extend their co-operation in establishing the certification industry in le irrigated territories, as far as experimental and practical data will ustify. They, therefore, present the following resolution: In view of the fact that the College of Agriculture has demonstrated that running out of seed potatoes in the North Platte valley is due almost entirely to spindle-tuber; and fur - thermore, Since the Agricultural College has demonstrated that the disease can be controlled by proper seed selection, roguing and so forth, and that with such care, good seed potatoes can be raised in irrigated territories; Therefore, we respectfully request the Certification Com - mittee of the Agricultural College to give consideration to the advisability of certification of potatoes in irrigated regions. The Scotts Bluff County Farm Bureau will co-operate in this work. SCOTTS BLUFF COUNTY FARM BUREAU, L. R. LEONARD, President. MR. H. I. MILLER, (Bushnell): Wouldn't that necessarily have to be considered before a meeting of the certified growers? THE PRESIDENT: I should suppose any such matter would have to be considered by the College. I question whether this body can take any action. </seg>
            <seg id="p773">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 775 THE SECRETARY: According to my understanding of the agree - ment the Agricultural College has with the Nebraska Certified Potato •Growers Co-operative, the College would specify — it is one of its duties — where and how certified seed can be raised, as well as the disease conditions. As far as this matter is concerned, it is up to the pleasure of the convention whether it cares to discuss it. You can not tak« -definite action which would be final. You can recommend the Com - mittee consider it, but it would be left to the committee of the Agricul - tural College for final action. MR. MILLER: I do not believe the dry-land growers would object seriously, providing the potatoes grown under irrigation would be mark - ■ed on the tag, "Irrigated Potatoes." MR. EHRMAN: I think it would be a good plan if an experiment could be carried on and tested out. If some good grower could be chosen and data kept, and test it out for a couple of years, and then -compare it with the certified dry-land seed, they could find out whether it was advisable to grow irrigated potatoes for seed for southern trade. I make it as a motion to have the experimental tests made The motion was seconded. DR. GOSS: I was wondering who was going to run the tests? Are you proposing the Association makes these tests and experiments, or requesting the College shall make them? THE SECRETARY: We have experiments under way along this line. Some have been running two or three years, and more work is being planned; so that phase is being taken care of as well as can be. We have some data on these show tables, discussed yesterday. It would be a repetition for me to go into that matter now. The irrigation growers would probably not find it as extremely profitable as they think. It would be necessary to keep down the size of the potatoes. In order to do that, you would have to give a little less water, probably. Excessive irrigation might be injurious. A small amount of irrigation does not hurt potatoes for seed purposes if spindle-tuber is not present. You can not sell big potatoes, and they must be in reasonably good condition. If badly scuffed up, the seed market does not want them. I showed yesterday, it seems to me, beyond question that both spindle-tuber and some other diseases are transmitted, and more transmission takes place on irrigated than on dry land. In considering that fact, the College Committee found it necessary to make some special rulings which might seem to be a little more stringent on the irrigated growers — not with the idea of penalizing them, but in order to protect the certified seed standards. Some things which would probably need to be done to accomplish the ends would be the planting of large seed pieces so far apart that rogu- </seg>
            <seg id="p774">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 776 ing could be done. If yon have the plants so close you could not do a thorough job of roguing, the seed could not be certified, as at present. The way to accomplish it would be to use very large seed pieces and get more potatoes, and consequently, smaller ones. I shall not endeavor to predict what the returns would be, but a guess on rather careful estimates would be than an irrigated grower Cld need to sacrifice what would be worth almost as much as the tional margin which certification would bring him. There are some lands wherein that might not apply — sandy lands at the edge of the project where it is not profitable to haul a long distance. I present these ideas to you for your consideration at this time. I feel free to say, with the evidence I gave you yesterday as a basis that by far the major cause, and perhaps the sole cause, of the de - terioration of irrigated seed is spindle-tuber. There may be consider - able prejudice on the part of some agents to buy irrigated seed because they have gotten poor seed, in irrigated regions and think the cause is tto the application of water. It will take quite a while to overcome t prejudice. MR. EHRMAN: Probably my system of irrigation is a little dif - ferent from some of the rest. I only irrigate my potatoes in a normal year, twice. I irrigate every other row the first time, and ten days later irrigate the alternating rows. By this time the vines are so ■heavy they just cover the whole row. You can not see through the field. I usually have a large yield. I realize they can be over-irri - gated to make good seed. Just a limited amount of irrigation it looks to me has been efficient. DR. GOSS: In regard to the motion before the meeting at the present time, I can not see it would do a great deal of good, because the experiments are being conducted. This matter has been considered brief - ly by the Committee. At the time the standards were set for this year's certification crop, the matter was threshed over and it was decided those experiments and tests between dry-land certified seed and irrigated stock should be carried on further, and further tests started, not only in this section, but other sections of Nebraska. The motion will not do any harm, but I can not see it will do any good. All we can do is to carry out our plans at the present time. MR. SHELDON: The resolution which was read is signed by the President of the Farm Bureau Board. I think possibly we have taken some chances in our dry land seed work. Maybe everybody was not con - vinced for different reasons. They did not believe it would hurt the dry land farmer to certify some in here and improve the quality. The irri - gated growers might want to start on a very small scale. Mr. Ehrman has some potatoes that have been good for several years. They presented the matter at this time to get an opinion, and would like to see a little ■tart made if the experiments would justify it. - • </seg>
            <seg id="p775">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 777 THE PRESIDENT: In giving consideration to this, it appeared to me as a matter of procedure in business, he should properly take it up direct with the people at Lincoln. So many details would have to be worked out, you might make a mistake in taking it up at this time. I presume your desire was to ask if the body would go on record behind the resolution, which would be an endorsement of your action in going to the College. If that is the proper interpretation of what you want, I wonder if that motion might be withdrawn, and if you want to ask action on the resolution to get it properly before the house. If not, the other motion is still in order. THE SECRETARY: I should like to add one feature to be con - sidered in this connection. It is this: At the present time some varie - ties are being grown in the irrigated section, the seed of which can not practically be grown on dry land in western Nebraska. I refer more es - pecially to the Russet Rural New Yorkers, which are popular in the upper part of the valley. The only source of certified guaranteed seed at the present time is Wisconsin or northern Michigan. It would be quite possible the certified seed industry might find some other region where that variety is used in which it could be satisfactorily produced. That also applies to a few other varieties which can not be grown on dry land. Mr. Ehrman's motion carried. Selection of Place for Holding 1925 Convention MR. C. A. BUEHLER, (Gering) : The folks of Gering were so well pleased with the Show here in their city, the Commercial Club requested me to invite you back again next year. They extend a hearty invitation to hold your next year's convention in Gering. THE PRESIDENT: We appreciate that spirit. In the past it has always been rather the feeling of the people, in order that the greatest number of persons might eventually see the exhibits, that we should move from one district to another. That is why this has been done. MR. SHELDON: The Chamber of Commerce of Scottsbluff asked rne to present their wishes to entertain the Potato Improvement Associa - tion convention at any time, either next year or as soon as they see fit to come to Scottsbluff. MR. WILSON: On behalf of the Lion's Club at Kimball, we would like to extend a cordial invitation to meet down there next year. We can show you the spuds and a good time. MR. FRED L.

            <seg id="p782">784 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, H. C. WITTMAN, LINCOLN, NEBR. Mr. President and Members of the Nebraska State Poultry Asso - ciation: Herewith I submit to you my annual report. The year of 1924 has been a trying one in the various lines of busi - ness including our farmers and stock breeders, especially the first six months. Sales of hatching eggs and breeding stock was far below the usual, mainly on account of the money stringency and the general in - redness of our farmers. Many a time from various sources I heard remark: "I don't know what we would do if it were not for our poultry flock; we are practically living on our income from market eggs." This remark or similar ones were not only made by the women but came from the men, who previously considered the poultry industry as a small sideline for the farmer's wife only. This fact has been the cause of numerous farmers getting the poultry fever and this will do our industry more good than anything else. There is no reason why our state should not be one of the leading poultry producing states for our climate is good and feed is cheap and our winters are not too severe. There is nothing on our farms that will pay as much as a well tended, well-culled flock of standard bred poultry. The year of 1925 will be long remembered as The Embargo Year. Late in the year of 1924 and the early part of 1925 a drastic embargo was laid against the shipment of live poultry from most western and central states to eastern markets and even from one state to another. Breeders were checked and troubled in selling their good birds to out of state buyers and Poultry Exhibitions were curtailed and limited to exhibitors of their own state. It was a serious situation and damaged the farmers, the breeders, the exhibitors and the poultry and commis - sion men to a very marked degree. Our 1925 exhibit at Lincoln was hard hit, many entries were cancelled and many that had entered were barred from shipping. It seems from all reports that the embargo is overdone and that no need exists for as stringent a measure as has been put into effect. I herewith quote to you a few extracts from the De - cember 12, 1924 Nebraska State Journal: PLACE EMBARGO ON WESTERN CHICKENS Board of Health, New York, Stops Shipments of Live Fowls From Several States, Nebraska Included. New York, Dec. 11. — The board of health today placed an embargo against the shipment of live chickens to New York city from North Dakota, South Dakota, Missouri, Kansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa and Nebraska. The embargo was ordered after it was found that a myster - ious disease had affected chickens here in the past few weeks. The </seg>
            <seg id="p783">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 785 embargo does not affect the shipment of other kinds of poultry. The board said it was "satisfied that a disease of a pestilential nature now exists" among the chickens in the states named. The embargo, which becomes effective tomorrow, is for an indefinite period. Local officials of the state department of farms and markets said today that an order was expected from the state commissioner in Albany, tomorrow, placing an embargo against all poultry from New York city to other points in this state, as well as barring shipments of live chickens into the state from states where the mysterious disease is known to be prevaent. EMBARGO IS MYSTERIOUS Not Warranted in Nebraska, Investigators Say — Dr. Van Es, Agricul - tural College Pathologist, Finds No Evidence of Unusual Diseases Among Fowls. An embargo on Nebraska chickens, placed by the New York city board of health is unwarranted and the embargo is more mysterious than the so-called mysterious disease, was the opinion expressed here tonight by Dr. Van Es, head of the deparment of pathology of the state agricultural college. "There is a nigger in the woodpile some place," Dr. Van Es said, as far as the embargo applies to Nebraska. The whole territory covered by the embargo is a big one and Dr. Van Es said he was not speaking for the other states. No evidence of a disease of a "pestilential nature" has been found among chickens in this state Dr. Van Es said and this includes the ex - amining of chickens for the last forty days from over the state. No disease other than those common to chickens this time of year has been found in Nebraska and conditions are about the same as they were in 1922 and 1923, he said. These examinations made by Dr. Van Es have been laboratory examinations made at the agricultural college. An immediate notice to cut prices from 17 to 10 cents a pound received from the east at certain Nebraska points Friday has caused poultrymen and some of the investigators at the College of Agriculture to question the good faith of the embargo, especially as applying to this state. Men from the college of agriculture have been making an in - vestigation and found no evidence of a disease that would warrant the placing of an embargo. Farmers Alarmed. They found however that farmers in some places are rushing their chickens to market at 10 cents and 7 cents below the price that has been offered heretofore. It will mean thousands of dollars loss to the farmers if they sacrifice or their chickens and Dr. Van Es said that </seg>
            <seg id="p784">786 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE there is no reason for the farmers to rush to market on account of such embargo. This is also the Christmas season when farmers begin un - loading their chickens and one poultryman expressed the belief that the embargo and consequent lowering of price seemed to be timely. Poultrymen do not see any occasion for the big scare. A number of investigators who went to Syracuse and Nebraska City Friday found no evidence of conditions that would warrant an embargo. The only thing that has been found is the usual conditions that exist among Ne - braska chickens and the fact that on account of the greatly increased number of chickens raised, many farmers are not able to care for them so well as usual. This has led to overcrowding and under nourishment. It is not a disease at all, as far as those who have made investigation can learn, and the only evidence of disease is where the crowded condi - tions have led to sweating and such ailments as come from cold while in this condition. Some of the poultry raisers dismiss the embargo as "bosh." They say that there is no reason for it. Efforts to trace down the inception of the embargo has failed to bring any light to the agricultural depart - ment thus far. One reason for the embargo that had been in circula - tion was that government inspectors had ordered it and when the authorities began an investigation they found there were no govern - ment inspectors on the job to order it. One of Lincoln's largest poultry dealers said Friday night that he is refusing to buy chickens until the embargo is lifted in the east. His place has as many chickens on hand as can be taken care of until some can be moved. Semi- Annual Meeting Our semi-annual and annual meetings were held as per schedule daring the past year. The semi-annual meeting of the stockholders was held at The State Fair Grounds Tuesday afternoon Sept. 2nd 1924. There being nothing of great importance to transact with the exception of the locating of the next State Show, it was moved and seconded to tarn this matter over to the Board of Directors for action when they meet this evening. This motion was carried and adjournment taken. Semi-Annual Meeting of the Board of Directors was called to order by Pres. Tharp at 7 P. M. Sept. 2, 1924. Roll call showed all members present, and the various officers read their reports which were accepted as read. Then the two offers for the location of our next state show were taken up. Hastings made a very fair but rather indefinite offer and Lincoln made a positive clean cut invitation and offered the City Auditorium free of charge with light, heat and water. After short discussion the Lincoln offer was accepted and the next State Show was slated to be held at Lincoln during the week of organized Agriculture January 5th to 9th, 1925. Several progressive steps were taken and a </seg>
            <seg id="p785">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 787 motion was made and carried that The Nebraska State Poultry Associa - tion invite all the smaller district shows and county fairs to join its membership roll and in reciprocation the State Association will grant free entrance to all 1st prize winners at the smaller affiliated shows to the following Nebraska State Show. The Secretary was instructed to get into communication with the various District Shows and this was done with very satisfactory results. Most all smaller shows are now members of the State Association and sending their 1st prize winners to the following State Show, free of entrance fee which makes the Ne - braska State Show The Main Exhibit of Poultry in Nebraska where all 1st prize winners meet. 40th Annual Exhibition The 40th annual exhibition was held at the City Auditorium in Lincoln and as stated before was cut short of the usual number of entries on account of the embargo of shipments of poultry. Many who were not prevented from shipping by said embargo, seemingly were afraid to ship fearing disease might creep into their flocks. So we had to be content with a smaller show but nevertheless we had real quality on tap. Our show was again well attended by the many visi - tors in Lincoln during the week of Organized Agriculture and many sales were consummated to stock breeders from various parts of the state. The heaviest entries in our Show were the various heavy breeds or dual purpose fowls such as the Rhode Island Reds, Plymouth Rocks, Wyandotts and Orpingtons. The lighter or egg producing breeds as Leghorns and Anconas were in the minority although the quality was high and the competition was sharp. Also the Egg Show was again on the map, stronger than ever. Two local institutions have offered some fine silver trophies for the best display of eggs, one for brown eggs and the other for white eggs and the competition is getting keener each year. No entry fee is charged for the egg show but all eggs are retained by the Association and given to the State Agricultural College to be sold at the end of the show, the proceeds to be used in helping to defray the expenses of the university poultry judging team in its trip to the Chicago Show. The entire egg show is given over to the State Agricultural College which takes charge of this department and demon - strates many different helps in poultry problems, such as feeding, hous - ing, delousing and control and prevention of poultry diseases. Their display is very interesting and instructive, especially to the beginners in poultry work of which we have so many each year. 40th Annual Business Meeting The 40th Annual business meeting of The Nebraska State Poultry Association was held at the Lindell Hotel Parlors Thursday evening, January 8th, 1925 at 8:30 P. M. The hour of meeting was a trifle later than usual, due to the fact that the Poultry Breeders joined the other members of Organized Agriculture in a banquet at the Hotel Lincoln </seg>

Pres. Tharp called the meeting to order and the roll call showed 35 members present. The usual routine was followed. Unfinished business was cleaned up, of - ficers reports were presented and approved and committee reports were heard.

Seconded by Mr. Ford — carried. UNFINISHED BUSINESS CHAIRMAN: Anything under the head of unfinished business? SECRETARY: Have nothing reported on. SPECIAL AND OTHER COMMITTEES CHAIRMAN: Are there any Special or other Committees to re- port? Secretary Wittman reported on his trip North as follows: Gentlemen: It was my first trip to the American Poultry Asso- ciation Convention. I was rather disappointed — disappointed in one way, as I did not see the progress I expected at the convention. It was more of an annual fair than I had expected. We arrived at Toronto, Ontario, Tuesday, August 15th. After various. addresses by the Mayor, "His Worship," as they call him there, and by Mr. John M. Martin and responses by our officers, we had several very interesting talks on the various phases of the poultry industry. </seg>
            <seg id="p789">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 791 Sessions of the next day followed along the same line. We were taken to the Parliament Building and held a Mock Court Trial. In the afternoon we heard a lecture by our well known Fancier, Mr. E. B. Thompson, whose speech has been printed in all well known poultry journals. His main theory was that the fancier comes first and the productionist next. I do not quite agree with Mr. Thompson. I like the production side a little more than Mr. Thompson does. However, that is a matter of opinion. We had several more speeches — one by a Government man who gave reports on pedigree at the Canadian Government Experiment Station. Next day we had various meetings and took up the subject about the Poultry Council. Discussed the matter and appointed several com - mittees. Ours to meet with the Poultry Council and see if it were pos - sible for the two bodies to work in unison for the benefit of the poultry industry. Another committee to meet with the Baby Chick Association to urge the necessity of using pure bred birds of higher quality for sup - plying pure bred chicks to the public. The following day we were taken over to Port Dover to see Mr. Martin's estate and poultry breeding plant. Then we returned to To - ronto to finish up our business, elect our officers and disband. CHAIRMAN: You have heard the report of our Secretary. No need of taking any action on that report as he has given us a very detailed report and we have gotten value received for our money. We had Nebraska represented anyway. Mr. Riggs said he was glad Ne - braska sent a representative willing to co-operate with the American Poultry Association. CORRESPONDENCE CHAIRMAN: Have we any communications on important matters? SECRETARY: Nothing of importance. NEW BUSINESS CHAIRMAN: Have we any new business? MR. KNUDSEN: Mr. Chairman, we are planning on a carload or a trainload of Nebraska Poultrymen to go to the A. P. A. Convention at Des Moines next August. I would like to have 8 fine representation and we will have a good number to go from Omaha. It will be a fine thing. If we want anything we will have to go after it. I do think </seg>
            <seg id="p790">792 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tween now and August we can do something that will do the Ne - ska Poultry Association some good. Would like to hear something that subject. CHAIRMAN: Any other remarks? If not, we would like to hear who would like to go. SECRETARY WITTMAN: I will stop at Des Moines for the A. P. A. Convention on my way back from Canada next August and I know Nebraska will have a fine representation as numerous parties have signified their intention of going. CHAIRMAN: Is there anything else? Mr. SMILLEY: I move you that it be the sense of this Association that the Poultry Department of the Nebraska State Farm cease selling breeding stock, eggs and chicks in competition with the Poultry Breeders of this state whose taxes are used to support this department. They are building up the department by selling the breeders in our state, at the expense of the breeders themselves. Many will not buy because they are not trap-nested. We cannot afford it — it hurts my business. I cannot see why any department of the Agricultural School should compete with breeders. It is absolutely wrong for anything like that to happen. Infringement on hardware stores, Standard Oil stations or like business would not be tolerated. It is time for us to call a halt and get behind this organization and help them along. seconds the motion. MR. COTTLE: I have seen birds from the State Farm that were anything else but good. I put up the argument that they have better pens than amateurs. People can get birds from the State Farm for Et half the money they would have to pay elsewhere. I agree with Smiley that we cannot compete with them when the State furnishes jrthing. MR. SMILEY: We cannot fight the University or this department, but there is no reason why there should be any competition between them and the poultry breeders of the state. Kansas and Michigan are having trouble. It is the principle of the thing, and the unfairness to Es breeders and this Association to be compelled to compete with this partment of the Agricultural College when we are taxed for its up - ;p and management. MR. HUDSON: I heartily agree with Mr. Smiley and Mr. Cottle. I have seen some good and some bad breeders that came from the State Farm and they have done a lot of harm. It is not right to place our State Farm Station in the commercial class. It should be handled on the same basis as the Federal. No private individual can buy a bird from the Federal Department. The birds are killed and sold. I am fully back of the State Department, but am not in favor of their commercial- </seg>
            <seg id="p791">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 793 izing the department and it is time for us to get up in arms and take action and see what can be done. MR. FLIPPEN: I am in line with the motion and believe it is a very expedient movement and it is about the right time to take some concerted action. We cannot employ and pay from $25 to $50 or $75 a month for help during the busy spring breeding months and compete with the State Farm where we are paying taxes for its upkeep and benefit. It is impossible to go and buy that class of breeding birds and sell the product at State Farm prices. I was out and visited the Poul - try Department today and saw eleven coops marked for Aurora. I talked with the caretaker. He did not know what they charged for them. Had some fine cockerels there. Some of us will pay as high as $100 for breeders and trap-nest them, but we cannot do this and supply cockerels from there at five or four or three dollars. We cannot raise a bird for that price. It takes one dollar and fifty cents to bring a bird up to laying age — seven and eight months to develop. We cannot keep that bird four or five more months and then sell it at State Farm prices. We are not only paying high prices for breeding fowls, feeds, etc., but also paying taxes and upkeep for the caretakers, and expenses for the State Farm Department. Another thing about that, there's na use talking when a man puts a lot of money into high class birds and hires extra help during the busy time of March, April and May, with additional work of trap-nesting, etc., and they are willing to furnish, such birds for less than we can raise them for. MR. SMILEY: I did not wish to bore this meeting. It was just the principle of the thing more than anything else. MR. KNUDSEN: True, selling birds under figures the breeders can produce them for is all wrong. I am associated with the Standard Oil Company and they would not be in business commercially on that sort of basis, nor can we. I happen to know the Chairman of the Board of Regents, Mr. Judson, and I know he is not in favor of this method. MR. HUDSON: This should be taken up right now. We are going to get this thing back down to earth again and now is the time to put it through. MRS. ANDERSON: I fully agree with the wishes of the Associa - tion in this matter but I do not agree on several things. The State Farm birds are not always kept separate as regards to the breeds. We had our pore bred flock of White Leghorns spoiled and had to start over again, entirely new MR. SMILEY: I move that it be the sense of the Association that the proper action be taken by the members to have the Nebraska State Farm cease selling breeding stock, baby chinks and eggs in competition with the Poultry Breeders of this State whose taxes are used to support this department in the State of Nebraska. Seconded by Mr. Vanderhill. </seg>

MUGGLESTONE: Mr. President, I would like to have that By-Law read, Section 8 — you gave it to me last night. SECRETARY: Do you have a bid for this show? I think the reason for putting it off is to give other towns a chance to make a bid. We had to coax to get in here. Hastings was to get the Show but did not, and I put in the bid for Lincoln. MR. E.
